AB  - Background and Aim: The aim of this study was to study the effect of Gamma Knife (GK) on meningiomas based on the World Health Organization's (WHO) grading system in terms of tumor control and final clinical outcome.
   Methodology: This retrospective study included clinicoradiological and GK characteristics of patients who had undergone GK for meningiomas at our institute from April 1997 until December 2009.
   Results: Of 440 patients, 235 underwent secondary GK for residual/recurrent lesion and 205 received primary GK. Of the 137 patients whose biopsy slide could be reviewed, 111 patients had grade I, 16 had grade II, and 10 had grade III meningiomas. Good tumor control rates were seen in 96.3% of grade I meningioma patients, 62.5% of 16 grade II, and 10% of grade III meningioma patients at median follow-up of 40 months. Age, sex, Simpson's grade of excision, and increasing peripheral dose of GK did not affect the response to radiosurgery (P > 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that high-grade tumor and radiotherapy prior to GK were important negative predictors for progression of tumor size after GK radiosurgery (GKRS) (P < 0.05). In patients with WHO grade I meningioma, radiation therapy prior to GKRS and repeat surgery were predictors for poorer outcome.
   Conclusion: In WHO grades II and III meningiomas, no factors affected tumor control except the histology itself.

AB  - Aiming to expand the application of the SST2R-antagonist LM4 (DPhe-c[DCys-4Pal-DAph(Cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys]-DTyr-NH2) beyond [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 PET/CT (DATA(5m), (6-pentanoic acid)-6-(amino)methy-1,4-diazepinetriacetate), we now introduce AAZTA(5)-LM4 (AAZTA(5), 1,4-bis(carboxymethyl)-6-[bis(carboxymethyl)]amino-6-[pentanoic-acid]perhydro-1,4-diazepine), allowing for the convenient coordination of trivalent radiometals of clinical interest, such as In-111 (for SPECT/CT) or Lu-177 (for radionuclide therapy). After labeling, the preclinical profiles of [In-111]In-AAZTA(5)-LM4 and [Lu-177]Lu-AAZTA(5)-LM4 were compared in HEK293-SST2R cells and double HEK293-SST2R/wtHEK293 tumor-bearing mice using [In-111]In-DOTA-LM3 and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-LM3 as references. The biodistribution of [Lu-177]Lu-AAZTA(5)-LM4 was additionally studied for the first time in a NET patient. Both [In-111]In-AAZTA(5)-LM4 and [Lu-177]Lu-AAZTA(5)-LM4 displayed high and selective targeting of the HEK293-SST2R tumors in mice and fast background clearance via the kidneys and the urinary system. This pattern was reproduced for [Lu-177]Lu-AAZTA(5)-LM4 in the patient according to SPECT/CT results in a monitoring time span of 4-72 h pi. In view of the above, we may conclude that [Lu-177]Lu-AAZTA(5)-LM4 shows promise as a therapeutic radiopharmaceutical candidate for SST2R-expressing human NETs, based on previous [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 PET/CT, but further studies are needed to fully assess its clinical value. Furthermore, [In-111]In-AAZTA(5)-LM4 SPECT/CT may represent a legitimate alternative diagnostic option in cases where PET/CT is not available.

AB  - Background: Various therapies ranging from plaque brachytherapy to enucleation have been applied in uveal melanomas (UM). A gamma knife (GK) is the gold standard modality for head and neck radiation therapy with enhanced precision owing to the paucity of moving parts. The literature on GK usage in UM is rich with the methodology and nuances of GK applications undergoing constant change.
   Objectives: This article reports on the authors' experience in using GK for tackling UM followed by a thematic review of the evolution of GK therapy for UM.
   Materials and Methods: Clinical and radiological data of patients with UM treated with GK at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from March 2019 to August 2020 was analyzed. A systematic search for comparative studies and case series evaluating GK usage in UM was performed.
   Results: Seven UM patients underwent GK, with the median dose being 28 Gy at 50%. All patients underwent clinical follow-up and 3 patients had a radiological follow-up. Six (85.7%) eyes were preserved at follow-up, and 1 (14.28%) patient developed radiation-induced cataract. There was a reduction in tumor volume in all patients with radiological follow-up with the minimum being a 33.06% reduction in size compared to the presenting volume and the maximum being the complete disappearance of tumor at follow-up. A total of 36 articles presenting various facets of GK usage in UM have been thematically reviewed.
   Conclusion: GK can be a viable and effective eye-preserving option for UM with catastrophic side effects becoming rare owing to progressive reduction in radiation dose.

AB  - Gastric surface mucosal cells are responsible for the uptake and secretion of (TcO4)-Tc-99m, a feature that has been used in imaging heterotopic gastric mucosa. We used the same principle to look for gastric mucosal viability in this case of pure esophageal atresia admitted for cervical stomal closure after a previous isoperistaltic gastric tube (IGT) replacement procedure. (TcO4)-Tc-99m scintigraphy was done after encountering a failure to maneuver the esophagoscope through the IGT. The study was helpful in assessing the loss of gastric mucosal viability in an intervening segment of the IGT.

AB  - Background: The standard therapy for glioblastoma (GBM) has been external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with concomitant temozolomide (TMZ) given for six cycles, after maximum possible surgical resection although recurrences after chemoradiation are mostly in-field.
   Objective: To compare the effects of early GKT (without EBRT) along with TMZ to those receiving standard chemoradiotherapy (EBRT + TMZ) after surgery.
   Methods: This was a retro-prospective study on histologically proven GBMs operated at our center between January 2016 and November 2018. The EBRT group consisted of 24 patients who received EBRT + TMZ for six cycles. The GKT arm consisted of 13 consecutive patients who received Gamma Knife within 4 weeks of surgery along with lifelong temozolomide. Patients were followed up every 3 months with CEMRI brain and PET-CT. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) with progression-free survival (PFS) being the secondary endpoint.
   Results: At a mean follow-up of 13.7 months, the median overall survivals in GKT and EBRT groups were 11.07 and 13.03 months, respectively (HR = 0.59; P value = 0.19; 95% CI: 0.27-1.29). The median PFS for GKT group was 7.03 months (95% CI: 4.17-17.3) as compared to 11.07 months (95% CI: 5.33-14.03) for the EBRT group. There was no statistical difference in the PFS or OS between the GKT and EBRT groups.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that Gamma Knife therapy (without EBRT) to residual tumor/tumor bed after primary surgery with concurrent temozolomide has similar progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates when compared to conventional treatment (EBRT).

AB  - This expert group consensus statement emphasises the need for standardising the definition of progressive fibrosing interstitial lung diseases (F-ILDs), with an accurate initial diagnosis being of paramount importance in ensuring appropriate initial management. Equally, case-by-case decisions on monitoring and management are essential, given the varying presentations of F-ILDs and the varying rates of progression. The value of diagnostic tests in risk stratification at presentation and, separately, the importance of a logical monitoring strategy, tailored to manage the risk of progression, are also stressed. The term "progressive pulmonary fibrosis" (PPF) exactly describes the entity that clinicians often face in practice. The importance of using antifibrotic therapy early in PPF (once initial management has failed to prevent progression) is increasingly supported by evidence. Artificial intelligence software for high-resolution computed tomography analysis, although an exciting tool for the future, awaits validation. Guidance is provided on pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen and the use of non-invasive ventilation focused specifically on the needs of ILD patients with progressive disease. PPF should be differentiated from acute deterioration due to drug-induced lung toxicity or other forms of acute exacerbations. Referral criteria for a lung transplant are discussed and applied to patient needs in severe diseases where transplantation is not realistic, either due to access limitations or transplantation contraindications. In conclusion, expert group consensus guidance is provided on the diagnosis, treatment and monitoring of F-ILDs with specific focus on the recognition of PPF and the management of pulmonary fibrosis progressing despite initial management.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and its correlates among apparently healthy children and adolescents.MethodsWe carried out a secondary analysis of data of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18 to analyze the pre-valence and predictors of VDD among Indian children and adolescents.ResultsThe over-all prevalence of VDD in preschool children (1-4 years), school age (5-9 years) children, and adolescents (10-19 years) was 13.7%, 18.2%, and 23.9%, respectively. Age, living in urban area, and winter season were significantly associated with VDD. Vegetarian diet and high-income households were the main risk factors observed in 5-19 years age category. Female sex and less than three hour of physical activity/week were independent risk factors among adolescents.ConclusionThe prevalence and determinants of VDD across different age-groups are reported, and these should be interpreted and addressed to decrease the burden of VDD in India.

AB  - Background: In spite of advancements in treatment options for MCA infarct, there is a definite role of decompressive hemicraniectomy. When compared with best medical management, it decreases mortality and improves functional outcome. But does surgery improve quality of life in terms of independence, cognition or it merely leads to increased survival?
   Objective: Outcome of 43 consecutive patients of MMCAI who underwent DHC was studied.
   Materials and Methods: Functional outcome was evaluated based on mRS and GOS in addition to survival advantage. The patient's proficiency in performing ADL was evaluated. MMSE and MOCA were performed to evaluate the neuropsychological outcome.
   Results: In-hospital mortality was 18.6%, and by 3 months, 67.5% of patients survived. During follow-up, nearly 60% of patients showed improvement in functional outcome when evaluated based on mRS and GOS. No patient could reach to the level of independent existence. Only eight patients could perform MMSE and five had good score (>24). All were young and had a right-sided lesion. None of the patients could perform well in MOCA.
   Conclusion: DHC improves survival and functional outcome. Cognition remains poor in the majority of the patients. These patients, though survive the stroke, remain dependent on care givers.

AB  - Purpose:The purpose of this study was to compare the outcomes of pre-Descemet endothelial keratoplasty (PDEK) and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in cases of endothelial decompensation.Methods:This was a prospective, randomized, interventional study conducted at a tertiary eye hospital in North India. Thirty eyes of 28 patients with corneal decompensation were randomly subjected to PDEK (n = 15 eyes) and DMEK (n = 15 eyes). Preoperative demographic details, surgical indications, uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, anterior and posterior segment details, intraocular pressure, central corneal thickness, endothelial cell count, and corneal aberrometry tracing on wavefront analysis were recorded. Patients were followed up for 6 months postsurgery. Visual and graft survival outcomes were assessed.Results:Intraoperatively, a surgeon reported better ease of preparation and intracameral handling with PDEK grafts. Both groups showed comparable improvement in visual acuity, contrast, and high-order aberrations. A decrease in central corneal thickness was significantly higher in DMEK (196 +/- 26 vs. 140 +/- 14 mu m) patients. DMEK grafts were significantly thinner than PDEK grafts at the 6-month follow-up (16 +/- 2.17 vs. 27.2 +/- 1.93 mu m). Endothelial cell loss (35% in DMEK vs. 33.4% in PDEK, P = 0.48) and rise of intraocular pressure (from 15.33 +/- 2.85 mm Hg to 15.53 +/- 2.2 mm Hg in the DMEK group vs. from 14.6 +/- 1.99 mm Hg to 16.2 +/- 1.43 mm Hg in the PDEK group) were comparable. Rebubbling rates were higher in the DMEK group (3/15, 20%) compared with the PDEK group (1/15, 6.66%; P = 0.165).Conclusions:DMEK and PDEK were comparable for both quantitative and qualitative visual outcomes and anatomically for graft survival at the 6-month follow-up.

AB  - Background: Role of radiosurgical lesioning in functional disorders has been restricted because of development of deep brain stimulation (DBS) techniques. However, many elderly patients with comorbidities and coagulation abnormalities may not be eligible for DBS. Radiosurgical lesioning may be a good alternative in such cases. The objective of the study was to review the role of radiosurgical lesioning for functional targets in common functional disorders.
   Materials and Methods: Literature reports pertaining to common disorders were reviewed. Disorders included are tremors (essential tremors, tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease [PD], multiple sclerosis [MS] related refractory tremors), Parkinson's disease (for rigidity, bradykinesia, drug-induced dyskinesias), dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
   Results: The most commonly performed procedure was ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) lesioning for essential tremors and tremor-dominant PD, with about 90% patients demonstrating improvement. Intractable OCD with 60% responders is a promising indication. Other disorders are less commonly treated, with dystonia being the least commonly treated entity. Subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus interna/posteroventral pallidum (GPi) lesioning are very rarely reported, and the available literature suggests caution due to high rates of adverse effects.
   Conclusions: Outcomes for radiosurgical lesioning for essential tremors (VIM) and OCD (anterior limb of internal capsule [ALIC]) are encouraging. Radiosurgical lesioning offers a lower immediate risk profile in patient population with several comorbidities; however, long-term adverse effects due to radiation are a concern, especially for STN and GPi lesioning.

AB  - Background and Objective: Surgery remains the primary option in large intracranial tumors, but significant number of patients may not be amenable for surgery. We explored the role of stereotactic radiosurgery as an alternative to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in such patients. Our study objective was to assess the clinicoradiological outcomes of large intracranial tumors (volume >= 20 cm(3)) managed with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). Materials and Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study conducted from January 2012 to December 2019. Patients with intracranial tumor volume >= 20 cm(3) who received GKRS and had a minimum of 12 months of follow-up were included. Clinical, radiological, and radiosurgical details and clinicoradiological outcomes of the patients were obtained and analyzed. Results: Seventy patients who had a pre-GKRS tumor volume >= 20 cm(3) with >12 months of follow-up were included. The mean age of the patients was 41.9 +/- 13.6 (range 11-75) years. Majority (97.1%) received GKRS in a single fraction. Mean pretreatment target volume was 31.9 +/- 15.1 cm(3). At a mean follow-up of 34.2 +/- 17.1 months, tumor control was achieved in 91.4% (n = 64) of the patients. Adverse radiation effects were observed in 11 (15.7%) patients, but were symptomatic in only one (1.4%) patient. Conclusion: The present series defines "large intracranial lesions" for GKRS and demonstrates excellent radiological and clinical outcomes in these patients. GKRS may be considered as the primary option in such large intracranial lesions in which surgery carries significant risk based on patient-related factors.

AB  - Existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) are primarily responsible for chemoresistance, cancer reoccurrence and treatment failure in cancer patients. Eliminating CSCs along with bulk tumor is a necessity to achieve complete cancer inhibition. Salinomycin (SAL) has potential to specifically target and kill CSCs through blocking their multiple pathways simultaneously. SAL has also been reported to improve anti-cancer efficacy of numerous chemo-based drugs when used in combination therapy. However, clinical use of SAL is restricted due to its high off targeted toxicity. Herein, we have developed a PLA based hybrid block copolymer for concomitant delivery of SAL and doxorubicin (DOX) with an aim to reduce their adverse side effects and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the treatment. Designed PLA based nanoplatform showed high encapsulation and sustained release profile for both the drugs. Cytotoxicity evaluation on cancer cell lines confirmed the synergistic effect of SAL:DOX co-loaded NPs. Additionally, prepared SAL NPs were also found to be highly effective against chemo-resistant cancer cells and CSCs derived from cancer patient. Most importantly, encapsulation of SAL in PLA NPs improved its phar-macokinetics and biodistribution profile. Consequently, undesired toxicity with SAL NPs was significantly reduced which in-turn increased the dose tolerability in mice as compared to free SAL. Treatment of EAC tumor bearing mice with SAL:DOX co-loaded NPs resulted in excellent tumor regression and complete inhibition of cancer reoccurrence. These results conclude that concomitant delivery of SAL and DOX using PLA based block copolymeric nano-carrier have a strong potential for cancer therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted with the aim to estimate long-term tumor control and hearing preservation rates in patients with neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2)-related vestibular schwannoma (VS), document retreatment suc-cess rate, and assess the associated predictive factors.METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with NF2-associated VS who underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) between 2009 and 2020 and had a minimum follow-up of 1 year. Loss of tumor control was defined as greater than 10% increase in volume in more than one follow-up imaging or the need for retreatment in the form of repeat GKRS or surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate actuarial tumor control and hearing preservation rates.RESULTS: In total, 85 patients with 133 VSs were included in the study. The mean age was 29.8 years. In total, 57 tumors showed tumor regression, 35 showed sta-ble disease, and 23 progressed in size at last follow up. Actuarial tumor control rates after 1, 3, 5, and 9 years were 95%, 79%, 75%, and 55%, respectively, with overall tumor control rate being 85%. Hearing worsened in 39 patients, and facial nerve dysfunction occurred in 4 patients. Five tumors underwent retreatment with GKRS at a median duration of 27.6 months (19-36 months) following the first GKRS.CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest radiosurgical series of NF2-associated VS reported to date. GKRS provides a high rate of long-term local tumor control with a low risk of neurologic deprivation for patients with these tumors. The need for retreatment with GKRS, although low, is associ-ated with good tumor control and lesser complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors that affect decision-making when choosing a specific subspecialty while exploring gender and geographic variables.METHODS: A cross-sectional, 13-item, nonrandomized online survey was created and shared over various social media platforms of the Neurosurgery Cocktail. Data were collected between January and April 2022. The survey focused on the amount of exposure to subspecialties dur-ing training, along with factors affecting the decision in choosing a specific subspecialty.RESULTS: A total of 207 respondents, predominantly from Asian and European countries, with an 83.6% dominance of male respondents, completed the survey. The most common subspecialties with maximum exposure were neurosur-gical oncology, spine, and neurocritical care and trauma, whereas peripheral nerve surgery and stereotactic and functional neurosurgery were the least exposed. In total, 70% of the respondents had no training or degree in a subspecialty, which was the greatest in Asian and African countries (P = 0.0205). Respondents found the prestige and lifestyle of a skull base neurosurgeon very attractive (P = 0.027, 0.034 respectively), whereas the lifestyle and salary of spine neurosurgeons made it a popular subspe-cialty (P < 0.001, 0.008, respectively). Personal interest in neurosurgical oncology established its popularity among the respondents (P = 0.028).CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic and functional neurosur-gery and peripheral nerve surgery are the emerging subspecialties and hence their exposure and access are highly limited to the developed world whereas spine and neurosurgical oncology branches had a homogenous geographic presence. Pediatric neurosurgery had the most female representation, thereby necessitating the need to uplift women in other subspecialties.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical, radiologic, intraoperative, histopathologic, and molecular factors that might affect the surgical outcome of petroclival meningiomas.-METHODS: Medical records of 53 cases of petroclival meningiomas operated from 2003 to 2021 were reviewed for clinicoradiologic and molecular factors that were corre-lated with extent of resection. -RESULTS: Modified Dolenc-Kawase anterior trans-petrous rhomboid (44, 83.0%) was the most commonly used approach, followed by retrosigmoid (2, 3.8%) and combined (7, 13.2%) approaches. Hypointense tumors on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (odds ratio [OR] 5.85; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70-20.41) and presence of brainstem edema (OR 4.53; 95% CI 1.36-15.12) were found to be significant factors increasing the likelihood of sub-total resection (STR; P = 0.004 and P = 0.011, respec-tively). In the presence of both tumor T2 hypointensity and brainstem edema, there was a significant increase in the likelihood of STR (P = 0.001; OR 25; 95% CI 3.52-177.48). Of the 16 cases for which molecular analysis was performed, no specimen was found to have pTERT, AKT-1 E17K, and SMO L412F and W535L mutations. All (100%) the patients harboring H3K27me3 loss and/or hemizygous CDKN2A deletion had cavernous sinus extension compared with 62.5% of patients without H3K27me3 loss and 72.7% with hemizygous CDKN2A retention. Similarly, hemizygous CDKN2A deletion and H3K27me3 loss were associated with an increase in the rate of brainstem edema from 27.3% to 60% and 25% to 50%, respectively. -CONCLUSIONS: T2 hypointense tumor and brainstem edema on preoperative imaging are significant predictors of STR. H3K27me3 loss and hemizygous CDKN2A deletion may be associated with cavernous sinus extension, sug-gesting their role in tumor spread.

AB  - Importance: Solid cancer patients following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination are likely to have a lower serocon-version rate than healthy adults. Seroconversion between those with and without cancer is likely to vary moderately or to be restricted to specific subgroups. Therefore, we sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for diminished humoral immune responses in solid cancer patients.Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were used to search literature through May 1, 2022. Prospective or retrospective studies comparing responders with non -responders against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) following COVID-19 vaccination were included. Pooled Odds Ratios (pORs) with 95% CIs for binary variables and differences in means (with SDs) for continuous variables were calculated to determine the pooled effect estimates of risk factors for poor antibody response.Results: Fifteen studies enrolling 3593 patients were included in the analysis. Seroconversion was seen in 84% of the pooled study population. Male gender, age >65 years, and recent chemotherapy were all fac-tors in a poor immune response. Patients under follow-up, those who received immunotherapy or tar-geted therapy, were more likely to be seropositive. Cancer subtypes, vaccine types, and timing of antibody testing from the 2nd dose of vaccine did not correlate with seroconversion.Conclusion: Cytotoxic therapy for solid cancer may portend poor immune response following 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines suggesting a need for booster doses in these patients. Immunotherapy and targeted therapy are likely to be associated with seropositive status, and thus can be considered as an alternative to cytotoxic agents in cases where both therapies are equally efficacious.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Acute on chronic pancreatitis (ACP) is a relatively common condition, but there are significant gaps in our knowledge on the definition, incidence, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. Methods: A systematic review that followed PICO (Population; Intervention; Comparator; Outcome) recommendation for quantitative questions and PICo (Population, Phenomenon of Interest, Context) for qualitative research was done to answer 10 of the most relevant questions about ACP. Quality of evidence was judged by the GRADE criteria (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). The manuscript was sent for review to 12 international experts from various disciplines and continents using a Delphi process. Results: The quality of evidence, for most statements, was low to very low, which means that the recommendations in general are only conditional. Despite that, it was possible to reach strong levels of agreement by the expert panel for all 10 questions. A new consensus definition of ACP was reached. Although common, the real incidence of ACP is not known, with alcohol as a major risk factor. Although pain dominates, other non-specific symptoms and signs can be present. Serum levels of pancreatic enzymes may be less than 3 times the upper limit of normal and cross-sectional imaging is considered more accurate for the diagnosis in many cases. It appears that it is less severe and with a lower mortality risk than acute pancreatitis.Conclusions: Although the evidence base is poor, this position statement provides a foundation from which to advance management of ACP.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - PurposeBone health in primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is under-investigated. We assessed patients with spontaneous POI for vertebral fractures (VFs) and related parameters of bone health.Methods70 cases with spontaneous POI (age 32.5 +/- 7.0 years) and an equal number of controls were assessed for BMD, TBS, and VFs. BMD at the lumbar-spine (L1-L4), left hip, non-dominant forearm, and TBS (iNsight software) were measured on a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) machine. VFs were assessed by Genant's classification. Serum FSH, LH, estradiol, T4, TSH, iPTH, serum 25(OH)D, total calcium, and inorganic phosphorus were measured.ResultsBMD at the lumbar-spine, hip and forearm was reduced by 11.5%, 11.4% and 9.1% in POI as compared to controls (P < 0.001). Degraded or partially degraded microarchitecture on TBS was observed in 66.7% of patients and 38.2% of controls (P = 0.001). 15.7% of the POI patients had VFs, compared to 4.3% of controls (P = 0.045). Age, duration of amenorrhea and duration of HRT use were the significant predictors of TBS (P < 0.01). Serum 25(OH)D was the significant determinant of VFs. TBS abnormalities were higher in patients with POI and VFs. BMD was not significantly different in patients with and without VFs.ConclusionThus, lumbar-spine osteoporosis, impaired TBS and VFs were present in 35.7%, 66.7% and 15.7% of patients with spontaneous POI in their early third decade. This indicates need for rigorous investigations for impaired bone health in these young patients and management with HRT, vitamin-D, and possible need for bisphosphonate therapy.

AB  - Introduction: Quantitative fecal fat estimation is the gold standard test to diagnose steatorrhea (fecal fat >7 g/day) in chronic pancreatitis (CP), but cumbersome and inconvenient. So, fecal elastase-1 (FE) is proposed as a good alternative but the data on the diagnostic utility of FE to diagnose steatorrhea is variable.Methods: This retrospective study included adult CP patients evaluated with both 24-h fecal-fat and FE tests within a 3-month period. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FE to di- agnose steatorrhea and to evaluate the FE progression over 9-month period.Results: Among the 147 included patients, the frequency of steatorrhea (fecal fat >7 g/day) was 34%. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative likelihood ratio (LR) of FE was 90%, 28.9% and 0.35 at cut-off of <100 mg/g stool to diagnose steatorrhea; and 96%, 11.3% and 0.35 at cut-off of <200 mg/g stool, respec- tively. The optimal cut-off of FE was <20 on receiver operating characteristic curve (sensitivity 66%; specificity 69%; positive LR 2.14). There was no statistically significant variation in FE levels over 9 months interval among a hundred patients.Conclusion: Compared to FE >= 200 mg/g stool, FE >= 100 can used to exclude steatorrhea (better specificity and negative LR). FE < 20 alone cannot replace fecal fat estimation to confirm steatorrhea but to be interpreted with clinical features. Repeat FE testing for exocrine insufficiency progression can be done at least a year later. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IAP and EPC.

AB  - The use of musculoskeletal (MSK) ultrasound (US) in pediatric rheumatology has expanded rapidly with various diagnostic and therapeutic indications. Unlike magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), US allows real-time dynamic assessment, evaluation of multiple joints in a single session and comparison with contralateral limb. However, a long learning curve and lack of experience with MSK US in pediatric patients still precludes its routine use at many imaging centers. It is prudent for pediatric radiologists to be aware of normal US appearances of the growing MSK structures to avoid their misinterpretation as pathology. The normal MSK US findings in children which can be confused with pathology and create diagnostic difficulty can arise due to variable states of maturation of bones, cartilage and tendons, complex anatomical locations, accessory structures, and artifacts. Herein, we describe the various technical and interpretive challenges encountered with MSK US in pediatric patients.

AB  - PurposeRe-implantation of the tumor bearing autograft following extracorporeal radiation therapy (ECRT) has been established as an oncologically safe biological reconstruction technique following resection of bone sarcomas. However, factors affecting the ECRT graft-host bone incorporation have not been fully investigated. An insight into the factors that influence graft incorporation can circumvent the complications and increase graft survival.MethodsA total of 96 osteotomies in 48 patients with intercalary resections of primary extremity bone sarcomas (mean age 15.8 years, mean follow-up 42.1 months) were analyzed retrospectively for factors ECRT autograft-host bone union.ResultsOn univariate analysis, age < 20 years, metaphyseal osteotomy site, V-shaped diaphyseal osteotomy, and use of additional plate at diaphyseal osteotomy had a significantly faster time to union, while gender, tumour type, bone involved, resection length, chemotherapy, type of fixation, and use of intra-medullary fibula did not influence union time. In multivariate analysis, V-shaped diaphyseal osteotomy and use of additional plate at diaphyseal ostetomy were the independent factors with favourable time to union. None of the analyzed factors was found to have a significant effect on the union rate. The major complications were non-union in 11.4% patients, graft failure in 2.1%, infection in 12.5%, and soft tissue local recurrences in 14.5% patients.ConclusionModified diaphyseal osteotomy and augmentation of the stability of the reconstruction using additional small plates enhance the incorporation of ECRT autograft.

AB  - "Reverse cortical sign" is a rare entity described in lumbar burst fracture that corresponds to the fracture fragment of the posterior wall of vertebral body, which has rotated 180 degrees with the cortical surface facing anteriorly and the cancellous surface facing posteriorly in the canal. Identifying this sign is crucial in deciding the line of management as it is a contraindication for ligamentotaxis. The advent of computed tomography scans with axial and sagittal reconstruction has allowed us to better describe these rare entities. We present a lumbar burst fracture with a reverse cortical sign describing its appearance in axial computed tomography scans, sagittal reconstruction, and magnetic resonance imaging.

TI  - Public health supply chain for iron and folic acid supplementation in India: Status, bottlenecks and an agenda for corrective action under Anemia Mukt Bharat strategy
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - MIXED-METHOD
KW  - LESSONS
AB  - PurposeThe IFA supplementation program under the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) program is one of the most ambitious nutrient supplementation programs in India. The delivery of services often suffers due to frequent stock outs and shortages. It is critical to understand the bottleneck in the supply chain adversely affecting the performance and coverage of the program. The paper attempts to identify the bottlenecks of the IFA supply chain in key areas of supply chain i.e., forecasting, procurement, warehousing and inventory management, transportation, distribution, logistic information system and suggests a plan of action aimed at ensuring uninterrupted supplies to the end beneficiaries. Design/methodology/approachThe data source for the present paper is the nationwide IFA Supply Chain Assessment (2018-19) conducted across 29 Indian states with a total of 58 districts, 116 blocks, 232 Sub-Centres, 232 Anganwadi centres and 232 schools covered under the assessment as a multi-partner collaborative initiative. Field insights from supply chain strengthening interventions under different public health programs in India and other developing countries were taken to arrive at corrective actions and recommendations. Findings were disseminated to government and an action plan was suggested for connecting service delivery points through an app-based system, developing a micro plan for ensuring fixed distribution schedule, followed by continuous monitoring and review meetings identified for follow up. FindingsThe average lead time across states was 35 weeks with top three performing states being Goa, Sikkim, and Telangana. The average per unit cost of procurement was Rs 0.35 for IFA Red, Rs 0.25 for IFA Blue, Rs 0.31 for IFA Pink and Rs 7.30 for IFA syrup. Out of the 704 districts in India, only 213 has IFA Red, only 140 had IFA Blue, 152 had IFA Pink and 163 had IFA Syrup available in four quarters of 2018-19. The key issues identified in the assessment were-a lack of standardized forecasting process, absence of inventory management techniques, no fixed distribution schedule, inadequate availability of transport vehicles and an absence of an integrated MIS. Originality/valueThe identification of bottlenecks in the IFA supply chain and its impact on the performance of the supply chain would provide policy guidelines for the government as well as development partner agencies to design an effective and efficient supply chain. It would also enable the policy planners to understand the challenges associated with managing different components of a supply chain, their interrelation and impact on the overall performance of the supply chain. The suggested recommendations would equip program managers with the tool to devise and implement field level solutions.

AB  - The Racial disparity between the clinical outcomes post interventions among Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) have not been well studied, with limited literature available. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the post-procedure outcomes among PAD patients between Black and White race. We systemati-cally searched all electronic databases from inception until first November 2022. The primary endpoint was major amputation within 30 days. Secondary endpoints were myocardial infarction (MI) within 30 days, mortality within 30 days, and all-cause mortality (ACM). A total of 136,395 patients were included in the analysis, with 117,177 patients of the White race and 19,218 patients of the Black race. The mean age of the patients in each group was (66.41 vs 62.75). Most common comorbidity among White and Black patients was diabetes mellitus (42.15% vs 55.90%), and hypertension (HTN) (39.53% vs 90.07%). The odds of major amputation within 30 days was significantly higher in Black patients com-pared to white patients (OR, 0.40 (95% CI: 0.19-0.84, P = 0.02), while the odds of MI was higher in White patients compared to Black race PAD patients (OR, 1.29, (95%CI:1.05-1.58), P < 0.02). There was no sig-nificant difference in ACM (OR, 0.97(95%CI: 0.64-1.47, P = 0.88), and mortality within 30 days (OR, 1.09 (95%CI:0.77-1.53, P = 0.64) between both groups. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis with the largest sample size thus far, highlighting that Black patients are at a higher risk for major amputation within 30 days compared to white patients although mortality remains comparable between the 2 races.

AB  - Drug-induced movement disorders (DIMDs) are most commonly associated with typical and atypical antipsychotics. However, other drugs such as antidepressants, antihistamines, antiepileptics, antiarrhythmics, and gastrointestinal drugs can also cause abnormal involuntary movements. Different types of movement disorders can also occur because of adverse drug reactions. Therefore, the important key to diagnosing DIMDs is a causal relationship between potential offending drugs and the occurrence of abnormal movements. The pathophysiology of DIMDs is not clearly understood; however, many cases of DIMDs are thought to exert adverse mechanisms of action in the basal ganglia. The treatment of some DIMDs is quite challenging, and removing the offending drugs may not be possible in some conditions such as withdrawing antipsychotics in the patient with partially or uncontrollable neuropsychiatric conditions. Future research is needed to understand the mechanism of DIMDs and the development of drugs with better side-effect profiles. This article reviews the phenomenology, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology, and management of DIMDs.

AB  - The unregulated use of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) has been linked to spread of breast cancer (BC), but the underlying biomolecular interactions are unknown. Using a case-control study, we compared OCP blood levels and protein signatures among BC patients. Five pesticides were found in significantly higher concentrations in breast cancer patients than in healthy controls: p ',p ' dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane (DDT), p ' p ' dichloro diphenyl dichloroethane (DDD), endosulfan II, delta-hexachlorocyclohexane (dHCH), and heptachlor epoxide A (HTEA). According to the odds ratio analysis, these OCPs, which have been banned for decades, continue to raise the risk of cancer in Indian women. Proteomic analysis of plasma from estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients revealed 17 dysregulated proteins, but transthyretin (TTR) was three times higher than in healthy controls, which is further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies revealed a competitive affinity between endosulfan II and the thyroxine-binding site of TTR, pointing towards the significance of the competition between thyroxin and endosulfan, resulting in endocrine disruption leading to breast cancer. Our study sheds light on the putative role of TTR in OCP-mediated BC, but more research is needed to decipher the underlying mechanisms that can be used to prevent the carcinogenic effects of these pesticides on women's health.

AB  - Parkinson's disease and Schizophrenia fall under low dopamine neurodegenerative and high dopamine psychiatric disorders respectively. Pharmacological interventions to correct mid-brain dopamine concentrations sometimes overshoots the physiological dopamine levels leading to psychosis in Parkinson's disease patients and, extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia patients. Currently no validated method is available to monitor side effects in such patients, Apolipoprotein E is one of the CSF biomarkers identified in the recent past that shows an inverse relation to mid-brain dopamine concentration. In this study, we have developed s-MARSA for the detection of Apolipoprotein E from ultra-small volume (2 mu L) of CSF. s-MARSA exhibits a broad detection range (5 fg mL(-1) to 4 mu g mL(-1)) with a better detection limit and could be performed within an hour utilizing only a small volume of CSF sample. The values measured by s-MARSA strongly correlates with the values measured by ELISA. Our method has advantages over ELISA in having a lower detection limit, a broader linear detection range, shorter analysis time, and requiring a low volume of CSF samples. The developed s-MARSA method holds promise for the detection of Apolipoprotein E with clinical utility for monitoring pharmacotherapy of Parkinson's and Schizophrenia patients.

AB  - BackgroundHerniation of ovaries and Mullerian structures into inguinal canal is usually reported in infants and is rare among adults. We are presenting a rare case of Mullerian agenesis and Turner mosaic syndrome with tubo-ovarian inguinal hernia.Case presentationA 17-year-old girl presented with complaints of primary amenorrhea, phenotypical features of Turner syndrome with left inguinal hernia and severe hypertension. Baseline hormonal analysis was normal. Karyotype revealed Turner mosaic with 46XX (85%); 45XO (15%). MRI showed Mullerian agenesis with normally located right ovary in pelvis and left ovary prolapsed through deep inguinal ring into the canal of Nuck. Anti-hypertensives were started and patient optimized for surgery. Laparoscopic hernia repair and repositioning of left ovary into the pelvis was done. Patient had uneventful post-operative course and was discharged in stable condition on anti-hypertensive medication. Future reproductive issues and need of passive vaginal dilatation or vaginoplasty before marriage were explained to the patient and family.ConclusionThis is the first ever reported case with unusual association of atypical MRKH, Turner mosaic syndrome and tubo-ovarian hernia into the inguinal canal. The case emphasizes the need and importance of complete work up of these atypical cases as patients may have more than one cause of primary amenorrhea and complete evaluation is must before any medical or surgical intervention.

AB  - ObjectiveA systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies evaluating the utility of the Testicular Work-up for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion (TWIST) score in establishing or excluding the diagnosis of testicular torsion (TT) is herewith presented in an attempt to quantify the available evidence.MethodsThe study protocol was outlined in advance. The review has been conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). The PubMed, PUBMED Central, PMC databases & Scopus followed by Google (Scholar & search engine) were systematically interrogated with the keywords TWIST score, testis and testicular torsion. Fourteen sets of data (n = 1940) from 13 studies were included; data from 7 studies (giving a detailed score-wise break-up) (n = 1285) were dis-integrated and re-integrated to tweak the cut-offs for low and high risk.ResultsFor every 4 patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with acute scrotum, one patient will eventually be diagnosed with TT. The mean TWIST score was higher in patients with testicular torsion (5.13 +/- 1.53 vs 1.50 +/- 1.40 for those without TT). TWIST score can be used to predict testicular torsion at cut-off of 5 with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.71 (0.66, 0.75; 95%CI), 0.97 (0.97, 0.98; 95%CI), 90.2%, 91.0%, and 90.9% respectively. While the slider for cut-off was shifted from 4 to 7, there was a rise in specificity and PPV of the test with a corresponding decline in sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy. The sensitivity witnessed a sharp decline from 0.86 (0.81-0.90; 95%CI) @ cut-off 4 to 0.18 (0.14-0.23; 95%CI) @ cut-off 7. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 5 was more than that for cut-offs 4, 6 & 7.TWIST cut-off of 2 may be used to predict the absence of testicular torsion with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of 0.76 (0.74, 0.78; 95%CI), 0.95 (0.93, 0.97; 95%CI), 97.9%, 56.5%, and 80.7%, respectively. While the cut-off is lowered from 3 to 0, there is a corresponding rise in the specificity and PPV, while the sensitivity, NPV, and accuracy are compromised. The sensitivity witnesses a sharp decline from 91 to 35%. The area under the SROC curve for cut-off 2 was more than that for cut-off @ 0, 1 or 3.The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to ascertain the diagnosis of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 4 & 5 only. The sum of sensitivity and specificity of TWIST scoring system to confirm the absence of TT is more than 1.5 for cut-off values 3 & 2 only.ConclusionTWIST is a relatively simple, flexible, and objective tool which may be swiftly administered even by the para-medical personnel in the ED. The overlapping clinical presentation of diseases originating from the same organ may prevent TWIST from absolutely establishing or refuting the diagnosis of TT in all the patients with acute scrotum. The proposed cut-offs are a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Yet, the TWIST scoring system is immensely helpful in the clinical decision-making process and saves time-lag associated with investigations in a significant majority of patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with long-term gastrointestinal sequelae; however, prospective longitudinal data are sparse. We prospectively studied the frequency, spectrum, and risk factors of post infection functional gastrointestinal disorders/disorders of gut-brain interaction (PI-FGID/DGBI) after COVID-19.METHODS: Three hundred twenty cases with COVID-19 and 2 control groups, group A, 320 healthy spou-ses/family controls, and group B, 280 healthy COVID serology-negative controls, were pro-spectively followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months by using validated Rome IV criteria to evaluate the frequency of PI-FGID/DGBI.RESULTS: Of 320 cases, at 1 month 36 (11.3%) developed FGID symptoms. Persistent symptoms were noted in 27 (8.4%) at 3 months and in 21 (6.6%) at 6 months. At 3 months, 8 (2.5%) had ir-ritable bowel syndrome, 7 (2.2%) had functional diarrhea, 6 (1.9%) had functional dyspepsia, 3 (0.9%) had functional constipation, 2 (0.6%) had functional dyspepsia-IBS overlap, and 1 (0.3%) had functional abdominal bloating/distention. Among symptomatic individuals at 3 months, 8 (29.6%) were positive for isolated carbohydrate malabsorption, 1 (3.7%) was pos-itive for post infection malabsorption syndrome, and 1 (3.7%) was positive for intestinal methanogen overgrowth. None of the healthy controls developed FGID up to 6 months of follow-up (P < .01). Predictive factors at 3 and 6 months were severity of infection (P < .01) and presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at the time of infection (P < .01).CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 led to significantly higher number of new onset PI-FGID/DGBI compared with healthy controls at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. If further investigated, some patients can be diagnosed with underlying malabsorption.

AB  - Objective The objective was to describe the clinical presentations, radiologic features, and outcomes of patients with autoimmune encephalitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG).
   BackgroundDuring the past decade, the spectrum of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated diseases (MOGAD) has expanded. Recently, patients with MOG antibody encephalitis (MOG-E) who do not fulfill the criteria for ADEM have been reported. In this study, we aimed to describe the spectrum of MOG-E.
   Methods Sixty-four patients with MOGAD were screened for encephalitis-like presentation. We collected the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and outcome data of the patients who presented with encephalitis and compared it with the non-encephalitis group.
   Results We identified sixteen patients (nine males and seven females) with MOG-E. The median age of the encephalitis population was significantly lower than the non-encephalitis group (14.5 years (11.75-18) vs. 28 years (19.75-42), p = 0.0004). Twelve out of sixteen patients (75%) had fever at the time of encephalitis. Headache and seizure were present in 9/16 (56.2%) and 7/16 (43.75%) patients, respectively. FLAIR cortical hyperintensity was present in 10/16 (62.5%) patients. Supratentorial deep gray nuclei were involved in 10/16 (62.5%) patients. Three patients had tumefactive demyelination, and one patient had a leukodystrophy-like lesion. Twelve of 16 (75%) patients had a good clinical outcome. Patient with leukodystrophy pattern and other with generalized CNS atrophy showed a chronic progressive course.
   Conclusion MOG-E can have heterogeneous radiological presentations. FLAIR cortical hyperintensity, tumefactive demyelination, and leukodystrophy-like presentations are novel radiological presentations associated with MOGAD. Though majority of MOG-E have a good clinical outcome, few patients can have chronic progressive disease even on immunosuppressive therapy.

AB  - ObjectivesTo assess the cost-effectiveness of addition of olanzapine to a prophylactic antiemetic regimen containing aprepitant, dexamethasone and ondansetron among children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the UK and the USA. MethodsHealth states were estimated using individual patient-level outcome data from a randomised trial. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit (NMB) were calculated from the patient perspective for India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the UK and the USA. One-way sensitivity analysis was done by varying the cost of olanzapine, cost of hospitalisation and utility values by +/- 25%. ResultsThe olanzapine arm had an increment of 0.0018 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) over the control arm. The mean total expenditure in the olanzapine arm was greater by US$0.51, US$0.43, US$6.73, US$11.05 and US$12.35 in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the UK and the USA, respectively. The ICUR($/QALY) was US$282.60 in India, US$241.42 in Bangladesh, US$3755.93 in Indonesia, US$6161.83 in the UK and US$6887.41 in the USA. The NMB was US$9.86, US$10.12, US$14.08, US$44.74 and US$98.79 for India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the UK and the USA, respectively. The ICUR estimates of the base case and sensitivity analysis were below the willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. ConclusionThe addition of olanzapine as a fourth agent for antiemetic prophylaxis is cost-effective despite an increase in overall expenditure. Olanzapine should be uniformly considered for children receiving HEC.

AB  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare systemic ANCA (Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) associated vasculitis (AAV). In the last couple of decades, GPA has emerged as a disease of concern due to rapid increase in the prevalence and incidence especially in developing countries. Unknown aetiology and rapid progression have made GPA a critical disease. Thus, establishing specific tools to facilitate early and faster disease diagnosis and efficient disease management has immense importance. GPA may develop in genetically predisposed individuals on receiving the external stimulus (i.e. microbial pathogen, pollutant etc.) that triggers the immune response. B-cell activating factor (BAFF) produced by the neutrophils, promotes the B-cell maturation and survival which leads to increased ANCA production. Abnormal B-cell and T-cell proliferation and their cytokine response plays a major role in disease pathogenesis and granuloma formation. ANCA interacts with neutrophils and induces the neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production which leads to the endothelial cell injury. This review article summarizes the critical pathological events and how cytokines and immune cells shape the GPA pathogenesis. Decoding this complex network would facilitate in developing tools for diagnosis, prognosis and disease management. Recently developed specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) targeting cytokines and immune cells are being used for safer treatment and achieving longer remission.

AB  - Worldwide, People with Epilepsy (PWE) are confronted with several barriers to face-to-face consultations. These obstacles hamper appropriate clinical follow-up and also increase the treatment gap for Epilepsy. Telemedicine holds the potential to enhance management as follow-up visits for PWE are focused on more on clinical history and counselling rather than physical examination. Besides consultation, telemedicine can also be used for remote EEG diagnostics and tele-neuropsychology assessments. In this article, the Telemedicine Task Force of the In-ternational League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) outlines recommendations regarding optimal practice in utilizing in the management of individuals with epilepsy. We formulated recommendations for minimum technical re-quirements, preparing for the first tele-consultation and the specificities for follow-up consultations. Special considerations are necessary for specific populations, including paediatric patients, patients who are not conversant with tele-medicine and those with intellectual disability. Telemedicine for individuals with epilepsy should be vigorously promoted with the aim of improving the quality of care and ultimately reduce the wide clinician access related treatment gap across several regions of the globe. of Epilepsy EEG diagnostics and tele-neuropsychology assessments.

AB  - Guidelines recommend initiating supplemental enteral feeding through a nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy tube (G-tube) in patients with chronic kidney disease who have inadequate oral intake despite repeated nutritional counseling. While G-tube placement is shown to improve both nutritional status and anthropometric indices of children with CKD in developed regions, information from developing countries is lacking. This retrospective report reviewed the impact of G-tube feeding on nutritional intakes and anthropometric parameters over a 1-y follow-up in 5 children with CKD-5D managed at one tertiary care center in India. Gastrostomy feeding facilitated significant increments in caloric and protein intake and was easy and safe. However, G-tube feeding led to additional expenses, and the changes in growth parameters were variable in the short term. A longer follow-up appears necessary to understand its impact on wasting, growth velocity, and stature.

AB  - Cancer patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 compared to the general population, but it remains unclear which types of cancer have the highest risk of COVID-19-related mortality. This study examines mortality rates for those with hematological malignancies (Hem) versus solid tumors (Tumor). PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for relevant articles using Nested Knowledge software (Nested Knowledge, St Paul, MN). Articles were eligible for inclusion if they reported mortality for Hem or Tumor patients with COVID-19. Articles were excluded if they were not published in English, non-clinical studies, had insufficient population/outcomes reporting, or were irrelevant. Baseline characteristics collected included age, sex, and comorbidities. Primary outcomes were all-cause and COVID-19-related in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Effect sizes from each study were computed as logarithmically transformed odds ratios (ORs) with random-effects, Mantel-Haenszel weighting. The between-study variance component of random-effects models was computed using restricted effects maximum likelihood estimation, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) around pooled effect sizes were calculated using Hartung-Knapp adjustments. In total, 12,057 patients were included in the analysis, with 2,714 (22.5%) patients in the Hem group and 9,343 (77.5%) patients in the Tumor group. The overall unadjusted odds of all-cause mortality were 1.64 times higher in the Hem group compared to the Tumor group (95% CI: 1.30-2.09). This finding was consistent with multivariable models presented in moderate- and high-quality cohort studies, suggestive of a causal effect of cancer type on in-hospital mortality. Additionally, the Hem group had increased odds of COVID-19-related mortality compared to the Tumor group (OR = 1.86 [95% CI: 1.38-2.49]). There was no significant difference in odds of IMV or ICU admission between cancer groups (OR = 1.13 [95% CI: 0.64-2.00] and OR = 1.59 [95% CI: 0.95-2.66], respectively). Cancer is a serious comorbidity associated with severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, with especially alarming mortality rates in patients with hematological malignancies, which are typically higher compared to patients with solid tumors. A meta-analysis of individual patient data is needed to better assess the impact of specific cancer types on patient outcomes and to identify optimal treatment strategies.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-9 is an emerging player in the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory diseases including bone disorders like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis. Recently, IL-9 was shown to enhance the osteoclast formation and their function in RA. However, the mechanisms by which IL-9 influences osteoclastogenesis are not known. Therefore, in this study we aimed to unravel the direct and indirect ways by which IL-9 can influence osteoclast formation. We used mouse bone marrow precursor cells for checking the effect of IL-9 on osteoclast differentiation and its function. Next, IL-9 induced signalling pathway were checked in the process of osteoclastogenesis. T cells play an important role in enhancing osteoclastogenesis in inflammatory conditions. We used splenic T cells to understand the impact of IL-9 on the functions of T effector (Teff) and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Furthermore, the effect of IL-9 mediated modulation of the T cell response on osteoclasts was checked using a coculture model of T cells with osteoclast precursors. We showed that IL-9 enhanced osteoclast formation and its function. We found that IL-9 activates STAT3, P38 MAPK, ERK1/2, NF kappa B and we hypothesize that it mediates the effect on osteoclastogenesis by accelerating mitochondrial biogenesis. Additionally, IL-9 was observed to facilitate the functions of pro-osteoclastogenic IL-17 producing T cells, but inhibits the function of anti-osteoclastogenic Treg cells. Our observations suggest that IL-9 can influence osteoclastogenesis directly by modulating the signalling cascade in the precursor cells; indirectly by enhancing IL-17 producing T cells and by reducing the functions of Treg cells.

AB  - Lately, 3D cell culture technique has gained a lot of appreciation as a research model. Augmented with tech-nological advancements, the area of 3D cell culture is growing rapidly with a diverse array of scaffolds being tested. This is especially the case for spheroid cultures. The culture of cells as spheroids provides opportunities for unanticipated vision into biological phenomena with its application to drug discovery, metabolic profiling, stem cell research as well as tumor, and disease biology. Spheroid fabrication techniques are broadly categorised into matrix-dependent and matrix-independent techniques. While there is a profusion of spheroid fabrication substrates with substantial biological relevance, an economical, modular, and bio-compatible substrate for high throughput production of spheroids is lacking. In this review, we posit the prospects of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) as a broad-spectrum spheroid fabrication platform. Elastin-like polypeptides are nature inspired, size-tunable genetically engineered polymers with wide applicability in various arena of biological considerations, has been employed for spheroid culture with profound utility. The technology offers a cheap, high-throughput, reproducible alternative for spheroid culture with exquisite adaptability. Here, we will brief the applicability of 3D cultures as compared to 2D cultures with spheroids being the focal point of the review. Common approaches to spheroid fabrication are discussed with existential limitations. Finally, the versatility of elastin-like poly-peptide inspired substrates for spheroid culture has been discussed.

AB  - With 40% of idiopathic cases, recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a problem of great concern for patients and clinicians. In addition to financial burden, it causes a lot of frustration and anxiety in affected couples. The primary objective of this review was to gain knowledge of recent advances in the field of recurrent pregnancy losses and to understand the role of male contributory factors in idiopathic cases. For a long time, researchers and clinicians were seeking an explanation for idiopathic RPL (iRPL) in females only; however, with recent advances in reproductive biology, the role of spermatozoa in early embryonic development has caught the attention of researchers. Clinically, only routine semen parameters and karyotyping are investigated in iRPL male partners, which seem to be insufficient in the present scenario, and thus, more information at the molecular level is required for a comprehensive understanding of iRPL. In concluding remarks, we suggest targeted multi-omics investigations in a large cohort to improve our understanding of the role of male contributory factors in iRPL.

AB  - Background and aimsEarly identification of non-response to steroids is critical in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) causing acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). We assessed if this non-response can be accurately identified within first few days of treatment.MethodsPatients with AIH-ACLF without baseline infection/hepatic encephalopathy were identified from APASL ACLF research consortium (AARC) database. Diagnosis of AIH-ACLF was based mainly on histology. Those treated with steroids were assessed for non-response (defined as death or liver transplant at 90 days for present study). Laboratory parameters, AARC, and model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scores were assessed at baseline and day 3 to identify early non-response. Utility of dynamic SURFASA score [- 6.80 + 1.92*(D0-INR) + 1.94*( increment %3-INR) + 1.64*( increment %3-bilirubin)] was also evaluated. The performance of early predictors was compared with changes in MELD score at 2 weeks.ResultsFifty-five out of one hundred and sixty-five patients (age-38.2 +/- 15.0 years, 67.2% females) with AIH-ACLF [median MELD 24 (IQR: 22-27); median AARC score 7 (6-9)] given oral prednisolone 40 (20-40) mg per day were analyzed. The 90 day transplant-free survival in this cohort was 45.7% with worse outcomes in those with incident infections (56% vs 28.0%, p = 0.03). The AUROC of pre-therapy AARC score [0.842 (95% CI 0.754-0.93)], MELD [0.837 (95% CI 0.733-0.94)] score and SURFASA score [0.795 (95% CI 0.678-0.911)] were as accurate as increment MELD at 2 weeks [0.770 (95% CI 0.687-0.845), p = 0.526] and better than increment MELD at 3 days [0.541 (95% CI 0.395, 0.687), p < 0.001] to predict non-response. Combination of AARC score > 6, MELD score > 24 with SURFASA score >= - 1.2, could identify non-responders at day 3 (concomitant- 75% vs either - 42%, p < 0.001).ConclusionBaseline AARC score, MELD score, and the dynamic SURFASA score on day 3 can accurately identify early non-response to steroids in AIH-ACLF.

AB  - The maturation of tRNA and its quality control is crucial for aminoacylation and protein synthesis. The CCA enzyme, also known as tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, catalyzes the addition or repair of CCA at the 3' -terminus of tRNAs to facilitate aminoacylation. Structural studies of CCA enzyme in complex with ATP and CTP suggested that adding CCA at the 3'-terminus of tRNAs is a sequential process [1-4]. However, there are many inconsistent results of CCA addition from the biochemical studies, which raise the am-biguity about the CCA enzyme specificity in vitro [5-7]. On the other hand, there are no effective methods for preparing the 3'-amino-tailed tRNA to provide a stable amide linkage, which is vital to make homogeneous samples for structural studies of stalling peptides to understand ribosome mediated gene regulation [7-11]. In this study, we examined the functional specificity of the Class II CCA enzyme from E. coli, and optimized the benchmark experimental conditions to prepare the 3'-NH2-tRNA using the CCA enzyme. Our results suggest that the CCA enzyme has a specific ability to catalyze the CCA addition/ repair activity within the stoichiometric range of the reactants, and excess amounts of nucleotides lead to non-specific polymerization of the tRNA. Further, we developed an efficient method for synthesizing 3' -amino tRNA, which can facilitate stable aminoacyl/peptidyl-tRNA preparation.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) incurs substantial health and economic burden, as it is the leading reason for death and disability globally. Endocrine abnormalities are no longer considered a rare complication of TBI. The reported prevalence is variable across studies, depending on the time frame of injury, time and type of testing, and variability in hormonal values considered normal across different studies. The present review reports evidence on the endocrine dysfunction that can occur after TBI. Several aspects, including the pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical consequences/challenges (in the acute and chronic phases), screening and diagnostic workup, principles of therapeutic management, and insights on future directions/research agenda, are presented. The management of hypopituitarism following TBI involves hormonal replacement therapy. It is essential for health care providers to be aware of this complication because at times, symptoms may be subtle and may be mistaken to be caused by brain injury itself. There is a need for stronger evidence for establishing recommendations for optimum management so that they can be incorporated as standard of care in TBI management.

AB  - BackgroundOrthopedic metallic screws even post healing causes 'pinching effect' and load inflammation to the bone. In this work, the design and development of a novel metallic core and polymeric shell orthopedic screw is discussed along with optimization of manufacturing process.MethodsA comparative 2D finite element study for pull-out test was conducted on HA, HB, HC, and HD standards of screws for approximately identical diameters to determine the type of threading for the proposed design of the novel orthopedic screw. The polymeric shell of the orthopedic screws was manufactured by injection molding process. The material used for manufacturing the polymeric shell was poly-l-lactic acid. Injection pressure, injection velocity, packing pressure and packing time of the injection molding process were optimized for the following output responses: maximum axial pull-out strength, and maximal bending strength of the screw.ResultsThe r-squared and the adjusted r-squared value of the developed regression model for pull-out was found to be 96% and 92%, respectively. For the bending force, the developed regression model had a r-squared and adjusted r-squared value of 87% and 75%, respectively. The regression models were maximised to obtain the desired input parameters. The optimised parameters were validated experimentally at two local maxima for both pull-out and bending force.SignificanceThe developed screw is novel in design and a patent has been filed under US patent office with number US 2022/0000529 A1. The screws can be used by medical practitioners to avoid or minimise revision surgery and inflammation.

AB  - Background Dyslipidemia is a potentially modifiable risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Information on the safety and efficacy of statins in pediatric CKD is limited.Methods Patients with CKD stage 2-5 and aged 5-18 years with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > 130 mg/dL and/or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) > 145 mg/dL were enrolled from September 2019 to February 2021. All patients were administered atorvastatin 10 mg/day, which was escalated to 20 mg/day if LDL-C remained > 100 mg/ dL and/or non-HDL-C > 120 mg/dL at 12 weeks. Proportion of patients achieving target lipid levels (LDL-C < 100 mg/dL and non-HDL-C < 120 mg/dL) and adverse events were assessed at 24 weeks.Results Of 31 patients enrolled, target lipid levels were achieved in 45.2% (95% CI 27.8-63.7%) at 24 weeks; 22 patients required dose escalation to 20 mg at 12 weeks. There was no difference in median lipid level reduction with 10 (n = 9) versus 20 mg/day (n = 22, P = 0.3). Higher baseline LDL-C (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.11) and older age (OR 36.5, 95% CI 2.57-519.14) were independent predictors of failure to achieve target lipid levels with 10 mg/day atorvastatin. None had persistent rise in AST/ALT > 3 times upper normal limit (UNL) or CPK > 10 times UNL. No differences were noted in adverse events due to atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg/day.Conclusion Atorvastatin (10-20 mg/day) administered for 24 weeks was safe and effectively reduced LDL-C and nonHDL-C in children with CKD stages 2-5. Patients with higher baseline LDL-C required higher doses to achieve the target.

AB  - BackgroundThe coronavirus disease (COVID) pandemic caused disruption globally and was particularly distressing in low- and middle-income countries such as India. This study aimed to provide population representative estimates of COVID-related outcomes in India over time and characterize how COVID-related changes and impacts differ by key socioeconomic groups across the life course.MethodsThe sample was leveraged from an existing nationally representative study on cognition and dementia in India: Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD). The wave-1 of LASI-DAD enrolled 4096 older adults aged 60 years and older in 3316 households from 18 states and union territories of India. Out of the 3316 LASI-DAD households, 2704 with valid phone numbers were contacted and invited to participate in the Real-Time Insights COVID-19 in India (RTI COVID-India) study. RTI COVID-India was a bi-monthly phone survey that provided insight into the individual's knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour towards COVID-19 and changes in the household's economic and health conditions throughout the pandemic. The survey was started in May 2020 and 9 rounds of data have been collected.Findings till dateOut of the 2704 LASI-DAD households with valid phone numbers, 1766 households participated in the RTI COVID-India survey at least once. Participants were in the age range of 18-102 years, 49% were female, 66% resided in rural area. Across all rounds, there was a higher report of infection among respondents aged 60-69 years. There was a greater prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosis reported in urban (23.0%) compared to rural areas (9.8%). Respondents with higher education had a greater prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosis compared to those with lower or no formal education. Highest prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosis was reported from high economic status compared to middle and low economic status households. Comparing education gradients in experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and being diagnosed, we observe an opposite pattern: respondents with no formal schooling reported the highest level of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, whereas the greatest proportion of the respondents with secondary school or higher education reported being diagnosed with COVID-19.Future plansThe study group will analyse the data collected showing the real-time changes throughout the pandemic and will make the data widely available for researchers to conduct further studies.

AB  - IntroductionGene expression profile of mitochondrial-related genes is not well deciphered in pediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). We aimed to identify mitochondria-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in pediatric AML with their prognostic significance. MethodsChildren with de novo AML were included prospectively between July 2016-December 2019. Transcriptomic profiling was done for a subset of samples, stratified by mtDNA copy number. Top mitochondria-related DEGs were identified and validated by real-time PCR. A prognostic gene signature risk score was formulated using DEGs independently predictive of overall survival (OS) in multivariable analysis. Predictive ability of the risk score was estimated along with external validation in The Tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) AML dataset. ResultsIn 143 children with AML, twenty mitochondria-related DEGs were selected for validation, of which 16 were found to be significantly dysregulated. Upregulation of SDHC (p<0.001), CLIC1 (p=0.013) and downregulation of SLC25A29 (p<0.001) were independently predictive of inferior OS, and included for developing prognostic risk score. The risk score model was independently predictive of survival over and above ELN risk categorization (Harrell's c-index: 0.675). High-risk patients (risk score above median) had significantly inferior OS (p<0.001) and event free survival (p<0.001); they were associated with poor-risk cytogenetics (p=0.021), ELN intermediate/poor risk group (p=0.016), absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 (p=0.027), and not attaining remission (p=0.016). On external validation, the risk score also predicted OS (p=0.019) in TCGA dataset. DiscussionWe identified and validated mitochondria-related DEGs with prognostic impact in pediatric AML and also developed a novel 3-gene based externally validated gene signature predictive of survival.

AB  - PurposeThis phase II trial is designed to test whether the performance status (PS) of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients (pts) can improve with chemotherapy if their poor PS (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of >= 2) is due to disease burden rather than comorbidities.MethodsAge18-65 years, Charlson's comorbidity index < 9, serum albumin >= 3.5 g/dl, adequate bone marrow and organ function, & ECOG PS >= 2 as judged by the worst score of three independent physicians were administered 3 doses of weekly paclitaxel at 60 mg/m(2)/dose. The primary endpoint was an improvement in ECOG PS by 1 point at 4 weeks; others: toxicity (CTCAE v 5.0), quality of life (QoL) assessment at baseline and 4 weeks by EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-LC13. Optimal Simon's 2-stage design was used.Results Forty-six patients were included with a median age of 56 years (interquartile range, IQR 54-59), 12 (26%) had comorbid conditions, and 87% with ECOG PS 3/4. PS improved in 11 pts at 4 weeks and in 7 beyond this time point. Grade 3/4 toxicities are seen in 20% (most common: anemia and diarrhea). At a median follow-up of 4.8 m (95% CI 3.27-14.9), the median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.3 months (95% CI 2.36-5.6) and 6.8 months (95% CI 2.47-8.8), respectively. QoL improved for global QoL, role functioning, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, pain in the chest, pain in other parts, and worsened for alopecia and sore mouth.Conclusions Abbreviated chemotherapy is a useful, well-tolerated strategy in carefully selected poor PS mNSCLC patients that can improve PS and QoL.

AB  - PurposeThe search for an ideal Hypospadias repair dressing continues. We aimed to develop a hypoallergenic optimized biocompatible dressing (BD).MethodBD with a multi-layered structure of hydrophilic treated Polypropylene with three-layered technologies; Absorbent-spunlaced hydroentangled polyester/viscose blend, outer Polypropylene, Polyester, Acrylic, and Spandex, with super Absorbent Polymer and Acrylic adhesive. Wistar rat abdominal wound model was divided into two groups: control (normal gauze dressing with adhesive) and Study (BD). The physical properties and wound characteristics were compared.ResultsAverage mass: thickness of BD was 626.7 +/- 5.6 g m(-2): 2.6 +/- 0.015 mm. Absorption was 1425.2 +/- 127.6%. Percentage desorption of solution A from dressings at 24:40 h was 1249 +/- 150%:1417 +/- 230%. BD was hydrophilic with no particles/residue after immersion and pH neutral. The average air permeability was 11.6 +/- 1.6 cm(3)/cm(2)/sec. The tensile force was 200N-220N with an extension on the breaking point at 24 mm. BD was superior for ease of removability on Day 6 (p = 0.012) and sticking quality (p = 0.036), absorption (p = 0.036), ease of removability(p = 0.036), and sustenance (p = 0.030) on Day 10. BD dressing demonstrated better wound healing (p = 0.015) and decreased redness (p = 0.002) on Day 10. Histopathological healing was better with BD on Day 14(p = 0.025) and Day 20 (p = 0.034).ConclusionBD demonstrated better desirable physical and wound healing qualities with less inflammation compared with control normal dressing.

AB  - The 10X Genomics spatial transcriptomics platform enables profiling of fresh-frozen (FF) and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. FF analysis relies on PolyA capture of RNAs, whereas FFPE analysis uses predesigned probes to capture coding transcripts. While using FFPE spatial data as a 'negative control' for identifying novel noncoding RNAs in FF data, we found that some probes captured spurious signal from both the target gene and potential lncRNAs. The finding was validated across seven published datasets from 10X Genomics and an in-house dataset. We recommend excluding genes captured by the identified 'spurious' probes from further analyses since the off-target signals account for the reported counts, where some of those genes are known to play role in cancer. We further propose to use existing annotations of lncRNA to redesign FFPE capture probes with better specificity.

AB  - BackgroundThe intrauterine contraceptive device TCu380Ag when compared with TCu380A at 1 year of use had better acceptability and continuation rates. ObjectivesTo study the continuation rate, efficacy, and acceptability of TCu380Ag in three sizes versus TCu380A at 5 years of use. MethodsA total of 600 women opting for intrauterine contraceptive devices were randomized equally into two groups. Group 1 received the TCu380Ag device (Normal, Maxi, and Mini for uterocervical length 7-8.5 cm, 8-9 cm, and 6-7.5 cm, respectively) and Group 2 received the TCu380A device. Follow-up was performed at 5 years to assess efficacy, acceptability, and continuation. Frequency data comparisons was performed across categories using chi(2)/Fisher exact test. ResultsAt 5 years of use, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that TCu380Ag compared with TCu380A had a higher continuation rate (45% vs. 35%, P = 0.010) with 100% efficacy each. TCu380Ag had fewer side effects, including heavy menstrual bleeding (16.6% vs. 34.1%, P < 0.001), abdomen pain (12.1% vs. 23.0%, P = 0.001), and expulsions (4.4% vs. 8.7%, P < 0.050), and fewer discontinuations attributable to contraceptive side effects (42.7% vs. 56.9%, P = 0.012). The mini TCu380Ag had the highest continuation rates and least menstrual irregularity (P < 0.050). ConclusionsThe TCu380Ag device in three sizes is an alternative to TCu380A for women desiring 5 years of contraception with equal efficacy, better continuation, and acceptability. The mini size is preferred for women with a uterocervical length of 6 to 7.5 cm.

AB  - Fetal neural stem cells (FNSCs) present in the human fetal brain differentiate into cells of neuronal and glial lineages. The developing fetus is exposed to lower oxygen concentrations than adults, and this physiological hypoxia may influence the growth and differentiation of the FNSCs. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation potential of human FNSCs isolated from the subventricular zone of aborted fetal brains (n = 5). FNSCs were isolated, expanded, and characterized by Nestin and Sox2 expression using immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, respectively. These FNSCs were exposed to 20% oxygen (normoxia) and 0.2% oxygen (hypoxia) concentrations for 48 h, and hypoxia exposure (n = 5) was validated. Whole transcriptome analyses (Genespring GX13) of FNSCs exposed to hypoxia (Agilent 4 x 44 K human array slides) highlighted that genes associated with neurogenesis were enriched upon exposure to hypoxia. The pathway analysis of these enriched genes (using Metacore) showed the involvement of the WNT signaling pathway. Microarray analyses were validated using neuronal and glial lineage commitment markers, namely, NEUROG1, NEUROG2, ASCL1, DCX, GFAP, OLIG2, and NKX2.2, using qPCR (n = 9). DCX, ASCL1, NGN1, and GFAP protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting (n = 3). This demonstrated upregulation of the neuronal commitment markers upon hypoxia exposure, while no change was observed in astrocytic and oligodendrocyte lineage commitment markers. Increased expression of downstream targets of the WNT signaling pathway, TCF4 and ID2, by qPCR (n = 9) and increased protein expression of CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) and ID2 by Western blot (n = 3) indicated its involvement in mediating neuronal differentiation upon exposure to hypoxia.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are a set of progressive and currently incurable diseases that are primarily caused by neuron degeneration. Neurodegenerative diseases often lead to cognitive impairment and dyskinesias. It is now well recognized that molecular events precede the onset of clinical symptoms by years. Over the past decade, intensive research attempts have been aimed at the early diagnosis of these diseases. Recently, exosomes have been shown to play a pivotal role in the occurrence and progression of many diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, because exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier, they may serve as a diagnostic tool for neural dysfunction. In this review, we detail the mechanisms and current challenges of these diseases, briefly review the role of exosomes in the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and propose a novel strategy based on salivary neuronal exosomes and nanoparticle tracking analysis that could be employed for screening the early onset of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Obesity is a metabolic disease, which is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality, where therapeutic options are limited. Treatment of obesity is necessary as it is associated with fatal complications like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, and many more. Liraglutide (Lir), a synthetic analogue of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), is the FDA approved anti-obesity drug, however, its major limitation is its clinical application which needs frequent parenteral injections. To address the issue of regular injection, we have synthesized a fat fighting oral nano-formulation of liraglutide with a sustained release feature, which was evaluated against high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice. Experimental obesity was induced in mice by feeding HFD for 26 weeks. Lir nanoparticles (NP) were fabricated with chitosan via ion -gelation technique and were coated with Eudragit@S100 to protect the drug in harsh gastric conditions. Phys-iochemical characterization of Eu-Lir-Cs-NP demonstrated a small particle size of 253.1 +/- 1.21 nm with -9.74 % loading and -72.11 % encapsulation efficiency of the drug. In-vitro studies showed successful cellular uptake of NP in Caco-2 cells and were stable in various enteric fluid pH conditions. Eudragit@S100 coated chitosan NP were able to protect the drug from harsh gastric pH conditions with more than -74% of recovery. Treatment of two weeks of liraglutide Eu-Lir-Cs-NP (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, orally; twice daily) moderately reduces obesity in mice as evidenced by a reduction in the body weight, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum resistin and serum insulin level of mice. In addition, significant reduction of liver weight, abdominal white adipose tissue, and hepatic oxidative stress were noted. Our results suggest that chitosan-based NP of liraglutide can be an effective and convenient formulation for the management of obesity.

AB  - The mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) plays a vital role in altering the structure and function of mitochondria. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is a mitochondrial protein that regulates mtPTP function and a known drug target for therapeutic studies involving mitochondria. While the effect of aromatase inhibition on the mtPTP has been studied previously, the effect of anastrozole on the mtPTP has not been completely elucidated. The role of anastrozole in modulating the mtPTP was evaluated by docking, molecular dynamics and network-guided studies using human CypD data. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with mitochondrial disorders and healthy controls were treated with anastrozole and evaluated for mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mtPTP) function and apoptosis using a flow cytometer. Spectrophotometry was employed for estimating total ATP levels. The anastrozole-CypD complex is more stable than cyclosporin A (CsA)-CypD. Anastrozole performed better than cyclosporine in inhibiting mtPTP. Additional effects included inducing mitochondrial membrane depolarization and a reduction in mitochondrial swelling and superoxide generation, intrinsic caspase-3 activity and cellular apoptosis, along with an increase in ATP levels. Anastrozole may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for mitochondrial disorders and ameliorate the clinical phenotype by regulating the activity of mtPTP. However, further studies are required to substantiate our preliminary findings.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Introduction/BackgroundMultiple medical and surgical treatments have been described in the early stages of Avascular Necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head which delay the disease progression. Similarly, multiple studies, trials, reviews, and systematic reviews exist for the various treatments described and their outcomes but with no consensus over which is superior. So in this study, we reviewed the systematic reviews of all the conservative therapies for AVN of the femoral head systematically to identify a single or a combination of non-surgical treatment choices in the initial stages of the disease.MethodologyA thorough literature search has been carried out in January 2022 through the use of Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane electronic databases using PRISMA guidelines. The Mesh words and Keywords used were "femoral head AVN", "Conservative management", and "Systematic Reviews". The inclusion criteria used during the screening were, any systematic reviews which included patients with AVN either idiopathic or secondary, who are managed with conservative therapies like bisphosphonates, Hyper Baric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), Shock wave therapies like Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT), or electrical therapy like Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field (PEMF). The quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR-2 criteria.ResultsThe initial search yielded 364 studies which on screening based on our inclusion criteria finally resulted in seven systematic reviews to be included in the present study. There were two systematic reviews for Hyper Baric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT), two for Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT), one for electrical stimulation modalities like Pulsed Electro Magnetic Field (PEMF), and two for bisphosphonates. The follow-up of the patients in the included systematic reviews varied from 6 weeks to 10 years. The total number of patients varied from 77 to over 1000 across the systematic reviews. Almost all of the studies included a control group that either received the intended treatment with adjuncts or did not receive any treatment at all. Because of the heterogeneous nature of included articles in the systematic reviews, meta-analysis was performed in only three of the included systematic reviews.ConclusionOf all the modalities of treatment described, bisphosphonates are easily available and cost-effective and do not require any hospital resources/machinery for delivering the treatment. So they can be used as an initial line of treatment for patients with early stages of AVN (Ficat and Arlet 1-3) and based on the hospital availability of resources could be supplemented with any of the biophysical modalities (ESWT/PEMF/HBOT) for maximum efficacy to delay the disease progression.Level of Clinical EvidenceSystematic review.

AB  - BackgroundPeripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel. To date, there is no effective strategy to prevent paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. A recent small phase II study demonstrated the potential role of oral gabapentin in this setting. This phase III study is aimed to assess the efficacy of oral gabapentin in preventing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.ObjectiveTo compare the efficacy of oral gabapentin with placebo in preventing clinically significant peripheral neuropathy (NCI CTCAEv5.0 grade 2 or higher) in patients receiving paclitaxel.MethodsThis is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. The primary outcome is the development of grade 2 or higher chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Secondary outcomes include any grade neuropathy, the percentage change in sensory nerve conduction velocities in peripheral nerves, time to development of any grade neuropathy, paclitaxel dose reductions and delays due to peripheral neuropathy, patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, and adherence to oral therapy. A total of 136 patients receiving paclitaxel will be randomly allocated (stratified by weekly vs. non-weekly administration) to receive either oral gabapentin or placebo till three weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy or occurrence of the primary outcome.ConclusionThis study aims to find if oral gabapentin reduces the incidence of grade 2 or higher chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving paclitaxel.

KW  - Prohibition
AB  - Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act, 2016 was promulgated in the state and a complete prohibition on alcohol was declared within the state of Bihar. We aimed to assess the impact of the prohibition on extent and pattern of alcohol use in the state of Bihar using the National Family Health Survey data. We also compared the data from Bihar with the data for the whole country, its neighbouring states and the state of Gujarat. There was a 41.78% reduction in the proportion of men who reported alcohol use in Bihar. Among those who reported alcohol use proportion of those who used 'almost every day' reduced by 29.72%. There was a 69.56% reduction in the proportion of women in Bihar who reported alcohol use. There was a significant increase in proportion of men reporting use of tadi madi and country liquor. Since the prohibition of alcohol in the state of Bihar there has been a reduction in self-reported alcohol use among men and women. However, alcohol use continues to be reported in the state even after the prohibition. There are states in the country that have similar extent of alcohol use as compared to Bihar, despite lack of prohibition. This warrants a relook at the policy to address what the prohi-bition could not achieve.

AB  - BackgroundRapid conversion from prediabetes to diabetes and frequent postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is seen in Asian Indians. These should be the target of dietary strategies.ObjectivesWe hypothesized that dietary intervention of preloading major meals with almonds in participants with prediabetes will decrease overall glycemia and PPHG.DesignThe study included two phases: (1) an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)-based crossover randomized control study, the effect of a single premeal almond load (20 g) given before OGTT was evaluated (n = 60, 30 each period). (2) The continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)-based study for 3 days including premeal almond load before three major meals was a free-living, open-labeled, crossover randomized control trial, where control and premeal almond load diets were compared for glycaemic control (n = 60, 30 in each period). The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration no. NCT04769726).ResultsIn the OGTT-based study phase, the overall AUC for blood glucose, serum insulin, C-peptide, and plasma glucagon post-75 g oral glucose load was significantly lower for treatment vs. control diet (p < 0.001). Specifically, with the former diet, PPHG was significantly lower (18.05% in AUC on OGTT, 24.8% at 1-h, 28.9% at 2-h post OGTT, and 10.07% during CGMS). The CGMS data showed that premeal almond load significantly improved 24-glucose variability; SD of mean glucose concentration and mean of daily differences. Daily glycaemic control improved significantly as per the following: mean 24-h blood glucose concentration (M), time spent above 7.8 mmol/L of blood glucose, together with the corresponding AUC values. Premeal almond load significantly decreased following: overall hyperglycemia (glucose AUC), PPHG, peak 24-h glycaemia, and minimum glucose level during night.ConclusionIncorporation of 20 g of almonds, 30 min before each major meal led to a significant decrease in PPHG (as revealed in OGTT-based study phase) and also improved insulin, C-peptide, glucagon levels, and improved glucose variability and glycemic parameters on CGMS in participants with prediabetes.

AB  - Although the short-term results of targeted a-therapy (TAT) with 225Ac-DOTATATE in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) have proven the therapy to be effective, to our knowledge no one has assessed the long-term outcome results. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term outcome of 225Ac-DOTATATE TAT in patients with somatostatin receptor-expressing advanced-stage me-tastatic GEP-NETs. Methods: Patients with 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT scans showing moderate-to-high somatostatin receptor expression were recruited. Systemic TAT was performed on 91 adults with GEP-NETs (54 men and 37 women; mean age, 54.3 y; range, 25-75 y) using 225Ac-DOTATATE (100-120 kBq/kg of body weight). All patients were given capecitabine therapy as a radiosensitizer (2 g/d) from days 0 to 14 of every 225Ac-DOTATATE treatment cycle. Patients were catego-rized into 3 groups based on the status of prior 177Lu-peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT): a prior-177Lu-PRRT-refractory group; a prior-177Lu-PRRT disease-control group; and a 177Lu-PRRT-naive group. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), objective tumor response, clinical response, and assessment of treatment-related toxicities. Results: Among the 91 patients, 57 underwent prior 177Lu-DOTATATE therapy (24 with controlled disease [partial response/ stable disease] and 33 with progressive disease [PD]). In total, 453 225Ac-DOTATATE TAT cycles were administered (median, 4 cycles per patient; range, 1-10) in a median follow-up of 24 mo (range, 5- 41 mo). Median OS was not attained, with a 24-mo OS probability of 70.8%. In multivariate analysis, prognostic factors associated with a poor OS included the presence bone metastases (hazard ratio [HR], 2.501; 95% CI, 1.826-5.791; P < 0.032) and 225Ac-DOTATATE therapy-refractory disease (HR, 8.781; 95% CI, 3.843-20.062; P < 0.0001). Median PFS was also not reached, with a 24-mo PFS probabil-ity of 67.5%. The multivariate analysis revealed only 177Lu-PRRT- refractory disease to be significantly associated with a reduced PFS (HR, 14.338; 95% CI, 1.853-97.698; P = 0.011). Two of 79 patients (2.5%) with assessable disease experienced a complete response, 38 (48%) had a partial response, 23 (29%) had stable disease, and 16 (20.2%) had PD. PD was observed in more patients from the prior-177Lu-PRRT- refractory group (11/33, 34%) than in 177Lu-PRRT-naive patients (4/24, 11%; P = 0.056). Patients from the prior-177Lu-PRRT-refractory group had the highest risk of poor PFS (HR, 13.553; 95% CI, 4.343-42.271; P = 0.0009). A significant clinical benefit was achieved after 225Ac-DOTATATE therapy with minimal treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion: In long-term results, 225Ac-DOTATATE TAT showed promise and improved the OS, even in patients refractory to prior 177Lu-DOTATATE treatment, with transient and acceptable adverse effects.

AB  - Introduction:Bile duct injury (BDI) continues to occur despite technological advances and improvements in surgical training over the past 2 decades. This study was conducted to audit our data on laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed over the past 2 decades to determine the role of Critical View of Safety (CVS) and proctored preceptorship in preventing BDI and postoperative complications. Materials and Methods:All patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The data were obtained from a prospectively maintained database from January 2004 to December 2019. Proctored preceptorship was used in all cases. Intraoperative details included the number of patients where CVS was defined, number of BDI and conversions. Postoperative outcomes, including hospital stay, morbidity, and bile duct stricture, were noted. Results:Three thousand seven hundred twenty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Trainee surgeons performed 31.6% of surgeries and 9.5% of these surgeries were taken over by the senior surgeon. A CVS could be delineated in 96.6% of patients. The major BDI rate was only 0.05%. Conclusion:This study reiterates the fact that following the basic tenets of safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, defining and confirming CVS, and following proctored preceptorship are critical in preventing major BDI.

AB  - BackgroundGreater occipital nerve blockade for the prevention of chronic migraine has a limited evidence base. A robust randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is needed. MethodsThis double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, following a baseline period of four weeks, randomly assigned patients of chronic migraine 1:1 to receive four-weekly bilateral greater occipital nerve blockade with either 2 ml of 2% (40 mg) lidocaine (active group) or 2 ml of 0.9% saline (placebo) injections for 12 weeks. The primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints were a change from the baseline in the mean number of headache and migraine days and the achievement of >= 50% reduction in headache days from baseline across the weeks 9-12 respectively. Safety evaluations included the documentation and reporting of serious and other adverse events. ResultsTwenty-two patients each were randomly allocated to the active and placebo group. Baseline demography and clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups. Mean headache and migraine days at baseline (+/- SD) were 23.4 +/- 4.4 and 15.6 +/- 5.7 days in the active group and 22.6 +/- 5.0 and 14.6 +/- 4.6 days in the placebo group respectively. The active group compared to the placebo had a significantly greater least-squares mean reduction in the number of headache and migraine days (-4.2 days [95% CI: -7.5 to -0.8; p = 0.018] and -4.7 days [95%CI: -7.7 to -1.7; p = 0.003] respectively). 40.9% of patients in the active group achieved >= 50% reduction in headache days as compared with 9.1% of patients receiving a placebo (p = 0.024). Overall, 64 mild and transient adverse events were reported by 16 patients in the active group and 15 in the placebo. No death or serious adverse events were reported. ConclusionFour-weekly greater occipital nerve blockade with 2% lidocaine for 12 weeks was superior to placebo in decreasing the average number of headache and migraine days in patients with chronic migraine with a good tolerability profile.Clinical trial.gov no.

AB  - Purpose:To demonstrate the utility of operating on the temporal trabecular meshwork with in vivo-aqueous angiography demonstrating new aqueous outflow channels. Method:In a patient with primary open angle glaucoma, nuclear sclerosis, and medically uncontrolled intraocular pressure, Indocyanine green aqueous angiography (0.5%) was performed to visualize baseline functional aqueous outflow channels. This was followed by 30 degrees bent needle ab-interno goniectomy in the temporal quadrant, where no aqueous outflow channels were initially visualized. Aqueous angiography was repeated using 2% fluorescein to visualize aqueous outflow channels after bent needle ab-interno goniectomy. Results:Prebent needle ab-interno goniectomy, aqueous angiography revealed functional outflow channels in the nasal quadrant although none were visible in the temporal quadrant. Postbent needle ab-interno goniectomy in temporal quadrant aqueous angiography demonstrated 2 new aqueous outflow channels. Conclusion:In a patient with open angle glaucoma, following temporal quadrant ab-interno goniectomy, the recruitment of aqueous outflow channels was demonstrated using aqueous angiography.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the value of DTI in differen-tiation of renal allograft rejection from well-functioning stable allograft, using fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values.Methods: In this prospective study, 22 transplant recip-ients with well-functioning stable allograft (group A) and 20 patients with renal allograft rejection (group B + C) were recruited over a period of 19 months from January 2018 to July 2019. DTI- MRI was performed in all the patients, and FA and ADC values were measured in cortical and medullary regions of the transplanted kidney. On biopsy, graft rejection was classified as acute (group B) (n = 7) and chronic graft rejection (group C) (n = 13) based on the BANNF scoring system. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA v.14.0.Results: Statistically significant difference between group A and group B + C was noted for cortical (p < 0.001), and medullary (p = 0.003) FA values, and cortical (p = 0.020), and medullary (p = 0.046) ADC values. Cortical(p < 0.001) and Medullary(p = 0.020) FA values showed statistically significant difference between group A and group C, and cortical FA value(p = 0.012) also showed statistically significant difference between group B and group C. AUC (to differentiate between renal allograft rejection and well-functioning stable allograft) for cortical, and medullary FA values and cortical and medullary ADC values were 0.853(p < 0.001), 0.757(p = 0.004), 0.709(p = 0.021) and 0.736(p = 0.009), respectively.Conclusion and Advances in knowledge: DTI is a prom-ising functional MRI technique for the non-invasive assessment of renal allograft function. Diffusion param-eters, such as FA and ADC values, can be useful in the differentiation of renal allograft rejection from well -functioning stable allograft.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the per operative intra-ocular lens (IOL) power calculation using intra-operative aberrometry (ORA) and its comparison with conventional methods. Methods: Patients with cataract planned for phacoemulsification by a single surgeon under topical anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective observational study in this prospective observational study. All patients underwent pre-operative biometry (Manual SRK-II and IOLMaster (R) 500) to determine the intra-ocular lens (IOL) power. Intra-operative aberrometry using ORA was also performed; however, IOL was inserted according to IOLMaster (R) (SRK/T). Spherical equivalent (SE) was recorded on post-operative days 1, 7, and 30. Patients were divided into three groups based on axial lengths for analysis. Comparative analysis was performed for the calculated IOL powers and prediction errors of ORA with conventional methods. Adjusted IOL power to calculate the emmetropic IOL using the LiHue formula was also determined and was compared with existing methods. A P -value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 115 eyes from 113 patients were included, with a median age of 54.90 +/- 14.3 years. The mean axial length was found to be 23.94 +/- 2.3 mm. There was good agreement (87%) between ORA and IOLMaster (R) for calculated IOL powers with a mean difference of 0.047 +/- 0.5D between the two (P = 0.33). A positive correlation was found between IOL power calculated using ORA, IOLMaster (R), SRK-II, and adjusted IOL. Conclusion: The use of intra-operative aberrometry (ORA) to calculate IOL power in patients undergoing uncomplicated phacoemulsification is non-inferior relative to standard pre-operative measurement and planning.

AB  - Background & objectives: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important screening tool for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Accessibility to CXR facilities in difficult-to-reach and underserved populations is a challenge. This can potentially be overcome by deploying digital X-ray machines that are portable. However, these portable X-ray machines need to be validated before their deployment in the field. Here, we compare the image quality of CXR taken by a newly developed handheld X-ray machine with routinely used reference digital X-ray machine through the conduct of a feasibility study.
   Methods: A total of 100 participants with suspected pulmonary TB were recruited from the outpatient departments of a medical college and a community health centre in Agra. Each participant underwent CXR twice, once with each machine. Both sets of de-identified images were independently read by two radiologists, who were blinded to the type of X-ray machine used. The primary outcome was agreement between image qualities produced by these two machines.
   Results: The intra-observer (radiologist) agreements regarding the status of the 15 CXR parameters ranged between 74 per cent and 100 per cent, with an unweighted mean of 87.2 per cent (95% confidence interval: 71.5-100). The median Cohen's kappa values for intra-observer agreement were 0.62 and 0.67 for radiologists 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, on comparison of the overall median score of quality of the image, the handheld machine images had a higher score for image quality.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The current study shows that a handheld X-ray machine, which is easy to use and can potentially be carried to any area, produces X-ray images with quality that is comparable to digital X-ray machines routinely used in health facilities.

AB  - Basal ganglia calcification (BGC) is a common complication in hypoparathyroid patients, linked to hyperphosphatemia and altered vitamin-D and calcium homeostasis following conventional therapy. The pathogenesis of BGC in hypoparathyroidism is not clear. Recently, we developed an ex vivo model of BGC using rat-striatal cell culture in 10.0 mmol/L of beta-glycerophosphate (31.8 mg/dL phosphate). However, the effect of 1,25(OH)(2) D, calcium, and milder phosphate excess on BGC in hypoparathyroidism is not known. This study describes two modified ex vivo models investigating pathogenesis of BGC in 'drug-naive' and 'conventionally treated' hypoparathyroid state. The first modification involved striatal cells cultured in low concentration 1,25(OH)(2)D (16.0 pg/mL), ionized calcium(0.99 mmol/L), hPTH((1-34)) (6.0 pg/mL), and 2.68 mmol/L (8.3 mg/dL) of phosphate akin to 'drug-naive' state for 24 days. In second modification, striatal cells were exposed to 46.0 pg/mL of 1,25(OH)(2)D, normal ionized calcium of 1.17 mmol/L, and 2.20 mmol/L (6.8 mg/dL) of phosphate akin to 'conventionally treated' state. Striatal cell culture under 'drug-naive' state showed that even 16.0 pg/mL of 1,25(OH)(2)D enhanced the calcification. In 'conventionally treated' model, striatal cell calcification was enhanced in 54% cases over 'drug-naive' state. Calcification in 'conventionally treated' state further increased on increasing phosphate to 8.3 mg/dL, suggesting importance of phosphatemic control in hypoparathyroid patients. Striatal cells in 'drug-naive' state showed increased mRNA expression of pro-osteogenic Wnt3a, Cd133,Vglut-1-neuronal phosphate-transporters, calcium-ion channel-Trvp2,Alp, and Collagen-1 alpha and decreased expression of Ca-II. These models suggest that in 'drug-naive' state, 1,25(OH)(2)D along with moderately elevated phosphate increases the expression of pro-osteogenic molecules to induce BGC. Although normalization of calcium in 'conventionally treated' state increased the expression of Opg, Osterix, Alp, and Cav2, calcification increased only in a subset, akin to variation in progression of BGC in hypoparathyroid patients on conventional therapy.

AB  - Thyroid cancer is very rare in children. I-131 therapy after thyroidectomy is established in pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Pediatric DTC guideline is silent on the optimum amount of I-131 that could be safely and effectively administered to children who are more radiosensitive. Like adult DTC, children are also given I-131 therapy empirically based either on age or body weight. Pediatric DTC guideline recommends that patient-specific dosimetry is important in children. Still, due to the low incidence rate and the practical difficulties of dosimetry, it has neither been established nor adopted in routine practice. This review article aims to discuss current approaches of I-131 therapy in children and young adult patients with DTC and dosimetric data obtained by several investigators. Efforts are required to simplify dosimetric procedures and precise results, especially in determining lesion size. We prefer 3-dimensional dosimetry over planar dosimetry, where lesion size could be measured accurately. I-124 PET/CT-based dosimetry is expected to give accurate dosimetric results. The most challenging aspect is that no randomized controlled trials are available to compare the empiric I-131 therapy results versus dosimetry-based treatment outcomes in children and young adults. Suppose dosimetry-based I-131 therapy could be shown to have better outcomes, namely, successful ablation rate, better disease-free survival, and lesser treatment-emergent adverse events than empirical I-131 treatment. In that case, one can argue in favor of the former. Unfortunately, no convincing study is currently available. Thus, there is a need for a randomized control trial to settle this issue.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) for the treatment of fungal keratitis. Methods: Patients with fungal keratitis confirmed by potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear and/ or confocal microscopy were administered topical L-AMB and randomized into three groups treated with three different formulations. The medication was administered two hourly till clinical improvement was achieved, followed by six hourly till complete resolution. The outcome measures were time to clinical improvement, resolution of epithelial defect, stromal infiltrate, hypopyon, extent and density of corneal opacity, neovascularization, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months. Results: Mean age of the patients was 46.6 +/- 14.8 years, and trauma with vegetative matter was the most common predisposing factor. Aspergillus flavus (36%) was the most common fungus cultured, followed by Fusarium (23%). Mean time to clinical improvement, time to resolution of epithelial defect, mean time to resolution of infiltrate, and time to resolution of hypopyon were 3.45 +/- 1.38, 25.35 +/- 8.46, 37.97 +/- 9.94, and 13.33 +/- 4.90 days, respectively, and they were comparable among the three groups. There was a significant difference between treatment failure and success cases in terms of days of presentation (P < 0.01), size of the epithelial defect (P-value 0.04), and infiltrate size at presentation (P-value 0.04). At 3 months follow-up, no statistically significant difference was noted in BCVA and mean scar size among groups. Conclusion: L-AMB in a gel form is an effective antifungal agent that promotes the healing of fungal ulcers with notably least vascularization and better tolerance.

AB  - Sympatico-vagal balance is essential for regulating cardiac electrophysiology and plays an important role in arrhythmogenic conditions. Various noninvasive methods, including electrocardiography (ECG), have been used for clinical assessment of the sympatico-vagal balance. This study aimed to use a custom-designed wearable device to record ECG and ECG-based cardiac function biomarkers to assess sympatico-vagal balance during tonic pain in healthy controls. Nineteen healthy volunteers were included for the ECG measurements using the custom-designed amplifier based on the Texas Instruments ADS1299. The ECG-based biomarkers of the sympatico-vagal balance, (including heart rate variability, deceleration capacity of the heart rate, and periodic repolarization dynamic), were calculated and compared between resting and pain conditions (tonic pain). The custom-designed device provided technically satisfactory ECG recordings. During exposure to tonic pain, the periodic repolarization dynamics increased significantly (p = 0.02), indicating enhancement of sympathetic nervous activity. This study showed that custom-designed wearable devices can potentially be useful in healthcare as a new telemetry technology. The ECG-based novel biomarkers, including periodic repolarization dynamic and deceleration capacity of heart rate, can be used to identify the cold pressor-induced activation of sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, making it useful for future studies on pain-evoked biomarkers.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to assess the impact of multiple COVID-19 waves on gynaecological cancer services across the UK. A survey was sent to staff in UK cancer hospitals after the first wave in 2020, and this was repeated for the second and third waves in 2021 and 2022. This showed that referrals halved during the first wave, and half of hospitals reported reduced staffing. The number of operations performed substantially fell, with many being postponed. Many hospital meetings and appointments were conducted by videoconferencing or telephone rather than in-person. By the second wave, referrals were at normal levels, with fewer reductions in staffing, operations, and other services. By the third wave, there were worse staffing reductions, similar to 2020, despite normal workloads. Our analysis shows the major impact of COVID-19 on gynaecological cancer services, highlights serious staffing shortages, and gives insights into the adaptations needed in the future. Background: This study aimed to assess the impact of multiple COVID-19 waves on UK gynaecological-oncology services. Methods: An online survey was distributed to all UK-British-Gynaecological-Cancer-Society members during three COVID-19 waves from 2020 to2022. Results: In total, 51 hospitals (including 32 cancer centres) responded to Survey 1, 42 hospitals (29 centres) to Survey 2, and 39 hospitals (30 centres) to Survey 3. During the first wave, urgent referrals reportedly fell by a median of 50% (IQR = 25-70%). In total, 49% hospitals reported reduced staffing, and the greatest was noted for trainee doctors, by a median of 40%. Theatre capacity was reduced by a median of 40%. A median of 30% of planned operations was postponed. Multidisciplinary meetings were completely virtual in 39% and mixed in 65% of the total. A median of 75% of outpatient consultations were remote. By the second wave, fewer hospitals reported staffing reductions, and there was a return to pre-pandemic urgent referrals and multidisciplinary workloads. Theatre capacity was reduced by a median of 10%, with 5% of operations postponed. The third wave demonstrated worsening staff reductions similar to Wave 1, primarily from sickness. Pre-pandemic levels of urgent referrals/workload continued, with little reduction in surgical capacity. Conclusion: COVID-19 led to a significant disruption of gynaecological-cancer care across the UK, including reduced staffing, urgent referrals, theatre capacity, and working practice changes. Whilst disruption eased and referrals/workloads returned to normal, significant staff shortages remained in 2022, highlighting persistent capacity constraints.

AB  - Currently, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) have emerged as potential risks for humans due to adopting a sedentary lifestyle and inaccurate diagnoses. The early detection of NCDs using point-of-care technologies significantly decreases the burden and will be poised to transform clinical intervention and healthcare provision. An imbalance in the levels of circulating cell-free microRNAs (ccf-miRNA) has manifested in NCDs, which are passively released into the bloodstream or actively produced from cells, improving the efficacy of disease screening and providing enormous sensing potential. The effective sensing of ccf-miRNA continues to be a significant technical challenge, even though sophisticated equipment is needed to analyze readouts and expression patterns. Nanomaterials have come to light as a potential solution as they provide significant advantages over other widely used diagnostic techniques to measure miRNAs. Particularly, CNDs-based fluorescence nano-biosensors are of great interest. Owing to the excellent fluorescence characteristics of CNDs, developing such sensors for ccf-microRNAs has been much more accessible. Here, we have critically examined recent advancements in fluorescence-based CNDs biosensors, including tools and techniques used for manufacturing these biosensors. Green synthesis methods for scaling up high-quality, fluorescent CNDs from a natural source are discussed. The various surface modifications that help attach biomolecules to CNDs utilizing covalent conjugation techniques for multiple applications, including self-assembly, sensing, and imaging, are analyzed. The current review will be of particular interest to researchers interested in fluorescence-based biosensors, materials chemistry, nanomedicine, and related fields, as we focus on CNDs-based nano-biosensors for ccf-miRNAs detection applications in the medical field.

AB  - Chronic inflammation in the gallbladder leading to persistent epithelium damage promotes invasive cancer. The study aimed to assess the prognostic value of PDL1 and CA19-9 markers in cancer/inflammatory lesions of the gallbladder. A total of 29 cases (19 cancer and 10 inflammatory) were included. The PDL1 protein concentration level and mRNA expression were assessed in the tissues' lysates by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. PDL1 and CA19-9 concentration levels were compared and statistically related with clinico-pathological variables. The PDL1 protein level and its relative mRNA expression were correlated. Kaplan-Meir survival and Cox regression analyses were conducted for predicting prognosis. This study investigated the PDL1 and CA19-9 marker expression in both cancer and inflammatory cases of the gallbladder (p = 0.48 and p = 0.17 respectively). PDL1 protein expression was significantly associated with the hormonal profile of the cases (p = 0.04) at an optimum cut-off value of 13 pg/mL, while the CA19-9 marker expression was correlated with the status of liver metastasis (p = 0.0043) and size of the tumor (p = 0.004). A low PDL1 concentration was found when compared to the CA19-9 level among cancer cases (p = 0.12) and proportional in the inflammatory lesions (p = 0.63). A significant positive correlation was found between the PDL1 protein and its relative mRNA expressions in the inflammatory lesions (p = 0.029) when compared to cancer cases (p = 0.069). Our results showed that a protein-based assay for PDL1 expression would be more sensitive compared to RNA based assays for GBC risk stratifications. Overall survival was predicted with CA19-9 and PDL1 levels (p = 0.0074, p = 0.23, respectively). PDL1 and CA19-9 may act as a probable predictor of a poor prognosis in gallbladder cancer (GBC) cases.

AB  - Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths among women. Despite advances in the treatment regimes, a high rate of diagnosis in the advanced stage makes it almost an incurable malignancy. Thus, more research efforts are required to identify potential molecular markers for early detection of the disease and therapeutic targets to augment the survival rate of ovarian cancer patients. Previously, in this context, we identified dysregulated expression of multimerin 1 (MMRN1) in ovarian cancer. To elucidate the relationship between MMRN1 expression and ovarian cancer progression, siRNA-based MMRN1 knockdown was employed and various cell assays were performed to study its effect on ovarian cancer cells. In addition, network of dysregulated proteins was identified by quantitative proteomics and associated pathways were explored by bioinformatics analysis. MMRN1 silencing showed a significant reduction in cell viability, adhesion, migration, and invasion and a high frequency of cell apoptosis. Label-free quantitative proteomics and in-depth statistical analysis identified 448 dysregulated proteins, majority of which were overexpressed in MMRN1 knockdown cells. The pathways overrepresented in ovarian cancer were DNA replication, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and cell cycle regulation. Conclusively, the findings of this study suggest that MMRN1 aids in the progression of ovarian cancer via modulation of DNA damage response and repair pathways.

AB  - Objective: To assess changes in profile of psychiatric emergencies in children and adolescents (aged <19 year) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic compared to pre-pandemic period. Methods: The psychiatric emergency records were analyzed for the period of April, 2019 - September, 2021 to assess the pattern and profile of mental health emergencies in children and adolescents in the period before and after the onset of the pandemic lockdown (i.e., 23 March, 2020). Results: 379 consecutive child and adolescent psychiatric emergencies were identified, of which 219 were seen after the onset of pandemic. Commonest reason for referral in the pandemic group was attempted self-harm (44.3%). The ICD-10 neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders constituted the commonest diagnostic category, similar to pre-pandemic period. A significantly higher proportion (44% vs 28%) of children was prescribed benzodiazepines in the pandemic period, compared to the pre-pandemic period. Conclusion: The average monthly psychiatric emergencies in children and adolescents showed no increase during the pandemic period. Self-harm was the commonest cause of psychiatric referral in emergency services mental health crisis in the younger population.

AB  - Background & objectives: Female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) is an important variety of extrapulmonary TB causing significant morbidity, especially infertility, in developing countries like India. The aim of this study was to evaluate the laparoscopic findings of the FGTB.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study on 374 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy performed on FGTB cases with infertility. All patients underwent history taking and clinical examination and endometrial sampling/biopsy for acid-fast bacilli, microscopy, culture, PCR, GeneXpert (only last 167 cases) and histopathological evidence of epithelioid granuloma. Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed in all the cases to evaluate the findings of FGTB.
   Results: Mean age, parity, body mass index and duration of infertility were 27.5 yr, 0.29, 22.6 kg/m(2) and 3.78 years, respectively. Primary infertility was found in 81 per cent and secondary infertility in 18.18 per cent of cases. Endometrial biopsy was positive for AFB microscopy in 4.8 per cent, culture in 6.4 per cent and epithelioid granuloma in 15.5 per cent. Positive peritoneal biopsy granuloma was seen in 5.88 per cent, PCR in 314 (83.95%) and GeneXpert in 31 (18.56%, out of last 167 cases) cases. Definite findings of FGTB were seen in 164 (43.86%) cases with beaded tubes (12.29%), tubercles (32.88%) and caseous nodules (14.96%). Probable findings of FGTB were seen in 210 (56.14%) cases with pelvic adhesions (23.52%), perihepatic adhesions (47.86%), shaggy areas (11.7%), pelvic adhesions (11.71%), encysted ascites (10.42%) and frozen pelvis in 3.7 per cent of cases.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The finding of this study suggests that laparoscopy is a useful modality to diagnose FGTB with a higher pickup rate of cases. Hence it should be included as a part of composite reference standard.

AB  - Aim Metalloenzymes produced by gut microbiota play an essential role in various physiological processes, and maintains homeostasis of gastrointestinal tract. Our study includes functional analysis of microbial metalloenzymes using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics data from Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiomics Database. Methods and results The distance matrix calculated by using metalloenzymes data produced significant results for bacterial taxonomy, with higher variance compared to HMP analysis in both Western and Indian population. Differential gene expression analysis revealed altered expression of ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated enzymes, increased folds changes in Prevotella and Megamonas transcripts; whereas, low transcripts of Alistipes genera. Further, docking and simulation studies performed on screened UC-associated enzymes revealed changes in catalytic efficiency and ligand interacting residues. Conclusion The beta-diversity using microbes containing metalloenzymes suggests considering small group of specific genes or enzymes for understanding the diversity between UC and healthy individuals. The docking and differential gene expression analysis collectively indicate the probable role of metalloenzymes and few UC-associated enzymes in the severity of UC.

AB  - Previously, we reported that an inverse agonist of estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERR gamma), GSK5182, enhances sodium iodide (Na+/I-) symporter (NIS) function through mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. This finding helped us to further investigate the effects of GSK5182 on NIS function in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Herein, we report the effects of ERR gamma on the regulation of NIS function in RAI-resistant PTC cells using GSK5182. RAI-refractory BCPAP cells were treated with GK5182 for 24 h at various concentrations, and radioiodine avidity was determined with or without potassium perchlorate (KClO4) as an NIS inhibitor. We explored the effects of GSK5182 on ERR gamma, the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, and iodide metabolism-related genes. We examined whether the MAP pathway affected GSK5182-mediated NIS function using U0126, a selective MEK inhibitor. A clonogenic assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of I-131. GSK5182 induced an increase in radioiodine avidity in a dose-dependent manner, and the enhanced uptake was completely inhibited by KClO4 in BCPAP cells. We found that ERR gamma was downregulated and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 was upregulated in BCPAP cells, with an increase in total and membranous NIS and iodide metabolism-related genes. MEK inhibitors reversed the increase in radioiodine avidity induced by GSK5182. Clonogenic examination revealed the lowest survival in cells treated with a combination of GSK5182 and I-131 compared to those treated with either GSK518 or I-131 alone. We demonstrate that an inverse agonist of ERR gamma, GSK5182, enhances the function of NIS protein via the modulation of ERR gamma and MAP kinase signaling, thereby leading to increased responsiveness to radioiodine in RAI-refractory papillary thyroid cancer cells.

TI  - Study protocol for economic evaluation of probiotic intervention for prevention of neonatal sepsis in 0-2-month old low-birth weight infants in India: the ProSPoNS trial
T2  - BMJ OPEN
KW  - neonatal intensive & critical care
KW  - health economics

AB  - Introduction The ProSPoNS trial is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the role of probiotics in prevention of neonatal sepsis. The present protocol describes the data and methodology for the cost utility of the probiotic intervention alongside the controlled trial. Methods and analysis A societal perspective will be adopted in the economic evaluation. Direct medical and non-medical costs associated with neonatal sepsis and its treatment would be ascertained in both the intervention and the control arm. Intervention costs will be facilitated through primary data collection and programme budgetary records. Treatment cost for neonatal sepsis and associated conditions will be accessed from Indian national costing database estimating healthcare system costs. A cost-utility design will be employed with outcome as incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year averted. Considering a time-horizon of 6 months, trial estimates will be extrapolated to model the cost and consequences among high-risk neonatal population in India. A discount rate of 3% will be used. Impact of uncertainties present in analysis will be addressed through both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Ethics and dissemination Has been obtained from EC of the six participating sites (MGIMS Wardha, KEM Pune, JIPMER Puducherry, AIPH, Bhubaneswar, LHMC New Delhi, SMC Meerut) as well as from the ERC of LSTM, UK. A peer-reviewed article will be published after completion of the study. Findings will be disseminated to the community of the study sites, with academic bodies and policymakers. Registration The protocol has been approved by the regulatory authority (Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation; CDSCO) in India (CT-NOC No. CT/NOC/17/2019 dated 1 March 2019). The ProSPoNS trial is registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI). Registered on 16 May 2019. Trial registration number CTRI/2019/05/019197; Clinical Trial Registry.

AB  - In humans, the gut microbiota (GM) are known to play a significant role in the metabolism of nutrients and drugs, immunomodulation, and pathogen defense by inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The role of the GM in the gut-brain axis (GBA) has been documented for different regulatory mechanisms and associated pathways and it shows different behaviors with individualized bacteria. In addition, the GM are known as susceptibility factor for neurological disorders in the central nervous system (CNS), regulating disease progression and being amenable to intervention. Bidirectional transmission between the brain and the GM occurs in the GBA, implying that it performs a significant role in neurocrine, endocrine, and immune-mediated signaling pathways. The GM regulates multiple neurological disorders by supplementing them with prebiotics, probiotics, postbiotics, synbiotics, fecal transplantations, and/or antibiotics. A well-balanced diet is critically important for establishing healthy GM, which can alter the enteric nervous system (ENS) and regulate multiple neurological disorders. Here, we have discussed the function of the GM in the GBA from the gut to the brain and the brain to the gut, the pathways associated with neurology that interacts with the GM, and the various neurological disorders associated with the GM. Furthermore, we have highlighted the recent advances and future prospects of the GBA, which may require addressing research concerns about GM and associated neurological disorders.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to assess the association of blood donor variables on the outcome of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Study design and methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients who had cardiac surgery between January 2018 and December 2020. Blood donor characteristics such as age (<= or >30 years), sex, and body mass index (BMI) (< or >25 kg/m2) were analyzed for association with patient outcomes (length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission). Sex matching was done as fully match, fully mismatch, and partial mismatch. Cox regression and Linear regression models were used to study the association with mortality and readmission, and LOS.Results: During the study period, 5788 patients had cardiac surgery; receiving a total of 20,348 red cell units. Of which, 522 (9%) died, 531 (9.2%) re-admitted and median LOS was 11 days (IQR 7-18). BMI >25 kg/m2 (b, 2.96; p = 0.000), female to male transfusion (partial mismatch: b, 4.42; p = 0.001; fully mismatch: b, 9.0; p = 0.02) negatively affected LOS. BMI >25 kg/m2 (HR, 2.07; p = 0.00) and partial mismatch transfusion to male patients (HR, 1.60; p = 0.01) increased mortality. Fully mismatch transfusion to female patients (HR, 1.24; p = 0.01) and partial mismatch to male patients (HR, 1.86; p = 0.01) increased readmission. No association of donor age on patient outcome was observed.Discussion: Blood donor sex, and BMI can influence mortality and LOS in cardiac surgery patients. The use of computer tools to match the patient's and donor's characteristics can assist to eliminate these types of adverse consequences. (c) 2022 Societe francaise de transfusion sanguine (SFTS).

AB  - BackgroundType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a common chronic health condition, has major health and socioeconomic consequences. In the Indian subcontinent, it is a health condition for which individuals commonly consult Ayurvedic (traditional medical system) practitioners and use their medicines. However, to date, a good quality T2DM clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners, grounded on the best available scientific evidence, is not available. Therefore, the study aimed to systematically develop a clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners to manage T2DM in adults. MethodsThe development work was guided by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) manual for developing guidelines, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. First, a comprehensive systematic review was conducted which evaluated Ayurvedic medicines' effectiveness and safety in managing T2DM. In addition, the GRADE approach was used for assessing the certainty of the findings. Next, using the GRADE approach, the Evidence-to-Decision framework was developed, and we focused on glycemic control and adverse events. Subsequently, based on the Evidence-to-Decision framework, a Guideline Development Group of 17 international members made recommendations on Ayurvedic medicines' effectiveness and safety in T2DM. These recommendations formed the basis of the clinical guideline, and additional generic content and recommendations were adapted from the T2DM Clinical Knowledge Summaries of the Clarity Informatics (UK). The feedback given by the Guideline Development Group on the draft version was used to amend and finalize the clinical guideline. ResultsA clinical guideline for managing T2DM in adults by Ayurvedic practitioners was developed, which focuses on how practitioners can provide appropriate care, education, and support for people with T2DM (and their carers and family). The clinical guideline provides information on T2DM, such as its definition, risk factors, prevalence, prognosis, and complications; how it should be diagnosed and managed through lifestyle changes like diet and physical activity and Ayurvedic medicines; how the acute and chronic complications of T2DM should be detected and managed (including referral to specialists); and advice on topics like driving, work, and fasting including during religious/socio-cultural festivals. ConclusionWe systematically developed a clinical guideline for Ayurvedic practitioners to manage T2DM in adults.

AB  - Shock in children is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, particularly in resource-limited settings. The principles of management include early recognition, fluid resuscitation, appropriate inotropes, antibiotic therapy in sepsis, supportive therapy for organ dysfunction, and regular hemodynamic monitoring. During the past decade, each step has undergone several changes and evolved as evidence that has been translated into recommendations and practice. There is a paradigm shift from protocolized-based care to personalized management, from liberal strategies to restrictive strategies in terms of fluids, blood transfusion, ventilation, and antibiotics, and from clinical monitoring to multimodal monitoring using bedside technologies. However, uncertainties are still prevailing in terms of the volume of fluids, use of steroids, and use of extracorporeal and newer therapies while managing shock. These changes have been summarized along with evidence in this article with the aim of adopting an evidence-based approach while managing children with shock.

AB  - Seasonal influenza epidemics cause significant pediatric mortality and morbidity worldwide. Live atten-uated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) can be administered intranasally, induce a broad and robust immune response, demonstrate higher yields during manufacturing as compared to inactivated influenza vaccines (IIVs), and thereby represent an attractive possibility for young children in developing countries. We summarize recent pediatric studies evaluating LAIV efficacy in developing countries where a large pro-portion of the influenza-virus-associated respiratory disease burden occurs. Recently, two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV in children reported contradictory results; vaccine efficacy varied between Bangladesh (41 %) and Senegal (0.0 %) against all influenza viral strains. Prior to 2013, Ann Arbor-based LAIV demonstrated superior efficacy as compared to IIV. However, due to low effectiveness of the Ann Arbor-based LAIV against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-like viruses, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended against the use of LAIV during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 influenza seasons. Reduced replicative fitness of the A(H1N1)pdm09 LAIV strains is thought to have led to the low effectiveness of the Ann-Arbor-based LAIV. Once the A(H1N1) pdm09 component was updated, the ACIP reintroduced the Ann-Arbor-based LAIV as a vaccine choice for the 2018-19 influenza season. In 2021, results from a 2-year RCT evaluating the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIV in rural north India reported that LAIV demonstrated significantly lower efficacy compared to IIV, but in Year 2, the vaccine efficacy for LAIV and IIV was comparable. A profounder understanding of the mechanisms underlying varied efficacy of LAIV in developing countries is warranted. Assessing replicative fitness, in addition to antigenicity, when selecting annual A(H1N1)pdm09 components in the Russian-backbone trivalent LAIVs is essential and may ultimately, enable widespread utility in resource-poor settings.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common endocrine disorder. Interestingly, the majority (75%) of parathyroid tumors are localized to the inferior parathyroid glands. To date, the reason for this natural bias has not been investigated. We assessed the global gene expression profile of superior and inferior glands obtained from forensic autopsies. The genes with significant differential expression between superior and inferior parathyroids were further assessed by RT-PCR in 19 pairs. As an iterative approach, additional genes with an established role in parathyroid disorders, i.e., CASR, MAFB, PAX9, TBCE, TBX1, VDR, MEN1, CCND1, and CDC73 were also evaluated by RT-PCR in all 19 pairs of superior and inferior parathyroid glands. Seven homeobox genes, namely HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXBAS3, HOXB4, HOXB6, HOXB9, IRX1, and one encoding for ALDH1A2 showed a lower expression in the inferior parathyroid glands than in the superior. Conversely, SLC6A1 showed a higher expression in the inferior glands. Of the nine genes with significant differential mRNA expression among superior and inferior glands HOXB9, HOXB4 and IRX1 could be detected by western blotting/mass spectrometry. The study is the first to show the differential expression of nine genes HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXBAS3, HOXB4, HOXB6, HOXB9, IRX1, ALDH1A2, and SLC6A1 in inferior versus the superior parathyroid glands. This could have potential implications for the preferential localization of parathyroid tumors to the inferior parathyroid glands as observed in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

AB  - IntroductionTraditional methods of prosthesis fabrication are not efficient and user centric and are made for common purposes without focusing on individual demands of user which leads to rejection of prosthesis for long-term use. Utilizing advanced additive manufacturing techniques for fabrication of prosthesis makes the development process user centric and covers all the user demands thus providing better fit, comfort, and more stable gait rehabilitation for the user.Areas coveredThe articles reporting fabrication of lower limb prosthesis and its socket are included in the study. Standard fabrication and additive manufacturing method are both systematically assessed by the reviewers. The review also covers the advanced methods of additive manufacturing that are presently being used for fabrication of rehabilitation devices.Expert opinionAdditive manufacturing method of fabrication of prosthesis provides more flexibility for manufacturing prosthesis parts as per demand of the user. The fabrication method takes into account the residual limb and thus makes the prosthesis user-specific providing better comfort and fit.

AB  - Background: The emergence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a global pandemic has resulted in the loss of many lives and a significant decline in global economic losses. Thus, for a large country like India, there is a need to comprehend the dynamics of COVID-19 in a clustered way.
   Objective: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 according to age, gender, and preexisting comorbidity. Patients with COVID-19 were categorized according to comorbidity, and the data over a 2-year period (1 January 2020 to 31 January 2022) were considered to analyze the impact of comorbidity on severe COVID-19 outcomes.
   Methods: For di erent age/ gender groups, the distribution of COVID-19 positive, hospitalized, and mortality cases was estimated. The impact of comorbidity was assessed by computing incidence rate (IR), odds ratio (OR), and proportion analysis.
   Results: The results indicated that COVID-19 caused an exponential growth in mortality. In patients over the age of 50, the mortality rate was found to be very high, similar to 80%. Moreover, based on the estimation ofOR, it can be inferred that age and various preexisting comorbidities were found to be predictors of severe COVID-19 outcomes. The strongest risk factors for COVID-19 mortality were preexisting comorbidities like diabetes (OR: 2.39; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.31-2.47; p < 0.0001), hypertension (OR: 2.31; 95% CI: 2.23-2.39; p < 0.0001), and heart disease (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 2.08-2.30; p < 0.0001). The proportion of fatal cases among patients positive for COVID-19 increased with the number of comorbidities.
   Conclusion: This study concluded that elderly patients with preexisting comorbidities were at an increased risk of COVID-19 mortality. Patients in the elderly age group with underlying medical conditions are recommended for preventive medical care or medical resources and vaccination against COVID-19

AB  - BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) considerably increases the risk of short-term mortality in acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) but predicting AKI is not possible with existing tools. Our study aimed at de novo discovery of AKI biomarkers in ACLF. MethodsThis observational study had two phases- (A) Discovery phase in which quantitative proteomics was carried-out with day-of-admission plasma from ACLF patients who initially had no-AKI but either progressed to AKI (n=10) or did not (n=9) within 7 days of admission and, (B) Validation phase in which selected biomarkers from the discovery phase were validated by ELISA in a larger set of ACLF plasma samples (n=93) followed by sub-group analyses. ResultsPlasma proteomics revealed 56 differentially expressed proteins in ACLF patients who progressed to AKI vs those who did not. The metallothionein protein-family was upregulated in patients who progressed to AKI and was validated by ELISA as significantly elevated in both- (i) ACLF-AKI vs no-AKI (p-value <= 0.0001) and (ii) progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI (p-value <= 0.001). AUROC for AKI vs no-AKI was 0.786 (p-value <= 0.001) and for progression to AKI vs no-progression to AKI was 0.7888 (p-value <= 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that ACLF patients with plasma MT concentration >5.83 ng/mL had a high probability of developing AKI by day 7 (p-value <= 0.0001). High expression of metallothionein genes was found in post-mortem liver biopsies of ACLF patients. ConclusionDay-of-admission measurements of plasma metallothionein can act as predictive biomarkers of AKI in ACLF.

AB  - Background India contributes 15% of the total global maternal mortality burden. An increasing proportion of these deaths are due to Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH), Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), and anaemia. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet-based electronic decision-support system (EDSS) to enhance routine antenatal care (ANC) and improve the screening and management of PIH, GDM, and anaemia in pregnancy in primary healthcare facilities of Telangana, India. The EDSS will work at two levels of primary health facilities and is customized for three cadres of healthcare providers - Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes (ANMs), staff nurses, and physicians (Medical Officers).Methods This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 66 clusters with a total of 1320 women in both the intervention and control arms. Each cluster will include three health facilities-one Primary Health Centre (PHC) and two linked sub-centers (SC). In the facilities under the intervention arm, ANMs, staff nurses, and Medical Officers will use the EDSS while providing ANC for all pregnant women. Facilities in the control arm will continue to provide ANC services using the existing standard of care in Telangana. The primary outcome is ANC quality, measured as provision of a composite of four selected ANC components (measurement of blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin levels, and conducting a urinary dipstick test) by the healthcare providers per visit, observed over two visits. Trained field research staff will collect outcome data via an observation checklist.Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first trial in India to evaluate an EDSS, targeted to enhance the quality of ANC and improve the screening and management of PIH, GDM, and anaemia, for multiple levels of health facilities and several cadres of healthcare providers. If effective, insights from the trial on the feasibility and cost of implementing the EDSS can inform potential national scale-up. Lessons learned from this trial will also inform recommendations for designing and upscaling similar mHealth interventions in other low and middle-income countries.Trial Registration.ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03700034, registered 9 Oct 2018,CTRI, CTRI/2019/01/016857, registered on 3 Mar 2019,

AB  - Pregnancy during adolescence is a major risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Further, Motherhood during the adolescent period is identified as a major global health burden. Considering the widely known importance of the negative impact of adolescent pregnancy, motherhood at an early age, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, this paper aims to provide insight into correlates of teen pregnancy, adolescent motherhood and adverse pregnancy outcome. This study utilizes the data from UDAYA survey conducted in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The eligible sample size for the study was 4897 married adolescent girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years. Bivariate analysis with a chi-square test of association and Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to fulfill the aim of the study. Our study shows that a major proportion of married adolescents (61%) got pregnant before the age of 20 years and around 42% of all adolescent married women gave birth to a child before reaching the age of 20 years. Adolescents who married before the age of 18 years were 1.79 times more likely to experience pregnancy (OR: 1.79; CI: 1.39-2.30) and 3.21 times more likely to experience motherhood (OR: 3.21; CI: 2.33-4.43). In the present study, women who experienced physical violence were at higher risk for having an adverse pregnancy outcome (OR: 1.41; CI: 1.08-1.84) than those who did not experience physical violence. To conclude, regional and national level efforts focused on improving early marriage, education and empowering women and girls can be beneficial.

AB  - Introduction: The scaffolds used in regenerative endodontic therapy (RET) provide structural support for cells so that they can adhere to the scaffolds and also are crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation. The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare effects of different intracanal scaffolds on success outcomes of RET. Methods: PubMed/ Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies evaluating and/or comparing clinical and/or radiographic success of RET using different scaffolds with a minimum of 12 months follow-up were included. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (ROB) tool and appropriate tools from Joanna Briggs Institute were used for the assessment of ROB. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the primary outcome (clinical success) and other success outcomes (root maturation, and pulpal sensibility) using different scaffolds. Results: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the desired inclusion criteria of which 25 had a low ROB whereas 2 had a moderate ROB. Clinical success of RET using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), blood clot (BC), and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) scaffolds ranged between 91.66%-100%, 84.61%-100%, and 77%-100% respectively. The different scaffolds did not show any statistically significant difference in clinical success (PRF vs BC [P = 1.000], PRP vs BC [P = 1.000], and PRF vs PRP [P = .999]), apical root closure (PRF vs BC [P = 1.000], PRP vs BC [P = .835], PRF vs PRP [P = .956]), and pulp sensibility (PRF vs BC [P = .980], PRP versus BC [P = .520], and PRF vs PRP [P = .990]). Conclusion: The intracanal scaffolds used during RET did not result in significant differences in regard to clinical success, root maturation, and pulpal sensibility. (J Endod 2023;49:110-128.)

AB  - The present prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of OXIS contact areas, namely, O (open type), X (point type), I (straight type), and S (curved type) in the development of approximal caries. We conducted this study among 953 school children with 3,812 contacts in Puducherry, India. At baseline, the contacts were assessed in accordance with OXIS criteria. At the end of 12 months, two calibrated dentists measured dental caries following the International Caries Detection and Assessment (ICDAS) criteria. Information about feeding practices, diet, and oral hygiene was collected by means of a structured questionnaire from each child's parent. Data were analyzed by unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression analysis with a multilevel approach. The two levels of analysis were tooth and child. Of 3,812 contacts observed during the follow-up, 127 (3.3%) were observed as carious. Poisson regression analysis revealed a significant association between type of contact and caries prevalence (p < 0.05). The risk ratios for the development of approximal caries in X contacts were 2.4 (0.3-17.2), p value 0.38; in I contacts 4.9 (1.2-19.9), p value 0.027; and in S contacts 8.2 (1.9-34.2), p value 0.004, when compared with the O contacts. Among the child variables, male gender (relative risk [RR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3, 3.5), parental supervision while toothbrushing (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.4), and the use of toothpaste (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3, 3.1) were found to be associated with approximal caries after adjustment for the other variables. Among the OXIS contacts, the S type was most susceptible to approximal caries due to its complex morphology, followed by I, X, and O.

AB  - PurposeTo explore a minimally invasive trans-canal endoscopic facial nerve decompression for traumatic facial nerve palsy and compare it with microscopic facial nerve decompression.Methods35 and 38 patients underwent endoscopic and microscopic facial nerve decompression, respectively, for traumatic facial nerve palsy. Onset of symptoms, type of temporal bone fracture, day of surgical intervention following trauma, ossicular chain status and nature of insult to facial nerve were observed. Time period for recovery (House Brackmann grade <= 3), long term recovery rates, pre- and post-operative hearing status, surgical time and post-operative pain were compared between groups.ResultsMaximum patients in endoscopic and microscopic groups (77.1% and 76.3%, respectively) had acute onset of symptoms. 57.1% (20/35) had longitudinal, 17.1% (6/35) had transverse and 25.7% (9/35) had mixed fractures in endoscopic group. In the microscopic group, 57.9% (22/38) had longitudinal, 18.4% (7/38) had transverse and 23.7% (9/38) had mixed fractures. The mean (+/- S.D.) post-operative air-bone gap in endoscopic and microscopic group were 16.47 +/- 4.5 dB and 19.4 +/- 5.2 dB, respectively, which was statistically significant. The mean (+/- S.D.) time period for recovery of endoscopic and microscopic groups were 14.4 +/- 5 days and 22.5 +/- 7 days, respectively (p value < 0.05). The difference in post-operative pain between the two groups was also statistically significant. The difference in long term recovery rates was not statistically significant (p > 0.05).ConclusionsEndoscopic facial nerve decompression results in early recovery, less post-operative pain and better post-operative air-bone gap closure when compared to conventional microscopic technique.

AB  - Xenobiotic metabolic enzymes CYP1A1 and GSTM1 are known to increase the risk of head and neck cancer. However, their role in the development of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in the Indian population is uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the CYP1A1 and GSTM1 gene polymorphism in the urban population of the state of Delhi as well as to investigate the risk of disease progression. Genotype analysis via polymerase chain reaction was conducted in 1169 cases and 1046 controls with regard to GSTM1 and CYP1A1 (ile-val) genes. The oral lesions were biopsied for histopathological diagnosis. Follow-up of the subjects was done at 6-month intervals and the status of the lesions was recorded as static, progressed, or regressed. Descriptive analysis was done with a p-value <= 0.05 and odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval being considered for a measure of association. Subjects who consumed both tobacco and alcohol and developed OPMD lesions were 8.2 times more likely to harbour CYP1A1 Val/Val genotype (p = 0.047; OR = 8.224; 95% CI = 1.024-66.037). The highest progression rate and lowest regression rate were found for the CYP1A1 Val/Val genotype in our sample. The CYP1A1 Val/Val genotype may be associated with an increased risk of development of OPMDs amongst consumers of both tobacco and alcohol. Real-time activity-based sensing of isoforms of the CYP1A1 enzyme in living systems is needed to validate the same.

AB  - Mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome 2 (MVA2) (MIM# 614114) is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by biallelic loss of function variants in the CEP57 gene. MVA2 is characterized by a variable phenotype ranging from poor growth to facial dysmorphism, short stature and congenital heart defects. Only 11 families and 5 pathogenic variants of MVA2 have been described so far. Intragenic duplication of 11 nucleotides (c.915_925dup11) in homozygous or compound heterozygous state is the commonest genetic aberration (10/13). We describe the first Indian family with two siblings with a novel homozygous splice site variant (c.382+2T>C) in CEP57. Molecular characterization demonstrated skipping of exon 3 due to the variant with protein modeling predicting subsequent complete loss of function. This is the first report of a splice site variation in CEP57 leading to MVA2.

AB  - Background and purpose: Differentiation of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA) from glioblastoma is difficult using con-ventional MRI parameters. The purpose of this study was to differentiate these two similar in appearance tumors using quantitative T1 perfusion MRI parameters combined under a machine learning framework.Materials and methods: This retrospective study included age/sex and location matched 26 PA and 33 glioblas-toma patients with tumor histopathological characterization performed using WHO 2016 classification. Multi -parametric MRI data were acquired at 3 T scanner and included T1 perfusion and DWI data along with con-ventional MRI images. Analysis of T1 perfusion data using a leaky-tracer-kinetic-model, first-pass-model and piecewise-linear-model resulted in multiple quantitative parameters. ADC maps were also computed from DWI data. Tumors were segmented into sub-components such as enhancing and non-enhancing regions, edema and necrotic/cystic regions using T1 perfusion parameters. Enhancing and non-enhancing regions were combined and used as an ROI. A support-vector-machine classifier was developed for the classification of PA versus glioblas-toma using T1 perfusion MRI parameters/features. The feature set was optimized using a random-forest based algorithm. Classification was also performed between the two tumor types using the ADC parameter.Results: T1 perfusion parameter values were significantly different between the two groups. The combination of T1 perfusion parameters classified tumors more accurately with a cross validated error of 9.80% against that of ADC's 17.65% error.Conclusion: The approach of using quantitative T1 perfusion parameters based upon a support-vector-machine classifier reliably differentiated PA from glioblastoma and performed better classification than ADC.

AB  - Inactivating mutations of SMARCA4 and accompanying loss of BRG1 immunoexpression were recently identified in majority of sinonasal teratocarcinosarcomas (TCS). These rare and aggressive neoplasms have potential for nodal metastasis, presenting opportunities for diagnosis on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). However, their cytological features have not been described till date. A 22-year-old male was diagnosed to have SMARCA4-deficient TCS on a nasal mass biopsy, and was started on neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Four months later, FNAC from cervical lymph nodes showed predominantly discohesive tumor cells with moderate to abundant cytoplasm and enlarged vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Occasional cohesive fragments showed ovoid to spindled tumor cells attached to fibrovascular cores. Few loosely cohesive cells with scant cytoplasm and nuclei having stippled chromatin, and rhabdoid cells were also seen. Frequent mitoses, apoptosis and nuclear streaking were evident. Overt squamous or glandular differentiation was absent. Tumor cells showed loss of BRG1 immunostaining and beta-catenin immunopositivity on a cell block, consistent with metastatic SMARCA4-deficient TCS. The diversity of cell types in SMARCA4-deficient TCS can result in a broad spectrum of cytological features that overlap with that of other regional metastatic tumors including neuroendocrine carcinoma, olfactory neuroblastoma and melanoma. Further, all components of TCS as seen in the primary tumor may not be present in nodal metastases. Thus, SMARCA4-deficient TCS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of metastatic poorly/undifferentiated malignancies in cervical lymph node aspirates, and appropriate ancillary tests viz. BRG1 immunostaining employed for accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Breast cancer (luminal and triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]) is the most common cancer among women in India and worldwide. Altered sphingolipid levels have emerged as a common phenomenon during cancer progression. However, these alterations are yet to be translated into robust diagnostic and prognostic markers for cancer. Here, we present the quantified sphingolipids of tumor and adjacent-normal tissues from patients of luminal (n = 70) and TNBC (n = 42) subtype from an Indian cohort using targeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. We recorded unique sphingolipid profiles that distinguished luminal and TNBC tumors in comparison to adjacent normal tissue by six-sphingolipid signatures. Moreover, systematic comparison of the profiles of luminal and TNBC tumors provided a unique five-sphingolipid signature distinguishing the two subtypes. We further identified key sphingolipids that can stratify grade II and grade III tumors of luminal and TNBC subtype as well as their lymphovascular invasion status. Therefore, we provide the right evidence to develop these candidate sphingolipids as widely acceptable marker/s capable of diagnosing luminal vs TNBC subtype of breast cancer, and predicting the disease severity by identifying the tumor grade.

AB  - The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) is a nationally representative in-depth study of cognitive aging and dementia. We present a publicly available dataset of harmonized cognitive measures of 4,096 adults 60 years of age and older in India, collected across 18 states and union territories. Blood samples were obtained to carry out whole blood and serum-based assays. Results are included in a venous blood specimen datafile that can be linked to the Harmonized LASI-DAD dataset. A global screening array of 960 LASI-DAD respondents is also publicly available for download, in addition to neuroimaging data on 137 LASI-DAD participants. Altogether, these datasets provide comprehensive information on older adults in India that allow researchers to further understand risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia.

AB  - BackgroundThe physiological changes of pregnancy increase the risk of gallstone formation and choledocholithiasis. Traditionally, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has been the main approach for managing choledocholithiasis during pregnancy, but recent progress in laparoscopic bile duct exploration (LBDE) has demonstrated this technique as a safe and effective alternative option.MethodsA retrospective multicenter study of all patients who underwent LBDE during pregnancy from five centers with proven experience in LBDE between January 2010 and June 2020 was performed. The primary endpoint was to analyze the role of LBDE during pregnancy and to further characterize its position as a safe and effective alternative for the management of choledocholithiasis. A systematic review of the published literature relating to LBDE during pregnancy until February 2022 was also performed.ResultsFive institutions reported performing LBDE during pregnancy in 8 patients. Median surgical time was 75 min (range: 60-140 min). The bile duct was cleared successfully in all patients, and the median hospital stay was 2 days (range: 1-3 days). The literature review identified a total of 7 patients with a successful CBD clearance rate of 86%. There were no major maternal, fetal, or pregnancy-related complications in any of the total 15 patients included. The symptomatic common bile duct lithiasis with deranged liver function tests was the most frequent indication (n=7).ConclusionLBDE during pregnancy appears to be safe and effective. More evidence reporting outcomes of LBDE during pregnancy is needed before any strong recommendations can be made.

AB  - Background: Clinical airway assessment parameters differ significantly between pregnant and non-pregnant patients, however literature comparing their ultrasound (US) airway parameters is limited. We planned a prospective cohort study to compare US-assessed airway parameters between pregnant and non-pregnant women.Methods: We enrolled 82 pregnant females scheduled for elective cesarean section under neuraxial anesthesia and 80 age-matched non-pregnant females scheduled for elective surgery. Pre-operative clinical airway assessment was performed in both groups. The US airway assessment was done pre-operatively in non-pregnant and postoperatively in pregnant patients. Our primary objective was to compare US-assessed parameters, and secondary objectives included a comparison of clinical airway assessment parameters and investigating a relationship between a difficult airway (defined as a modified Mallampati grade (MMG) >= 3) and other airway assessment parameters.Results: Among several US airway parameters, pregnant patients had significantly higher hyomental distance, anterior neck soft tissue thickness at the hyoid and vocal cord level, and oral cavity height, while the tongue thickness and mandibular condylar movements were significantly lower than in non-pregnant patients. Similarly, for the clinical airway assessment, pregnant patients had significantly higher MMG and upper lip bite test scores, mentohyoid distance, and neck circumference. Pregnancy, the ratio of pre-epiglottic space and epiglottis-to-vocal cords distance (Pre-E/E-VC), and hyoid bone visibility were independent predictors of a difficult airway.Conclusion: The US airway assessment parameters differ significantly between pregnant and non-pregnant patients. Pregnancy, hyoid bone visibility, and Pre-E/E-VC ratio were independent predictors of the difficult airway in female patients.

AB  - Purpose: Candida albicans is the major cause of fungal UTI in neonates and infants but nowadays non albicans Candida is also increasing and these are mostly multidrug resistant. So it's important to know the species of candidal UTI for the proper management. This study was undertaken to determine the Candida species distri-bution in UTI along with their susceptibility pattern and outcome in infants and neonates admitted in different wards and ICU of our hospital. We also assess the incidence rate of candiduria in ICUs.Method: Urine samples were collected from infants and neonates presented in pediatrics and neonatal ICU (intensive care units) and clinical wards with a clinical suspicion of candiduria and infants at risk of invasive candidiasis were also included in the study. Identification of Candida sp. was done by Gram's staining, germ tube test, chlamydospore formation on corn meal agar, color appearance on CHROM agar and also confirmed by MALDI-TOF Assay. Antifungal susceptibility was performed by using broth microdilution method as per the CLSI M27-A3/M27-S4.Result: Urine samples were received from 219 infants, and Candida was isolated from samples from 52 infants (isolation rate 23.75%), of which 30 were admitted in pediatric or neonatal ICU and 22 in the wards. The incidence rate of candiduria in ICU was 3.25%. Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated species from the samples of infants in the wards (13/22 i.e. 59%), while Candida tropicalis was most frequently isolated from samples of infants in the ICUs (13/30 i.e. 43.34%). Candida glabrata was the least commonly isolated species and was only encopuntered in the ICU. There was no discrepancy between the results of conventional methods of identification and MALDI-TOF. Antifungal susceptibility was performed for 18 randomly selected isolates. All were found to be susceptible to caspofungin, micafungin, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, amphotericin B.Conclusion: High suspicion of candiduria is needed especially in ICU admitted infants and identification of candida at species level along with the susceptibility pattern is important for the better management of patients.

AB  - Biomaterial properties, such as surface roughness, morphology, stiffness, conductivity, and chemistry, significantly influence a cell's ability to sense and adhere to its surface and regulate cell functioning. Understanding how biomaterial properties govern changes in cellular function is one of the fundamental goals of tissue engineering. Still, no generalized rule is established to predict cellular processes (adhesion, spreading, growth and differentiation) on biomaterial surfaces. A few studies have highlighted that cells sense biomaterial properties at multiple length scales and regulate various intracellular biochemical processes like cytoskeleton organization, gene regulation, and receptor expression to influence cell function. However, recent studies have found cellular metabolism as another critical aspect of cellular processes that regulate cell behavior, co-relating metabolism to cellular functions like adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Now researchers have started to uncover previously overlooked factors on how biomaterial properties govern changes in cellular functions mediated through metabolism. This review highlights how different physiochemical properties of scaffolds designed from different biomaterials influence cell metabolism. The review also discusses the role of metabolism change in cellular functions and cell behavior in the context of bone tissue engineering. It also emphasizes the importance of cell metabolism as a missing link between the cellular behavior and physicochemical properties of scaffolds and serves as a guiding principle for designing scaffolds for tissue engineering.

AB  - Aim: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair is a direct biomarker proven to be useful for the detection of chronic excessive alcohol use. This study investigated the association of self-reported alcohol consumption with traditional biomarkers: GGT, AST, ALT, CDT, and MCV in blood and a direct biomarker, hair EtG, in a total of 122 patients with alcohol dependence syndrome. The diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers to differentiate heavy from non-heavy drinkers was also evaluated.Method: GGT, AST, and ALT in serum were measured by Automated Chemistry Analyzer, MCV in blood was measured by Haematology Analyzer, serum CDT was analyzed by ELISA, and EtG in hair was eval-uated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The association between the biomarkers and the amount of alcohol consumed (self-reported) was determined using Spearman's rank correlation.Results: All participants showed EtG level above the cut-off (0.03 ng/mg). Hair EtG showed a statistically significant linear and positive correlation with the amounts (in grams) of alcohol consumed (r 1/4 0.60; p < 0.001). No correlation was observed among the traditional biomarkers and the quantity of alcohol consumed. Also, EtG showed an excellent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (98%) with good sensitivity (85%) and specificity (60%) to classify heavy drinkers among individuals with alcohol dependence syndrome.Conclusion: Hair EtG can be helpful to estimate retrospective alcohol consumption in long-term chronic alcohol consumption cases. Hair EtG also provides a reliable diagnostic test to detect heavy drinkers among individuals with alcohol dependence syndrome.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundVitamin D deficiency has been examined as a risk factor for severity and progression of kidney disease due to its immunomodulatory effects. There is paucity of data about its impact in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).MethodsIn a retrospective cohort study, 25 (OH) vitamin D assay was performed in bio-banked baseline serum samples collected during kidney biopsy of 105 adult patients with primary IgAN diagnosed between 2015 and 2019. A level of < 10 ng/mL was defined as Vitamin D deficiency.ResultsMean age of patients was 34 +/- 10.6 years, 69.5% were males. Mean baseline 25(OH) Vitamin D levels was 15.9 +/- 11.9 ng/mL and 41(39%) patients had vitamin D deficiency. Serum albumin level was lower in vitamin D deficient patients compared to those who had higher vitamin D levels (3.7 +/- 0.9 vs 4.1 +/- 0.7 g/dl, p = 0.018)but there was no significant difference in baseline proteinuria and eGFR. Crescentic lesions were more frequent in vitamin D deficient group (19.5% vs 6.3%, p = 0.022). At median follow up of 21.5 months (6 - 56 months), there was no difference in remission (68.3% vs 65.6%, p = 0.777) and disease progression (12.5% vs 9.4%, p = 0.614) in those with and without Vitamin D deficiency respectively. On multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis, vitamin D deficiency was not a significant risk factor for renal survival (HR-1.79, 95% confidence interval:0.50-6.34, p = 0.368).ConclusionThere was no association between vitamin D deficiency and disease profile as well as renal outcome in Indian patients with IgAN.

AB  - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) exhibits intrinsic heterogeneity at the molecular level that aids in distinguishing between its two prominent subtypes - Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC). This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)-based deep learning framework to discover a small set of NSCLC biomarkers. The proposed framework comprises three modules - an autoencoder to shrink the input feature space, a feed-forward neural network to classify NSCLC instances into LUAD and LUSC, and a biomarker discovery module that leverages the combined network comprising the autoencoder and the feed-forward neural network. In the biomarker discovery module, XAI methods uncovered a set of 52 relevant biomarkers for NSCLC subtype classification. To evaluate the classification performance of the discovered biomarkers, multiple machine-learning models are constructed using these biomarkers. Using 10-Fold cross-validation, Multilayer Perceptron achieved an accuracy of 95.74% (+/- 1.27) at 95% confidence interval. Further, using Drug-Gene Interaction Database, we observe that 14 of the discovered biomarkers are druggable. In addition, 28 biomarkers aid the prediction of the survivability of the patients. Out of 52 discovered biomarkers, we find that 45 biomarkers have been reported in previous studies on distinguishing between the two NSCLC subtypes. To the best of our knowledge, the remaining seven biomarkers have not yet been reported for NSCLC subtyping and could be further explored for their contribution to targeted therapy of lung cancer.

AB  - Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced by the intestinal microbiota as a by-product of metabolism of dietary precursors. TMA has been implicated in various chronic health conditions. However, the effect of TMA in the colon and the underlying mechanism was not clear. In this study, TMA exhibited toxic effects in vitro as well as in vivo. TMA-induced oxidative stress causes DNA damage, and compromised cell membrane integrity leading to the release of LDH outside the cells which ultimately leads to cell death. Besides, TMA also exhibited pronounced increase in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in both HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. TMA was found to be genotoxic and cytotoxic as the TMA concentration increased from 0.15 mM. A decreased ATP intracellular content was observed after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner. For in vivo research, TMA (100 mM, i.p. and intra-rectal) once a week for 12 weeks caused significant changes in cellular morphology of colon and rectum epithelium as assessed by H & E staining. TMA also significantly increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colon and rectal epithelium indicating the severity of inflammation. In addition, TMA caused extensive mucosal damage and distortion in the epithelium, decrease in length of small intestine compared to control mice. In conclusion, these results highlight the detrimental effects of TMA in the colon and rectal epithelium.

AB  - BackgroundFOXO3, a member of the FOX transcription factor family, is frequently described as being deregulated in cancer. Additionally, notable role of FOXO3 can be easily recognized in the process of ageing and survival. Even though various studies have been done to acknowledge the tumour-suppressive or oncogenic role of FOXO3 in cancer, still there exist a lack of understanding in terms of cancer prognosis and treatment. Therefore, to provide better insight, our study aims to evaluate the role and function of FOXO3 in breast cancer in Indian female patients. We examined the FOXO3 expression levels in breast cancer samples by analyzing mRNA and protein expression along with its clinicopathological parameters. ResultsA total of 127 cases of breast cancer with equal normal cases (n=127) were assessed with methylation (MS-PCR), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA expression using Real-time PCR was analysed and 66.14% cases at mRNA level were found to be downregulated, while 81.10% of cases had little or very little protein expression. Our data state, the promoter hypermethylation of the FOXO3 gene and the downregulated protein expression are significantly correlated (p=0.0004). Additionally, we found a significant correlation between the level of FOXO3 mRNA with ER (p=0.04) and status of lymph node (p=0.01) along with this. ConclusionData suggests the prognostic significance and the tumour-suppressive role of FOXO3 in breast cancer cases studied in India. However, there is a need for the extended research targeting FOXO3 to measure its clinical potential and develop well-defined therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Mutations in the Krebs cycle enzyme IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP(+)) 1) are associated with better prognosis in gliomas. Though IDH1 mutant (IDH1(R132H)) tumors are characterized by their antiproliferative signatures maintained through hypermethylation of DNA and chromatin, mechanisms affecting cell death pathways in these tumors are not well elucidated. On investigating the crosstalk between the IDH1 mutant epigenome, ferritinophagy and inflammation, diminished expression of PRMT1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) and its associated asymmetric dimethyl epigenetic mark H4R3me2a was observed in IDH1(R132H) gliomas. Reduced expression of PRMT1 was concurrent with diminished levels of PTX3, a key secretory factor involved in cancer-related inflammation. Lack of PRMT1 H4R3me2a in IDH1 mutant glioma failed to epigenetically activate the expression of PTX3 with a reduction in YY1 (YY1 transcription factor) binding on its promoter. Transcriptional activation and subsequent secretion of PTX3 from cells was required for maintaining macroautophagic/autophagic balance as pharmacological or genetic ablation of PTX3 secretion in wild-type IDH1 significantly increased autophagic flux. Additionally, PTX3-deficient IDH1 mutant gliomas exhibited heightened autophagic signatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the PRMT1-PTX3 axis is important in regulating the levels of ferritin genes/iron storage and inhibition of this axis triggered ferritinophagic flux. This study highlights the conserved role of IDH1 mutants in augmenting ferritinophagic flux in gliomas irrespective of genetic landscape through inhibition of the PRMT1-PTX3 axis. This is the first study describing ferritinophagy in IDH1 mutant gliomas with mechanistic details. Of clinical importance, our study suggests that the PRMT1-PTX3 ferritinophagy regulatory circuit could be exploited for therapeutic gains.

AB  - Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) represents a group of malformations of cortical development, which are speculated to be related to early developmental defects in the cerebral cortex. According to dysmature cerebral development hypothesis of FCD altered GABAA receptor function is known to contribute to abnormal neuronal network. Here, we studied the possible association between age at seizure onset in FCD with the subunit configuration of GABAA receptors in resected brain specimens obtained from patients with FCD. We observed a significantly higher ratio of alpha 4/alpha 1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors in patients with early onset (EO) FCD as compared to those with late onset (LO) FCD as is seen during the course of development where alpha 4-containing GABAA receptors expression is high as compared to alpha 1-containing GABAA receptors expression. Likewise, the influx to efflux chloride co-transporter expression of NKCC1/KCC2 was also increased in patients with EO FCD as seen during brain development. In addition, we observed that the ratio of GABA/Glutamate neurotransmitters was lower in patients with EO FCD as compared to that in patients with LO FCD. Our findings suggest altered configuration of GABAA receptors in FCD which could be contributing to aberrant depolarizing GABAergic activity. In particular, we observed a correlation of age at seizure onset in FCD with subunit configuration of GABAA receptors, levels of NKCC1/KCC2 and the ratio of GABA/Glutamate neurotransmitters such that the patients with EO FCD exhibited a more critically modulated GABAergic network.

AB  - Objective: Developing countries such as India face a major mental health care gap. Delayed or inadequate care can have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. We compared pathways to care in first episode psychosis (FEP) between North and South India to inform solutions to bridge the treatment gap.Methods: Cross-sectional observation study of 'untreated' FEP patients (n = 177) visiting a psychiatry department in two sites in India (AIIMS, New Delhi and SCARF, Chennai). We compared duration of untreated psychosis (DUP), first service encounters, illness attributions and socio-demographic factors between patients from North and South India. Correlates of DUP were explored using logistic regression analysis (DUP >= 6 months) and generalised linear models (DUP in weeks).Results: Patients in North India had experienced longer DUP than patients in South India (beta = 17.68, p < 0.05). The most common first encounter in North India was with a faith healer (45.7%), however, this contact was not significantly associated with longer DUP. Visiting a faith healer was the second most common first contact in South India (23.6%) and was significantly associated with longer DUP (Odds Ratio: 6.84; 95% Confidence In-terval: 1.77, 26.49). Being in paid employment was significantly associated with shorter DUP across both sites.Conclusions: Implementing early intervention strategies in a diverse country like India requires careful attention to local population demographics; one size may not fit all. A collaborative relationship between faith healers and mental health professionals could help with educational initiatives and to provide more accessible care.

AB  - IntroductionPrior estimates of dementia prevalence in India were based on samples from selected communities, inadequately representing the national and state populations. MethodsFrom the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) we recruited a sample of adults ages 60+ and administered a rich battery of neuropsychological tests and an informant interview in 2018 through 2020. We obtained a clinical consensus rating of dementia status for a subsample (N = 2528), fitted a logistic model for dementia status on this subsample, and then imputed dementia status for all other LASI respondents aged 60+ (N = 28,949). ResultsThe estimated dementia prevalence for adults ages 60+ in India is 7.4%, with significant age and education gradients, sex and urban/rural differences, and cross-state variation. DiscussionAn estimated 8.8 million Indians older than 60 years have dementia. The burden of dementia cases is unevenly distributed across states and subpopulations and may therefore require different levels of local planning and support. HighlightsThe estimated dementia prevalence for adults ages 60+ in India is 7.4%.About 8.8 million Indians older than 60 years live with dementia.Dementia is more prevalent among females than males and in rural than urban areas.Significant cross-state variation exists in dementia prevalence.

AB  - Gaucher disease (GD), one of the most frequent autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders, occurs due to bi-allelic pathogenic variants in the GBA1. Worldwide, the c.1448T>C (L483P) homozygous pathogenic variant is reported to be associated with neurological GD phenotype. Clinical distinction between GD1 and GD3 may be challenging due to subtle neurological features. Objective methods to evaluate neurological signs and saccades may help in early diagnosis. This study was conducted to assess the neurological phenotype, and its severity using a modified severity scoring tool (mSST), and the genotype-phenotype correlation. A total of 45 children aged 2 years 6 months to 15 years with a confirmed enzymatic and molecular diagnosis of GD with or without therapy were recruited. mSST tool was used to assess the severity of the neurological phenotype. A digital eye movement tracker (View Point Tracker) was used to assess eye movements. Clinical and genetic findings were analyzed. Out of 45 patients, 39 (86.7%) had at least one neurological phenotype detected using the mSST tool, with impairment of cognitive function (68.8%, 31/45) being the commonest feature. Thirty-two of 45 (71%) were assessed for saccadic eye movements using the eye tracker. Of these, 62.5% (20/32) had absent saccades. Four children (8.9%, 4/32) without clinical oculomotor apraxia had absent saccades on the viewpoint eye tracker. Overall, 77.7% (35/45), had homozygosity for c.1448T>C in GBA1 of which 91.4% (32/35) had neurological manifestations. Other alleles associated with neurological phenotype included c.1603C>T(p.R535C), c.1184C>T (p.S395F), c.115+1G>A (g.4234G>A), c.260G>A (p.R87Q) and c.1352A>G (p.Y451C). To conclude, in India, the c.1448T>C pathogenic variant in GBA1 is the commonest and is associated with neurological phenotype of GD. Therefore, every patient of GD should be assessed using the mSST scoring tool for an early pick up of neurological features. The routine use of a viewpoint eye tracker in children with GD would be useful for early recognition of saccadic abnormalities.

AB  - Background The vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to HIV infection increases if unprotected heterosexual anal intercourse (HAI) is practiced. Objectives To estimate the prevalence of HAI among FSWs, and associated factors, and prevalence of consistent condom use (CCU) during HAI and associated factors. Methods Analysis of cross-sectional data from nationwide biological and behavioural survey, conducted at 73 randomly selected domains with sample size of 27,000 in India. Results A total of 25,932 FSWs were included in the analysis, after excluding 1075 (3.9%) FSWs for which the data were incomplete. The prevalence of HAI was 29.9% (95% CI, 29.3, 30.4); The CCU during HAI in the last one month was 58.9%. Younger age at the start of sex work, use of mobile phone/internet for soliciting client, home as a place of sex work, consumption of alcohol/drug, and physical violence against FSWs were associated with higher odds of HAI. Frequent contact with outreach workers, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, and older age at the start of sex work was associated with CCU. Conclusion Prevalence of HAI was high among FSW in India. The national program could target those factors that reduce the odds of HAI and/or promote CCU.

AB  - HBV entry to the host cells and its successful infection depends on its ability to modulate the host restriction factors. DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX3, is shown to inhibit HBV replication. However, the exact mechanism of inhibition still remains unclear. DDX3 is involved in multitude or RNA metabolism processes including biogenesis of miRNAs. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism involved in DDX3-mediated HBV inhibition. First, we observed that HBx protein of HBV downregulated DDX3 expression in HBV-infected cells. Overexpression of DDX3 inhibited HBx, HBsAg and total viral load, while its knockdown reversed the result in Hep G2.2.15 cells. Expression of miR-34 was downregulated in HBV-infected cells. Overexpression of pHBV(1.3) further confirmed that HBV downregulates miR-34 expression. Consistent with the previous finding that DDX3 is involved in miRNA biogenesis, we observed that expression of miR-34 positively corelated with DDX3 expression. miRNA target prediction tools showed that miR-34 can target autophagy pathway which is hijacked by HBV for the benefit of its own replication. Indeed, transfection with miR-34 oligos downregulated the expression of autophagy marker proteins in HBV-expressing cells. Overexpression of DDX3 in HBV-expressing cells, downregulated expression of autophagy proteins while silencing of DDX3 reversed the results. These results led us to conclude that DDX3 upregulates miR-34 expression and thus inhibits autophagy in HBV-expressing cells while HBx helps HBV evade DDX3-mediated inhibition by downregulating DDX3 expression in HBV-infected cells.

AB  - Background: Social cognition is the study of how people make sense of themselves and others. Impairment in several domains of social cognition is increasingly being recognized in Parkinson's disease (PD). ObjectivesWe aimed to study multiple domains of social cognition in Indian PD patients using a culturally appropriate, validated instrument. Methods: We recruited 52 individuals with PD and 31 healthy volunteers (HV) and used the Social Cognition Rating Tools in Indian Setting (SOCRATIS) tool to assess theory of mind (ToM), attributional biases and social cue perception. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the PDQOL scale. Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable between PD and HV. The mean (SD) FOT index (first order ToM index) was 0.86(0.18) in PD and 0.99(0.07) in HV [P < 0.001]. The PD group showed higher Externalizing Bias [EB, 4.42(3.91)], compared to HV [1.58(3.22), P = 0.001]. The mean (SD) Faux Pas Composite Index (FPCI ALT) was 0.69(0.09) in PD and 0.78(0.13) in HV [P < 0.001]. Social cognition indices were not associated with QoL in PD. Clinical parameters-age, gender, HAM-D, MOCA, education, levodopa equivalent daily dose of medication, number of PD drugs and trihexyphenidyl use did not predict social cognition. Conclusion: PD patients were less successful than age, gender matched controls in understanding social situations and other's thought processes and had higher tendency to attribute undesirable events to external causes. Deficits in social cognition did not impair the quality of life.

AB  - Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (PIBD) is rising rapidly in many industrialized and affluent areas in the Asia-Pacific region. Current available guidelines, mainly from Europe and North America, may not be completely applicable to clinicians caring for children with PIBD in this region due to differences in disease characteristics and regional resources constraints. This position paper is an initiative from the Asian Pan-Pacific Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (APPSPGHAN) with the aim of providing an up-to-date, evidence-based approach to PIBD in the Asia-Pacific region, taking into consideration the unique disease characteristics and financial resources available in this region. A group of pediatric gastroenterologists with special interest in PIBD performed an extensive literature search covering epidemiology, disease characteristics and natural history, management, and monitoring. Gastrointestinal infections, including tuberculosis, need to be excluded before diagnosing IBD. In some populations in Asia, the Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUD15) gene is a better predictor of leukopenia induced by azathioprine than thiopurine-S-methyltransferase (TPMT). The main considerations in the use of biologics in the Asia-Pacific region are high cost, ease of access, and potential infectious risk, especially tuberculosis. This position paper provides a useful guide to clinicians in the medical management of children with PIBD in the Asia-Pacific region.

AB  - Introduction: The bacterial protein toxin Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) mediates RANKL-independent osteoclast differentiation. Although these osteoclasts are smaller, their resorptive activity is high which helps in efficient destruction of nasal turbinate bones of pigs.Methods: The proteome of bone marrow-derived macrophages differentiated into osteoclasts with either RANKL or PMT was analysed. The results were verified by characterizing the metabolic activity using Seahorse analysis, a protein translation assay, immunoblots, real-time PCR as well as flow cytometry-based monitoring of mitochondrial activity and ROS production. A G alpha q overexpression system using ER-Hoxb8 cells was used to identify G alpha q-mediated metabolic effects on osteoclast differentiation and function.Results: PMT induces the upregulation of metabolic pathways, which included strong glycolytic activity, increased expression of GLUT1 and upregulation of the mTOR pathway. As OxPhos components were expressed more efficiently, cells also displayed increased mitochondrial respiration. The heterotrimeric G protein G alpha q plays a central role in this hypermetabolic cell activation as it triggers mitochondrial relocalisation of pSerSTAT3 and an increase in OPA1 expression. This seems to be caused by a direct interaction between STAT3 and OPA1 resulting in enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Overexpression of G alpha q mimicked the hypermetabolic phenotype observed for PMT-induced osteoclasts and resulted in higher glycolytic and mitochondrial activity as well as increased bone resorptive activity. In addition, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients showed an increase in GNAQ expression, especially in the synovial fluid.Discussion: Our study suggests that G alpha q plays a key role in PMT-induced osteoclastogenesis. Enhanced expression of GNAQ at the site of inflammation in RA patients indicates its pathophysiological relevance in the context of inflammatory bone disorders.

AB  - Background Coexisting genetic variants in patients with anti-factor H (FH)-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) have implications for therapy. We estimated the prevalence of complement genetic variants in children with anti-FH aHUS from a prospective nationwide cohort and determined if significant genetic variants impact long-term kidney outcomes. Methods Of 436 patients in the database, 77 consecutive patients, 21 with a relapse and 9 with kidney failure and/or death were included. Targeted sequencing, using a 27-gene panel including CFH, CFI, CFB, C3, CD46, PLG, DGKE, and THBD and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of CFH-CFHR region, was performed. The adverse outcome was eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) or death. Results Patients had high anti-FH titers 5670 (2177-13,545) AU/ml, relapsing course (42.1%), and adverse outcomes (19.6%). Variants, chiefly of unknown significance, were found in 7 (6.5%; 95% CI 3.1-13.2%); a pathogenic variant was found in one patient. Homozygous deletion of CFHR1 was present in 91.6% compared to 9.8% in 184 healthy controls. Plasma exchanges and immunosuppression showed a trend of improving outcomes, independent of genetic defects (HR 0.32; P = 0.070). Meta-analysis of 18 studies (384 patients) showed that the pooled prevalence of pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants was 3% (95% CI 0-8%). Of 37 total variants in the meta-analysis, 7 (18.9%) each were pathogenic and likely pathogenic; others were variants of unknown significance. Conclusions Significant variants in complement regulatory genes are rare in patients with anti-FH-associated aHUS. Irrespective of genetic defects, plasma exchanges and immunosuppression showed a statistical trend to improved outcomes.

AB  - The short peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-S) of the innate immune system recognizes the invading microbes through binding to their cell wall molecules. In order to understand the mode of binding of PGRP-S to bacterial cell wall molecules, the structure of the complex of camel PGRP-S (CPGRP-S) with hexanoic acid has been determined at 2.07 & ANGS; resolution. Previously, we had reported the structures of CPGRP-S in the native unbound state as well as in the complexed forms with the components of various bacterial cell wall molecules such as peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), mycolic acid (MA) and other fatty acids. These structures revealed that CPGRP-S formed two homodimers which were designated as A-B and C-D dimers. It also showed that the fatty acids bind to CPGRP-S in the binding site at the A-B dimer while the non-fatty acids were shown to bind at the interfaces of both A-B and C-D dimers. The present structure of the complex of CPGRP-S with hexanoic acid (HA) showed that HA binds to CPGRP-S at the interface of C-D dimer. HA was located in the same groove at the C-D interface which was occupied by non-fatty acids such as PGN, LPS and LTA and interacts with residues from both C and D molecules. HA is firmly held in the groove with several hydrogen bonds and a number of van der Waals contacts. This is the first structure which reports the binding of a fatty acid in the cleft at the interface of C-D dimer.

AB  - The emerging role of microglia in brain homeostasis, neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopmental disorders has attracted considerable interest. In addition, recent developments in microglial functions and associated pathways have shed new light on their fundamental role in the immunological surveillance of the brain. Understanding the interconnections between microglia, neurons, and non-neuronal cells have opened up additional avenues for research in this evolving field. Furthermore, the study of microglia at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels has enhanced our knowledge of these native brain immune cells. Moreover, exploring various facets of microglia biology will facilitate the early detection, treatment, and management of neurological disorders. Consequently, the present review aimed to provide comprehensive insight on microglia biology and its influence on brain development, homeostasis, management of disease, and highlights microglia as potential therapeutic targets in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases.

AB  - Background Severe traumatic brain-injured (TBI) patients should be primarily admitted to a hub trauma center (hospital with neurosurgical capabilities) to allow immediate delivery of appropriate care in a specialized environment. Sometimes, severe TBI patients are admitted to a spoke hospital (hospital without neurosurgical capabilities), and scarce data are available regarding the optimal management of severe isolated TBI patients who do not have immediate access to neurosurgical care. Methods A multidisciplinary consensus panel composed of 41 physicians selected for their established clinical and scientific expertise in the acute management of TBI patients with different specializations (anesthesia/intensive care, neurocritical care, acute care surgery, neurosurgery and neuroradiology) was established. The consensus was endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery, and a modified Delphi approach was adopted. Results A total of 28 statements were proposed and discussed. Consensus was reached on 22 strong recommendations and 3 weak recommendations. In three cases, where consensus was not reached, no recommendation was provided. Conclusions This consensus provides practical recommendations to support clinician's decision making in the management of isolated severe TBI patients in centers without neurosurgical capabilities and during transfer to a hub center.

AB  - Background and aims: The role of intestinal-barrier in acute pancreatitis(AP) is poorly understood. We aimed to assess structural and functional changes in the intestinal-barrier in patients with early AP (time from onset<2 weeks) and the effect of enteral nutrition on them.Methods: In this prospective observational study, patients with early AP not on enteral nutrition were compared with controls for baseline intestinal-permeability(lactulose: mannitol ratio(L:M)), endotox- inemia(serum IgM/IgG anti-endotoxin antibodies), bacterial-translocation(serum bacterial 16S rRNA) and duodenal epithelial tight-junction structure by immunohistochemistry(IHC) for tight-junction pro- teins(claudin-2,-3,-4, zonula occludens-1(ZO1), junctional adhesion molecule(JAM) and occludin) and electron microscopy. These parameters were reassessed after 2 weeks enteral feeding in a AP patients subset.Results: 96 patients with AP(age: 38.0 +/- 14.5 years; etiology: biliary[46.8%]/alcohol[39.6%]; severe:53.2%, mortality:11.4%) and 40 matched controls were recruited. Patients with AP had higher baseline intestinal permeability(median L:M 0.176(IQR 0.073-0.376) vs 0.049(0.024-0.075) in controls; p < 0.001) and more frequent bacteraemia(positive bacterial 16S rRNA in 24/48 AP vs 0/21 controls; p < 0.001) with trend towards higher serum endotoxinemia(median IgG anti-endotoxin 78(51.2-171.6) GMU/ml vs 51.2(26.16-79.2) in controls; p1/40.061). Claudin-2, claudin-3, ZO1 were downregulated in both duodenal crypts and villi while claudin-4 and JAM were downregulated in duodenal villi and crypts respectively. 22 AP patients reassessed after initiation of enteral nutrition showed trend towards improving intestinal permeability, serum endotoxinemia and bacteraemia, with significant improvement in claudin-2,-3 in duodenal villi.Conclusion: Patients with AP have significant disturbances in intestinal barrier structure and function in first 2 weeks from onset that persist despite institution of enteral nutrition.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IAP and EPC.

AB  - Purpose We aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical, biochemical and radiological profile and outcomes of patients with ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) and Cushing disease (CD) treated over a period of 10 years (2013-2022).Methods In this ambispective observational study, we collected data for 146 patients with ACTH-dependent CS (EAS, n = 23; CD, n = 94; occult ACTH source, n = 29). Relevant details were filled in a predesigned proforma and outcomes were ascertained at the most recent visit.Results EAS was more common in males (65.2 vs. 27.6%, p < 0.001). Patients with EAS had a shorter duration of symptoms [12 (6-12) vs. 31.5 (15-48) months, p < 0.001] and were more likely to have hypokalemia (82.6 vs. 21.0%, p = 0.001), pedal edema (65.2 vs. 34.2%, p = 0.015), weight loss (34.8 vs. 4.0%, p < 0.001) and systemic infection (30.4 vs. 6.5%, p = 0.006). They also had significantly higher 8 a.m. serum cortisol, midnight serum and salivary cortisol and 8 a.m. plasma ACTH levels. Bronchial carcinoid (n = 10, 43.5%) was the most common etiology of EAS. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in 11 (47.8%) patients with EAS. Eight patients (34.8%) with EAS died at the last follow-up, of whom 7 (87.5%) had metastatic disease. In CD group, overall remission rate was 69.4% (56.1%, early and 13.3%, delayed) and 26.3% of patients with an initial remission had recurrence.Conclusions Bronchial carcinoid was the most common cause of EAS in our cohort. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed in approximately every 1 in 2 patients with EAS and approximately every 1 in 3 patients expired till the last follow-up.

AB  - This study aims to develop a neural network (foot2hip) for long-term recording of gait kinematics with improved user comfort. Methods: Foot2hip predicts ankle, knee, and hip joint angle profiles in the sagittal plane using foot kinematics and kinetics during walking. Foot2hip consists of three convolutions, two max-pooling, two LSTM, and three dense layers. An indigenously developed insole and an outsole were used to measure the kinetics and kinematics of the foot, respectively. Seven healthy participants were recruited to follow an experimental protocol consisting of six walking conditions: slow, medium, fast walking speed, rearfoot, flatfoot, and forefoot landing pattern. Results: When tested for leave-one-out and nested cross-validation, foot2hip obtained 3.04? +/- 0.20 RMSE and 0.97 +/- 0.01 correlation coefficient for knee joint, 1.7?+/- 0.09 RMSE and 0.95 +/- 0.01 correlation coefficient for hip joint, and 1.32?+/- 0.08 RMSE and 0.91 +/- 0.02 correlation coefficient for ankle joint (averaged across all folds). Conclusion: The prediction performance of foot2hip is encouraging and shows its applicability in accurately predicting lower limb kinematics with minimal wearables. Significance: The hardware used along with foot2hip is low cost ($268 + N x $35, N is the number of different foot sizes), comfortable, and easy to use. Therefore, the system is suitable for most clinical and personal applications.

AB  - Background Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROM's) are increasingly used to assess surgical outcomes in low-risk surgeries such as minimally invasive primary ventral and incisional hernia repair. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically summarize the available evidence for the effect of laparoscopic versus robotic primary ventral and incisional hernia repair on PROM's. Methods A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Randomised control trials, retrospective and prospective studies were included. Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Cochrane CENTRAL, and two trial registers were searched. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method. The overall quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE.Results Of the 2728 titles screened, eight studies involving 41,205 participants were included. Return to activities of daily living, return to work day and recurrence rate were statistically better in the robotic group. Length of stay, readmission, postoperative pain, quality of life, body image, and patient satisfaction were similar in both groups. The GRADE rating of the quality of evidence was moderate for postoperative pain and low to very low for the quality of life, length of stay, recurrence and readmission.Conclusion The available data of PROM's of laparoscopic and robotic primary ventral and incisional hernia repair is scarce and highly heterogeneous, thus making it difficult to assess the superiority of the laparoscopic technique over the robotic technique. Further studies with uniform reporting of PROM's in laparoscopic and robotic primary ventral and incisional hernia repair are needed.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a member of the nerve growth factor family. It plays a significant role in the regulation of brain metabolic activity, modification of synaptic efficacy, and enhances neuronal survival. A common naturally occurring allelic variation, i.e. G196A (Val66 Met, rs6265) of the BDNF gene is implicated in neuroplasticity. This study analyzes its expression levels and determines the frequency of BDNF G196A gene polymorphism in women with Turner syndrome (TS) compared to the controls. This case-control study comprised 14 TS patients and 8 healthy individuals. The expression levels of BDNF gene in TS patients were checked by qPCR. For BDNF gene, a dynamic expression range along with the presence of G196A polymorphism was found across all TS patients. The effects of Val66 Met mutation on BDNF protein structure and function were studied by molecular dynamics simulations of wild and mutant (Val66 Met) forms. The analysis of different trajectories generated by simulation showed that there was a significant change in the protein structure due to Val66 Met polymorphism, which might lead to functional impairment. This is first time we are reporting the association of BDNF G196A gene polymorphism with TS risk. Our study suggests that in turner patients, BDNF G196A polymorphism may be an important genetic factor predisposing to neuroplasticity risk and can be exploited as diagnostic/prognostic marker for TS. Further study on a large number of TS samples will prove this point beyond doubts or otherwise enriching the much desired repertoire of personalized medicine.

AB  - Introduction. Accurate estimation of dementia prevalence is essential for making effective public and social care policy to support individuals and families suffering from the disease. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the prevalence of dementia in India using a semi-supervised machine learning approach based on a large nationally representative sample.
   Methods. The sample of this study is adults 60 years or older in the wave 1 (2017-2019) of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI). A subsample in LASI received extensive cognitive assessment and clinical consensus ratings and therefore have diagnoses of dementia. A semi-supervised machine learning model was developed to predict the status of dementia for LASI participants without diagnoses. After obtaining the predictions, sampling weights and age standardization to the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population were applied to generate the estimate for prevalence of dementia in India.
   Results. The prevalence of dementia for those aged 60 years and older in India was 8.44% (95% CI: 7.89%similar to 9.01%). The age-standardized prevalence was estimated to be 8.94% (95% CI: 8.36%similar to 9.55%). The prevalence of dementia was greater for those who were older, were females, received no education, and lived in rural areas.
   Discussion/Conclusion. The prevalence of dementia in India may be higher than prior estimates derived from local studies. These prevalence estimates provide the information necessary for making long-term planning of public and social care policy. The semi-supervised machine learning approach adopted in this paper may also be useful for other large population ageing studies that have a similar data structure.

AB  - Purpose The utility of the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology is debatable in determining the risk of malignancy in pediatric patients. Moreover, the upper age limit for defining the pediatric group has varied across different studies. The aim of this study is to compare the risk of malignancy (ROM) and risk of neoplasia (RON) across different Bethesda categories between the pediatric, young adult, and adult patients.Methods This is a retrospective multi-institutional study performed in three Indian hospitals. ROM was calculated and compared across Bethesda categories in adult (> 18 years) and pediatric age groups (<= 18 years), with a subgroup analysis in young adults (19-21 years).Results Thyroid nodules from a total of 5958 patients were subjected to fine needle aspiration. Of these 199 were pediatric (3.3%) and follow-up histology was available in 2276. The ROM and RON rates, including overall ROM/RON, were significantly higher in pediatric age group as compared to adults. Overall ROM of suspicious for malignancy and malignant categories was higher in children as compared to adults. The overall surgical resection rates were also higher in pediatric patients (45.2% vs. 35.7%; p < 0.01). The similar trend of increased ROM, RON and resection rates was seen among young adults as compared to adult age group.Conclusion Thyroid nodules presenting in children are more likely to be malignant than those in adults. Importantly, the young adult group behaved in a similar manner with regard to surgical resection rates, ROM and RON to pediatric.

AB  - Mutations in the PAX6 gene are generally associated with aniridia. We describe a family with Juvenile onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG), where one of the two children had JOAG and the other Juvenile ocular hypertension. Whole exome sequencing was performed for the parents and their two affected children where the proband and her sibling were detected to have a de novo PAX6 gene variant in the absence of aniridia. All previously described gene mutations for glaucoma were looked for in the family. The potential pathogenicity of the identified variants was assessed by determining their frequency in large public exome databases; as well as using the current ACMG guidelines. The same heterozygous variant at NM_000280.6:c.1124 C > A; p. Pro375Gln in the PAX6 gene was detected in the proband and her affected brother. The variant has been described in aniridia patients before and has been shown to cause a weaker DNA binding using functional studies. This report expands the phenotypic spectrum of the PAX6 gene to include Juvenile onset open angle glaucoma.

AB  - Background Evidence on the comparative performance of purified protein derivative tuberculin skin tests (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) for predicting incident active tuberculosis (TB) remains conflicting. We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis to directly compare the predictive performance for incident TB disease between TST and IGRA to inform policy. Methods We searched Medline and Embase from 1 January 2002 to 4 September 2020, and studies that were included in previous systematic reviews. We included prospective longitudinal studies in which participants received both TST and IGRA and estimated performance as hazard ratios (HR) for the development of all diagnoses of TB in partici-pants with dichotomised positive test results compared to negative results, using different thresholds of positivity for TST. Secondary analyses included an evaluation of the impact of background TB incidence. We also estimated the sensitivity and specificity for predicting TB. We explored heterogeneity through pre-defined sub-group analyses (e.g. country-level TB incidence). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. This review is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020205667. Findings We obtained data from 13 studies out of 40 that were considered eligible (N = 32,034 participants: 36% from countries with TB incidence rate >= 100 per 100,000 population). All reported data on TST and QuantiFERON Gold in -Tube (QFT-GIT). The point estimate for the TST was highest with higher cut-offs for positivity and particularly when stratified by bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG) status (15 mm if BCG vaccinated and 5 mm if not [TST5/15 mm]) at 2.88 (95% CI 1.69-4.90). The pooled HR for QFT-GIT was higher than for TST at 4.15 (95% CI 1.97-8.75). The difference was large in countries with TB incidence rate <100 per 100,000 population (HR 10.38, 95% CI 4.17-25.87 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 5.36, 95% CI 3.82-7.51 for TST5/15 mm) but much of this difference was driven by a single study (HR 5.13, 95% CI 3.58-7.35 for TST5/15 mm VS. 7.18, 95% CI 4.48-11.51 for QFT-GIT, when excluding the study, in which all 19 TB cases had positive QFT-GIT results). The comparative performance was similar in the higher burden countries (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.23-2.10 for QFT-GIT VS. HR 1.72, 95% CI 0.98-3.01 for TST5/15 mm). The predictive performance of both tests was higher in countries with TB incidence rate <100 per 100,000 population. In the lower TB incidence countries, the specificity of TST (76% for TST5/15 mm) and QFT-GIT (74%) for predicting active TB approached the minimum World Health Organization target (>= 75%), but the sensitivity was below the target of >= 75% (63% for TST5/15 mm and 65% for QFT-GIT). The absolute differences in positive and negative predictive values between TST15 mm and QFT-GIT were small (positive predictive values 2.74% VS. 2.46%; negative predictive values 99.42% VS. 99.52% in low-incidence countries). Egger's test did not show evidence of publication bias (0.74 for TST15 mmand p = 0.68 for QFT-GIT). Interpretation IGRA appears to have higher predictive performance than the TST in low TB incidence countries, but the difference was driven by a single study. Any advantage in clinical performance may be small, given the numerically similar positive and negative predictive values. Both IGRA and TST had lower performance in countries with high TB incidence. Test choice should be contextual and made considering operational and likely clinical impact of test results. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - ObjectiveThe efficacy of decompressive surgery (DS) in cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) patients has been reported in several case reports and case series. We aimed at determining the association of DS compared with medical management and timing of surgery with functional outcome and mortality. We also aimed at determining the prevalence of DS in CVT patients. MethodsThe literature search was conducted till 7 November 2022 in PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases. Risk of bias was examined using Joanna Briggs Institute scale for case series and case reports. Association of DS compared with medical management and timing of surgery with functional outcome and mortality was determined using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Pooled prevalence of DS in CVT patients with 95%CI was calculated. Heterogeneity was explored using outlier, meta-regression, sensitivity and subgroup analyses. ResultsFifty-one studies consisting of 483 CVT cases with DS were included. The OR of poor outcome with surgery was 0.03; (95%CI: 0.00-0.22) and of mortality with surgery was 0.25; (95%CI: 0.02-2.60) versus that with medical management. Surgery done <= 48 h of admission was significantly associated with less mortality (OR: 0.26; 95%CI: 0.10-0.69). Pooled prevalence of DS in CVT was 12% (95%CI: 8%-17%; I-2 = 91%). Revised pooled prevalence after removing outliers was 10% (95%CI: 7%-13%; I-2 = 73%). ConclusionsSurgery <= 48 h of admission might decrease mortality in CVT patients and may result in improved functional outcome. Further prospective studies with appropriate control arms are required to confirm its efficacy over medical management.

KW  - CT
AB  - Introduction Accurate localization of the pathological parathyroid gland is a prerequisite for minimally invasive surgical management of hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Poor imaging or discordance in odd situations like ectopic adenomas, parathyroid hyperplasia, syndromic HPT results in localization dilemma thus causing failed parathyroidectomy. We studied the impact of Fluoro-Choline (FCH) PET/CT imaging in reduction in localization failure of parathyroid adenoma. Materials and methods We did a retrospective observational study (2018-2021) of HPT among which 97 patients underwent focused parathyroidectomy (FP). All patients had undergone ultrasound imaging and 99mTc-sestaMIBI scan with early SPECT/CT (MIBI). When this preliminary imaging was doubtful or negative or multiple lesions were expected, FCH PET/CT was performed. We compared the localization accuracy of MIBI scan and FCH PET/CT with surgical outcomes as reference standard. Results MIBI scan showed overall lesion detection rate (LDR) of 88.65% in localization of pathological parathyroid gland in 97 patients. The addition of FCH PET/CT improved the overall lesion detection to 97.9%. The overall possible localization failure was reduced from 11.34 to 2.06% with the addition of FCH PET/CT (p < 0.05). Out of 97 patients of FP, 87 patients showed features of parathyroid adenoma. Single hyperplastic gland was seen in 7 patients, lipoadenoma was seen in 1 patient and 1 patient had features suggestive of parathyroiditis on histopathology. FCH PET/CT was a useful adjunct and showed significant reduction in localization failure of parathyroid adenoma.

AB  - Accessory cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare form of developmental mullerian anomaly which causes chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility in young females. It is a non-communicating, accessory cavity within an otherwise normal uterus, lined by functional endometrium and surrounded by myometrium-like smooth muscle cells which imparts it uterus-like appearance. USG and MRI are the imaging modalities which help in reaching the diagnosis. Knowledge of this entity and awareness of its imaging features can help diagnose this often underdiagnosed and surgically correctable cause of dysmenorrhea.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is considered a complicated neurodevelopment disorder with rising prevalence globally. ASD is characterized by a series of events including varying degrees of defects in communication, learning, and social interaction which is accompanied by stereotypical behavioral patterns. Despite extensive research, the current diagnosis for ASD is complex and almost solely based on the behavioral assessments of the suspected individuals. The multifactorial etiopathology of this disease along with the diversity of symptoms among different individuals adds to the current intricacies for accurate prognosis of ASD. Hence, there exists a dire need for biologically relevant biomarkers for an early diagnosis and for tracking the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Until recently, among various biofluids, saliva has gained increasing interest for biomarker identification, the advantages include the non-invasive nature and ease of sample handling. This mini-review aims to provide a succinct summary of recent literature on saliva-based diagnostic modalities for ASD, examine various studies that highlight the potential use of proteomic and/or RNA-based biomarkers. Finally, some conclusive perspectives of using the salivary system for ASD mechanistic details and diagnosis are also discussed.

TI  - Sex disparity in childhood cancer in India: a multi-centre, individual patient data analysis
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
AB  - Background Sex disparity and its determinants in childhood cancer in India remain unexplored, with scarce information available through summary statistics of cancer registries. This study analysed the degree of sex bias in childhood cancer in India and its clinical and demographical associations.Methods In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we collected individual data of children (aged 0-19 years) with cancer extracted from the hospital-based records of three cancer centres in India between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2019, and two population-based cancer registries (PBCRs; Delhi [between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2014] and Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry [between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2017]). We extracted data on age, sex, and confirmed diagnosis of malignancy (according to the International Classification of Diseases-10 coding), and excluded participants if they were without a recorded diagnosis, had a benign diagnosis, had missing sex information, resided outside of India, or were a donor for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary outcome was the male-to-female incidence rate ratio (MF-IRR) in the two PBCRs and the male-to-female ratios (MFR) from the hospital-based and the HSCT data. For PBCR data, MF-IRR was estimated by dividing the MFR by the total population at risk. MFR was analysed for patients seeking treatment at the cancer centres and for those undergoing HSCT. Logistic regression analyses were done to explore the association of clinical and demographical variables with sex of the patients seeking treatment and those undergoing HSCT in hospital-based data and multivariable analyses were done to determine independent sociodemographic predictors of sex bias. Annual time trends of MFR and MF-IRR during the 15-year study period were ascertained by time series regression analyses.Findings We included 11 375 children from PBCRs in the study. 26 891 children from hospital-based records were screened, and data from 22 893 (85middot1%) were included (including 514 who underwent HSCT). Residence details were missing for 257 (1middot1%) of 22 893 patients from hospital-based records. The crude MFR of children at diagnosis was in favour of boys: 2middot00 (95% CI 1middot92-2middot09) in the Delhi PBCR and 1middot44 (1middot32-1middot57) in Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry. The MF-IRRs for cancer diagnosis were also skewed in favour of boys in both PBCRs (Delhi 1middot69 [95% CI 1middot61-1middot76]; Madras Metropolitan Tumour Registry 1middot37 [1middot26-1middot49]). The MFR for children seeking treatment from hospital-based records was 2middot06 (95% CI 2middot00-2middot12) in favour of boys. In subgroup analyses, the proportion of boys seeking treatment was higher in northern India than southern India (p<0middot0001); in private centres than in centres providing subsidised treatment (p<0middot0001); in patients with haematological malignancies than those with solid malignancies (p<0middot0001); in those residing 100 km or further from the hospital than those within 100 km of a hospital (p<0middot0001); and those living in rural areas than those living in urban areas (p=0middot0006). The MFR of 514 children who underwent HSCT was 2middot81 (95% CI 2middot32-3middot43) in favour of boys. Time trend analysis showed that MFR did not show any significant annual change in either the overall cohort or in any of the individual centres for hospital-based data; however, the analysis did show a declining MF-IRR in the Delhi PBCR from 2005 to 2014 (p=0middot031).
   Interpretation The sex ratio for childhood cancer in India has a bias towards boys at the level of diagnosis, which is more pronounced in northern India and in situations demanding greater financial commitment. Addressing societal sex bias and enhancing affordable health care for girls should be pursued simultaneously in India.Funding None.Copyright (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bone tissue engineering (BTE) has attained enough attention towards fabricating a scaffold for the treatment of bone injury. To develop an ideal scaffold, various techniques and polymers have been explored. Electrospinning has been much focused on fabricating a scaffold by taking various polymers for bone tissue engineering in recent years. In this study, a tri-polymer (PCL-gelatin-chitosan; PCL-GT-CS) scaffold was first fabricated through electrospinning. Then, the surface of the fabricated scaffold was treated with 1 wt% of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp) for 10, 20 and 30 min. After treatment, nHAp modified PCL-GT-CS electrospun scaffold was studied by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) to investigate the surface morphology, fiber diameter and pore size. FE-SEM analysis revealed a uniform distribution of nHAp particles on the surface of fibers in the PCL-GT-CS scaffold after 20 min. The fiber diameter and pore size of nHAp treated scaffold (20 min) were determined and found to be 680 +/- 184 nm and 5.3 +/- 2.1 mu m respectively. Further, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Energy dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric (TG) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) suggested the presence of nHAp over the surface of PCL-GT-CS electrospun scaffold. The cell viability of human osteoblasts over the nHAp modified PCL-GT-CS scaffold was analyzed by MTT assay which was found higher than the unmodified (PCL-GT-CS) scaffold. Furthermore, DNA quantification was performed to examine the proliferation of osteoblasts which was also found significantly higher on nHAp modified scaffold than on the unmodified scaffold. Moreover, FE-SEM analysis of the scaffold, seeded with cells, depicted effective cell attachment of osteoblasts, and well-spread morphology with their characteristic polygonal shape over the modified PCL-GT-CS scaffold. Thus, an in-vitro study of nHAp modified PCL-GT-CS electrospun scaffold indicated its potential for BTE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ISCHEMIA trial (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches) compared an initial invasive versus an initial conservative management strategy for patients with chronic coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, with no major difference in most outcomes during a median of 3.2 years. Extended follow-up for mortality is ongoing. METHODS: ISCHEMIA participants were randomized to an initial invasive strategy added to guideline-directed medical therapy or a conservative strategy. Patients with moderate or severe ischemia, ejection fraction >= 35%, and no recent acute coronary syndromes were included. Those with an unacceptable level of angina were excluded. Extended follow-up for vital status is being conducted by sites or through central death index search. Data obtained through December 2021 are included in this interim report. We analyzed all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality by randomized strategy, using nonparametric cumulative incidence estimators, Cox regression models, and Bayesian methods. Undetermined deaths were classified as cardiovascular as prespecified in the trial protocol. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics for 5179 original ISCHEMIA trial participants included median age 65 years, 23% women, 16% Hispanic, 4% Black, 42% with diabetes, and median ejection fraction 0.60. A total of 557 deaths accrued during a median follow-up of 5.7 years, with 268 of these added in the extended follow-up phase. This included a total of 343 cardiovascular deaths, 192 noncardiovascular deaths, and 22 unclassified deaths. All-cause mortality was not different between randomized treatment groups (7-year rate, 12.7% in invasive strategy, 13.4% in conservative strategy; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.85-1.18]). There was a lower 7-year rate cardiovascular mortality (6.4% versus 8.6%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.63-0.96]) with an initial invasive strategy but a higher 7-year rate of noncardiovascular mortality (5.6% versus 4.4%; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.08-1.91]) compared with the conservative strategy. No heterogeneity of treatment effect was evident in prespecified subgroups, including multivessel coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in all-cause mortality with an initial invasive strategy compared with an initial conservative strategy, but there was lower risk of cardiovascular mortality and higher risk of noncardiovascular mortality with an initial invasive strategy during a median follow-up of 5.7 years.

AB  - Background: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are one of the most common adverse events in patient care that account for substantial morbidity and mortality. We evaluate the existing Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) practices in hospitals participating in the nationally representative HAI Surveillance network.Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in 23 hospitals across 22 states of India from October -2015 to September-2018 in the HAI surveillance network. The World Health Organization (WHO) IPC core components assessment tool for health-care facility level (IPCAT-H) was adapted from IPC assessment tool developed by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC) under the Epidemiology and Labora-tory Capacity (ELC) Infection Control Assessment and Response (ICAR) Program. Mann-Whitney U test was used to calculate the significant difference between scores (P < .05).Results: Amongst the participating hospitals, 7 were private sectors and 16 were public health care facilities. Infection IPCAT-H average score per multimodal strategy was less than 50% for programmed IPC activities (45.7); implementation of health care workers (HCWs) immunization programme (43.5%); monitoring and evaluation component (38.30%).Conclusions: There is potential for improvement in Human Resources, Surveillance of HAIs as well as Moni-toring and Evaluation components. & COPY; 2022 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (FCM) is a useful diagnostic tool for the evaluation of mature B-cell neoplasms (MBN). Here, CD200 expression may play a significant role and improve the distinction between various MBNs, but any potential as a prognostic marker is yet to be established. The present prospective study was conducted on all the suspected cases of MBNs. Immunophenotyping was done using a BD FACS Canto FCM using a panel of 4 to 6 color combinations of monoclonal antibodies; CD45, CD34, CD5, CD19, CD20, CD22, CD23, CD79b, FMC7, CD10, CD38, ZAP70, CD200, IgG, IgM, CD25, CD103, CD2, CD3, CD11c as well as kappa and lambda light chains. CD200 expression was compared in different subgroups. Of the total of 130 cases included in the study, CD200 was positive in 118 cases (90%). CD200 was expressed in 100% of the cases of CLL(86 cases), atypical CLL(06 cases), HCL(14 cases), FL(02 cases), SMZL(04 cases), LPL (01 case), and low-grade NHL (05 cases), with the highest intensity of fluorescence in HCL followed by CLL. All the cases of MCL and PLL were exclusively negative for CD200. In conclusion, the results of the present study support inclusion of this marker in the flow cytometric panels for the differential diagnosis of MBNs.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is common and linked to poor prognosis in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We investigated the differential effect of basal vitamin D levels in monocrotaline (MCT) induced PAH in normal and vitamin D deficient (VDD) rats. Rats were fed a VDD diet and exposed to filtered fluorescent light to deplete vitamin D. Normal rats were pretreated with vitamin D 100 IU/d and treated with vitamin D 100 and 200 IU/d, while VDD rats received vitamin D 100 IU/d. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) silencing was done in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) using VDR siRNA. Calcitriol (50 nM/mL) was added to human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) and HUVECs before and after the exposure to TGF-,B (10 ng/mL). Vitamin D 100 IU/d pretreatment in normal rats up-regulated the expression of eNOS and inhibited endothelial to mesenchymal transition significantly and maximally. Vitamin D 100 IU/d treatment in VDD rats was comparable to vitamin D 200 IU/d treated normal rats. These effects were significantly attenuated by L-NAME (20 mg/kg), a potent eNOS inhibitor. Exposure to TGF-,B significantly reduced the expression of eNOS and increased the mesenchymal marker expression in normal and VDR-silenced HUVECs and HPASMCs, which were averted by treatment and maximally inhibited by pretreatment with calcitriol (50 nM). To conclude, this study provided novel evidence suggesting the beneficial role of higher basal vitamin D levels, which are inversely linked with PAH severity.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Collaborative care (CC) is a multicomponent team-based approach to providing mental health care with systematic integration into outpatient medical settings. The 12-month INDEPENDENT CC intervention improved joint disease control measures in patients with both depression and diabetes at 12 and 24 months following randomization. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the durability of intervention effects on patient outcomes at 36 months following randomization. PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with poorly controlled T2D and depression in India randomized to CC or usual care. DESIGN: Post hoc analyses of between-group differences in patient outcomes at 36 months post-randomization (N = 331) and maintenance of outcomes from 12 to 36 months (N = 314). MAIN MEASURES: We evaluated combined risk factor improvement since baseline, defined as >= 50.0% reduction in Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (SCL-20) scores along with reduction of at least 0.5 percentage point hemoglobin A1C, 5 mmHg systolic blood pressure, or 10 mg/dL low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Improvements in single risk factors were also examined. KEY RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in improvements since baseline in multiple or single risk factors at 36 months. Patients in the CC group with improved outcomes at 12 months were more likely to maintain a >= 50.0% reduction since baseline in SCL-20 scores (CC [54.9%] vs. UC [40.9%]; RR: 1.27 [95% CI: 1.04, 1.56]) and 0.5 percentage point reduction since baseline in hemoglobin A1C (CC [31.9%] vs. UC [19.5%]; RR: 1.64 [95% CI: 1.11, 2.41]) at 36 months. CONCLUSIONS: While improvements since baseline in patient outcomes did not differ between the collaborative care and usual care groups at 36 months, patients who received CC were more likely to maintain improvements in depressive symptoms and glucose levels at 36 months if they had achieved these improvements at the end of active intervention.

AB  - Background/purpose: The signaling mechanisms for Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (PgLPS)-induced inflammation in human dental pulp cells are not fully clarified. This in vitro study aimed to evaluate the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/proMethods: Human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) were challenged with PgLPS with or without pretreatment and coincubation with a PI3K/Akt inhibitor (LY294002). The gene or protein levels of PI3K, Akt, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin and osteonectin were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real-time PCR, west-ern blotting, and immunofluorescent staining. In addition, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to analyze IL-6 and IL-8 levels in culture medium.Results: In response to 5 mg/ml PgLPS, IL-6, IL-8, and PI3K, but not Akt mRNA expression of HDPCs, was upregulated. IL-6, IL-8, PI3K, and p-Akt protein levels were stimulated by 10-50 mg/ml of PgLPS in HDPCs. PgLPS also induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion at concentrations higher than 5mg/ml. Pretreatment and co-incubation by LY294002 attenuated PgL PS -induced IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression in HDPCs. The mRNA expression of ALP, but not osteo-calcin and osteonectin, was inhibited by higher concentrations of PgLPS in HDPCs. Conclusion: P. gingivalis contributes to pulpal inflammation in HDPCs by dysregulating PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway to stimulate IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA/protein expression and secretion. These results are useful for understanding the pulpal inflammation and possible biomarkers of in-flamed pulp diagnosis and treatment.Copyright 2022, Formosan Medical Association.

AB  - Background and PurposeIn recent decades, a focus on the most critical and fundamental concepts has proven highly advantageous to students and educators in many science disciplines. Pharmacology, unlike microbiology, biochemistry, or physiology, lacks a consensus list of such core concepts. Experimental ApproachWe sought to develop a research-based, globally relevant list of core concepts that all students completing a foundational pharmacology course should master. This two-part project consisted of exploratory and refinement phases. The exploratory phase involved empirical data mining of the introductory sections of five key textbooks, in parallel with an online survey of over 200 pharmacology educators from 17 countries across six continents. The refinement phase involved three Delphi rounds involving 24 experts from 15 countries across six continents. Key ResultsThe exploratory phase resulted in a consolidated list of 74 candidate core concepts. In the refinement phase, the expert group produced a consensus list of 25 core concepts of pharmacology. Conclusion and ImplicationsThis list will allow pharmacology educators everywhere to focus their efforts on the conceptual knowledge perceived to matter most by experts within the discipline. Next steps for this project include defining and unpacking each core concept and developing resources to help pharmacology educators globally teach and assess these concepts within their educational contexts.

AB  - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the commonest maladies, affecting 5%-10% of pregnancies worldwide. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) identifies four categories of HDP, namely gestational hypertension (GH), Preeclampsia (PE), chronic hypertension (CH), and CH with superimposed PE. PE is a multisystem, heterogeneous disorder that encompasses 2%-8% of all pregnancy-related complications, contributing to about 9% to 26% of maternal deaths in low-income countries and 16% in high-income countries. These translate to 50 000 maternal deaths and over 500 000 fetal deaths worldwide, therefore demanding high priority in understanding clinical presentation, screening, diagnostic criteria, and effective management. PE is accompanied by uteroplacental insufficiency leading to vascular and metabolic changes, vasoconstriction, and end-organ ischemia. PE is diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women who were previously normotensive or hypertensive. Besides shallow trophoblast invasion and inadequate remodeling of uterine arteries, dysregulation of the nonimmune system has been the focal point in PE. This results from aberrant immune system activation and imbalanced differentiation of T cells. Further, a failure of tolerance toward the semi-allogenic fetus results due to altered distribution of Tregs such as CD4+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127(low) FoxP3+ cells, thereby creating a cytotoxic environment by suboptimal production of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. Also, intracellular production of complement protein C5a may result in decreased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. With immune system dysfunction as a major driver in PE pathogenesis, it is logical that therapeutic targeting of components of the immune system with pharmacologic agents like anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating molecules are either being used or under clinical trial. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors like Pravastatin may improve placental perfusion in PE, while Eculizumab (monoclonal antibody inhibiting C5) and small molecular inhibitor of C5a, Zilucoplan are under investigation. Monoclonal antibody against IL-17(Secukinumab) has been proposed to alter the Th imbalance in PE. Autologous Treg therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-CTLA-4 are emerging as new candidates in immune horizons for PE management in the future.

AB  - Introduction: Recent evidence has linked long-term use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors with the risk of developing lung cancer by increasing levels of substance P (SP) and bradykinin in lung tissue. DPP-4 inhibitors, by virtue of their mechanism of action, may increase the level of SP and pose a similar risk of incident lung cancer. Concomitant use of DPP-4 inhibitors and ACE inhibitors may further exaggerate this plausible risk.Area covered: Here we discuss both direct and indirect evidence involving mechanisms by which DPP-4 inhibitors may increase the risk of lung cancer in treated patients. We highlight that increased levels of SP with DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy and raised levels of both SP and bradykinin with add-on ACE inhibitor therapy may further enhance this risk.Expert opinion: DPP-4 inhibitors are prescribed in type-2 diabetes mellitus patients with or without cardiovascular disease. When used together, ACE inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors may act synergistically and further amplify the lung cancer risk. Consequently, physicians should consider this plausible association while prescribing them concomitantly especially in high-risk individuals. Well-planned research studies are required to assess the association of DPP-4 inhibitors with lung cancer and other adverse effects linked to increased levels of SP and bradykinin.

AB  - Aim: Critical to maternal outcome and development of a healthy and relationship between mother and baby, is the woman's perception of her birth experience. The Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) has been demonstrated to be psychometrically robust, easily administered, and scored self-report measure of birth experience. Aim of the study was to translate the UK-BSS-R into Hindi, collect data, and psychometrically validate an Indian (Hindi)-BSS-R. Methods: Psychometric assessment of the Indian (Hindi)-BSS-R was undertaken following translation using a cross-sectional design. Evaluation of known-groups validity was undertaken using an embedded between-subjects component. Data were collected from (n = 312) postnatal Hindi speaking women in India. Measurement characteristics were assessed using confirmatory factor analysis, divergent validity and internal consistency analysis. Results: The measurement properties of the Indian (Hindi)-BSS-R were observed to be equivocal, with the established tri-dimensional measurement model not achieving best fit to data. Instead, an alternative two-factor model offered an excellent fit to data. Significant differences were observed between Indian (Hindi)-BSS-R scores and family type and gestation term status, which highlights the relevance of these contextual aspects to the Indian birth experience. Internal consistency was observed to be low on some sub-scales, indicating the potential need for future revision. Conclusions: The Indian (Hindi)-BSS-R is a measure of birth experience, which accepting some measurement caveats, is acceptable for use with Hindi speaking women in India. Further research is required to determine if modification of some of the items is required to improve internal consistency.

AB  - Neurosarcoidosis (NS) is a protean illness with multiple clinical and radiological presentations giving it the moniker of "a chameleon" or the great mimic. NS can present as a wide spectrum of neurological syndromes localizing both to the central and peripheral nervous systems. The absence of a diagnostic serum test makes it difficult to diagnose with certainty and remains largely a histopathological diagnosis and one of exclusion. A high index of suspicion should be there in suspecting NS, and it should always be excluded among patients presenting with acute to subacute neurological deficits.

AB  - Neuroendocrine neoplasms are derived from the epithelial lineages mainly of respiratory tract, with predominant neuroendocrine differentiation. There are only a handful of documented cases of paranasal small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (SNEC) with primary orbital involvement. Here, the authors describe a 33-year-old male patient with rapidly progressive swelling of the right lower lid with proptosis since 4 weeks. On contrast-MRI orbit, an ill-defined multilobulated mass measuring 3.6 x 3.1 cm with intense homogenous enhancement was seen in the right retrobulbar space involving the right ethmoid sinus. On incisional biopsy, a poorly differentiated mass containing numerous small round blue cells and scanty intervening stroma with prominent necrosis and apoptosis was seen. Immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for synaptophysin. He was diagnosed as a case of SNEC and received chemotherapy, with good response till date of 9 months of follow up. The authors present a literature review and describe challenges in management of a primary orbital SNEC.

AB  - The purpose of this meta-analysis was to strengthen the credibility of primary research results by combining open-source scientific material, namely a comparison of craniofacial features (Cfc) between Crouzon's syndrome (CS) patients and non-CS populations. All articles published up to October 7, 2021, were included in the search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Medline, and Web of Science. The PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct this study. PECO framework was applied in the following ways: Those who have CS are denoted by the letter P, those who have been diagnosed with CS via clinical or genetic means by the letter E, those who do not have CS by the letter C, and those who have a Cfc of CS by the letter O. Independent reviewers collected the data and ranked the publications based on their adherence to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. A total of six case-control studies were reviewed for this meta-analysis. Due to the large variation in cephalometric measures, only those published in at least two previous studies were included. This analysis found that CS patients had a smaller skull and mandible volumes than those without CS.in terms of SNA degrees (MD = -2.33, p = <0.001, I-2 = 83.6%) and ANB degrees(MD = -1.89, p = <0.005, I-2 = 93.1%)), as well as ANS (MD = -1.87, p = 0.001, I-2 = 96.5%)) and SN/PP (MD = -1.99, p = 0.036, I-2 = 77.3%)). In comparison to the general population, people with CS tend to have shorter and flatter cranial bases, smaller orbital volumes, and cleft palates. They differ from the general population in having a shorter skull base and more V-shaped maxillary arches.

AB  - Functional electrical stimulation has been widely used in the neurologically disabled population as a rehabilitation method because of its intrinsic and higher ability to activate paralyzed muscles. However, the nonlinear and time-varying nature of the muscle against exogenous electrical stimulus makes it very challenging to achieve optimal control solutions in real-time, that results in difficulty in achieving functional electrical stimulus-assisted limb movement control in the real-time rehabilitation process. Model-based control methods have been suggested in many functional electrical stimulations elicited limb movement applications. However, in the presence of uncertainties and dynamic variations during the process the model-based control methods are unable to give a robust performance. In this work, a model-free adaptable control approach is designed to regulate knee joint movement with electrical stimulus assistance without prior knowledge of the dynamics of the subjects. The model free adaptive control with a data-driven approach is provided with recursive feasibility, compliance with input constraints, and exponential stability. The experimental results obtained from both non-disabled participants and a participant with spinal cord injury validate the ability of the proposed controller to allocate electrical stimulus for regulating seated knee joint movement in the pre-defined trajectory.

AB  - N95 masks filter 95% of the small particles and respiratory droplets (>0.3 mu m diameter). Therefore, they are widely used both by general public and health workers during pandemic. When physical activity or exercise is performed wearing N95 mask, it induces hypercapnic environment. The heat burden is also increased leading to discomfort and reduced compliance. This study was done to compare physiological effects and subjective perceptions while wearing N95 mask and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) (2 fans, N95 filter) during incremental exercise. ECG, respiratory movement, SpO2, temperature inside the mask were recorded and perception of discomfort was also assessed. Heart rate variability (HRV) values during baseline were within normal limits in both the mask conditions signifying that cardiac autonomic tone is comparable. During incremental exercise, fall in SpO2 was significantly lesser in PAPR as compared to N95 mask at 60-70% and 70-80% of maximum achievable heart rate. The temperatures inside both the mask conditions were significantly higher than ambient temperature. The scores of humid, hot, breath resistance and fatigue were significantly lower in PAPR than N95 mask. In conditions where prolonged use of mask is required with strenuous physical exertion or exercise, PAPR could be preferred over N95 mask.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease characterised by low bone mineral density (BMD), degeneration of bone micro-architecture, and impaired bone strength. Cissus quadrangularis (CQ), popularly known as Hadjod (bone setter) in Hindi, is a traditional medicinal herb exhibiting osteoprotective potential in various bone diseases, especially osteoporosis and fractures. However, the cellular mechanisms underpinning its direct effect on bone health through altering the host immune system have never been elucidated. In the present study, we interrogated the osteoprotective and immunoporotic (the osteoprotective potential of CQ via modulating the host immune system) potential of CQ in preventing inflammatory bone loss under oestrogen-deficient conditions. The current study outlines the CQ's osteoprotective potential under both ex vivo and in vivo (ovariectomized) conditions. Our ex vivo data demonstrated that, in a dose-dependent manner CQ, suppresses the RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis (p < 0.001) as well as inhibiting the osteoclast functional activity (p < 0.001) in mouse bone marrow cells (BMCs). Our in vivo mu-CT and flow cytometry data further showed that CQ administration improves bone health and preserves bone micro-architecture by markedly raising the proportion of anti-osteoclastogenic immune cells, such as Th1 (p < 0.05), Th2 (p < 0.05), Tregs (p < 0.05), and Bregs (p < 0.01), while concurrently lowering the osteoclastogenic Th17 cells in bone marrow, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and spleen in comparison to the control group. Serum cytokine analysis further supported the osteoprotective and immunoporotic potential of CQ, showing a significant increase in the levels of anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (p < 0.05) (IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10) and a concurrent decrease in the levels of osteoclastogenic cytokines (p < 0.05) (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-17). In conclusion, our data for the first time delineates the novel cellular and immunological mechanism of the osteoprotective potential of CQ under postmenopausal osteoporotic conditions.

AB  - Muscle synergy-based functional electrical stimulation had improved movement kinematics instantly and in long-term use in post-stroke patients. However, the therapeutic benefits and efficacy of muscle synergy-based functional electrical stimulation patterns over traditional stimulation patterns need exploration. This paper presents the therapeutic benefits of muscle synergy-based functional electrical stimulation compared to traditional stimulation patterns from the perspective of muscular fatigue and kinematic performance produced. Three stimulation waveforms/envelopes: customized rectangular, trapezoidal, and muscle synergy-based FES patterns were administered on six healthy and six post-stroke patients to achieve full elbow flexion. The muscular fatigue was measured through evoked-electromyography, and the kinematic outcome was measured through angular displacement during elbow flexion. The time domain (peak-to-peak amplitude, mean absolute value, root-mean-square) and frequency domain (mean frequency, median frequency) myoelectric indices of fatigue were calculated from evoked-electromyography. Myoelectric indices of fatigue and peak angular displacements of elbow joint were compared across waveforms. The presented study found that the muscle synergy-based stimulation pattern sustained the kinematic output for longer durations and induced less muscular fatigue followed by trapezoidal and customized rectangular patterns in healthy and post-stroke participants. These findings imply that the therapeutic effect of muscle synergy-based functional electrical stimulation stems from not only being biomimetic but also due to it being efficient in inducing less fatigue. The slope of current injection was a crucial factor in determining the performance of muscle synergy-based FES waveforms. The presented research methodology and outcomes would help researchers and physiotherapists in choosing effective stimulation patterns for maximizing post-stroke rehabilitation benefits. Note: FES waveform/ pattern/ stimulation pattern all refers to FES envelop in this paper.

AB  - Background: rs4340ID polymorphism of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) correlates with serum ACE levels in many known cancers. This study analyzed ACE rs4340 ID polymorphism in lung cancer (LC) in older patients of North India and correlated it with addiction status.
   Methods: The study enrolled all subjects aged 60 years and above with 154 LC and 205 healthy controls. Genotyping was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and validated by sequencing of 10% of the sample. Statistical analysis was done by SPSS Statistics 21.
   Results: Genotype II was observed to have a significant 2.21-fold increased risk of LC as compared to the DD genotype and 3.43-folds enhanced risk with interaction of I allele with tobacco consumption habits as compared to D allele in LC was seen.
   Conclusion: The risk of LC was higher with II genotype as compared to DD genotype. Interactive effect showed that I allele with tobacco habits may increase the risk of LC.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a preventable but escalating global health crisis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) studies to date have been limited, and some are underpowered. In this study, we aimed to perform the PsychArray-based GWAS study to identify single nucleotide variations associated with suicide in the Indian population. Methods: We recruited unrelated subjects who died by suicide as cases (N = 313) and the non-suicidal deaths as controls (N = 294). The 607 samples were genotyped, including cases and controls using the Illumina Infinium PsychArray-24 BeadChip v1.3 Results: In our study, four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) crossed the threshold of significance level <1 x 10(-5). One of them is intronic at Chromosome2:rs1901851 and three are intergenic at Chromosome12:rs3847911, Chromosome8:rs2941489, Chromosome8:rs1464092. At a significance level of 5 x 10(-5), we found a few more SNPs, with the majority of them being intergenic variants. The associated genes were associated with various important functions ranging from cell signaling, GTP binding, GPCR binding, and transcription factor binding. Conclusions: The SNPs identified in our study were not reported earlier. To our best knowledge, this study is one of the first GWAS for suicide in the Indian population. The results indicate few novel SNPs that may be associated with suicide and require further investigation. Their clinical significance is to be studied in the future.

AB  - The heart sounds recorded through a phonocardiogram (PCG) can assist in the early detection of valvular heart diseases (VHD), which is important for minimizing the chances of cardiac complications like heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Despite a large number of previous studies with highly accurate classifications, PCG-based deep learning (DL) methods for VHD detection are not suitable for clinical practice as they lack transparency and interpretability. The proposed work utilizes analytic continuous wavelet transform (CWT) scalograms as the time-frequency representations (TFRs) of the PCG signals. A 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed for the multiclass classification (aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, and normal) of PCG signal's TFR. Besides introducing a VHD classification method in this article, we also carry out the interpretation of the proposed CNN architecture by using occlusion maps and deep dream images for local and global explanations, respectively. The highest accuracy achieved during fivefold cross validation is 99.6%, and the overall accuracy is 98.32% for a publicly available PCG database. The accuracy of the proposed method for binary classification (abnormal and normal) tested on the PhysioNet database is 93.07%. DL visualization methods assisted in determining what features or regions of TFR of PCGs the proposed network was for making a class-specific correct prediction. Class-specific morphological and time-frequency features were observed. DL visualization makes the network decision more reliable. The novel classification framework along with its interpretations would enable successful clinical translation of PCG-based VHD detection.

AB  - Background and Aim: Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunoexpression status determines the response to immunotherapy in many cancers. Limited data exist on PD-L1 status in aggressive thyroid tumors. We investigated PD-L1 expression across thyroid cancers and correlated it with their molecular profile.
   Materials and Methods: Sixty-five cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) were assessed for PD-L1 expression (clone SP263, VENTANA). The differentiated cases encompassed the aggressive hobnail and tall cell subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) besides classical PTC and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Ten nodular goiters (NG) were also evaluated. Tumor proportion score (TPS) and H-score were calculated. BRAFV600E and H-/ K-/ N-RAS were assessed using allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to investigate the associations between the categorical variables and compare PD-L1 scores with the mutation status.
   Results: Most PTC (87%) and ATC (73%) cases were PD-L1 positive (TPS >= 1%), with significantly higher positivity rates than NG (20%). TPS >50% was seen in 60% ATC and 7% PTC cases. The median TPS and H-score of ATC were 56 (0-96.6) and 168 (0-275), respectively, and of PTC were 9.6 (4-16.8) and 17.8 (6.6-38.6), respectively. The scores were similar across the PTC subtypes. Only one case each of FTC and PDTC was PD-L1 positive. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, but not with RAS mutation.
   Conclusions: ATC showed intense and diffuse PD-L1 staining. Although most PTCs were PD-L1 positive, the expression was weaker and patchy, irrespective of the histological subtype. Results of this pilot study indicate that ATC is most likely to respond to immunotherapy. PTC, FTC, and PDTC may be less amenable to immunotherapy. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, allowing for combined targeted therapy.

AB  - Background and Aim:Programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) immunoexpression status determines the response to immunotherapy in many cancers. Limited data exist on PD-L1 status in aggressive thyroid tumors. We investigated PD-L1 expression across thyroid cancers and correlated it with their molecular profile. Materials and Methods:Sixty-five cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) were assessed for PD-L1 expression (clone SP263, VENTANA). The differentiated cases encompassed the aggressive hobnail and tall cell subtypes of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) besides classical PTC and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Ten nodular goiters (NG) were also evaluated. Tumor proportion score (TPS) and H-score were calculated. BRAFV600E and H-/K-/N-RAS were assessed using allele-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to investigate the associations between the categorical variables and compare PD-L1 scores with the mutation status. Results:Most PTC (87%) and ATC (73%) cases were PD-L1 positive (TPS >= 1%), with significantly higher positivity rates than NG (20%). TPS >50% was seen in 60% ATC and 7% PTC cases. The median TPS and H-score of ATC were 56 (0-96.6) and 168 (0-275), respectively, and of PTC were 9.6 (4-16.8) and 17.8 (6.6-38.6), respectively. The scores were similar across the PTC subtypes. Only one case each of FTC and PDTC was PD-L1 positive. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, but not with RAS mutation. Conclusions:ATC showed intense and diffuse PD-L1 staining. Although most PTCs were PD-L1 positive, the expression was weaker and patchy, irrespective of the histological subtype. Results of this pilot study indicate that ATC is most likely to respond to immunotherapy. PTC, FTC, and PDTC may be less amenable to immunotherapy. PD-L1 expression correlated significantly with BRAFV600E, allowing for combined targeted therapy.

AB  - Background: IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 antibody (anti-TG2Ab) deposits in intestinal and extraintestinal organs have been used to link the respective pathological changes in these organs with celiac disease (CeD). Aims: To know if parts of intestine other than the duodenum, such as esophagus, stomach, and colon, have any pathology related to potential CeD or have mucosal IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits. Settings and Design: A prospective case-control study conducted from April 2018 to December 2019. Materials and Methods: Nine patients with potential CeD and 27 age-and gender-matched patients with irritable bowel syndrome were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Mucosal biopsies were collected from esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectosigmoid regions, histological changes were evaluated, and IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits were analyzed in these regions by two-color immunohistochemical staining. Statistics: Data were analyzed using statistical software Stata 14.0. Results: No distinct difference in mucosal lymphocytosis were identified between biopsies of patients with potential CeD and controls at the following sites: esophagus (11.1% vs 0%, P = 0.079), stomach (14.3% vs 7.7%, P = 0.590), and rectum (20% vs 0%, P = 0.067). Co-localized IgA anti-TG2Ab deposits were observed more in potential CeD than in controls at esophagus 22.2% (2/9) vs 0%, P = 0.012; stomach 66.7% (6/9) vs 11.5% (3/26), P < 0.001; and duodenum 66.7% (6/9) vs 0%, P < 0.001 but not at rectum 0% (0/4) vs 0% (0/25). Conclusion: Although histological changes are not distinct, a subset of subjects with potential CeD has pan-intestinal involvement other than in the duodenum.

AB  - Background: The causal association between IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and celiac disease (CeD) is based on their clinical coexistence. In this prospective study, we screened patients with IgAN for CeD and explored the utility of analysis of IgA anti-TG2 antibody deposits, for establishing a causal association.Methods: Biopsy-proven patients of IgAN were screened for serum IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA anti-tTG Ab) titer and thereafter were invited to undergo endoscopic duodenal biopsy. Corresponding duodenal and kidney biopsies were subjected to IgA anti-TG2 antibody colocalization study using dual-color immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. Additionally, kidney biopsies from 105 patients with IgAN who did not give consent for serology analysis, 30 non-IgA nephropathies, and 10 normal controls were also included. Dual-color-stained slides were interpreted based on stain distribution and intensity scores, and Pearson's index >0.3-1 on confocal imaging was considered significant.Results: Of a cohort of 151 patients with IgAN, 32 consented to undergo sero-screening and 5 of them had high serum anti-tTG Ab titer. Two out of the latter consented to endoscopic duodenal biopsies, in whom modified Marsh grade 3b changes were identified. Strong IgA anti-TG2 antibody deposits were noted in the kidney and duodenal biopsies of these patients. One patient out of non-consenting 105 patients with IgAN and 3 out of 30 patients with other non-IgA nephropathies also showed IgA anti-TG2 deposits. None of the healthy kidney tissues showed IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits.Conclusions: Co-localized IgA anti-TG2 deposits in the kidney biopsies in patients with IgAN help to establish a pathogenic link with CeD. A small proportion of patients with IgAN have associated CeD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   To assess the cost-effectiveness of collaborative versus usual care in adults with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and depression in India.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   We performed a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis of a 24-month parallel, open-label, pragmatic randomized clinical trial at four urban clinics in India from multipayer and societal perspectives. The trial randomly assigned 404 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (HbA(1c) >= 8.0%, systolic blood pressure >= 140 mmHg, or LDL cholesterol >= 130 mg/dL) and depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire score >= 10) to collaborative care (support from non-physician care coordinators, electronic registers, and specialist-supported case review) for 12 months, followed by 12 months of usual care or 24 months of usual care. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Indian rupees (INR) and international dollars (Int'l-$) and the probability of cost-effectiveness using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and depression-free days (DFDs).
   RESULTS
   From a multipayer perspective, collaborative care costed an additional INR309,558 (Int'l-$15,344) per QALY and an additional INR290.2 (Int'l-$14.4) per DFD gained compared with usual care. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 56.4% using a willingness to pay of INR336,000 (Int'l-$16,654) per QALY (approximately three times per-capita gross domestic product). The willingness to pay per DFD to achieve a probability of cost-effectiveness >95% was INR401.6 (Int'l-$19.9). From a societal perspective, cost-effectiveness was marginally lower. In sensitivity analyses, integrating collaborative care in clinical workflows reduced incremental costs by similar to 47% (ICER 162,689 per QALY, cost-effectiveness probability 89.4%), but cost-effectiveness decreased when adjusting for baseline values.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Collaborative care for patients with type 2 diabetes and depression in urban India can be cost-effective, especially when integrated in clinical workflows. Long-term cost-effectiveness might be more favorable. Scalability across lower- and middle-income country settings depends on heterogeneous contextual factors.

AB  - Purpose: Interstitial brachytherapy (ISBT) is indicated for intact cervical carcinoma (IN-CC) if intracavitary brachytherapy (ICRT) is not feasible and also in vault carcinoma (VA-C). We aimed to evaluate the doses to pelvic lymph node regions in IN-CC and VA-C treated with ISBT.
   Material and methods: Ten patients (6 IN-CC, 4 VA-C) were chosen for this dosimetric study. IN-CC had a central tandem in addition to the needles. External iliac (EI-N), internal iliac (II-N), obturator (OB-N) and sacral (SA-N) groups of lymph nodes were delineated. A dose of 10 grays (Gy) and 8 Gy each x 2 fractions was prescribed to the target in IN-CC and VA-C respectively. Doses received by 100%, 90% and 50% volume (D100, D90, D50) and D2cc, D1cc, D0.1cc were evaluated. Doses to lymph nodal groups in IN-CC vs. VA-C were compared using Student's t-test.
   Results: For 20 implants, the median number of needles was 18 (range, 16-20). Mean D90 and D2cc of the combined bilateral OB-N, II-N, EI-N and SA-N groups were 33.62 +/- 3.46% and 102.94 +/- 10.71%, 6.98 +/- 0.65% and 39.69 +/- 3.64%, 5.1 +/- 0.51% and 15.4 +/- 0.8%, 7.76 +/- 0.95% and 15.36 +/- 1.09% of the prescribed doses respectively. Patients with a central tandem (IN-CC) received significantly higher doses to external, internal iliac and sacral group of lymph nodes (p < 0.001) as compared to VA-C.
   Conclusions: In patients with cervical carcinoma treated with ISBT, pelvic lymph node groups received significant doses. The dose contribution to pelvic lymph nodes is higher in patients with intact cervical cancer where a central tandem is used as compared to post-operative patients.

AB  - Background: A clear understanding of the anthropometric and sociodemographic risk factors related to BMI and hypertension categories is essential for more effective disease prevention, particularly in India. There is a paucity of nationally representative data on the dynamics of these risk factors, which have not been assessed among healthy reproductive-age Indian women.Objective: This cross-sectional polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) task force study aimed to assess the anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics of healthy reproductive-age Indian women and explore the association of these characteristics with various noncommunicable diseases.Methods: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey from 2018 to 2022 as part of the Indian Council of Medical Research-PCOS National Task Force study, with the primary aim of estimating the national prevalence of PCOS and regional phenotypic variations among women with PCOS. A multistage random sampling technique was adopted, and 7107 healthy women (aged 18-40 years) from 6 representative geographical zones of India were included in the study. The anthropometric indices and sociodemographic characteristics of these women were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the association between exposure and outcome variables.Results: Of the 7107 study participants, 3585 (50.44%) were from rural areas and 3522 (49.56%) were from urban areas. The prevalence of obesity increased from 8.1% using World Health Organization criteria to 40% using the revised consensus guidelines for Asian Indian populations. Women from urban areas showed higher proportions of overweight (524/1908, 27.46%), obesity (775/1908, 40.62%), and prehypertension (1008/1908, 52.83%) categories. A rising trend of obesity was observed with an increase in age. Women aged 18 to 23 years were healthy (314/724, 43.4%) and overweight (140/724, 19.3%) compared with women aged 36 to 40 years with obesity (448/911, 49.2%) and overweight (216/911, 23.7%). The proportion of obesity was high among South Indian women, with 49.53% (531/1072) and 66.14% (709/1072), using both World Health Organization criteria and the revised Indian guidelines for BMI, respectively. BMI with waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio had a statistically significant linear relationship (r=0.417; P<.001 and r=0.422; P<.001, respectively). However, the magnitude, or strength, of the association was relatively weak (0.3<|r|<0.5). Statistical analysis showed that the strongest predictors of being overweight or obese were older age, level of education, wealth quintile, and area of residence.Conclusions: Anthropometric and sociodemographic characteristics are useful predictors of overweight-and obesity-related syndromes, including prehypertension, among healthy Indian women. Increased attention to the health of Indian women from public health experts and policy makers is warranted. The findings of this study can be leveraged to offer valuable insights, informing health decision-making and targeted interventions that mitigate risk factors of overweight, obesity, and hypertension.International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): RR2-10.2196/23437 (JMIR Public Health Surveill 2023;9:e43199) doi: 10.2196/43199

AB  - Background: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presents with inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombus in 10%-30% cases and surgical management forms the mainstay of the treatment. The objective of this study is to assess the outcomes of the patients undergoing radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients undergoing open radical nephrectomy with IVC thrombectomy between 2006 till 2018 was done.
   Results: A total of 56 patients were included. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 57.1 (+/- 12.2) years. The number of patients with levels I, II, III, and IV thrombus were 4, 29,10, and 13, respectively. The mean blood loss was 1851.8 mL, and the mean operative time was 303.3 minutes. Overall, the complication rate was 51.7%, while the perioperative mortality rate was 8.9%. The mean duration of hospital stay was 10.6 +/- 6.4 days. The majority of the patients had clear cell carcinoma (87.5%). There was a significant association between grade and stage of thrombus (P = 0.011). Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the median overall survival (OS) was 75 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 43.5-106.5) months, and the median recurrence-free survival (RFS) was 48 (95% CI = 33.1-62.3) months. Age ( P = 0.03), presence of systemic symptoms (P = 0.01), radiological size (P = 0.04), histopathological grade (P = 0.01), level of thrombus (P = 0.04), and invasion of thrombus into IVC wall (P = 0.01) were found to be significant predictors of OS.
   Conclusion: The management of RCC with IVC thrombus poses a major surgical challenge. Experience of a center along with high-volume and multidisciplinary facility particularly cardiothoracic facility provides better perioperative outcome. Though surgically challenging, it offers good overall-survival and recurrence-free survival.

AB  - Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a life-threatening respiratory fungal infection that is almost exclu-sively seen in patients with preexisting structural lung disease with no or mild immunosuppression. The clinical presenta-tion and imaging findings are varied and often pose a diagnostic challenge; and the disease is often present for a long time before being correctly diagnosed. High-resolution chest computed tomography is the imaging modality of choice because it helps identify various forms of CPA, which can range from a simple aspergilloma and chronic cavitary form, to the subacute invasive and end-stage fibrotic form. The knowledge of the imaging features of this disease cannot be over-emphasized because it can assist the clinician in reaching at an early diagnosis and timely initiation of appropriate anti -fungal therapy, thereby improving patient management and treatment outcome. Moreover, imaging also plays a pivotal role during follow-up in patients of CPA to assess the treatment response. In the current review, we present an illustrative review of radiologic patterns seen in various forms of CPA.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - COVID-19 causes morbid pathological changes in different organs including lungs, kidneys, liver, and so on, especially in those who succumb. Though clinical outcomes in those with comorbidities are known to be different from those without-not much is known about the differences at the histopathological level. To compare the morbid histopathological changes in COVID-19 patients between those who were immunocompromised (Gr 1), had a malignancy (Gr 2), or had cardiometabolic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery disease) (Gr 3), postmortem tissue sampling (minimally invasive tissue sampling [MITS]) was done from the lungs, kidney, heart, and liver using a biopsy gun within 2hours of death. Routine (hematoxylin and eosin) and special staining (acid fast bacilli, silver methanamine, periodic acid schiff) was done besides immunohistochemistry. A total of 100 patients underwent MITS and data of 92 patients were included (immunocompromised: 27, malignancy: 18, cardiometabolic conditions: 71). In lung histopathology, capillary congestion was more in those with malignancy, while others like diffuse alveolar damage, microthrombi, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and so on, were equally distributed. In liver histopathology, architectural distortion was significantly different in immunocompromised; while steatosis, portal inflammation, Kupffer cell hypertrophy, and confluent necrosis were equally distributed. There was a trend towards higher acute tubular injury in those with cardiometabolic conditions as compared to the other groups. No significant histopathological difference in the heart was discerned. Certain histopathological features were markedly different in different groups (Gr 1, 2, and 3) of COVID-19 patients with fatal outcomes.

AB  - Due to rising environmental and global public health concerns associated with environmental contamination, human populations are continually being exposed to environmental toxicants, including physical chemical mutagens widespread in our environment causing adverse consequences and inducing a variety of neurological disorders in humans. Physical mutagens comprise ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, such as UV rays, IR rays, X-rays, which produces a broad spectrum of neuronal destruction, including neuroinflammation, genetic instability, enhanced oxidative stress driving mitochondrial damage in the human neuronal antecedent cells, cognitive impairment due to alterations in neuronal function, especially in synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis repression, modifications in mature neuronal networks drives to enhanced neurodegenerative risk. Chemical Mutagens including alkylating agents (EMS, NM, MMS, and NTG), Hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, sodium azide, halouracils are the major toxic mutagen in our environment and have been associated with neurological disorders. These chemical mutagens create dimers of pyrimidine that cause DNA damage that leads to ROS generation producing mutations, chromosomal abnormalities, genotoxicity which leads to increased neurodegenerative risk. The toxicity of four heavy metal including Cd, As, Pb, Hg is mostly responsible for complicated neurological disorders in humans. Cadmium exposure can enhance the permeability of the BBB and penetrate the brain, driving brain intracellular accumulation, cellular dysfunction, and cerebral edema. Arsenic exerts its toxic effect by induction of ROS production in neuronal cells. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanism and mechanistic effects of mutagens in the environment and their role in multiple neurological disorders.

AB  - Purpose: Leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, and sleeping sickness are caused by protozoa Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Trypanosoma brucei, respectively. Platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) is an inflammatory protein implicated in pathogenesis of these three infections, thereby making them attractive drug targets.Methods: PAF-AH sequences were retrieved from UniProt and aligned using Clustal Omega. Homologous models of parasitic proteins were built based on crystal structure of human PAF-AH and validated using PROCHECK server. Volumes of substrate-binding channel were calculated using the ProteinsPlus program. High throughput virtual screening using Glide program in Schrodinger was done with ZINC drug library against parasitic PAF-AH enzymes. Complexes with best hits were energy-minimized and subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation and analyzed.Results: PAF-AH enzyme sequences from protozoa Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and human have a minimum of 34% sequence similarity with each other. Corresponding structures show a globular conformation consisting of twisted beta-pleated sheets, flanked by alpha-helices on either side. Catalytic triad of serine-histidine-aspartate is conserved. Substrate-binding channel residues are conserved to an extent, with a lower channel volume in human as compared to target enzymes. Drug screening resulted in identification of three molecules that had better affinities than the substrate to the target enzymes. These molecules fulfill Lipinski's rules for drug likeness and also bind with less affinity to the human counterpart, thereby establishing a high selective index.Conclusion: Structures of PAF-AH from protozoan parasites and humans belong to the same family of enzymes and have a similar three-dimensional fold. However, they show subtle variations in residue composition, secondary structure composition, substrate-binding channel volume, and conformational stability. These differences result in certain specific molecules being potent inhibitors of the target enzymes while simultaneously having weaker binding to human homologue.

AB  - Introduction: Today, endovascular treatment (EVT) is the therapy of choice for strokes due to acute large vessel occlusion, ir-respective of prior thrombolysis. This necessitates fast, coordinated multi-specialty collaboration. Currently, in most countries, the number of physicians and centres with expertise in EVT is limited. Thus, only a small proportion of eligible patients receive this po-tentially life-saving therapy, often after significant delays. Hence, there is an unmet need to train a sufficient number of physicians and centres in acute stroke intervention in order to allow widespread and timely access to EVT.Aim: To provide multi-specialty training guidelines for competency, accreditation and certification of centres and physicians in EVT for acute large vessel occlusion strokes.Material and methods: The World Federation for Interventional Stroke Treatment (WIST) consists of experts in the field of en-dovascular stroke treatment. This interdisciplinary working group developed competency - rather than time-based - guidelines for operator training, taking into consideration trainees' previous skillsets and experience. Existing training concepts from mostly single specialty organizations were analysed and incorporated. Results: The WIST establishes an individualized approach to acquiring clinical knowledge and procedural skills to meet the competency requirements for certification of interventionalists of various disciplines and stroke centres in EVT. WIST guidelines encourage acquisition of skills using innovative training methods such as structured supervised high-fidelity simulation and proce-dural performance on human perfused cadaveric models. Conclusions: WIST multispecialty guidelines outline competency and quality standards for physicians and centres to perform safe and effective EVT. The role of quality control and quality assurance is highlighted.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, emerges as a global health problem, as the viral genome is evolving rapidly to form several variants. Advancement and progress in the development of effective vaccines and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are promising to combat viral infections. In the current scenario, several lineages containing "co-mutations" in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) region of the spike (S) protein are imposing new challenges. Co-occurrence of some co-mutations includes delta (L452R/T478K), kappa (L452R/E484Q), and a common mutation in both beta and gamma variants (E484K/N501Y). The effect of co-mutants (L452R/E484Q) on human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) binding has already been elucidated. Here, for the first time, we investigated the role of these RBD co-mutations (L452R/E484Q) on the binding affinity of mAbs by adopting molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and free-energy binding estimation. The results obtained from our study suggest that the structural and dynamic changes introduced by these co-mutations reduce the binding affinity of the viral S protein to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The structural changes imposed by L452R create a charged patch near the interfacial surface that alters the affinity towards mAbs. In E484Q mutation, polar negatively charged E484 helps in the formation of electrostatic interaction, while the neutrally charged Q residue affects the interaction by forming repulsive forces. MD simulations along with molecular mechanics-generalized Born surface area (MMGBSA) studies revealed that the REGN 10933, BD-368-2, and S2M11 complexes have reduced binding affinity towards the double-mutant RBD. This indicates that their mutant (MT) structures have a stronger ability to escape from most antibodies than the wild type (WT). However, EY6A Ab showed higher affinity towards the double MT-RBD complex as compared to the WT. However, no significant effect of the per-residue contribution of double-mutated residues was observed, as this mAb does not interact with the region harboring L452 and E484 residues.

TI  - Original scientific What happened to laboratory animals during COVID-19 lockdown? India answers. A survey from India on Laboratory animal care during COVID 19 lockdown
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
AB  - Publishing the practical problems that occurred during a local or global disaster can help to plan improved future logistic and personnel management, and this can ultimately result in better welfare of laboratory animals. COVID-19 necessitated euthanasia of research animals, and partial or complete closure of laboratory animal facilities, throughout the world. In an attempt to find out the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on laboratory animals in India, a survey was conducted based on the voluntary participation of institutions from different regions of the country. A total of 56 facilities participated from 14 states and union territories. From their responses, 95% of the facilities continued their operations during lockdown. Among these facilities, 13% were completely operational. 63% had no interruption in receiving essential supplies and 16% operated with complete man-power. 20% paused breeding completely and 54% partially. In spite of the strict lockdown, 91% of the institutes were able to provide veterinary care. 60% of the institutions conducted online institutional animal ethical committee meetings indicative of continuing research activities. Many facilities reported animal morbidity (64%) and mortality (9%). To optimize resources 41% reported euthanasia of animals. Statistical analysis revealed a significant association of lockdown with increased animal morbidity, euthanasia and reduced animal breeding. In conclusion, even though lockdown had created a partial disruption of activities with some reduction in animal health and welfare, operations and research continued at most of the facilities surveyed in India.

AB  - Diet is an important determinant of health and consequently is often implicated in the development of disease, particularly gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, given the high prevalence of meal-related symptoms. The mechanisms underlying diet-driven pathophysiology are not well understood, but recent studies suggest that gut microbiota may mediate the effect of diet on GI physiology. In this review, we focus primarily on two distinct GI diseases where the role of diet has been best studied: irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.We discuss how the concurrent and sequential utilization of dietary nutrients by the host and gut microbiota determines the eventual bioactive metabolite profiles in the gut and the biological effect of these metabolites on GI physiology.We highlight several concepts that can be gleaned from these findings, such as how distinct effects of an individual metabolite can influence diverse GI diseases, the effect of similar dietary interventions on multiple disease states, and the need for extensive phenotyping and data collection to help make personalized diet recommendations.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to evaluate the frequency and clinicopathologic correlates of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu and betacatenin (BC) oncoproteins in gastric adenocarcinoma and to seek correlation if any between their expression status. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional analytical immunohistochemistry (IHC) study was performed on 50 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma. HER-2/neu immunoexpression was scored as per criteria by Ruschoff et al. as positive (3+), equivocal (2+), and negative (1+, 0). Aberrant BC expression was categorized as nuclear, cytoplasmic, and reduced membranous immunoexpression. Protein expression results of both oncoproteins were correlated with conventional clinicopathological parameters. Correlation between immunoexpression profiles of both proteins was also analyzed. P <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: HER-2/neu positivity (2 + and 3+) was seen in 94% of the cases; almost 60% had strong (3+) expression. All cases showed aberrant BC immunoexpression (any pattern) except 2 cases that revealed negative expression (a form of aberrant immunoexpression) and were removed from analysis due to a very small number. The pattern of BC expression was as follows: nuclear expression (38%), cytoplasmic expression (82%), reduced membranous expression (96%), no staining (4%) cases. HER-2/neu expression correlated with age. No significant correlation was found between any of the 2 oncoprotein immunoexpression and other clinicopathological parameters (P > 0.05). Concordance between protein expression of HER-2/neu and BC was seen in >93% cases, however, the correlation was not significant. Conclusion: HER-2/neu and BC oncoprotein expression are frequently dysregulated in gastric adenocarcinomas. The significance of pathways involving HER-2/neu and BC in gastric carcinogenesis should be explored.

AB  - Aims and objectivesThe objective of the study was to restore Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan image using blind deconvolution (BD) algorithm so that ribs, vertebrae, and lesions present in them become prominent. Materials and methodsOur study consists of retrospective data in which 356 Tc-99m MDP bone scan images (178 anterior and 178 posterior) were processed using dynamic stochastic resonance algorithm, block-matching 3D filter, and then restored using BD algorithm. Two nuclear medicine (NM) physicians compared restored image with its input image; they especially lookedfor: (a) improvement in lesions detectability, (b) artifacts if any, (c) deterioration in ribs and vertebra, and (d) contrast enhancement in adjacent vertebra and adjacent ribs. They selected one out of two (restored and input) images, which had better quality. The overall image quality was also assessed using the following image quality metrics: brightness, blur, global contrast factor, and contrast per pixel. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for finding significant difference between the value of image quality metrics of restored image and input image at level of significance alpha = 0.05. ResultsAccording to NM physicians, 80.3% (286 out of 356) of restored images were acceptable, whereas 19.6% (70 out of 356) were unacceptable. Ribs and vertebrae were prominent in 161 out of 178 posterior restored images. Lumbar vertebrae were enhanced and well differentiated from adjacent vertebrae in 125 out of 178 anterior restored images. The value of image quality metrics of restored and input images were found to be significantly different (P-value < 0.0001). ConclusionRibs, vertebrae, and lesions present in them become prominent in the most of Tc-99m MDP bone scan images (80.3%) restored using BD algorithm.

AB  - Context: Previous research has shown the vast benefits associated with BhP. However, the dynamics of cortical activity in connection with Bhramari sound have not been investigated yet.Aim: To investigate the cortical activity in connection with Bhramari sound.Settings and Design: Humming sound was analyzed with a custom-made nasal device consisting of MAX4466 sensor time synchronized with the EEG setup. We anticipated that the modulation of cortical activity with the humming sound (either of long or short durations) leaves its effects after the Pranayama, which helps to understand the positive impacts of BhP.Methods and Material: 30 participants were instructed to perform the BhP for a period of 90 seconds. We proposed to investigate the cortical correlates before, during, and after the BhP through EEG. A custom-made nasal device consisting of MAX4466 sensor time synchronized with the EEG setup was used for analyzing the humming sound.Statistical Analysis Used: A paired t-test (P < 0.05) with a Bonferroni correction is carried out to explore the statistically significant difference in power spectral density (PSD) values.Results: Results show that the relative spectral power in theta band for short humming durations (less than or equal to 9 seconds) was similar on the frontal cortex during and after the Pranayama practice (P > 0.05) in most of the subjects.Conclusions: In conclusion, for the immediate positive effects of BhP, the humming duration should be kept less than or equal to 9 seconds. A wearable sound recording system can be developed in the future as a feedback system that provides biofeedback to the user so that a constant humming duration can be maintained.

AB  - Background: Totally extra-peritoneal (TEP) and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair are two established minimal access techniques of groin hernia surgery. TEP offers the advantage of avoiding violation of the peritoneal cavity.
   Aim: This study aims to describe the decade-long experience of TEP in groin hernia repair in a tertiary care teaching institute and the feasibility of the same in difficult scenarios.
   Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of the database of patients undergoing TEP repair for inguinal hernia in a single surgical unit at a tertiary teaching hospital between January 2008 and December 2019 was performed. Detailed pre-operative clinical details, operative duration, intraoperative and post-operative complications, including pain, length of post-operative hospital stay and hernia recurrence data were analysed.
   Results: Over 12 years' duration, 511 patients underwent endoscopic TEP mesh repair and the total number of hernias repaired was 614. Majority (97.45%) of patients were male. The mean age of the patient population was 51.3 years. Primary hernia was seen in 490 patients. The mean operating time for unilateral inguinal hernia repair was 56.8 +/- 16 min and for bilateral repair 80.9 +/- 25.2 min. TEP in previous lower abdominal/suprapubic surgical scars was attempted in 17 (3.3%) patients, with only one requiring conversion. The intraoperative peritoneal breach was the most common documented complication (34.8%). Seroma was seen in 9.4% of patients. Seventeen patients required conversion (14 TAPP and 3 open). Recurrence was seen in 4 (0.7) patients.
   Conclusion: TEP repair is an effective method of groin hernia repair and can be attempted in the majority of patients groin hernia, including patients with previous lower abdominal incisions.

AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of our study was to describe the scintigraphic patterns of Tc-99m-pertechnetate uptake in patients who were referred to the department of nuclear medicine for evaluating and diagnosing ectopic gastric mucosa in foregut and midgut duplication cysts. Materials and methodsThis hospital-based, retrospective cum prospective research spans a period of 8 years from April 2014 to January 2022. Previous hospital medical records were analyzed and subsequently, a database was prepared which included the age, sex, clinical indication of a Tc-99m-pertechnetate scan, and the planar and SPECT-computed tomography (CT) imaging findings. Postoperative histopathological reports were available for 21 patients. Dynamic and planar static imaging was performed. We included SPECT-CT in suspected duplication cysts to increase the sensitivity and specificity which is a tradeoff for a small amount of additional radiation exposure. A total of 69 patients were subjected to a Tc-99m-pertechnetate scan for suspected foregut or midgut duplication cysts. All were subjected to dynamic planar and delayed static images up to 24 h or until focal uptake of radiotracer was noted which corroborated the anatomical findings, whichever was earlier. SPECT-CT was performed along with the planar study in 31 patients which confirmed the findings. Previously performed CT scans were used for anatomical correlation in the remaining ones ResultsDuplication cysts were localized in a total of 28 patients (19 foregut duplication cysts and 12 small bowel duplications - 3 patients had dual duplication cysts, both foregut, and midgut). Forty-one patients had no scintigraphic evidence of ectopic gastric mucosa. Of these 69 patients, histopathological diagnosis was available for 21 patients (22 lesions). The report was concordant with the scan findings in 15 patients (16 lesions) and 6 patients showed discordance in histopathological diagnosis and scan findings. ConclusionIn conclusion, multi-time point imaging is the key to diagnosing ectopic gastric mucosa of various sizes and in various locations. An abnormal radiotracer uptake in dynamic sequences, even before the appearance of the stomach in the region of the small bowel is indicative of intestinal duplication, and delayed radiotracer visualization in the region of the thorax is characteristic of intrathoracic foregut duplication cyst.

AB  - Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) refers to metastatic spread of tumor into the peritoneal cavity. Earlier, PC was thought to be associated with grave clinical outcome. However, various advances in treatment options including cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy or early post-operative chemotherapy can prolong survival of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. These treatment options are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this article is to acquaint the radiologist about various appearances of peritoneal carcinomatosis in order to help clinicians in selecting candidates for surgery and avoid unnecessary potentially debilitating surgeries in patients with unresectable PC.

AB  - The effect of emergency department (ED) length of stay (EDLOS) on in-hospital mortality (IHM) remains unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the association between EDLOS and IHM. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and Scopus databases from their inception until 14-15 January 2022. We included studies reporting the association between EDLOS and IHM. A total of 11,337 references were identified, and 52 studies (total of 1,718,518 ED patients) were included in the systematic review and 33 in the meta-analysis. A statistically significant association between EDLOS and IHM was observed for EDLOS over 24 h in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) (OR = 1.396, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.147 to 1.701; p < 0.001, I-2 = 0%) and for low EDLOS in non-ICU-admitted patients (OR = 0.583, 95% CI: 0.453 to 0.745; p < 0.001, I-2 = 0%). No associations were detected for the other cut-offs. Our findings suggest that there is an association between IHM low EDLOS and EDLOS exceeding 24 h and IHM. Long stays in the ED should not be allowed and special attention should be given to patients admitted after a short stay in the ED.

AB  - Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which not only produces respiratory symptoms but is known to involve almost every system, and its neuroinvasive properties have been well demonstrated throughout the pandemic. Also, to combat the pandemic, there was rapid development and induction of various vaccination drives, following which many adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) have been reported, which include neurological complications as well.
   Method: We present a series of three cases, post vaccination, with and without a history of COVID illness that showed remarkably similar findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Result: A 38-year-old male presented with complaints of weakness of the bilateral lower limbs with sensory loss and bladder disturbance a day after receiving his first dose of ChadOx1 nCoV-19 (COVISHIELD) vaccine. A 50-year-old male with hypothyroidism characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis and impaired glucose tolerance experienced difficulty in walking 11.5 weeks after being administered with COVID vaccine (COVAXIN). A 38-year-old male presented with subacute onset progressive symmetric quadriparesis 2 months after their first dose of a COVID vaccine. The patient also had sensory ataxia, and his vibration sensation was impaired below C7. All three patients had typical pattern of involvement of the brain and spine on MRI with signal changes in bilateral corticospinal tracts, trigeminal tracts in the brain, and both lateral and posterior columns in the spine.
   Conclusion: This pattern of brain and spine involvement on MRI is a novel finding and is likely a result of post-vaccination/post-COVID immune-mediated demyelination.

AB  - Background: Preclinical studies have reported significant changes in the gut microbiome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We hypothesized that TBI induces the growth of Proteobacteria in the human gut. Our primary outcome was to study the profile of the human fecal microbiome after TBI and the secondary outcome was to identify colonization with colistin-resistant and multidrug-resistant pathogens.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with moderate-severe TBI admitted to the neurotrauma-intensive care unit within 48 hours of injury were enrolled into this observational study. Samples from rectal swabs obtained on days 0, 3, and 7 after admission were assessed for microbial growth and antibiotic resistance. Demographic data and variables such as hypotension, blood transfusion, surgery, start of nasogastric feeding, use of antibiotics, length of hospital stay and mortality were noted.
   Results: One hundred one patients were enrolled into this study; 57 (56.4%) underwent surgery, 80 (79.2%) required blood transfusion, 15 (14.9%) had an episode of hypotension, 37 (36.6%) received enteral feed within the first 3 days, and 79 (78.2%) received antibiotics. Rectal microbiological samples were collected from 101, 95, and 85 patients on days 0, 3, and 7, respectively. All organisms isolated at the 3 time-points belonged to the Proteobacteria phylum, with Enterobacteriaceae forming the largest group. Colistin-resistant organisms were found in 17 (16.8%) of 101 patients and multidrug-resistant organisms in 25 (64.1%) of the 39 patients in whom isolates were tested against the entire panel of antimicrobials.
   Conclusion: TBI is associated with widespread colonization with Proteobacteria as early as 48 hours after injury. Colonization with colistin and multidrug-resistant organisms highlights the importance of the judicious use of antibiotics.

AB  - Non-invasive characterization of pancreatic masses aids in the management of pancreatic lesions. Intravoxel incoherent motion-diffusion kurtosis imaging (IVIM-DKI) and machine learning-based texture analysis was used to differentiate pancreatic masses such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (MFCP). A total of forty-eight biopsy-proven patients with pancreatic masses were recruited and classified into pNET (n = 13), MFCP (n = 6), SPEN (n = 4), and PDAC (n = 25) groups. All patients were scanned for IVIM-DKI sequences acquired with 14 b-values (0 to 2500 s/mm(2)) on a 1.5T MRI. An IVIM-DKI model with a 3D total variation (TV) penalty function was implemented to estimate the precise IVIM-DKI parametric maps. Texture analysis (TA) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM-DKI parametric map was performed and reduced using the chi-square test. These features were fed to an artificial neural network (ANN) for characterization of pancreatic mass subtypes and validated by 5-fold cross-validation. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to compute the area under curve (AUC). Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in pNET than PDAC. The f showed better diagnostic performance for PDAC vs. MFCP with AUC:0.77. Both pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) and f for PDAC vs. pNET showed an AUC of 0.73. ADC and diffusion coefficient (D) showed good diagnostic performance for pNET vs. MFCP with AUC: 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. In the TA of PDAC vs. non-PDAC, f and combined IVIM-DKI parameters showed high accuracy >= 84.3% and AUC >= 0.84. Mean f and combined IVIM-DKI parameters estimated that the IVIM-DKI model with TV texture features has the potential to be helpful in characterizing pancreatic masses.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to evaluate the outcomes of cataract surgery in patients of the pediatric age group with systemic comorbidities. Methods: Medical records of 54 eyes (30 patients) of the pediatric age group with systemic comorbidities who had undergone cataract surgery in a tertiary-care center were reviewed. The following parameters were recorded: systemic comorbidity; toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, HIV (TORCH) profile, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), strabismus, nystagmus, and cataract morphology. Results: Thirty patients with a mean age of 55 months (9 months-14 years) were included. On average, every child was seen by three physicians, and the mean duration between the first visit to a physician and presentation to our center was 2.23 +/- 0.67 years. The various causes for delay in referral include multiple referrals due to a lack of general anesthesia services in 78% of cases, a long waiting list at the referral hospital in 35% of cases, and a lack of awareness at the primary-care physician level in 50% of cases. The mean BSCVA at presentation was 1.4 logMAR (0.3 to 3 logMAR). The most common cataract morphology was that of zonular cataract (31.48%; 17/54). Strabismus and abnormal eye movements were observed in 27.7% (15/54) and 33.3% (18/54) of eyes, respectively. Various systemic associations were periventricular leukomalacia (12/30), Down's syndrome (6/30), seizure disorder (6/30), cardiac valvular anomalies (6/30), Marfan's syndrome (4/30), hypothyroidism (4/30), rubella (3/20), cytomegalovirus (3/20), cerebral palsy (2/30), nephrotic syndrome (2/30), Type 1 diabetes mellitus (1/30), microcephaly (1/30), cryptogenic West syndrome (1/30), congenital rubella syndrome (1/30), and Tourette syndrome (1/30). The mean postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) at 2-year follow-up improved to 1.0 logMAR (0 to 3 logMAR). No postoperative complications were reported at the final follow-up. Around 70% of the parents reported improvement in their child's psychomotor skills. Conclusion: Intellectually impaired pediatric patients with cataract should be operated upon whenever there is a presence of infrastructure, and unnecessary delay in surgery should be avoided by referring the patient to higher centers. Even though objective improvement in visual acuity was suboptimal, there was definitely an improvement in the psychomotor skills of the patients.

AB  - Introduction: Health workforce is the important pillar of health system in India. Efficient utilization of scarce community-level human resources in health care is critical to ensure optimum care in a community. Objective: To describe the time utilization pattern of health workers (HWs) during field activity at the primary healthcare level and to study the facilitators and barriers in efficient time utilization. Methods: A mixed-method study with a time and motion approach was carried out in the rural areas of Ballabgarh block of Haryana. Time and motion approach was continuous, direct, synchronous and both active and passive method of time logging was adapted. Electronic Geo-Positioning System based mobile, timestamp application and the digital stopwatch were used to capture time utilization. The quality of the data collected in the daily work plan during the household (HH) visits was assessed using semi-structured interview schedule. In-depth interview with the HWs was carried out to understand the facilitating factors and barriers in their efficient functioning. Results: Proportion of HH s covered in data collection for time and motion patterns was 36% out of the total number of HH s in the SCs. The completeness of work plan was 74.8%. The average number of HHs covered per day by an HW was 38. Mean (standard deviation [SD]) time duration spent in each HH in completing the work plan was 2.9 (0.8) minutes. Mean (SD) total distance travelled by HW per day was 1845.1 (974.2) metres. Mean (SD) time duration spent idle in the field was 22.7 (13.0) minutes. Proportion of effective time utilised in the field was 54.3%. Several enabling factors and barriers were identified at personal, community, and health system level. Conclusion: Only half of the allotted time was effectively utilized by the HWs for house visit in the community. Planning the beat schedule as per the feasibility and ensuring quality of HH visits using information technology is critical for providing primary healthcare at village level.

AB  - The concept of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) emerged from the recognition that statistical significance alone is not enough to determine the clinical relevance of treatment effects in clinical research. In many cases, statistically significant changes in outcomes may not be meaningful to patients or may not result in any tangible improvements in their health. This has led to a growing emphasis on the importance of measuring patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in clinical trials and other research studies, in order to capture the patient perspective on treatment effectiveness. MCID is defined as the smallest change in scores that is considered meaningful or important to patients. MCID is particularly important in fields such as neurology, where many of the outcomes of interest are subjective or based on patient-reported symptoms. This review discusses the challenges associated with interpreting outcomes of clinical trials based solely on statistical significance, highlighting the importance of considering clinical relevance and patient perception of change. There are two main approaches to estimating MCID: anchor-based and distribution-based. Anchor-based approaches compare change scores using an external anchor, while distribution-based approaches estimate MCID values based on statistical characteristics of scores within a sample. MCID is dynamic and context-specific, and there is no single 'gold standard' method for estimating it. A range of MCID thresholds should be defined using multiple methods for a disease under targeted intervention, rather than relying on a single absolute value. The use of MCID thresholds can be an important tool for researchers, neurophysicians and patients in evaluating the effectiveness of treatments and interventions, and in making informed decisions about care.

AB  - Background and Purpose: There is an unmet need for a more effective thrombolytic agent in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management. Various studies and meta-analysis suggest tenecteplase (TNK) as non-inferior over alteplase (rTPA). The present single-center study compares biosimilar TNK and rTPA in a tertiary care setting. Methods: Data of patients who presented with AIS and underwent intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) were recruited retrospectively from January 2018 to July 2021. Primary efficacy outcome was a modified Rankin score (mRS) at 90 days dichotomized at < = 2. Qualitative and quantitative variables were assessed using Chi-square test and Student's t-test, respectively. Results: A total of 160 patients, 103 in the rTPA and 57 in TNK group, were analyzed. The baseline characteristics were well matched apart from hypertension. Large artery atherosclerosis was the most frequent subtype of stroke among the two groups. Good functional outcome was seen in 47.92% of patients TNK and 64.77% of patients in rTPA group (p = 0.069). No difference was seen in the rates of any ICH (p = 0.29) and mortality at 3 months (p = 0.32) among the two groups. Conclusion: This present study observed no difference in the efficacy and safety between biosimilar TNK and rTPA. Our findings are in concordance with published trials showing equivalence between the two molecules.

KW  - STATEMENT
AB  - We performed a case-control study across 25 hospitals in India for the period of January-June 2021 to evaluate the reasons for an COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM) outbreak. We investigated whether COVID-19 treat-ment practices (glucocorticoids, zinc, tocilizumab, and oth-ers) were associated with CAM. We included 1,733 cases of CAM and 3,911 age-matched COVID-19 controls. We found cumulative glucocorticoid dose (odds ratio [OR] 1.006, 95% CI 1.004-1.007) and zinc supplementation (OR 2.76, 95% CI 2.24-3.40), along with elevated C-reactive protein (OR 1.004, 95% CI 1.002-1.006), host factors (re-nal transplantation [OR 7.58, 95% CI 3.31-17.40], diabetes mellitus [OR 6.72, 95% CI 5.45-8.28], diabetic ketoacidosis during COVID-19 [OR 4.41, 95% CI 2.03-9.60]), and rural residence (OR 2.88, 95% CI 2.12-3.79), significantly as-sociated with CAM. Mortality rate at 12 weeks was 32.2% (473/1,471). We emphasize the judicious use of COVID-19 therapies and optimal glycemic control to prevent CAM.

AB  - A library of non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR) tasks were developed for post-stroke rehabilitation of distal upper extremities. The objective was to evaluate the rehabilitation impact of the developed VR-tasks on a patient with chronic stroke. The study involved a 50-year-old male patient with chronic (13 month) stroke. Twenty VR therapy sessions of 45 min each were given. Clinical scales, cortical-excitability measures, functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired pre-and post-therapy to evaluate the motor recovery. Increase in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (wrist/hand) by 2 units, Barthel Index by 5 units, Brunnstrom Stage by 1 unit, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination by 3 units, Wrist Active Range of Motion by 5 degrees and decrease in Modified Ashworth Scale by 1 unit were observed. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) amplitude (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 60.9 mu V with a decrease in Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) by 7%, and contralesional MEP amplitude was increased by 56.2 mu V with a decrease in RMT by 7%. The fMRI-derived Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex increased in precentral-gyrus (from 0.28 to 0.33) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.07 to 0.3). The DTI-derived FA-asymmetry decreased in precentral-gyrus (from 0.029 to 0.024) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.027 to 0.017). Relative reduction in task-specific performance metrics, i.e., time taken to complete the task (31.6%), smoothness of trajectory (76.7%), and relative percentage error (80.7%), were observed from day 1 to day 20 of the VR therapy. VR therapy resulted in improvement in clinical outcomes in a patient with chronic stroke. The research also gives insights to further improve the overall system of rehabilitation.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that impacts the physical and psychological functioning of the patients. The physical and cognitive changes come with social stigma and threats to roles previously associated with their identities. Objectives: The current paper attempts to study the influence of the disease on the personal identity of the patients. Methods: A systematic review was done on PD and personal identity following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used to assess the quality of the papers. The selected papers were synthesized to understand the relationship between PD and personal identity. Results: The emerging themes were: (1) dissociation of old personal identity: (1.1) Influence of physical symptoms, (1.2) influence of society and stigma, and (1.3) threats to roles associated with identity and (2) changing family dynamics. A Model of Personal, Family, and Disease Dynamics was also developed based on clinical first-hand experience with the patients and the review. Conclusion: The personal identity of the PD patients shifts drastically as a result of their physical and psychosocial experiences. This also results in changed family dynamics, with the patient feeling sidelined due to loss of control and responsibilities in the family.

AB  - The past five decades have seen significant developments in the knowledge and practice of interventional radiology. Advancements in angiographic equipment have made interventional radiology a safe, minimally invasive preferred option in the treatment of a variety of diseases. Today, a range of catheters are available in the armamentarium of the interventional radiologist to suit different needs when conducting diagnostic angiograms or performing interventions in various vascular territories. The hardware required for interventions includes needles, wires, catheters, balloons, and stents. Catheters, in particular, are an invaluable tool for interventionists. The purpose of this review is to describe the identification characteristics, properties, and uses of the common angiographic catheters used in interventional radiology, with a special focus on peripheral vascular interventions (excluding neurointerventions).

These regimens have never been compared head to head in a randomized controlled trial for treatment na & iuml;ve FL. Methods: This phase III open label randomised controlled trial was conducted at our center from January 2016 to December 2017.Treatment na & iuml;ve patients with age more than 18 years, ECOG PS <= 2, who were diagnosed with FL (Stage II-IV)were included in our study.Patients were randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive six cycles of BR(bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) d1-2 and rituximab 375mg/m(2) d1) every 4 weeks or LR (lenalidomide 20 mg d1-21 and rituximab 375 mg/m(2)) every 4 weeks.The primary endpoint was complete response rate (CRR)and secondary endpoints were overall response rate(ORR) and toxicity. The trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2016/05/006904). Results: We enrolled 23 patients, 11patients received BR and 12 patients received LR. At a median follow up of 15 months, theCRRwas 63.6 %( n = 7) and 16.6% ( n = 2) in BR and LR arm respectively (p = 0.03). The ORR was 81.8% (n = 9) and 83.3 %( n = 10) in BR and LR arm respectively (p = 1.0). BR was better tolerated than LR with lower rates of all grade of toxicities (54% vs 92%),anemia (0% vs 33.3%), skin toxicity (18% vs 33%), diarrhoea (18% vs 42%), vomiting(9% vs 25%)and nephrotoxicity (0% vs 17%). There was no significant difference in grade 3 or 4 toxicities between BR and LR arm (27% vs 25%). Conclusions: The ORR was similar in both the arms, however, CRR were significantly higher with BR arm. BR was better tolerated than LR.

AB  - Introduction. Invasive mucormycosis (IM) is a potentially fatal infection caused by fungi of the order Mucorales. Histopathology, culture, and radiology are the mainstays of diagnosis, but they are not sufficiently sensitive, resulting in delayed diagnosis and intervention. Recent studies have shown that PCR-based techniques can be a promising way to diagnose IM.
   Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Early diagnosis of fungal infections using molecular diagnostic techniques can improve patient outcomes, especially in invasive mucormycosis.
   Aim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of our in-house mould-specific real time PCR assay (qPCR) in comparison with the commercially available real time PCR (MucorGenius PCR), for the early diagnosis of mucormycosis in tissue samples from patients with suspicion of invasive mucormycosis (IM). This in-house assay can detect and distinguish three clinically relevant mould species, e.g. Aspergillus spp., Mucorales and Fusarium spp. in a single reaction with only one pair of primers, without the need for sequencing.
   Methodology. We enrolled 313 tissue samples from 193 patients with suspected IM in this prospective study. All cases were classified using EORTC/MSGERC guidelines. All samples were tested using traditional methods, in-house qPCR, and MucorGenius PCR.
   Results. Using direct microscopy as a gold standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity of in-house qPCR for detection of IM was 92.46% and 80% respectively, while that of the MucorGenius PCR was 66.67% and 90% respectively. However, co-infection of IM and IA adversely affected the performance of MucorGenius PCR in detection of IM.
   The in-house PCR detected Aspergillus spp. in 14 cases and Fusarium spp. in 4 cases which showed clinical and radiological features of fungal sinusitis. The in-house qPCR also performed better in detecting possible cases of IM. This aids early diagnosis and appropriate treatment to improve patient outcomes.
   Conclusion. Because the in-house PCR is not only sensitive and specific, but also entirely based on SYBR Green for detection of targets, it is less expensive than probe-based assays and can be used on a regular basis for the diagnosis of IM in resource-constrained settings. It can be used to distinguish between mucormycosis and fungal sinusitis caused by Aspergillus and Fusarium in high-risk patients, as well as to accurately detect Mucorales in fungal co-infection cases.

AB  - A biomarker is a measurable indicator used to distinguish precisely/objectively either normal biological state/pathological condition/response to a specific therapeutic intervention. The use of novel molecular biomarkers within evidence-based medicine may improve the diagnosis/treatment of disease, improve health outcomes, and reduce the disease's socio-economic impact. Presently cancer biomarkers are the backbone of therapy, with greater efficacy and better survival rates. Cancer biomarkers are extensively used to treat cancer and monitor the disease's progress, drug response, relapses, and drug resistance. The highest percent of all biomarkers explored are in the domain of cancer. Extensive research using various methods/tissues is carried out for identifying biomarkers for early detection, which has been mostly unsuccessful. The quantitative/qualitative detection of various biomarkers in different tissues should ideally be done in accordance with qualification rules laid down by the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), Program for the Assessment of Clinical Cancer Tests (PACCT), and National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry. Many biomarkers are presently under investigation, but lacunae lie in the biomarker's sensitivity and specificity. An ideal biomarker should be quantifiable, reliable, of considerable high/low expression, correlate with the outcome progression, cost-effective, and consistent across gender and ethnic groups. Further, we also highlight that these biomarkers' application remains questionable in childhood malignancies due to the lack of reference values in the pediatric population. The development of a cancer biomarker stands very challenging due to its complexity and sensitivity/resistance to the therapy. In past decades, the cross-talks between molecular pathways have been targeted to study the nature of cancer. To generate sensitive and specific biomarkers representing the pathogenesis of specific cancer, predicting the treatment responses and outcomes would necessitate inclusion of multiple biomarkers.

AB  - Radical prostatectomy (RP) constitutes the primary treatment option for patients with clinically localized, biopsy-proven prostate cancer that requires local treatment with curative intent. Accurate reporting of radical prostatectomy specimens is required to guide further risk stratification and management of patients. Hence, for the handling and reporting of RP specimens, a standardized protocol should be followed. Many general pathologists may not be well-versed with the guidelines for the handling of radical prostatectomy specimens. This article discusses a detailed approach to grossing techniques, including specimen description, fixation requirements, gross cut-up, and reporting of the grade and stage of RP specimens. This will enable the pathologist to aid in multidisciplinary management.

AB  - Vulval tumours are rare, representing merely 4% of all gynaecological neoplasms. 98% of vulvar lesions are benign, and only 2% are malignant. Of all vulvar malig-nancies, while squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy, leiomyo-sarcomas of the vulva are extremely rare. Usually these tumours have nonspecific clinical manifestations, often leading to misdiagnoses of Bartholin cysts or abscesses. We describe a case of a 47-year-old woman who presented with a nonspecific pain-less swelling in the left vulva for 2 months which was diagnosed as leiomyosarcoma of the vulva on biopsy as well as resection.

AB  - Identification of the genomic features responsible for the progression of Multiple Myeloma (MM) cancer from its precancerous stage MGUS can improve the understanding of the disease pathogenesis and, in devising suitable preventive and treatment measures. We have designed an innovative AI-based model, namely, the Bioinspired Deep Learning architecture for the identification of altered Signaling Pathways (BDL-SP) to discover pivotal genomic biomarkers that can potentially distinguish MM from MGUS. The proposed BDL-SP model comprehends gene-gene interactions using the PPI network and analyzes genomic features using a deep learning (DL) architecture to identify significantly altered genes and signaling pathways in MM and MGUS. For this, whole exome sequencing data of 1174 MM and 61 MGUS patients were analyzed. In the quantitative benchmarking with the other popular machine learning models, BDL-SP performed almost similar to the two other best performing predictive ML models of Random Forest and CatBoost. However, an extensive post-hoc explainability analysis, capturing the application specific nuances, clearly established the significance of the BDL-SP model. This analysis revealed that BDL-SP identified a maximum number of previously reported oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, and actionable genes of high relevance in MM as the top significantly altered genes. Further, the post-hoc analysis revealed a significant contribution of the total number of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and genomic features associated with synonymous SNVs in disease stage classification. Finally, the pathway enrichment analysis of the top significantly altered genes showed that many cancer pathways are selectively and significantly dysregulated in MM compared to its precursor stage of MGUS, while a few that lost their significance with disease progression from MGUS to MM were actually related to the other disease types. These observations may pave the way for appropriate therapeutic interventions to halt the progression to overt MM in the future.

AB  - ObjectivePatients with chronic hypoparathyroidism (cHypoPT) are prone to intracranial-calcification, cataract and nephrocalcinosis. In this study, we systematically investigated the possibility of increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in them. DesignCross-sectional. Patients and MeasurementsNinety-four nonsurgical cHypoPT (M:F = 50:44; age = 45 +/- 15 years) with 18.6 +/- 9.3 years of illness were assessed. Those with dyspnoea, angina, syncope, abnormal electrocardiogram, echocardiography or significant CAC underwent coronary angiography or myocardial-perfusion-stress imaging. Their lipid parameters and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were compared with age-matched healthy controls (Group A, n = 101). The prevalence of CAC in cHypoPT was compared with that of subjects referred from cardiology-clinics (Group B, n = 148, age = 52 +/- 11 years). ResultsOne of 94 cHypoPT had known CAD. On screening, 17 cHypoPT required evaluation for CAD. Two of 17 had severe coronary stenosis, and 12 showed subclinical CAD. CAC and aortic-valve calcification occurred in 21.5% and 11.8%. Clinical and subclinical CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT >= 50 years of age was 8.1%, 27.0%, 52.8% and 27.8%, respectively. Frequency of age-adjusted CAC was comparable between cHypoPT and control Group B (30.2% vs. 30.7%, p = .93). Elevated hsCRP was higher in cHypoPT than in controls A (52% vs. 32%, p < .01). Factors associated with CAD in cHypoPT were CAC and hypertension. However, CAD and CAC showed no association with long-term calcemic or phosphatemic control and intracranial-calcification in cHypoPT. ConclusionsClinical and subclinical CAD was observed in 3.2% and 12.8% of cHypoPT patients. The increased prevalence of CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT above 50 years of age suggested their careful cardiac evaluation during follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To determine the feasibility, reliability, and acceptability of video teleconference (VTC)-based neuropsychological assessment using Addenbrooke's cognitive examination-III (ACE-III). Methods: This study was performed from January 2022 to April 2022, during the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India. We administered ACE-III using video-teleconferencing and compared the scores to face-to-face (FTF) testing for the eligible participants. We also conducted a participant's satisfaction survey of VTC-administered ACE-III compared to FTF-administered ACE-III, using a 7-point Likert scale. Results: We screened 37 participants and 24 (64.9%) successfully underwent ACE-III testing through VTC. We included 20 patients (mean age: 62.7 +/- 10 years, mean education: 12.0 +/- 4.6 years, 85% men) for final analysis, (who completed both VTC and FTF-administered ACE-III). Nine patients had major neurocognitive disorder (dementia), eight had mild neurocognitive disorder (MCI), and three had subjective cognitive decline (SCD). The two tests were administered at a median gap of 36 (18,74.5) days. The Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) of ACE-3 total scores (0.97) and the subdomain scores was high (>0.8). There was "very low" to "no" bias on the Bland-Altman plots, across all domains. The mean overall satisfaction score was 4.1, indicating that VTC is "as good as" FTF. Conclusions: Results support the feasibility and acceptability of remote administration of ACE-III via VTC. There is a good agreement between the ACE-III scores across VTC and in-person conditions.

AB  - Purpose: Elizabethkingia is an emerging non-fermenting Gram-negative bacillus (NFGNB) causing bloodstream infections (BSI) associated with high mortality. It demonstrates a unique antimicrobial profile in showing susceptibility to antimicrobials effective against Gram-positive bacteria. This study was undertaken to determine the overall frequency of Elizabethkingia BSI, associated risk factors, microbiological susceptibility, and clonal relationship of Elizabethkingia isolates using Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus Polymerase Chain Reaction (ERIC-PCR).Patients and Methods: Elizabethkingia isolates obtained from the blood culture of admitted patients (August 2020-December 2021) were identified by the VITEK 2 system and subjected to an antimicrobial susceptibility test by standard procedures. Demographics, co-morbidities, risk factors for survival, and outcome were summarized and analyzed by Chi-square test, Kaplan-Meier curve, and Cox regression. Clonal relatedness between Elizabethkingia isolates was analyzed using ERIC-PCR fingerprinting with the "PAST: Paleontological statistics software package".Results: Of 13,747 blood samples received during the study period, 13.59% were culture positive, and 14.60% were NFGNBs. The frequency of Elizabethkingia spp. among all NFGNBs in BSI was 29.30%, and the overall prevalence in BSI was 4.21%. In patients with Elizabethkingia BSI, Foley's catheter was present in 81.25% of the cases. 100% susceptibility was observed to linezolid, followed by vancomycin (98.75%) and chloramphenicol (89.5%). The 30-day mortality rate in the patients of Elizabethkingia BSI was 26.25%. The Presence of COVID-19, pneumonia, diabetes mellitus (DM), mechanical ventilation (MV), and prior antibiotics were significantly different (p<0.05) between the survival and death groups. ERIC-PCR profile dendrogram of Elizabethkingia isolates showed ten major clusters indicating high genetic diversity.Conclusion: Elizabethkingia was responsible for one-third of NFGNB BSI in a single-center study, with approximately 26% of 30 -day all-cause mortality. Most isolates were susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin, and chloramphenicol. COVID-19 was the most significant risk factor associated with mortality. ERIC-PCR of Elizabethkingia isolates exhibited high genetic diversity.

AB  - Background: Although well known in clinical practice, research in lichen planus pigmentosus and related dermal pigmentary diseases is restricted due to lack of consensus on nomenclature and disease definition.Aims and Objectives: Delphi exercise to define and categorise acquired dermal pigmentary diseases.Methods: Core areas were identified including disease definition, etiopathogenesis, risk factors, clinical features, diagnostic methods, treatment modalities and outcome measures. The Delphi exercise was conducted in three rounds.Results: Sixteen researchers representing 12 different universities across India and Australia agreed to be part of this Delphi exercise. At the end of three rounds, a consensus of >80% was reached on usage of the umbrella term 'acquired dermal macular hyperpigmentation'. It was agreed that there were minimal differences, if any, among the disorders previously defined as ashy dermatosis, erythema dyschromicum perstans, Riehl's melanosis and pigmented contact dermatitis. It was also agreed that lichen planus pigmentosus, erythema dyschromicum perstans and ashy dermatosis did not differ significantly apart from the sites of involvement, as historically described in the literature. Exposure to hair colours, sunlight and cosmetics was associated with these disorders in a significant proportion of patients. Participants agreed that both histopathology and dermatoscopy could diagnose dermal pigmentation characteristic of acquired dermal macular hyperpigmentation but could not differentiate the individual entities of ashy dermatosis, erythema dyschromicum perstans, Riehl's melanosis, lichen planus pigmentosus and pigmented contact dermatitis.Limitations: A wider consensus involving representatives from East Asian, European and Latin American countries is required.Conclusion: Acquired dermal macular hyperpigmentation could be an appropriate conglomerate terminology for acquired dermatoses characterised by idiopathic or multifactorial non-inflammatory macular dermal hyperpigmentation.

AB  - The International Academy of Cytology has joined with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to bring together a group of experts in lung cytopathology to develop a WHO Reporting System for Lung Cytopathology (WHO System). This WHO System defines five categories for reporting lung cytopathology, that is, "Insufficient"/"Inadequate"/"Non-diagnostic," "Benign," "Atypical," "Suspicious for malignancy," and "Malignant," each with a clear descriptive term for the category, a definition, a risk of malignancy and a suggested management algorithm. The key diagnostic cytopathology features of each of the lesions within each category have been established by consensus and will be presented more fully in a subsequent IARC e-book and published hard cover book.The WHO System provides the best practice application of ancillary testing, including immunocytochemistry and molecular pathology, and provides a review to guide sampling and processing techniques to optimize the handling and preparation of the cytopathology sample emphasizing the cytomorphological differential diagnosis to aid low-resourced settings. The authors recognize that local medical and pathology resources will vary, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, and have developed the WHO System to make it applicable worldwide based on cytomorphology with options for further diagnostic management of the patient.The online WHO System provides a direct link to the WHO Tumour Classification for Thoracic Tumours 5th Edition. It will raise the profile and use of cytopathology by increasing awareness of its current role and its potential role in the era of personalized medicine based on molecular pathology utilizing "small biopsies." Ultimately, the System will improve patient care and outcomes.This System aims to improve and standardize the reporting of cytopathology, facilitate communication between cytopathologists and clinicians and improve patient care. The System is based on the current role of lung cytopathology and synthesizes the existing evidence while highlighting areas requiring further research and the future potential role of lung cytopathology.

AB  - Background: Association between opioid use and sexual functioning is well-known. However, data evaluating the influence of treatment on different aspects of sexuality are lacking.
   Aim: To compare sexual behavior, functioning, relationship, satisfaction, and sexual quality of life (sQoL) among treatment naive patients (GROUP-I) with Opioid (heroin) dependence syndrome (ODS-H)with those maintained on buprenorphine (GROUP-II). Methods: Married adult males diagnosed with ODS-H, currently sexually active, and living with their partner were recruited. They were assessed for their sexual practices and high-risk sexual behavior (HRSB) through a semi-structured questionnaire and sexual functioning, relationships, satisfaction, and sQoL through structured questionnaires.
   Results: A total of 112 individuals (GROUP-I: 63; GROUP-II: 49) were recruited from the outpatient settings. Mean age and employment in GROUP-II were higher (p < 0.05) than in GROUP-I (37 vs 32 years; 94% vs 70%, respectively). Other sociodemographic variables and the age of onset of heroin use were comparable. The current practice of HRSB (e.g., engaging in casual partner sex, sex with commercial sex workers, and sex under intoxication) was higher in GROUP-I while almost no differences were seen in lifetime HRSB. The frequency of erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation in the two groups were: 78% vs 39% (p < 0.001), and 30% vs 6% (p = 0.001), respectively. GROUP-II had significantly higher scores in all the scales (p < 0.05) as compared to GROUP-I, indicating better sexual satisfaction, quality of life, and sexual relationship.
   Conclusion: Heroin use is associated with HRSB, poorer sexual functioning, overall satisfaction, and sQoL. Maintenance of Buprenorphine helps with improvement in all these parameters. Comprehensive management for substance use should target sexual problems as well.

AB  - Purpose: Assistive technology (AT) has recently received considerable attention around the world. Studies have shown poor access to assistive technology for visual impairment (ATVI) in schools for the blind in India. The present article aimed at designing a school-based model to improve AT access in schools and provide hands-on training, and identify types of ocular morbidities present among students. Methods: The vision rehabilitation (VR) team of a tertiary eye-care center visited schools for the blind as a part of community-based VR services. The team conducted a basic eye examination and assessed best-corrected vision acuity (BCVA) and provided VR services. Furthermore, two schools were selected to establish an ATVI learning center as a pilot model. Results: In total, 1887 students were registered for VR and obtained their disability certificates in 2019-20. Retina problems (25.7%), globe abnormalities (25.5%), optic nerve atrophy (13.6%), and squint (12.0%) were common ocular problems identified in students. Around 50.3% of students had BCVA(3) 1/60 in the better eye who would be benefited from visual-based AT, and the remaining students with visual substitution AT. Further, 20.8% of them who had near vision between N18 to N24 would be benefitted from large print books. Two schools were provided ATVI with support from the WHO. Familiarization, demonstration, and initial training for ATVI were carried out. Conclusion: A sizable number of the students would be benefitted from visual-based AT apart from visual substitutions AT. Students were interested to have such ATVI centers in the school for academic and non-academic skills development.

AB  - Vitreous hemorrhage is associated with a myriad of conditions such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy, proliferative retinopathy following vascular occlusion and vasculitis, trauma, retinal breaks, and posterior vitreous detachment without retinal break. Multiple pathological mechanisms are associated with development of vitreous hemorrhage such as disruption of abnormal vessels, normal vessels, and extension of blood from an adjacent source. The diagnosis of vitreous hemorrhage requires a thorough history taking and clinical examination including investigations such as ultra-sonography, which help decide the appropriate time for intervention. The prognosis of vitreous hemorrhage depends on the underlying cause. Treatment options include observation, laser photo-coagulation, cryotherapy, intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, and surgery. Pars plana vitrectomy remains the cornerstone of management. Complications of vitreous hemorrhage include glaucoma (ghost cell glaucoma, hemosiderotic glaucoma), proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and hemosiderosis bulbi.

AB  - Cerebral collateral circulation refers to the auxiliary vascular structures which compensate cerebral blood flow when it has been compromised due to stenosis or occlusion of the principal supplying arteries. They play a vital role in sustaining blood flow to the ischemic areas in acute, subacute or chronic phases of ischemic stroke or TIA. Good collateral circulation has shown protective effects towards a favorable functional outcome and a lower risk of recurrence of stroke. The benchmark mechanical thrombectomy trials utilized these collateral scoring methods to guide patient selection and prognosticate favorable outcome models. This shows a promising future of the collateral circulation for extending the time frame of the reperfusion therapies by optimally guiding patient selection and moving from a "time window" to a "tissue window."

AB  - Background: Cutaneous adnexal tumours (CATs) are one of the commonest clinical presentations in dermatology outpatients. They constitute a subset of skin tumours with a common clinical presentation and variable histological findings. Almost all of them clinically present as a subcutaneous nodule. Depending upon the site and distribution, the clinician can suspect the diagnosis. However, histopathological examination is the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis and proper subtyping of CATs. Aims: The present study is conducted to see the overall spectrum, incidence and distribution of CATs in a large cohort at the tertiary care centre with their clinical profile. Methods: This was a retrospective study in which all the CATs diagnosed over a period of 5 years (2015 to 2019) in a tertiary care hospital were studied. Clinical data were recorded from the histopathology requisition forms. Results: Three hundred and ninety-five cases of CATs were retrieved. Approximately 90% of cases were benign and 10% were malignant. The age of presentation ranged from 8 months to 81 years with male preponderance in all the histological subtypes. The most common site was the head and neck followed by the extremities. Morphologically, the maximum cases showed a differentiation towards sweat glands (44%), followed by sebaceous (29%), follicular (26.5%) and apocrine differentiation (5.3%). Malignant tumours were common in the elderly age group with sebaceous carcinoma being the commonest. Conclusion: CATs comprise of a wide spectrum of tumours occurring in all age groups. Malignant CATs are rare and common in older age groups. Histopathological examination is the gold standard in distinguishing between the different subtypes.

AB  - Depression and diabetes share a bidirectional causal association. Additionally, during the postpartum period women have an increased vulnerability for both depression and impaired glucose tolerance. The impact of the comorbidity of diabetes and postpartum depression is also bidirectional with an impaired course and outcome of both these disorders. The clinic visits for pregnancy and/ or diabetes care offer important opportunity to screen for postpartum (as well as prepartum) depression. Screening tools that are shorter, that take less time and acceptable are recommended. While a limited number of guidelines on management of depression among persons with diabetes have commented on management of the postpartum depression, the emphasis is on timely intervention using pharmacological and psycho- social interventions. There is a need to develop a collaborative approach involving various stakeholders to effectively manage postpartum depression and diabetes.

AB  - Purpose: To observe the photoreceptor anomalies in cases of ametropic amblyopia. Methods: A prospective study with 25 isoametropic amblyopic children in the age group of 5-14 years and 25 age-matched controls was done. Examination included refraction, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and color vision. Adaptive optics (AO) and multifocal electroretinogram (mf-ERG) were done to assess the anatomy and function of photoreceptors. The subgroup analysis of the improved and non-improved groups was done. Results: The mean cone density in cases and control in the superior, temporal, and nasal quadrants was respectively as follows (21640 +/- 5713, 24040 +/- 3386, P = 0.01) (19755 +/- 6282, 21832 +/- 2911, P = 0.03) (19897 +/- 5418, 22171 +/- 3660, P = 0.01) (20768 +/- 4799, 22819 +/- 3241, P = 0.01). The amplitude of N1 wave and P1 wave in cases was significantly low compared to the controls. Cases with subnormal color vision had reduced BCVA (0.55 +/- 0.018) in comparison to the children with normal response (0.350 +/- 0.014). Cone density was also significantly reduced in children with subnormal color vision. Sixteen out of 25 cases showed BCVA improvement with spectacles. Baseline cone density was found to be significantly higher in the improved group. There was no correlation between BCVA and AO parameters. Conclusion: Patients with ametropic amblyopia show subnormal photoreceptor properties than controls. Low cone density may be associated with defective color vision and poor prognosis in these cases.

AB  - Background:Dose-dense adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be associated with improved long-term survival outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, there is a lacuna of data on the benefits of dose-dense neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in TNBC.This retrospective study included 217 newly diagnosed cases of TNBC treated with a sequential anthracycline and taxane-based NACT, followed by definitive surgery. Study groups consisted of 137 patients who received 3-weekly conventional chemotherapy (cNACT group) and 80 patients with 2-weekly dose-dense NACT (ddNACT group). Pathological complete response (pCR) rates, relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and grade-3/4 chemotoxicities were compared across the groups.No significant difference in the pCR rate (32.8% versus 31.3%; P = 0.808) was observed across the study groups. Relapse rate was lower in the ddNACT group compared to the cNACT group (odds ratio [OR]: 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.95). However, ddNACT had no RFS advantage over conventional chemotherapy (median RFS: not reached versus 56.1 months in cNACT; hazard ratio: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.52-1.53). OS was also comparable in both the groups with a 3-year survival rate of 78.8% (95% CI: 60.9-89.2) in the ddNACT group versus 84.3% (95% CI: 74.8-90.4) in the cNACT group. Younger age, menopause, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ECOG status, and pCR were significantly associated with OS in our cohort. Grade-3 toxicities were comparable in both groups.This observational study focusing on ddNACT among TNBC patients demonstrated significant differences in the relapse rate with no survival benefits. Differential effects of ddNACT by tumor presentation (early vs. late), tumor size, tumor biology, and cost-benefits of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support with such regimens need further exploration.Dose-dense chemotherapy has been shown to be associated with improved long-term outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).[1] Currently, dose-dense neo-adjuvant (ddNACT) is the standard of care in patients with early and locally advanced stage TNBC based on the extrapolation of data from an adjuvant setting.[2] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) provides the opportunity to assess pathological response following surgical resection, and attainment of pathological complete response (pCR) has become an established surrogate marker for assessing long-term survival in breast cancer, especially in TNBC and HER2+ (human-epidermal growth factor receptor-2) breast cancer subtypes.[3] Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with sequential anthracyclines and a taxane-based regimen is the current standard of care in TNBC, and a pCR rate of around 30-35% has been demonstrated with these regimens in various trials.[2] Recently, various strategies have been tested to increase the pCR rate in TNBC. Dose-dense neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be associated with an increased rate of achievement of pCR.[4,5] Various strategies have been tried to increase the dose density of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which include dose escalation, reducing the interval between chemotherapy cycles, and sequential administration of chemotherapeutic agents.[1] However, the dose-escalation strategy did not translate into an increased pCR rate.[3] Recently, the addition of platinum compounds or immune-checkpoint inhibitors along with chemotherapy has been studied.[6-10] These strategies have shown promising results and may become the standard of care in the future.
   [11]Despite being a common subtype, there is a lack of data on the impact of anthracycline and taxane-based dose-dense NACT and its effects on pCR and survival outcomes.

Dose-dense neo-adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be associated with an increased rate of achievement of pCR.[4,5] Various strategies have been tried to increase the dose density of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which include dose escalation, reducing the interval between chemotherapy cycles, and sequential administration of chemotherapeutic agents.[1] However, the dose-escalation strategy did not translate into an increased pCR rate.[3] Recently, the addition of platinum compounds or immune-checkpoint inhibitors along with chemotherapy has been studied.[6-10] These strategies have shown promising results and may become the standard of care in the future.[11]Despite being a common subtype, there is a lack of data on the impact of anthracycline and taxane-based dose-dense NACT and its effects on pCR and survival outcomes. With this analysis, we intend to study the pCR rate in TNBC patients who underwent definitive surgery and compared pCR rates between patients treated with dose-dense NACT and conventional NACT.

AB  - The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in diabetic nephropathy (DN). Angiotensin-II secreted during the RAAS pathway increases nephropathy. It stimulates oxidative stress which can quench nitric oxide. Reduced nitric oxide level aggravates AngII-induced vasoconstriction. Ang-II has also emerged as a central mediator of the glomerular hemodynamic changes that are associated with renal injury. Deletion of ACE2 is also noted due to increased Ang-II level which leads to the development of DN. We hypothesize that nephropathy caused by Ang-II in the periphery may be controlled by brain RAAS. ACE inhibitors and ARBs may show the renoprotective effect when administered through ICV without crossing the blood-brain barrier. DN was observed after 8 weeks of diabetes induction through alloxan. Administration of captopril and valsartan once and in combined therapy for 2 weeks, significantly reduced urine output, blood urea nitrogen, total protein in the urine, serum cholesterol, serum creatinine, serum triglycerides, and kidney/body weight ratio as compared to diabetic control rats. Further, combination therapy significantly increased the body weight and serum nitrate level as compared to diabetic control animals. However, increased ACE2 levels in the brain may reduce the sympathetic outflow and might have decreased the peripheral activity of Ang-II which shows beneficial effects in DN.

AB  - Overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) resulting from its genomic rearrangement is the most frequent genetic alteration found in Philadelphia chromosome-like (Ph-like) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), a high-risk leukemia. Detection of CRLF2 expression by multiparameter flow cytometry has been proposed as a screening tool for the identification of Ph-like B-ALL. However, the prognostic relevance of flow cytometric expression of CRLF2 in pediatric B-ALL is not very clear. Additionally, its association with common copy number alterations (CNA) has not been studied in detail. Hence, in this study, we prospectively evaluated the flow cytometric expression of CRLF2 in 256 pediatric B-ALL patients and determined its association with molecular features such as common CNAs detected using Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and mutations in CRLF2, JAK2 and IL7RA genes. Further, its association with clinicopathological features including patient outcome was assessed. We found that 8.59% (22/256) pediatric B-ALL patients were CRLF2-positive at diagnosis. Among CNAs, CRLF2 positivity was associated with presence of PAX5 alteration (P=0.041). JAK2 and IL-7R mutations were found in 9% and 13.6% CRLF2-positive patients, respectively. IGH::CRLF2 or P2RY8::CRLF2 fusions were each found in 1/22 individuals. CRLF2-positive patients were found to have inferior overall (hazard ratio (HR) =4.39, P=0.006) and event free survival (HR=2.62, P=0.045), independent to other clinical features. Furthermore, concomitant CNA of IKZF1 in CRLF2 positive patients was associated with a greater hazard for poor overall and event free survival, compared to patients without these alterations or presence of any one of them. Our findings demonstrate that the surface CRLF2 expression in association with IKZF1 copy number alteration can be used to risk stratify pediatric B-ALL patients.

AB  - Background It has been more than 17 years since the introduction of free ART in India. At this point, it would be prudent to look at the factors associated with the survival of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (PLHA) who are already enrolled in the ART program. Methods PLHAs enrolled from antiretroviral therapy (ART) centers located in three different cities in India - Delhi, Pune and Kolkata, and were followed up at six monthly intervals monitoring the WHO stage, CD4 counts, complete blood counts, and liver and kidney function tests, for a duration of three years. Results and Discussion The incidence of mortality among HIV/AIDS patients on ART was 5.0 per 1000 patient-years (21/1410, 1.4%). Age at initiation of ART, being above 35 years, was the only significant predictor of mortality (log-rank p = 0.018). Multivariable analysis showed a significant association of an unfavourable outcome (defined as mortality or development of opportunistic infection during follow-up) with male gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.26, p = <0.01) and being unmarried at ART initiation (AOR = 1.39, p = 0.005). Conclusion The survival of PLHA with good adherence to ART is independent of the WHO stage or CD4 counts at the initiation of ART. Initiation of ART after 35 years of age was a significant predictor of mortality.

AB  - Background The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has received global attention. Due to a lack of recommended treatment regimens, the world faced various limitations resulting in improper management of the disease. Phytomedicines have played a prominent role in the prevention of various epidemics and pandemics in the past. Objective Here, we attempt to focus on safe and feasible use of Thuja occidentalis to manage and alleviate the panic of viral respiratory infections, including COVID-19, by strengthening an individual's immunity. The relevant information was collected from the web-based databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and MEDLINE, as well as other internet sources to review the applicability of T. occidentalis as a phytomedicine in managing respiratory infections and strengthening immunity. Conclusion As important phytomedicine, and antipsychotic, T. occidentalis possesses a plethora of immunological properties that can be used effectively in the management of viral respiratory infections and has the potential to prevent further progression of the disease. Importantly, this could be only a part of the approach for treatment during the current outbreak that should be considered along with other measures.

AB  - Background: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is frequently described for the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). A few studies have reported transbronchial cry-obiopsy for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL's). We aimed to study the utility and safety of transbronchial cryobiopsy for the diagnosis of PPL's.Methods: We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to extract the relevant studies. We then performed a meta-analysis to calculate the diagnostic yields of transbronchial cryobiopsy and bronchoscopic forceps biopsy. Results: Following a systematic search, we identified nine relevant studies (300 patients under-going cryobiopsy). All used Radial Endobronchial Ultrasound (R-EBUS) for PPL localization. The pooled diagnostic yield of transbronchial cryobiopsy was 77% (95% CI, 71%-84%) (I2 circumflex accent = 38.72%, p = 0.11). The diagnostic yield of forceps biopsy was 72% (95% CI, 60%-83%) (I2 circumflex accent = 78.56%, p < 0.01). The diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy and forceps biopsy was similar (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96--1.15), with a 5% risk difference for diagnostic yield (95% CI, -6% to 15%). There was significant heterogeneity (I2 circumflex accent = 57.2%, p = 0.017), and no significant publication bias. One severe bleeding and three pneumothoraxes requiring intercostal drain (ICD) placement (major complication rate 4/122, 1.8%) were reported with transbronchial cryobiopsy.Conclusions: R-EBUS guided transbronchial cryobiopsy is a safe and efficacious modality. The diagnostic yields of TBLC and forceps biopsy are similar. More extensive multicentre randomized trials are required for the further evaluation and standardization of transbronchial cryobiopsy for PPL's.(c) 2021 Sociedade Portuguesa de Pneumologia.

AB  - Background. The World Health Organization's call for elimination of cervical cancer envisages 70% screening coverage of women aged 35 and 45 years by an effective test. In India, this target seems unrealistic as awareness and access to cancer prevention services are poor. However, the institutional delivery rate is now >80%. We evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing and its role in screening during pregnancy.
   Methods. This observational study recruited 275 pregnant women aged >25 years between 12 and 34 weeks of gestation for screening by cytology and HPV testing. Colposcopy was advised if either test was positive. Acceptability and feasibility were assessed by a questionnaire.
   Results. Cytology and HPV reports were available for 269 subjects. The median age was 28 years and median parity was two. Only 98 (36.4%) had heard about carcinoma cervix. Awareness improved with education (p<0.001). On cytology, only 4 (1.5%) were abnormal (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance 3; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion 1). The prevalence of high-risk HPV infection was 8.2% (22/269). On colposcopy, all had the Swede score <5. No high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or carcinoma was detected. Pre-procedure, 183 (68.0%) subjects expressed apprehension, post-procedure 114 (42.4%) of them had realized that their apprehensions were unfounded. Women found screening to be more uncomfortable after 28 weeks of gestation (n=26/68; 38.2%; p<0.001). Physicians found the cervix more difficult to visualize after 20 weeks of gestation (p<0.001).
   Conclusions. HPV screening at 16-20 weeks of pregnancy is acceptable, feasible, and can greatly improve screening coverage in resource-limited settings. Pregnancy is a good opportunity to improve awareness of the screening programmes.

AB  - Cutaneous mastocytosis is a neoplasm characterized by the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells in the skin. There can be involvement of other organ systems as well. Cutaneous manifestations can vary from mastocytoma to maculopapular lesions to diffuse cutaneous form. There can be symptoms associated with mast cell mediators release like itching, flushing, hypotension, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and anaphylaxis. Hence, the mainstay of treatment is avoidance of triggers causing these mediators to release, anti-histamines, topical/intra-lesional/systemic steroids, mast cell-targeted therapy, epinephrine, and omalizumab depending upon the severity of symptoms/signs. Childhood cases usually have a good prognosis except in a few cases, especially those with systemic involvement. Such situations might warrant cytoreductive therapy, polychemotherapy, or autologous stem cell transplantation. Here, we intend to review the English literature on childhood cutaneous mastocytosis.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is one of the quiet prevalent and aggressive biliary tract malignant neoplasms distinguished by significant cellular heterogeneity, metastatic activity, and a poor prognosis, with varied frequency worldwide. Most cases are detected incidentally while routine screening imaging or pathological investigation of cholecystectomy tissues and usually present with advanced disease. The surgical resection is usually done in the initial clinical stage having limited spread. Despite the surgical therapy, the death rate is significant. Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms affecting the clinical course of inflammatory gallbladder to carcinogenesis remain poorly understood. There is an impending need for developing diagnostic biomarkers and targeted approaches for GBC. The newer molecular platform, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), such as RNA-sequencing (RNAseq), single-cell sequencing, and microarray technology, has revolutionized the field of genomics, opened a new perspective in defining genetic and epigenetic characteristics identifying molecules as possible therapeutic targets. Therefore, in this review, we would analyze transcriptomic and epigenomics profiles of GBC using already published high-throughput sequencing-based studies published between 2010 and 2023. The review would also analyze the possible impact of the technological advancement on the patient management strategy and overall survival. This may also help identify target genes and pathways linked to GBC, which may help establish molecular biomarkers, for early GBC diagnosis, personalized therapy, and management.

AB  - Airwriting recognition is the task of identifying letters written in free space with finger movement. It is a dynamic gesture recognition with the vocabulary of gestures corresponding to letters in a given language. Electromyography (EMG) is a technique used to record electrical activity during muscle contraction and relaxation as a result of movement and is widely used for gesture recognition. Most of the current research in gesture recognition is focused on identifying static gestures. However, dynamic gestures are natural and user-friendly for being used as alternate input methods in human-computer interaction (HCI) applications. Airwriting recognition using EMG signals recorded from forearm muscles is, therefore, a viable solution. Since the user does not need to learn any new gestures and a large range of words can be formed by concatenating these letters, it is generalizable to a wider population. There has been limited work in recognition of airwriting using EMG signals and forms the core idea of the current work. The SurfMyoAiR dataset comprising of EMG signals recorded during writing English uppercase alphabets is constructed. Several different time-domain features to construct EMG envelope and two different time-frequency image representations: short-time Fourier transform and continuous wavelet transform were explored to form the input to a deep learning model for airwriting recognition. Several different deep learning architectures were exploited for this task. In addition, the effect of various parameters, such as signal length, window length, and interpolation techniques on the recognition performance, is comprehensively explored. The best-achieved accuracy was 78.50% and 62.19% in user-dependent and user-independent scenarios, respectively, by using short-time Fourier transform in conjunction with a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifier. Airwriting has great potential as a user-friendly modality to be used as an alternate input method in HCI applications.

AB  - (i) Background: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Covishield((R))) vaccine is widely used in India. We studied the Covishield((R)) induced antibody response and its durability among health care workers (HCWs) (ii) Method: HCWs received two doses (0.5 mL) four weeks apart. Blood specimens, collected before each dose, day (D) 60, D150 and D270 after second dose, were tested for anti-spike antibody (ASAb) titre and neutralising antibody (%) (NAb) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche) and SARS-CoV-2 NAb ELISA Kit (Invitrogen), respectively. Data are expressed as proportions and median (interquartile range) and compared using non-parametric (iii) Result: Among 135 HCWs (83 males; age 45 (37-53); 36 had pre-existing ASAb), 29 (21.5%) acquired COVID-19 after 60 (39-68) days of vaccination. ASAb titre before second dose and at D60, D150, D270 were 77.2 (19.4-329.4), 512 (114.5-9212), 149 (51.6-2283) and 2079 (433.9-8644) U/mL, respectively. Compared to those without pre-existing ASAb, titres were significantly higher before second dose (5929 vs. 41, p < 0.001), D60 (3395 vs. 234, p = 0.007) and D150 (1805 vs. 103, p < 0.001) in participants with pre-existing ASAb; NAb were also higher (80 vs. 18, p < 0.001) before second dose. Between those who acquired infection or not after vaccination, ASAb titres were comparable before second dose (77 vs. 78, p = 0.362) but significantly higher at D60 (14,019 vs. 317, p < 0.001) and D150 (2062 vs. 121, p = 0.002) in the former group, though NAb percentage were higher at D60 (87 vs. 27, p < 0.001) and D150 (79 vs. 25, p = 0.007) only (iv) Conclusions: Covishield((R)) induces a higher antibody titre in those with pre-existing ASAb. The vaccine induced antibody starts falling 5 months after vaccination.

AB  - Introduction: Atherosclerosis has been shown to impact cognitive impairment, with most of the evidence originating from European, African, or East Asian populations that have employed carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) as a biomarker for atherosclerosis. Vascular disease is related to dementia/cognitive decline. There is no community-based study from India that has looked at the association of cIMT with cognitive performance. Methods: In this cross-sectional study between December 2014 and 2019, we recruited 7505 persons [(mean age 64.6 (9.2) y) and 50.9% women] from a community-dwelling population in New Delhi. These persons underwent carotid ultrasound to quantify cIMT and a cognitive test battery that tapped into memory, processing speed, and executive function. We also computed the general cognitive factor (g-factor), which was identified as the first unrotated component of the principal component analysis and explained 37.4% of all variances in the cognitive tests. We constructed multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. Additional adjustment was made for depression, anxiety, and psychosocial support in the final model. Results: We found a significant association of higher cIMT with worse performance in general cognition (beta=-0. 01(95% CI: -0.01; -0.01); P<0.001), processing speed (beta=-0.20; 95% CI: -0.34; -0.07); P=0.003), memory (beta=-0.29; 95% CI: -0.53; -0.05); P=0.016), and executive function (beta=-0.54; 95% CI: -0.75; -0.33); P=<0.001). There was no statistically significant association of cIMT with Mini-Mental Status Examination score (beta=0.02; 95% CI: -0.34; 0.40; 0.89). Conclusion: The cross-sectional study found significant associations of increased cIMT with worse performance in global cognition, information processing, memory, and executive function.

AB  - Purpose: The present study was a population-based study to determine the prevalence and causes of low vision in children less than 16 years in North India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 40 clusters of urban Delhi. Children aged less than 16 years underwent visual acuity screening using age-appropriate visual acuity charts. All children with visual acuity of < 6/12 in any eye in the age group between 3 and 15 years and inability to follow the light in age less than 3 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination in a centrally based clinic. Cycloplegic examination and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed. They were examined by an ophthalmologist to determine the prevalence and causes of functional low vision (FLV). The prevalence of FLV was compared with other population-based studies across India and other parts of the world. Results: Amongst 20,955 children examined for visual acuity, 789 children were referred to the central clinic for detailed ophthalmic examination. The overall prevalence of low vision was 0.62 per 1,000 children (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-1.90). The main anatomical cause of low vision was retinal abnormalities. Conclusion: Although the prevalence of children with low vision decreased as compared to previous population-based studies. There is an important need to create awareness among parents on appropriate and timely usage of low-vision devices (LVDs) at an affordable cost to improve the visual quality in children with low vision.

AB  - Simple Summary Antibiotic resistance has become one of the biggest threats to global health. The occurrence of resistance is a natural phenomenon of bacterial evolution, but their inappropriate use in humans and the environment is hastening the process at a reckless speed. The speed of developing resistance is at par or, in fact, more than the speed of novel antibiotic development. Most of the big pharmaceutical companies have left antibiotic research due to the high risk of failure and poor return on investment. Antibiotic research is mostly carried out by academic institutes and small- and medium-sized enterprises. However, they lack sufficient funds to take the compounds from early-and-mid-stage to clinical trials and market. To make this possible, several government and non-government organizations worldwide have come forward to incentivize research through push funding mechanisms. The positive impact of these mechanisms, which started around a decade ago, is now visible, with fair improvements in research pipelines in the last five years. However, a large landscape of push incentives across the globe and staggered funding across different stages of development make the process complex. Efforts in various forms are now being implemented and proposed to streamline and smoothen push funding mechanisms for reinvigorating antibiotic research. The growing need for effective antibiotics is attributed to the intrinsic ability of bacteria to develop survival mechanisms. The speed at which pathogens develop resistance is at par or even faster than the discovery of newer agents. Due to the enormous cost of developing an antibiotic and poor return on investment, big pharmaceutical companies are stepping out of the antibiotic research field, and the world is now heading towards the silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance. Lack of investment in research has further led to the anemic antibiotic pipeline. To overcome these challenges, various organizations have come forward with push funding to financially assist antibiotic developers. Although push funding has somewhat reinvigorated the dwindled field of antibiotic development by bearing the financial risks of failure, the landscape is still large and staggered. Most of the funding is funneled towards the early stages; however, to carry the promising compounds forward, equal or more funding is required formid- and late-stage research. To some extent, the complexity associated with accessing the funding mechanisms has led to their underutilization. In the present review, we discuss several major push funding mechanisms, issues in their effective utilization, recent strategies adopted, and a way forward to streamline funding in antibiotic research.

AB  - Background/Aims: The utility of Baveno-VII criteria of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) to predict decompensation in compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) patient needs validation. We aim to validate the performance of CSPH criteria to predict the risk of decompensation in an international real-world cohort of cACLD patients.Methods: cACLD patients were stratified into three categories (CSPH excluded, grey zone, and CSPH). The risks of decompensation across different CSPH categories were estimated using competing risk regression for clustered data, with death and hepatocellular carcinoma as competing events. The performance of "treating definite CSPH" strategy to prevent decompensation using non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) was compared against other strategies in decision curve analysis.Results: One thousand one hundred fifty-nine cACLD patients (36.8% had CSPH) were included; 7.2% experienced decompensation over a median follow-up of 40 months. Non-invasive assessment of CSPH predicts a 5-fold higher risk of liver decompensation in cACLD patients (subdistribution hazard ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-7.4). "Probable CSPH" is suboptimal to predict decompensation risk in cACLD patients. CSPH exclusion criteria reliably exclude cACLD patients at risk of decompensation, regardless of etiology. Among the grey zone, the decompensation risk was negligible among viral-related cACLD, but was substantially higher among the non-viral cACLD group. Decision curve analysis showed that "treating definite CSPH" strategy is superior to "treating all varices" or "treating probable CSPH" strategy to prevent decompensation using NSBB. Conclusions: Non-invasive assessment of CSPH may stratify decompensation risk and the need for NSBB in cACLD patients. (Clin Mol Hepatol 2023;29:135-145)

AB  - OBJECTIVE Training of international medical graduates (IMGs) offers opportunities for the US neurosurgery community to engage the global talent pool and impact national and international healthcare. Here, the authors analyzed the time trend of IMGs matching into US neurosurgery programs and identified potential opportunities for enhancing IMG engagement. METHODS The authors analyzed the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) match results, NRMP program director (PD) surveys, and applicant surveys from 2013 to 2022. Regression methods were used to analyze time trends. RESULTS Between 2013 and 2022, the number of US neurosurgery residency positions increased by 17.6% (from 204 to 240). During this period, the percentage of IMGs matching into neurosurgery increased from 3.5% to 7%, translating into a 6.8% increase in the likelihood of a successful IMG match per year (95% CI 0.3%-13.8%, p = 0.042). The likelihoods of a successful match for US MDs and IMGs scoring > 260 on the USMLE Step 1 were > 90% and approximately 55%, respectively. In PD surveys, approximately 90% of PDs indicated that they seldom/never interview or rank IMGs. In terms of factors that influenced the PD decision for interviewing/ranking, IMGs are disadvantaged in several categories, including the ability to secure an audition elective/rotation, and proper letters of recommendation, as well as the influence of the culture on the preconceived perception of poor interpersonal skills. CONCLUSIONS The number of IMGs matching successfully in neurosurgery has increased marginally during the past decade. The authors outline the challenges that IMGs encounter in this process and suggest strategies for considerations of IMG training in NRMP-associated institutions.

AB  - Background: Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) is one of the most commonly used trauma scores and is a good predictor of outcome in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. There are other more complex scores with additional physiological parameters. Whether they discriminate better than GCS in predicting mortality in TBI patients is debatable. The aim of this study was to compare the discrimination of GCS with that of MGAP, GAP, RTS and KTS for 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality in adult TBI patients, in a resource limited LMIC setting.Method: We analysed data from the multicentre, observational trauma cohort Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcome (TITCO) in India. We included all patients 18 years or older, admitted from the emergency department with TBI. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve was used to quantify and compare the discrimination of all scores: GCS; Revised Trauma Score (RTS); mechanism, GCS, age, systolic blood pressure (MGAP); GCS, age, systolic blood pressure ( GAP ) and Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) in the prediction of 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality.Results: A total of 3306 TBI patients were included in this study. The majority were within the GCS range 3-8. The commonest mechanism of injury was road traffic injuries [1907(58.0%)]. In-hospital mortality was 27.2% (899). There was no significant difference in discrimination in 24-hour in-hospital mortality when comparing GCS with MGAP and GAP. While GCS performed better than KTS, RTS performed better than GCS. For 30-day in-hospital mortality, GCS discriminated significantly better compared with KTS, but there was no significant difference when compared to MGAP and RTS. GAP discriminated significantly better when compared with GCS. Conclusion: This study shows that the discrimination of GCS is comparable to that of more complex trauma scores in predicting 24-hour and 30-day in-hospital mortality in adult TBI patients in a resource limited LMIC setting.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly evolving over the time and the genetic variation has led to the generation of Variants of Concerns (VoC), which have shown increased fitness. These VoC viruses contain the key mutations in the spike protein which have allowed better survival and evasion of host defense mechanisms. The D614G mutation in the spike domain is found in the majority of VoC; additionally, the P681R/H mutation at the S1/S2 furin cleavage site junction is also found to be highly conserved in major VoCs; Alpha, Delta, Omicron, and its' current variants. The impact of these genetic alterations of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs on the host cell entry, transmissibility, and infectivity has not been clearly identified. In our study, Delta and D614G + P681R synthetic double mutant pseudoviruses showed a significant increase in the cell entry, cell-to-cell fusion and infectivity. In contrast, the Omicron and P681H synthetic single mutant pseudoviruses showed TMPRSS2 independent cell entry, less fusion and infectivity as compared to Delta and D614G + P681R double mutants. Addition of exogenous trypsin further enhanced fusion in Delta viruses as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, Delta viruses showed susceptibility to both E64d and Camostat mesylate inhibitors suggesting, that the Delta virus could exploit both endosomal and TMPRSS2 dependent entry pathways as compared to the Omicron virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the D614G and P681R/H mutations in the spike protein are pivotal which might be favoring the VoC replication in different host compartments, and thus allowing a balance of mutation vs selection for better long-term adaptation.

AB  - The coordination of the body with the central nervous system has been studied using various biomechan-ical, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies. Different postural strategies provide evidence of cor-tical involvement to maintain postural stability, which can be utilised to minimise the risk of falls in the elderly and various pathological individuals. In this paper, we investigated the effect of vibrotactile feed-back in Electroencephalography (EEG) based classification of voluntary postural sway during weight-shifting exercises in healthy and transfemoral amputees. The EEG data recorded during forward, back-ward, right, and left shifting as well as normal standing, with and without vibrotactile feedback, is decomposed using discrete wavelet transform. The energy of the coefficients from levels 4 to 7 forms the feature space to be forwarded to the weighted kNN classifier and ensemble bagged trees. We have achieved significantly higher classification rates across all the conditions for healthy and amputee sub-jects. Predictor importance from ensemble bagged tree models provides the highest contributions from the low-frequency band of 0-3.9 Hz and channels located over the motor and somatosensory cortex. We have also observed the contributions associated with the spinocerebellum and cerebrocerebellum.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context The American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines recommend Dynamic Risk Stratification (DRS) for predicting long-term outcomes and personalizing management in adult differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs). However, its applicability in pediatric DTCs needs to be validated. Objective We have attempted a validation study concerning the use of DRS in pediatric DTCs. Methods Data of children (age <= 18 years) with DTCs and follow-up of >= 5 years were extracted. All patients were classified according to DRS (excellent biochemical or structural incomplete responses). Univariate and multivariate analyses were done to identify factor(s) affecting disease-free survival (DFS). Results We included 176 pediatric patients with DTC (median age at diagnosis 15 years). All patients underwent thyroidectomy and received radioiodine as part of initial management. On the basis of clinical, biochemical, and imaging findings acquired during the first 2 years of follow-up, the DRS system divided patients into 3 response categories: excellent response in 82/176 (46.6%), biochemical incomplete response in 56/176 (31.8%), and structural incomplete response in 38/176 (21.6%) patients. The median follow-up was 10.6 years (interquartile range 7.7-15.5). Ten-year overall survival and DFS rates were 100% and 88.7%, respectively. In univariate analysis, DFS was significantly affected by extrathyroidal extension (P = .002), lymph node metastasis (P = .018), ATA initial risk stratification (P = .033), and DRS (P = .004). However, in multivariate analysis, DRS alone showed a significant association with DFS (P = .016). Conclusion Like adults, DRS correctly predicts long-term outcomes in pediatric DTC. In addition to ATA initial risk stratification, DRS could further refine risk in pediatric DTCs and help in planning more personalized treatment and follow-up strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Most cases of bronchopulmonary sequestration ( BPS) regress. Prenatal intervention is needed in cases of fetal hydrothorax or hydrops. Laser is commonly used to ablate the feeding arteryCase presentation: Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA) was used to ablate the feeding artery from descending aorta in a case of extralobar BPS at 29 weeks gestation. The fetus had significant pleural effusion causing mediastinal shift and collapse of lung. The effusion and tumor started decreasing from day 3 after procedure. By the time patient delivered at 36 weeks gestation, the lesion had almost resolvedConclusion : with proper technique , RFA can be safely used to ablate feeding artery in BPS

AB  - Fruit crops, including bananas, apples, citrus fruit, grape, berries, etc. not only offer essential nutrients for sustaining healthy human life but also contribute to a major part of the GDP of many countries. Given the unprecedented climatic alterations and anticipated hidden conflicts, food and nutritional insecurity concerns of the world are mounting alarmingly high over the last few decades. These daunting conditions show how a huge section of the global population is currently "chronically undernourished". However, since the green revolution, access to food has substantially increased; but unfortunately, these foods are considered deprived of overall nutritional contents. Thus to guarantee global food and nutritional insecurity concerns, it is enormously crucial that the agricultural productivity of Nutri-enriched food crops must be widely amplified within a few years or decades. For this, conventional breeding assisted with intensive agricultural practices, extensive use of agrochemicals, more farm mechanization, and additional agricultural land is required. Therefore, these approaches are not much viable, effective, and unable to offer long-term solutions. Henceforth, we have to search for alternate sources of foods with high nutritional values, and breeding strategies to supplement our growing food and nutritional requirements. Therefore, the fruits can be an efficient candidate and viable to tackle aforesaid issues. However, the quality traits, nutritional values, and productivity of most fruit crops are deteriorated because of several hidden factors. Overall quality traits, nutritional values, and yield potentials of the fruit crops can be augmented by integrating conventional breeding with newly evolved high-throughput modern biotechnology platforms like gene or, genome editing technologies. Until that, many scientific efforts have been made in all cereal crops but very scarce or no efforts have been reported in imperative fruit crops using genome editing technologies. Henceforth, with this holistic vision, the present manuscript elaborates on the mechanisms, recent advances, challenges, and potentials of CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing as a possible candidate "game changer" technology for targeted improvement of fruit crops. In total without a doubt, the rapidly advancing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing with great breeding efficiency will certainly boost the overall improvement of fruit crops.

AB  - Primary splenic lymphomas are rare with the majority of lymphomas in spleen being secondary to an extra-splenic lymphoma. We aimed to analyze the epidemiological profile of the splenic lymphoma and review the literature. This was a retrospective study including all splenectomies and splenic biopsies from 2015 to September 2021. All the cases were retrieved from Department of Pathology. Detailed histopathological, clinical and demographic evaluation was done. All the lymphomas were classified according to WHO 2016 classification. A total of 714 splenectomies were performed for a variety of benign causes, as part of tumor resections and for the diagnosis of lymphoma. Few core biopsies were also included. A total of 33 lymphomas diagnosed in the spleen, primary splenic lymphomas constituted 84.84% (n = 28) of the cohort with 5 (15.15%) having the primary site elsewhere. The primary splenic lymphomas constituted 0.28% of all the lymphomas arising at various sites. Adult population (19-65 years) formed the bulk (78.78%) with a slight male preponderance. Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (n = 15, 45.45%) comprised of major proportion of cases followed by primary splenic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 4, 12.12%). Splenectomy was the main course of treatment for SMZL with a good overall outcome, with chemotherapy & PLUSMN; radiotherapy forming the mainstay in other lymphomas. Lymphomas in spleen can be infiltrative or a primary, hence proper clinic-radiological and pathological evaluation is required. Appropriate management is guided by the precise and detailed evaluation by the pathologist, requiring understanding of the same.

AB  - The association of airborne particulate matter exposure with the deteriorating function of the cardiovascular system is fundamentally driven by the impairment of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk orchestrated by aberrant redox signaling. The loss of delicate balance in retrograde communication from mitochondria to the nucleus often culminates in the methylation of the newly synthesized strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through DNA methyl transferases. In highly metabolic active tissues such as the heart, mtDNA's methylation state alteration impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics. It affects transcriptional regulatory processes involved in biogenesis, fission, and fusion, often accompanied by the integrated stress response. Previous studies have demonstrated a paradoxical role of mtDNA methylation in cardiovascular pathologies linked to air pollution. A pronounced alteration in mtDNA methylation contributes to systemic inflammation, an etiological determinant for several co-morbidities, including vascular endothelial dysfunction and myocardial injury. In the current article, we evaluate the state of evidence and examine the considerable promise of using cell-free circulating methylated mtDNA as a predictive biomarker to reduce the more significant burden of ambient air pollution on cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - -BACKGROUND: Simulation-based neurosurgical training allows the development of surgical skills outside the oper-ating room. However, the use of nonstandardized materials and poor haptic feedback remain the primary limitations of the surgical simulators. Therefore, this work proposes a comprehensive scheme for scalp and dura surrogate synthe-sis and their standardization for neurosurgical training.-METHODS: Eight different variants of silicone-based scalp (S1-S8) and dura (D1-D8) surrogates were synthe-sized. The samples were evaluated by 26 neurosurgeons. They provided their feedback in a Likert scale ques-tionnaire. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn multiple com-parisons was used for statistical analysis of surgeons' scores. The samples were mechanically characterized using Shore A hardness and dynamic nanoindentation testing.-RESULTS: The highest mean Likert score values were obtained for S3 scalp and D8 dura variants. The comparison of S3 and D8 with the rest of the variants in the respective groups was statistically significant in 21 of 28 instances. The average Shore A hardness and storage modulus of the S3 variant were 21.9 DU and 505.3 kPa, respectively. The corresponding values for the D8 variant were 32.5 DU and 632 kPa, respectively.-CONCLUSIONS: This study proposes a method for the synthesis, evaluation, and standardization of scalp and dura surrogates. The study achieved standardized silicone compositions along with a recommendable range of Shore hardness and viscoelastic moduli values for the scalp and dura surrogates. This work can be extended for the standardization of surrogates for other tissues involved in neurosurgical simulators.

AB  - The question of how lung cancer progresses in never-smokers remains largely unanswered. In our analysis of data from 1727 lung cancer patients, we observed a difference of only 47 days in the overall survival between lung adenocarcinoma patients who were smokers vis-a-vis never-smokers - the disease has a poor prognosis irrespective of the smoking status, or gender. We have investigated the possible collaboration between the nAChR and hypoxia signaling pathway to explicate a mechanism of disease progression in never-smokers using patientderived tumor cells. We found a previously unidentified increase in both acetylcholine and nAChR-& alpha;7 levels in non-small cell lung cancer cells in hypoxia. A similar increase in ubiquitously expressed nAChR-& alpha;7 transcripts was also observed in other cancer lines and primary tumor tissues. A direct binding of HIF-1 & alpha; with the hypoxiaresponse element (HRE) present at -48 position preceding the transcriptional start site in nAChR-& alpha;7 promoter region was established. Crucially, the increased acetylcholine levels in hypoxia drove a feedback loop via modulation of PI3K/AKT pathway to stabilize HIF-1 & alpha; in hypoxia. Further, hypoxia-mediated metastasis and induction of HIF-1 & alpha; in these cells was significantly reversed by bungarotoxin, an antagonist of nAChR-& alpha;7. The nAChR-AKT-HIF network needs to be further investigated to conclusively prove its mechanism and to explore its therapeutic potential. Our study gives a plausible explanation for the equally worse prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers wherein the nAChR signaling is enhanced in hypoxia by acetylcholine in the absence of nicotine.

AB  - Dengue is an important public health problem with a wide clinical spectrum. The World Health Organization classifies dengue into probable dengue, dengue with warning signs, and severe dengue. Severe dengue, characterized by plasma leakage, severe bleeding, or organ impairment, entails significant morbidity and mortality if not treated timely. There are no definitive curative medications for dengue; management is supportive. Judicious fluid resuscitation during the critical phase of dengue is the cornerstone of management. Crystalloids are the initial fluid of choice. Prophylactic platelet transfusion is not recommended. Organ involvement in severe dengue should be carefully looked for and managed. Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a potentially fatal complication of dengue that needs to be recognized, as specific management with steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin may improve outcomes. Several compounds with anti-dengue potential are being studied; no anti-dengue drug is available so far.

AB  - A 14-month child presenting with complaints of spastic paraplegia was diagnosed with C6-D1 intramedullary cyst. A cysto-subarachnoid shunt was performed; the patient was clinically stable in the immediate post-operative period. On post-operative day 2, the patient developed multiple episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) with altered sensorium, NCCT head revealed bilateral diffuse parieto-occipital hypodensities. MRI brain showed on T2WI and FLAIR, diffuse hyperintensities in bilateral parieto-occipital region suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The patient never experienced hypertensive episodes and was treated with anti-epileptics. The patient's symptoms improved and repeat MRI after 10 weeks revealed normal signal intensity in bilateral parieto-occipital areas. PRES after spinal surgeries is very rare and more so in pediatric cases, CSF hypotension may contribute to PRES in such cases.

AB  - IntroductionAlong with the rising prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)], biological therapies need an update/insight.Area coveredThis review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from PubMed database (2000-October 2022) of approved biologics and small molecules with primary outcome analysis on efficacy (clinical response/remission/mucosal healing) and/or adverse events (AEs). Considered for this review under biologics classes are TNF-alpha inhibitors, leukocyte trafficking inhibitors, and anti IL-12/IL-23; and under small molecules are Janus-kinase inhibitors, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators.Expert opinionIn CD, clinical response and remission were better with tofacitinib (61.23%) and infliximab (44.86%), respectively, in the induction phase, and these were better with ustekinumab in the maintenance phase. In UC, the maximum rate of response, remission, and mucosal healing were obtained with infliximab during the induction phase (67.49%, 35.99%, and 60.25%, respectively). During the maintenance phase, response rate was better with ustekinumab, but remission and mucosal healing were better with vedolizumab. The combined percentage of AEs was highest with infliximab (174.45%) and least with ozanimod (23.04%), and most commonly belonged to the 'infection and infestation system organ class (SOC).' These efficacy and safety analyses will help in the optimization of biologic treatment in IBD.

AB  - Recent evidence suggests that the prognostic impact of gene mutations in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) may differ depending on the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) gene somatic hypermutation (SHM) status. In this study, we assessed the impact of nine recurrently mutated genes (BIRC3, EGR2, MYD88, NFKBIE, NOTCH1, POT1, SF3B1, TP53, and XPO1) in pre-treatment samples from 4580 patients with CLL, using time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) as the primary end-point in relation to IGHV gene SHM status. Mutations were detected in 1588 (34.7%) patients at frequencies ranging from 2.3-9.8% with mutations in NOTCH1 being the most frequent. In both univariate and multivariate analyses, mutations in all genes except MYD88 were associated with a significantly shorter TTFT. In multivariate analysis of Binet stage A patients, performed separately for IGHV-mutated (M-CLL) and unmutated CLL (U-CLL), a different spectrum of gene alterations independently predicted short TTFT within the two subgroups. While SF3B1 and XPO1 mutations were independent prognostic variables in both U-CLL and M-CLL, TP53, BIRC3 and EGR2 aberrations were significant predictors only in U-CLL, and NOTCH1 and NFKBIE only in M-CLL. Our findings underscore the need for a compartmentalized approach to identify high-risk patients, particularly among M-CLL patients, with potential implications for stratified management.

AB  - Background Introduction of the classification of brain tumours based on DNA methylation profile has significantly changed the diagnostic approach. Due to the paucity of data on the molecular profiling of meningiomas and their clinical implications, no effective therapies and new treatments have been implemented. Methods DNA methylation profiling, copy number analysis, targeted sequencing and H3K27me3 expression was performed on 35 meningiomas and 5 controls.Results Unsupervised hierarchical clustering (UHC) analysis revealed four distinct molecular subgroups: Malignant; Intermediate; Benign A, and Benign B. Molecular heterogeneity was observed within the same grade as the Intermediate, Benign A, and Benign B subgroups were composed of WHO grade 1 as well as grade 2 cases. There was association of mutations with distinct methylation subgroups (NF2, AKT1, SMO, TRAF7 and pTERT). Loss of chromosome 22q was observed across all subgroups. 1p/14q co-deletion was seen in 50% of malignant and intermediate while CDKN2A loss was predominantly observed in malignant subgroup (50%). Majority of malignant (75%) and a small proportion of other subgroups (Intermediate: 25%, Benign A: 38.5%, and Benign B: 20%) harboured H3K27me3 loss. 38,734 genes were dysregulated amongst the four subgroups. DKFZ classified 71% cases with acceptable score. On survival analysis, methylation profiling had significant impact on progression-free-survival in WHO grade1 and 2 meningiomas (p = 0.0051).Conclusion Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling highlights clinically distinct molecular subgroups and heterogeneity within the same grade of meningiomas. Molecular profiling can usher in a paradigm shift in meningioma classification, prognostic prediction, and treatment strategy.

AB  - Background Urinary NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin) levels have been shown to predict renal damage in various medical conditions. The present study was conducted to study the role of urinary NGAL levels in children with bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex post single-stage total reconstruction (SSTR) as markers of early renal function reduction.Methods Urine samples were collected from children with bladder exstrophy before SSTR (Group A, n = 11), 5 years post SSTR (Group B, n = 40) and controls (Group C, n = 41) and stored at - 20 degrees C. NGAL levels were estimated using double antibody sandwich ELISA.Results Mean NGAL levels in Groups A, B and C were 1.39, 34.24 and 2.58 ng/ml, respectively. Mean NGAL levels among Group B subjects with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) >= 80 ml/min/1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) was 29.8 ng/ml, while it was 31.74 ng/ml in those with GFR < 80 ml/min. Urine samples were also evaluated 6 months post SSTR. Mean NGAL at 6 months was 6.76 ng/ml, while at 12 months it was 30.3 ng/ml, remaining > 30 ng/ml at 18 and 24 months. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans did not show any scarring, and GFR on diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) scans remained stable.Conclusions Increasing levels of urinary NGAL following bladder-exstrophy and epispadias complex repair suggest that NGAL detects the earliest signs of renal damage even before any deterioration is observed in DMSA and/or DTPA-GFR scans. Further studies with an adequate sample size and periodic measurement of NGAL need to be performed before any definitive conclusion can be drawn.

AB  - Background and Aims Assessment of clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) non-invasively using a combination of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and platelet counts is proposed as an alternative to hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) estimation. Utility of these criteria in compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) patients of different etiologies including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with BMI > 30 kg/m(2) was studied in a large cohort.Methods Consecutive patients of cACLD with available anthropometric and laboratory details, LSM, and HVPG were included in a retrospective analysis. A LSM of >= 25 kPa alone and LSM <= 15 kPa plus platelets >= 150 x 10(9)/L were evaluated as non-invasive rule-in and rule-out criteria for CSPH, respectively. The NASH-ANTICPATE model (composite of BMI, platelets, and LSM) was evaluated in patients with obese NASH.Results Patients with cACLD (n = 626) (mean age: 50.8 +/- 12.4 years, 74.2% males) with alcohol (ALD, 30.3%), NASH (26.4%), hepatitis C (HCV, 16.6%), hepatitis B (HBV,10.2%) etiology were included. The prevalence of CSPH was > 80% across all etiologies except in HBV (62.5%) and in obese non-NASH (71-72%). The rule-in criteria had a PPV > 90% for all etiologies except in HBV (80.8%). The rule-out criteria had a negative predictive value (NPV) of 65%, 53%, and 40% in ALD, HCV, and NASH, respectively. The NASH-ANTCIPATE model had specificity of 100% and NPV of 33% to detect CSPH in obese NASH (n = 62).Conclusions LSM >= 25 kPa predicted CSPH in most etiologies except HBV. A significant proportion of patients have CSPH despite satisfying the rule-out criteria. The NASH-ANTICIPATE model is specific but fails to exclude CSPH in nearly two-third patients with obesity and NASH. There is a need for precise disease-specific non-invasive models for detecting CSPH.

AB  - Medical dressings play an important role in the field of tissue engineering owing to their ability to accelerate the process of wound healing. Great efforts have been made to fabricate wound dressings with distinctive features for promoting wound healing. However, most of the current synthesis methods either generate dressings of uniform size or involve complex fabrication techniques, thus limiting their commercialization for the personalized dressings. We report here a dressing, which presents a paradigm shift in the design of the dressing from uniform films to a micro-patterned film. The hypothesis driving the design is the ability of the 3D patterns to provide an efficient transient matrix filling the depth of the wound rather than just providing a barrier and slight re-epithelialization. We demonstrate the use of the digital light processing 3D printing technique to generate micro-pyramid-decorated wound healing dressings with individualized design and with bio-compatible gelatin methacryloyl to contact the wounded areas. In addition to providing better adhesion to the migratory cells, the micro-pyramids also enable covalent conjugation of heparin, providing capability to sequester endogenous growth factors (GFs). Based on these advantages, the developed dressing not only adheres strongly to the wound bed but also promotes the treatment of a rat wound model by utilizing the power of endogenous GFs for tissue regeneration. Thus, it is believed that the developed dressing can break through the limitation of traditional wound treatment and be an ideal candidate for wound healing.

AB  - BackgroundFemale genital tuberculosis (FGTB), an important clinical sub-type of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is responsible for about 10% cases of infertility in India. Both FGTB and latent genital tuberculosis (LGTB) can cause infertility through blockage of fallopian tubes and through altered uterine endometrial receptivity. AimsThis review tries to elucidates the role of various immune factors in FGTB and LGTB. ContentVarious immune disturbances are observed in FGTB and LGTB like growth factors and cytokines which inhibit implantation and several inflammatory signaling pathways like mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), natural killer (NK) cells, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-KB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and toll like receptors (TLR) signaling are dysregulated. These altered immune factors and pathways may be detected in the endometrial biopsies at the early stages of disease before permanent damage. Prompt and adequate treatment with the four anti-tubercular drugs (rifampicin [R], isoniazid [H], pyrazinamide [Z], and ethambutol [E]) can increase pregnancy rates in some of these women. Assisted reproduction especially in-vitro fertilization and embryo transfer may be required for some women. ImplicationsInflammatory pathways identified from the gene profiling have enabled development of potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of FGTB. Immunomodulation and novel biotechniques like stem cell transplantation, nanoparticles and host directed therapies are being tried in selected patients of FGTB and LGTB with promising results.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the differences in the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) profiles of women in early pregnancy stratified based on different HbA1c levels known to be predictive of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24-28 weeks of gestation (& GE; 5.2%) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (& GE; 5.5%) in Indian women.Methods : We enrolled women at 8(+ 0) to 19(+ 6) weeks of gestation (early pregnancy), evaluated the glycaemic parameters of clinical interest using CGMS, and reported them per standard methodology proposed by Hernandez et al. WHO 2013 criteria were used for diagnosis of early GDM.Results: Ninety-six women were enrolled at 14.0 & PLUSMN; 3.2 weeks of gestation. Of these, 38 were found to have early GDM (diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation) on evaluation. Of 96 women, 33 (34.4%) had HbA1c value & GE; 5.5% [11 (19.0%) with normoglycaemia and 22 (57.9%) with GDM]. The women with elevated HbA1c differed significantly from those with HbA1c < 5.5% for all evaluated parameters. The differences for overall women were > 10 mg/dl (0.56 mmol/l) for 1-h postprandial glucose (difference of 0.78 mmol/l), 2-h postprandial glucose (difference of 0.59 mmol/l), peak postprandial glucose (difference of 0.75 mmol/l), and 1-h postprandial glucose excursion (difference of 0.59 mmol/l). Of 58 women with normoglycaemia, 29 (50.0%) had an HbA1c value & GE; 5.2%. In comparison, in the normoglycaemic group of women with and without HbA1c & GE; 5.2% (known to be predictive of future GDM), the results were significant for 1-h (difference of 0.44 mmol/l), 2-h (difference of 0.278 mmol/l), and peak postprandial glucose (difference of 0.35 mmol/l).Conclusions : The results suggest that women with elevated HbA1c (& GE; 5.5%) in early pregnancy significantly differ from those with HbA1c < 5.5% in all glycaemic parameters evaluated in this study, suggesting that HbA1c at this cut-off has a role to play in early pregnancy.

AB  - Camphorquinone (CQ) and resin monomers are included in dentin bonding agents (DBAs) and composite resin to restore tooth defects due to abrasion, crown fracture, or dental caries. DBAs, CQ, and bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BisGMA) applications influence the biological activities of the dental pulp. The current investi-gation aimed to delineate the effect of DBAs, CQ, and BisGMA on cathepsin L production/expression, lysosomal activity, and autophagy induction in human dental pulp cells (HDPCs). HDPCs were exposed to DBAs, CQ, or BisGMA with/without inhibitors for 24 h. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed to determine the cathepsin L level in culture medium. The cell layer was utilized to measure cell viability by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate the mRNA expression. Western blotting or immunofluorescent staining was used to study protein expression. Lysosomal density was evaluated by lysotracker red staining. We found that DBAs, CQ, and BisGMA stimulated cathepsin L mRNA, protein expression, and production in HDPCs. In addition, CQ and BisGMA induced lysosomal activity, Beclin1, ATG12, LC3B, Bax, and p53 expression in HDPCs, indicating the stimulation of autophagy. Glutathione (GSH) prevented CQ-and BisGMA-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, E64d, cathepsin L inhibitor (two cathepsin inhibitors), and Pifithrin-alpha (a p53 inhibitor) showed little preventive effect toward CQ-and BisGMA-induced cytotoxicity. Autophagy inhibitors (NH4Cl, Lys05) mildly enhanced the CQ-and BisGMA-induced cytotoxicity. These results indicate that DBAs stimulated cathepsin L, possibly due to their content of CQ and BisGMA that may induce cathepsin L in HDPCs. CQ and BisGMA stimulated lysosomal activity, autophagy, and apoptosis, possibly via induction of Beclin 1, ATG12, LC-3B, Bax, and p53 expression. In addition, CQ and BisGMA cytotoxicity was related to redox change and autophagy. These events are important role in pulpal changes after the restoration of tooth decay using CQ-and BisGMA-containing DBAs and resin composite.

AB  - Background Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) mediated cell survival as well as cell death. High serum TNF alpha levels correlate with liver fibrosis and enhance hepatic stellate cell (HSC) viability. However, the regulatory role of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1/2 (cIAP1/2) during TNF alpha induced NF-kappa B signaling in activated HSCs is largely unknown. Method and Results Activated HSCs were treated with cIAP1/2 inhbitiors i.e., SMAC mimetic BV6, and Birinapant in the presence of TNF alpha and macrophage conditioned media. TNF alpha cytokine increased cIAP2 expression and enhanced cell viability through the canonical NF-kappa B signaling in activated HSCs. cIAP2 inhibition via BV6 decreased the TNF alpha induced canonical NF-kappa B signaling, and reduced cell viability in activated HSCs. SMAC mimetic, Birinapant alone did not affect the cell viability but treatment of TNF alpha sensitized HSCs with Birinapant induced cell death. While BV6 mediated cIAP2 ablation was able to decrease the TNF alpha induced canonical NF-kappa B signaling, this effect was not observed with Birinapant treatment. Secreted TNF alpha from M1 polarized macrophages sensitized activated HSCs to BV6 or Birinapant mediated cell death. However, M2 polarized macrophage conditioned medium rescued the activated HSCs from BV6 mediated cytotoxicity. Conclusion In this study, we describe the regulatory role of cIAP2 in TNF alpha induced NF-kappa B signaling in activated HSCs. Targeting cIAP2 may be a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment via modulating NF-kappa B signaling in activated HSCs.

AB  - Background: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has an affinity for the angio-tensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are present abundantly on the diaphragm. This study aims to describe temporal changes in diaphragmatic thickness and excursion using ultrasonography in sub-jects with acute COVID-19.Methods: This prospective observational study included adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past 48 hours. The diaphragm thickness at end-expiration (DTE), diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF), and dia-phragm excursion during tidal breathing (DE) and maximal inspiration (DEmax) were measured using ultra-sonography daily for 5 days. The changes in DTE, DTF, DE, and Demax from day 1 to day 5 were assessed.Results: This study included 64 adults (62.5% male) with a mean (SD) age of 50.2 (17.5) years. A majority (91%) of the participants had mild or moderate illness. The median (IQR) DTE, DTF (%), DE and Demax on day 1 were 2.2 (1.9, 3.0) mm, 21.5% (14.2, 31.0), 19.2 (16.5, 24.0) mm, and 26.7 (22.0, 30.2) mm, respectively. On day 5, there was a significant reduction in the DTE (p=0.002) with a median (IQR) percentage change of-15.7% (-21.0, 0.0). The DTF significantly increased on day 5 with a median (IQR) percentage change of 25.0% (-19.2, 98.4), p=0.03. There was no significant change in DE and Demax from day 1 to day 5, with a median (IQR) percentage change of 3.6% (-5.2, 15) and 0% (-6.7, 5.9), respectively.Conclusions: Non-intubated patients with COVID-19 exhibited a temporal decline in diaphragm thickness with increase in thickening fraction over 5 days of hospital admission. Further research is warranted to assess the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on diaphragmatic function.(c) 2022 SPLF and Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is a paucity of data on the bone mineral status of infants, with no data from India. This study was undertaken to assess the bone mineral content (BMC) of the healthy term Indian infants at 1 and 2 y of age, and the influence of factors such as birth weight, gender, current size, and vitamin D levels on BMC. Anthropometry, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin-D levels, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for the lumbar spine and whole-body BMC were performed at the ages of 1 and 2 y. Mean whole-body BMC was 214.1 +/- 40.8 g at 1 y (n = 131) and 327.6 +/- 87.4 g at 2 y (n = 73); lumbar spine BMC was 6.9 +/- 1.8 g at 1 y and 10.2 +/- 3.8 g at 2 y. The chief determinants of BMC were the weight and length/height of the infant, with no effect of vitamin D levels. The BMC of Indian infants at 1 y was similar to that reported previously for Caucasian infants.

AB  - Radiotherapy is an effective and complex treatment modality for the ablation of malignant tumors. Despite several technological advances, precise determination of the radiation dose delivered to the tumor and its neighbouring healthy tissues remains a challenge. This work focuses on the synthesis and characterisation of a symmetrically substituted diacetylene which is coated on a paper to function as a radiochromic film. The paperbased film exhibits distinct color change from white to varying shades of blue from the 0.5-20 Gy dose range administered in radiotherapy. The difference in the color intensity of the radiochromic film is used as a quantitative indicator of the radiation dose delivered. A comprehensive evaluation of general optical characteristics, dosimetric properties and stability of the dose response is performed. The prepared film is tissue-equivalent with weak dependence on dosimetric parameters like energy, dose rate and dose accumulation. It can be stored under normal room conditions as the influence of variation in temperature, light intensity and post irradiation time was found to be <2%. The uncertainty in the dose response based on the calibration curve was found to be 2.74%. The therapeutic range of radiation dose detection, facile fabrication and implementation of this radiochromic film can be potentially translated into different radiotherapy clinical applications.

AB  - Mitochondria are dynamic cellular organelles with diverse functions including energy production, calcium ho-meostasis, apoptosis, host innate immune signaling, and disease progression. Several viral proteins specifically target mitochondria to subvert host defense as mitochondria stand out as the most suitable target for the invading viruses. They have acquired the capability to control apoptosis, metabolic state, and evade immune responses in host cells, by targeting mitochondria. In this way, the viruses successfully allow the spread of viral progeny and thus the infection. Viruses employ their proteins to alter mitochondrial dynamics and their specific functions by a modulation of membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial bio-energetics to help them achieve a state of persistent infection. A better understanding of such viral proteins and their impact on mitochondrial forms and functions is the main focus of this review. We also attempt to emphasize the importance of exploring the role of mitochondria in the context of SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis and identify host-virus protein interactions.

AB  - Morphology and chemical composition altogether determine the fate of atmospheric particulate matter(PM) deposition and inhalation. Site-wise(#20 sites) and cumulative variations in morphology and chemical composition of PM5 in Delhi showed dominance of non-spherical (sharp-edged, angular and flattened) particles followed by spherical ones, rich in elements like C, O, S, N, Al, Si, Cu, Ca, Na, Cl, Fe, Ni, Cr, Zn, Hg, Pb, Mo, etc. having potential health effects. #2650 individual particles analyzed for the morphological parameters like aspect ratio(AR), circularity factor(CIR), surface equivalent radius(SER) and area. Dominant AR and SER values found between >= 1-1.60 and > 0-0.50 mu m, respectively showing dominance of non-spherical and fine-size particles in Delhi. The Multiple Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD) Model used to study variations in deposition potential (regional deposition, lobar deposition, mass deposition and mass flux) of different PM sizes (PM0.4, PM1, PM2.5 and PM5) at different AR values which suggested that AR is an important input parameter of health models to get realistic and unbiased output health data. In addition, study revealed higher coarse particles deposition in the head region affecting upper respiratory tract with their non-spherical shapes whereas higher fine particles deposition in TB and pulmonary regions affecting inner parts of the lungs.

AB  - Background and aims Limited data exist on course of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis with gastric variceal (GV) bleeding as their index decompensation. We evaluated long-term outcomes in this subgroup and compared them with a propensity score-matched cohort of patients with esophageal variceal (EV) bleeding. Methods Patients with cirrhosis with GVs (IGV-1 and GOV-2) bleeding as their index decompensation were analyzed in this retrospective study. Incidence of new-onset clinical decompensations and survival were estimated and compared with a cohort of patients with EVs bleeding matched for etiology and disease severity using competing risk analysis. Results Baseline characteristics of patients with GVs related bleeding (n = 51) (mean age-48.1 +/- 12.9 years, 80% males, non-viral cirrhosis: 80.3%) were similar to the cohort of EVs bleeding (n = 51) (mean age-45.9 +/- 14.2, 88% males, non-viral cirrhosis: 78.4%). The 1-year and 3-year rates of new-onset ascites were (17.9%, 34.2%) and (23.9%, 49%) in patients with GVs and EVs related index bleeding, respectively (Gray's test, p = 0.035). The 1-year and 3 year rate of rebleed was (35.6%, 46.3%) and (13.9%, 35.7%) in patients with GVs and EVs related index bleeding, respectively (Gray's test, p = 0.1). While overall survival was similar across both the groups (GV: 29.6% vs EV: 21.6%, p = 0.495), rebleeding-related deaths occurred exclusively in patients with GV (rebleeding-related deaths: GV: 40% vs EVs: 0%; non-bleeding liver-related deaths: GV: 60% vs EV: 100%; p = 0.048). Conclusions Rebleeding predominates the course of portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis presenting with GVs related bleeding, whereas ascites is the most significant event on follow-up in those with EVs related bleeding.

AB  - Post autopsy reconstruction (PAR) plays a vital role in the external appearance of dead bodies while handing over to grieving family members. Autopsy surgeons should not only be restricted to autopsy findings/techniques but should also give importance to PAR. Autopsy incision includes various conventional incisions like I, Y, and Modified Y-shaped. The most commonly used incision is I-shaped in most of the autopsy because it is easy for quick suturing but it produces a poor cosmetic appearance because suturing produces visible suture over the front of the neck and chest of a corpse and improper suturing in the skin flaps leads to gapping causes leakage of body fluids at the suture site. More often that leads to avoidable, unnecessary emotional distress for grieving family members. That creates a negative image of forensic practice in society and sometimes with administrative complaints. The authors conducted an observation based study on the medicolegal autopsy that included ten cases that involved "Stethoscope" and various conventional incisions and explored suturing techniques and body packing methods. The study observed that the proposed "Stethoscope" incision was feasible, less time-consuming for suturing, had an excellent cosmetic effect, and was cost-effective. The suturing technique revealed that invisible sutures leads to good cosmetic outcomes but is more time-consuming and costly. The body packing method showed the excellent result of no leakage of body fluid from the suture site. The authors proposed a "Stethoscope" method of incision that can be practiced and adopted for a better cosmetic appearance and hu-manitarian aspect for grieving relatives. The body packing method renders the body non-hazardous to the public and attendants while handling and transporting. The authors highlight the importance and sensitization of au-topsy surgeon/mortuary staff to restructure the corpse with the best cosmetic appearance for the Dignified Management of the Dead and Humanitarian Forensics.

AB  - To gain insights into the idiosyncrasies of CD34 + enriched leukemic stem cells, we investigated the nature and extent of transcriptional heterogeneity by single-cell sequencing in pediatric AML. Whole transcriptome analysis of 28,029 AML single cells was performed using the nanowell cartridge-based barcoding technology. Integrated transcriptional analysis identified unique leukemic stem cell clusters of each patient and intra-patient heterogeneity was revealed by multiple LSCenriched clusters differing in their cell cycle processes and BCL2 expression. All LSC-enriched clusters exhibited gene expression profile of dormancy and self-renewal. Upregulation of genes involved in non-coding RNA processing and ribonucleoprotein assembly were observed in LSC-enriched clusters relative to HSC. The genes involved in regulation of apoptotic processes, response to cytokine stimulus, and negative regulation of transcription were upregulated in LSC-enriched clusters as compared to the blasts. Validation of top altered genes in LSC-enriched clusters confirmed upregulation of TCF7L2, JUP, ARHGAP25, LPAR6, and PRDX1 genes, and serine/threonine kinases (STK24, STK26). Upregulation of LPAR6 showed trend towards MRD positive status (Odds ratio = 0.126; 95% CI = 0.0144-1.10; p = 0.067) and increased expression of STK26 significantly correlated with higher RFS (HR = 0.231; 95% CI = 0.0506-1.052; p = 0.04). Our findings addressed the inter and intra-patient diversity within AML LSC and potential signaling and chemoresistance-associated targets that warrant investigation in larger cohort that may guide precision medicine in the near future.

AB  - Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is one of the problems encountered in surgical practices. The aetiology is of various types, but GOO occurring secondary to heterotopic pancreas (HP) is rare, which is often not thought of but would come as a surprise. The cause for GOO due to heterotopic pancreas is very rare and should be kept in mind as one of the differentials while treating a patient with GOO.

Although uncommon, immunocompromised patients are particularly susceptible to this opportunistic fun-gus. Here, we report the case of a renal transplant recipient who presented with painful disseminated subcu-taneous and soft tissue lesions. Sequencing of the Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA identified the fungus as Medicopsis romeroi. Additionally, tissue samples from a non-healing wound on the left forearm grew Rhizopus spp. on Sabouraud dextrose agar, indicating a Mucormycosis superinfection. The patient's condition improved with surgical intervention and antifungal therapy with Posaconazole and Terbinafine. This case demonstrates the need for a high index of suspicion in order to facilitate early diagno-sis and treatment and thus reduce the risk of dissemination.(c) 2022 SFMM.

AB  - BackgroundDiagnostic delays in cancers are frequent in developing countries due to poor health infrastructure. Existing literature from developed countries suggests that diagnostic interval in bone sarcomas is primarily dictated by tumour biology with no impact on survival. This study evaluates the social and biological determinants of the diagnostic interval in bone sarcomas in a resource-challenged setting and assesses its impact on treatment outcomes. MethodsA retrospective single-institutional study was conducted on patients with high-grade bone sarcomas recorded in the sarcoma clinic database between 2003 and 2018. Baseline clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes were recorded. Logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of baseline clinical and social characteristics (distance from treating centre and rural vs. urban residence) on the diagnostic interval. Further, the impact of diagnostic interval on histologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, amputation requirement in extremity sarcomas and survival was evaluated. ResultsA total of 1227 patients were included for analysis. The median diagnostic interval was 4 months (3-7 months). Age above 18 years, Ewing sarcoma (ES) diagnosis, absence of fever at presentation and tumour size above 7.5 cm were predictors of a longer diagnostic interval (>4 months). The length of the diagnostic interval did not impact amputation requirement or survival outcomes. However, the proportion of patients with good necrosis post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy was lower among patients with longer diagnostic intervals (25% vs. 34 center dot 16%; p-value = .04). ConclusionTumour characteristics rather than social factors determined the diagnostic interval. Diagnostic interval did not impact survival outcomes even in a resource-constrained setting.

AB  - Background: The recent World Health Organization recommendation supporting single-dose of HPV vaccine will significantly reduce programmatic cost, mitigate the supply shortage, and simplify logistics, thus allowing more low- and middle-income countries to introduce the vaccine. From a programmatic perspective the durability of protection offered by a single-dose will be a key consideration. The primary objectives of the present study were to determine whether recipients of a single-dose of quadrivalent HPV vaccine had sustained immune response against targeted HPV types (HPV 6,11,16,18) at 10 years post-vaccination and whether this response was superior to the natural antibody titres observed in unvaccinated women.Methods: Participants received at age 10-18 years either one, two or three doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Serology samples were obtained at different timepoints up to 10 years after vaccination from a convenience sample of vaccinated participants and from age-matched unvaccinated women at one timepoint. The evolution of the binding and neutralizing antibody response was presented by dose received. 10-year durability of immune responses induced by a single-dose was compared to that after three doses of the vaccine and in unvaccinated married women.Results: The dynamics of antibody response among the single-dose recipients observed over 120 months show stabilized levels 18 months after vaccination for all four HPV types. Although the HPV type-specific (binding or neutralizing) antibody titres after a single-dose were significantly inferior to those after three doses of the vaccine (lower bounds of GMT ratios < 0.5), they were all significantly higher than those observed in unvaccinated women following natural infections (GMT ratios: 2.05 to 4.04-fold higher). The results correlate well with the high vaccine efficacy of single-dose against persistent HPV 16/18 infections reported by us earlier at 10-years post-vaccination.Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the high and durable immune response in single-dose recipients of HPV vaccine at 10-years post vaccination.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection targets host restriction factors that inhibit its replication and survival. Previous studies have shown that barriers to autointegration factor1 (BANF1) inhibited the replication of herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus by binding to phosphate backbone of dsDNA. To date, no reports are available for the interplay between BANF1 and HBV. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms by which HBV inhibit BANF1. First, the effect of HBV on BANF1 was observed in Huh-7, Hep G2, and Hep G2.2.15 cells. Huh-7 cells were transfected with pHBV(1.3) or HBx plasmids. The results showed that there was a decreased expression of BANF1 in Hep G2.2.15 cells (P <= 0.005) or in HBV/HBx expressing Huh-7 cells (P <= 0.005), whereas BANF1 overexpression decreased viral replication (P <= 0.05). To study whether phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of BANF1 was responsible for antiviral activity, mutants were created, and it was found that inhibition due to mutants was less significant compared to BANF1 wild type. Previous studies have shown that HBV, at least in part, could regulate the expression of host miRNAs via HBx. It was found that miR-203 expression was high in Hep G2.2.15 cells (P <= 0.005) compared to Hep G2 cells. Next, the effect of HBx on miR-203 expression was studied and result showed that HBx upregulated miR-203 expression (P <= 0.005). Overexpression of miR-203 downregulated BANF1 expression (P <= 0.05) and viral titer was upregulated (P <= 0.05), while inhibition of miR-203, reversed these changes. In conclusion, BANF1 downregulated HBV, whereas HBV inhibited BANF1, at least in part, via HBx-mediated miR-203 upregulation in hepatic cells.IMPORTANCE In this study, for the first time, we found that BANF1 inhibited HBV replication and restricted the viral load. However, as previously reported for other viruses, the results in this study showed that BAF1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is not involved in its antiviral activity against HBV. HBV infection inhibited the intracellular expression of BANF1, via HBx-mediated upregulation of miR-203 expression. Overexpression of miR-203 downregulated BANF1 and increased the viral titer, while inhibition of miR-203 reversed these changes. This study helped us to understand the molecular mechanisms by which HBV survives and replicates in the host cells.

AB  - Introduction In RCC, systematic procedures such as surgery, chemo-radiation therapy, and application of target-based inhibitors increase the risk of several comorbidities such as chronic kidney disease, hemorrhage, and cardiac arrest that may increase the mortality rate. Even though immune-based checkpoint inhibitor therapies have an overall good response rate, it is restricted to only 30-40% of patients. Hence, an in-depth study of tumor pathophysiology in RCC is needed to identify the new therapeutic target. In RCC, persisted hypoxia is an essential phenomenon for tumor growth and progression. KCMF1 is a newly identified ubiquitin ligase whose domain interacts with destabilized proteins and reprogrammed the ubiquitin coding for lysosome-mediated degradation and autophagy under hypoxic conditions/oxidative stress and maintaining cellular homeostasis. But in RCC, the functional role of KCMF1 remains undefined to date.Method We determined KCMF1 and its associated proteins RAD6 and UBR4 expression and their co-localization using confocal microscopy in tumor and non-tumor tissues samples. Further, immunofluorescence staining was performed to determine autophagy (LC3B, p62), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1A) and ion channel markers (Kv1.3, KCNN4) in RCC patients (n-10). Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICPMS) was performed to estimate the concentration of potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and Zinc (zn(2+)) in tumor and non-tumor cells of RCC patients (n-20). Lastly, images were analyzed using ZEN3.1, and ImageJ software.Result and conclusion We observed a discrepancy in the formation of ubiquitin ligase, autophagosome via KCMF1, and ionic concentration in tumor cells, which might be one of the possible factors for cancer evolution. KCMF1-associated ubiquitin ligase system could be considered as a novel therapeutic target for RCC in the future.

AB  - Telemedicine could improve access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). Telemedicine-delivered MOUD (TMOUD) has expanded substantially in response to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on in-person clinical contact, yet this expansion has not happened consistently across all health systems and countries. This Review aims to understand key factors in TMOUD implementation that might explain variations in uptake. We did a scoping review using three English language databases for articles reporting on the implementation of TMOUD services. 57 peerreviewed articles were identified, subjected to open coding and thematic analysis, and further interpreted through normalisation process theory (NPT). NPT was originally used to evaluate telehealth innovations and has been applied extensively to describe, assess, and develop the implementation potential of a broad range of complex health-care interventions. By categorising our findings according to the four core NPT constructs of coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring, we aim to rationalise the current evidence base to show the workability of TMOUD in practice. We find that variations in TMOUD models in practice depend on organisations' attitudes towards risk, clinicians' tensions around giving up control over standard practices, organisation-level support in overcoming operational and technological challenges, and evaluation methods that might neglect a potential widening of the digital divide.

AB  - Background: Hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas of tracheobronchial origin are very rare salivary gland type tumors accounting for less than 1% of lung tumors with only 13 cases reported to date. Their radiological features, morphological spectrum, and molecular features are not well described. Aim: To perform a clinicopathological analysis of primary pulmonary hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas. Method: A retrospective search of primary pulmonary hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas was conducted from authors' institutions and the clinicopathological features including details of molecular testing were analyzed. Results: Five primary pulmonary hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas were identified. The mean patient age at diagnosis was 48.2 years (range: 33-64 years). Three patients were women. All patients were nonsmokers and 3 were symptomatic; 2 were detected incidentally during health screening. The tumors were located in the main lobar bronchi ranging from 1.3 to 4.9 cm in maximum dimension. Microscopy showed cords and nests of at least, focally clear tumor cells. Mucin cysts lacking goblet cells were seen. All tumors were uniformly positive for p40, p63, AE1/AE3, keratin 7, and epithelial membrane antigen but negative for TTF1, KIT, neuroendocrine markers, and other myoepithelial markers. All cases showed Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene rearrangement. Perineural invasion and lymph node metastases were detected in patient 5. Two patients with available follow-up data were recurrence-free until 4 years (patient 1) and 9 months (patient 5) after resection. Conclusion: The present series adds to the scant available literature on primary pulmonary hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas highlighting the characteristic histomorphology, immunoprofiles, and benign outcomes of these rare tumors.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial to assess effectiveness of GamE- an e-Health intervention to self-manage gaming with an aim to prevent gaming disorder
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
AB  - Gaming disorder is a health concern associated with significant impairment. Digital technology can be helpful for implementing preventive measures for gaming disorder. This randomized trial aimed to assess the effectiveness of an e-Health intervention to prevent gaming disorder among college students. This randomized trial compared an online intervention module aimed at improving knowledge, skill and attitude of the students and empower them with self- help strategies to monitor and regulate their gaming behavior with an aim to prevent gaming disorder, with wait list control. The sample comprised of 30 cases and 33 controls. The understanding of the concept of gaming, understanding of difference between gaming and gaming disorder, understanding of adverse effects associated with gaming disorder, understanding of screening of gaming disorder and self-help techniques of regulating gaming disorder increased more in the intervention group than control. The participants most favored self-monitoring and strategies to promote healthy lifestyles for regulating gaming. Online digital intervention can be effectively used as a strategy to prevent gaming disorder among college students. Such an intervention can empower students with strategies to regulate their extent of gaming.

AB  - Introduction: CD34 and HLA-DR negativity is often used as a characteristic immunophenotypic feature of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) that differentiates APL from other subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, other subtypes of AML, without expression of CD34 and HLA-DR antigens, have also been reported. Methods: We analysed the HLA-DR negative de novo non-APL AML cases by dividing HLA-DR negative non-APL group into 2 sub-groups based on CD34 expression and compared the characteristics of CD34 negative HLA-DR negative with CD34 positive HLA-DR negative non-APL AML cases with respect to morphologic, immunophenotypic, molecular and clinical parameters. Results: There were 70 cases (8.54%) which were CD34 negative HLA-DR negative and 52 cases (6.34%) were CD34 positive HLA-DR negative. The median age at diagnosis was higher in CD34 negative HLA-DR negative AML than in CD34 positive HLA-DR negative AML group (38 years vs. 12 years, p < 0.001). DIC rate was higher in CD34 negative HLA-DR negative group than the other group (p < 0.001). Median total leucocyte count was higher with higher blast count in peripheral blood and bone marrow in CD34 negative HLA-DR negative AML cases than the other group (p < 0.05). CD34 negative HLA-DR negative AML was more associated with normal karyotype (96.2% vs. 38.5%; p < 0.001), NPM1 mutation (67.8% vs. 8.3%; p < 0.001) and FLT-ITD mutation (37.3% vs. 13.9%; p < 0.05). In CD34 negative HLA-DR negative group, 16 cases had co-occurrence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations, whereas no case of CD34 positive HLA-DR negative group had such dual mutation positivity. There was poor median overall survival [3.8 months (95%CI: 2.3-7.8 months) vs. 20.4 months (95% CI: 12.8-25.7 months); p = 0.0148] in CD34 positive HLA-DR negative AML than CD34 negative HLA-DR negative AML cases. Conclusion: We found that the CD34 negative HLADR negative non APL AML is highly associated with NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation, older age at diagnosis, DIC, higher total leucocyte count, higher blast counts and normal karyotype in comparison to CD34 positive HLA-DR negative AML group. Co-occurrence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation was also exclusively seen in CD34 negative HLA-DR negative group. There was poor overall survival in CD34 positive HLA-DR negative AML than CD34 negative HLA-DR negative AML cases.

AB  - Management of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is an unmet need. We analyzed data on 41 such patients to evaluate predictors of outcome. Between January, 2010 and December 2020, among 1028 patients with EOC treated at our institute 41 (3.98%) developed CNS metas-tasis. Median age of patients was 48 years, ranging from 22 to 75 years. Primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS), and analysis of prognostic factors were secondary out-come measures. An intention to treat analysis was done. We also performed review the literature (n = 2253) as regards to clinicopathological and radiological features, treatment received, survival outcomes and prog-nostic factors. Median time from diagnosis of EOC to CNS metastasis was 27 months (range: 0 to 101 months). 33(80.5%) patients had FIGO stage III-IV at baseline and serous carcinoma (75.6%) was com-mon pathology subtype. Thirteen (31.7%) patients had isolated CNS metastasis and 28 (68.3%) had intra-abdominal disease in addition. Nineteen (46.3%) patients achieved complete response post treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Median PFS and OS from the time of CNS metastasis is 12 (range:1 to 51) months and 33 (range: 1 to 71) months, respectively. Absence of extracranial disease and lower serum CA-125 at diagnosis of CNS metastasis were predictive of superior PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CNS metastasis is a late event in EOC, post multiple lines of treatment. Patients with disease limited to brain and treated with surgical resection and chemoradiation have best outcome.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - IntroductionData are scarce on hs-CRP as a biomarker for airway inflammation in pediatric asthma. We aimed to examine correlation between hs-CRP and asthma control levels.MethodsChildren with physician-diagnosed asthma, ages 6-15 years, were enrolled. GINA-2016 criteria were used to assess the level of asthma control. The relationships between serum hs-CRP and each of asthma control measures (asthma control criteria, spirometry, impulse oscillometry, eosinophil counts and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were assessed.Results150 asthmatic children were enrolled; 52 (35%) had well controlled asthma, 76 (51%), and 22 (14%) children had partly controlled and uncontrolled asthma, respectively. Median (IQR) values of hs-CRP were 0.47 (0.1, 1.67) mg/L in well controlled, 0.30 (0.1, 1.83) mg/L in partly controlled, and 2.74 (0.55, 3.74) mg/L in uncontrolled asthma (p = 0.029). Using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, area under the curve for hs-CRP (mg/L) to discriminate between uncontrolled and (controlled + partly controlled) asthma was 0.67 (95% CI 0.55, 0.80) and a cutoff 1.1 mg/L of serum hs-CRP level had a sensitivity of 68.1% with specificity of 67.97%. In two groups of hs-CRP (<3 mg/L) and hs-CRP (>= 3 mg/L), high hs-CRP group had higher proportion of uncontrolled asthmatic children (p = 0.03).ConclusionWe observed higher serum hs-CRP values in children with uncontrolled asthma, suggesting its potential role as a biomarker of asthma control.

AB  - IntroductionGestational diabetes (GDM) and pre-eclampsia (PE) represents the unrecognized risk factors for reduced bone content in neonates. The present study is planned to explore the components of vitamin D metabolism and calcium transport in placenta of GDM and PE cases and its effect on the neonatal bone mass determination using bone densitometry system. MethodsWe have collected serum and placenta tissues from GDM (n = 20), PE (n = 20), and healthy pregnancies (n = 20). In the present study, we found mRNA expression of oxidative stress markers, vitamin D metabolic components and calcium channels, calcium channel binding proteins, plasma membrane calcium ATPase, ATP synthase and Ca2+ release genes; Ryanodine receptors genes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in placental tissue of GDM, PE, and healthy pregnancies. ResultsWe observed high level of oxidative stress in both GDM and PE placenta compared to normal pregnancies. CYP2R1 and VDR mRNA expression was significantly downregulated and upregulation of CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 in GDM and PE compared with healthy cases. Similarly, calcium transporters were downregulated in GDM and PE placental tissues. In addition, CYP24A1, VDR, CaBP28K, TRPV5 and PMCA3 mRNA expression were correlated with BMC of neonates. DiscussionOxidative stress is probably relevant to disrupted vitamin D homeostasis and calcium transport in the placenta of GDM and PE cases. The altered regulatory mechanism of CYP24A1 and VDR could indicates more pronounced serum 25(OH)D reduction. Additionally, reduced BMC in the neonates of these cases might be as consequences of modified CYP24A1, VDR, CaBP28K, TRPV5 and PMCA3 mRNA expression.

AB  - Background: Routine use of cardiac sympathetic imaging in HF has been limited by the lower availability/sensitivity of radiotracers. This study was aimed to assess the feasibility of 18F-FDOPA (commonly available PET-radiotracer) in assessment of cardiac autonomic dysfunction. Methods: Twenty-four controls (46.5 +/- 11.1 years, 16men) and 24 patients (43.5 +/- 11.0 years, 18men) with diagnosed HF (Framingham-Criteria) underwent cardiac-PET/CT. Region(s) Of Interest were drawn over entire left ventricular myocardium (LV), individual walls, and mediastinum (M). Coefficient of Variation (CV) was calculated from individual wall counts. Results: HF patients had significantly lower myocardial 18F-FDOPA uptake (P < .001, independent t test) than controls [32.4% +/- 9.5% global reduction; highest in apex (39.9% +/- 7.0%)]. A cut-off of LV/M <= 1.68 could differentiate patients from controls with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 95.8%, respectively. LV/M correlated positively with EF (Pearson coefficient = 0.460, P .031). During follow-up, 3 patients were lost to follow-up, 4 died (survival-20.5 +/- 4 months), 2 worsened, and 15 remained stable/showed mild improvement. Patients who worsened/died during follow-up had higher CV than those with stable/improving symptoms [0.16 +/- 0.05 vs 0.11 +/- 0.05, P value .069 (independent t test); Cox regression P = .084]. Conclusion: Myocardial 18F-FDOPA uptake in patients with HF is significantly reduced. Higher reduction is seen in those with lower EF. CV, a maker of regional heterogeneity, is a potential prognostic marker.

AB  - Benzodiazepines (BDZ) such as diazepam and lorazepam are popular as first-line treatment for acute seizures due to their rapid action and high efficacy. However, long-term usage of BDZ leads to benzodiazepine resistance, a phenomenon whose underlying mechanisms are still being investigated. One of the hypothesised mechanisms contributing to BDZ resistance is the presence of mutations in benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors. While a few genetic variants have been reported previously, knowledge of relevant pathogenic variants is still scarce. We used Sanger Sequencing to detect variants in the ligand-binding domain of BDZ-sensitive GABAA receptor subunits alpha 1-3 and 5 expressed in resected brain tissues of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients with a history of BDZ resistance and found two previously unreported predicted pathogenic frameshifting variants - NM_000807.4 (GABRA2):c.367_368insG and NM_000810.4(GABRA5):c.410del - significantly enriched in these patients. The findings were further explored in resected DRE brain tissues through cellular electrophysiological experiments.

AB  - Background/AimExternal inflammatory root resorption (EIRR) and external replacement root resorption (ERRR) are the most common adverse outcomes after luxation injuries or dental injuries. They are usually detected radiographically after considerable progression. It can be envisaged that evaluation of inflammatory mediators might serve as an objective and reliable method of predicting the risk of resorption. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the evidence regarding the risk of resorption and to provide future research directions. MethodsAn a priori protocol was prepared by a multidisciplinary expert group, as per the Cochrane handbook and PRISMA guidelines. The systematic search was conducted in six databases and grey-literature sources. Scrutiny of titles and abstracts, and later full-text articles was performed, and data were extracted. Risk of bias analysis was done by using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklist for analytical cross-sectional and cohort studies. ResultsEight studies were included in the systematic review and could be categorized as per the source of biomarkers, namely epithelial cells from mucosa, gingival crevicular fluid and extracted teeth. The studies utilizing epithelial cells had been conducted between 2015 and 2018 in Brazil and did not find any correlation with EIRR. Two of the studies with extracted teeth found differences in the immunologic profiles of teeth with resorption. Three studies evaluating gingival crevicular fluid found increased levels of dentine sialoprotein and Interleukin-1-alpha. ConclusionAmong the three sources, the inflammatory gingival crevicular fluid appeared to be the most non-invasive source of biomarkers for predicting trauma-induced root resorption, although the evidence about this came from two studies with moderate and one study with high risk of bias. The primary studies in this systematic review showed variability in terms of the sample sizes, age of the patients, the grading/classification of trauma-induced resorption and the evaluation methods which must be addressed by future researchers.

AB  - Carbon fiber (CF)/PEEK composites were manufactured using towpregs impregnated with PEEK microparticles via an in-house developed dispersion coating method. The PEEK microparticles were dispersed in a self-stabilized aqueous solution of Polyimide (PI) precursor polyamic acid ammonium salt solution (PAAS). The dispersion coating produced a uniform coating of PEEK microparticles on the surface and along the cross-section of CF tow to overcome the low melt flow of PEEK, a high-performance thermoplastic. The PAAS formed a layer of PI nanoparticles on CF acting as an interface between CF and PEEK in the composite. The composites yielded a flexural strength of-1160 MPa; tensile strength of-1900 MPa; compressive strength of-600 MPa; inter -laminar shear strength of-70 MPa and free of void evident from micro-CT and microstructure evaluations. A detailed physiochemical study of the dispersion, coated tow and composite are provided to understand the mechanism of the dispersion coating process.

AB  - IntroductionAge adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (a-CCI) is an established scoring system to predict long-term mortality. However, its role in predicting 30-day post-operative outcome in general surgery patients is not well elucidated. MethodsThis was a prospective observational study. Consecutive patients operated under general anaesthesia between January 2019 and December 2020 were enrolled. Their a-CCI was calculated and stratified as Grade 0 comorbidities (a-CCI score = 0), Grade A comorbidities (a-CCI score = 1 and 2) and Grade B comorbidities (a-CCI score >= 3). Post-operative complications were graded according to Clavien Dindo (CD) grading system and classified as minor complications (CD Grades I and II), major complications (CD Grades III-IV) and mortality (CD Grade V). Binary logistic regression and multi-nominal logistic regression analysis were done and relative risk ratios were calculated. ResultA total of 925 patients were enrolled. The mean age was 42.75 (14-85 +/- 10) years. 31% of our patients had complications within 30 days of surgery which included mortality in 2.7%. Compared with patients with Grade 0 comorbidities, the odds of getting complications is 1.2 times more in patients with Grade A comorbidities and 1.84 times more in patients with Grade B comorbidities (P = 0.205, 0.001 respectively). In comparison to patients with Grade 0 co-morbidities, risk of mortality is 3 and 17.86 times more in patients with Grade A and Grade B comorbidities (P = 0.121 and < 0.001 respectively). Conclusiona-CCI has clinical relevance in general surgical patients and can predict early post-operative outcome. It should be a part of our armamentarium for pre-operative assessment of surgical patients.

AB  - GaN is an aqueous and chemically stable material that has demonstrated biocompatibility with potential in biomedical engineering and offers enormous opportunities to tailor its inherent surface properties and promote efficient biomolecule adhesion with targeted functionalities. In this article, functionalization of GaN surfaces via a three-step process to enhance cell attachment and its effective utilization in in-vivo and in-vitro applications is reported. The morphology and surface chemistry of GaN surfaces were modified using sodium hydroxide and 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane followed via bioconjugation with type 1-human collagen (T1HC), and the changes in chemical states, morphology, wettability, pH, and aqueous stability were investigated. Further, cell culture studies using human periodontal ligament fibroblast (HPdlF) cells were undertaken. The proliferation and adhesion/survivability studies at different time intervals on functionalized GaN surfaces were performed and analyzed via MTT Assay and SEM evaluation. It has been observed that the hydroxyl species and protonated amines promotes the adhesion of the silane coupling agent and human collagen, which remains stable under standard cell culture media. The chemically functionalized T1HC bio-conjugated GaN surfaces display excellent cell culture properties with complete cell adhesion and viability of similar to 95 %. The research revealed that chemically functionalized GaN might be useful in various procedures where integrating soft tissues with implant surfaces is crucial.

AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) is a common cause of referral to the pediatricians, geneticists, and pediatric neurologists. A thorough clinical evaluation and a stepwise investigative approach using a combination of traditional genetic techniques and appropriate latest genomic technologies can help in arriving at a diagnosis. In the current "omics" era, adopting a multiomics approach would further assist in solving the undiagnosed cases with intellectual disability.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to evaluate whether individualized homeopathic medicines have a greater adjunctive effect than adjunctive placebos in the treatment of moderate and severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods The study was a randomized, single-blind, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trial set in the clinical context of standard care. Intervention Patients of either sex, admitted in a tertiary care hospital, suffering from moderate or severe COVID-19 and above 18 years of age were included. In total, 150 patients were recruited and then randomly divided into two groups to receive either individualized homeopathic medicines or placebos, in addition to the standard treatment of COVID-19. Outcome Measures The primary outcome was time taken to achieve RT-PCR-confirmed virus clearance for COVID-19. Secondary outcomes were changes in the Clinical Ordinal Outcomes Scale (COOS) of the World Health Organization, the patient-reported MYMOP2 scale, and several biochemical parameters. Parametric data were analyzed using unpaired t -test. Non-parametric data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Categorical data were analyzed using Chi-square test. Results In total, 72 participants of the add-on homeopathy (AoH) group showed conversion of RT-PCR status to negative, in an average time of 7.53 & PLUSMN; 4.76 days (mean & PLUSMN; SD), as compared with 11.65 & PLUSMN; 9.54 days in the add-on placebo (AoP) group ( p = 0.001). The mean COOS score decreased from 4.26 & PLUSMN; 0.44 to 3.64 & PLUSMN; 1.50 and from 4.3 & PLUSMN; 0.46 to 4.07 & PLUSMN; 1.8 in the AoH and AoP groups respectively ( p = 0.130). The mortality rate for the AoH group was 9.7% compared with 17.3% in the AoP group. The MYMOP2 scores between the two groups differed significantly ( p = 0.001), in favor of AoH. Inter-group differences in the pre- and post- mean values of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, total leukocyte count, platelet count and alkaline phosphatase were each found to be statistically significant ( p < 0.05), favoring AoH; six other biochemical parameters showed no statistically significant differences. Conclusion The study suggests homeopathy may be an effective adjunct to standard care for treating moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. More rigorous, including double-blinded, studies should be performed to confirm or refute these initial findings.

AB  - Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of women's mortality in developing countries. The prevalence of cervical cancer is higher in developing countries like India and continents like Africa. Hyper-methylation of tumor suppressor genes through human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known to be one of the major causes of cervical cancer. The promoter hypermethylation of the cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS1) genes due to DNMT1 overexpression leads to their epigenetic silencing followed by gene repression causing cervical cancer. In silico study on the inhibition effect of capsaicin on DNMT1 was simulated by different servers. The binding energy was observed to be -7.8 kcal/mol. In vitro studies on the effect of capsaicin on aberrant methylation of CADM1 and SOCS1 were performed on the adenocarcinoma cervical cancer cell line, HeLa. The IC50 of capsaicin was observed to be 160 mu M through crystal violet assay. DNA methylation of the CADM1 and SOCS1 was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR along with their reversal using capsaicin (20 mu M) by treating the cells for 72 h and 6 days. In silico results suggested that capsaicin has an inhibitory effect on DNMT1, which regulates DNA methylation leading to the hypermethylation of CADM1 and SOCS1 genes. The in vitro studies suggested that hypermethylation leads to the inhibition of CADM1 and SOCS1 expression, which could be reversed using capsaicin with visible changes in methylation-specific and unmethylation-specific bands in MS-PCR, respectively. The present study shows the reversal of methylation of CADM1 and SOCS1 after 72 h which showed a further increase in case of 6 days of treatment using 20 mu M capsaicin, which makes capsaicin a potent candidate for causing demethylation of CADM1 and SOCS1 genes that may lead to the reactivation of the downregulated gene.

AB  - We estimated the proportion of children with stereopsis following surgery in congenital and developmental cataracts by systematic review and meta-analysis and also considered the factors influencing stereopsis, such as intervention age and presence of strabismus. Stereopsis is directly related to quality of life, and investigating its levels following cataract surgery in children may help decide the right time to intervene, particularly in the context of brain plasticity. We conducted a systematic literature search using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science and found 25 case series, 3 cohorts, and 3 clinical trial studies from 1/1/1995 to 31/12/2020. Study-specific proportions of stereopsis from 923 children were pooled using a random-effects model, and stratified analyses were conducted based on intervention age and pre-existing strabismus as a confounder. We appraised the risk of bias using tools published by National Institutes of Health and evaluated publication bias with funnel plots and the Egger test. The pooled proportions of stereopsis based on 8 unilateral and 6 bilateral congenital cataract studies were 0.37 (95% CIs: [0.24, 0.53]) and 0.45 (95% CIs: [0.24,0.68]) when patients with preexisting strabismus were excluded as a confounder. When the intervention age was <= 6 months, proportions in unilateral congenital cataract group significantly increased to 0.52 (95% CIs: [0.37, 0.66]; P = 0.49) compared to 0.26 (95% CIs: [0.14, 0.44];

AB  - During COVID-19 pandemic, many doctors were redirected from various disciplines for care of COVID-19 patients. A survey was conducted among doctors involved, to assess transfusion practices during the pandemic. To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of blood transfusion among doctors involved in care of COVID-19 patients. A cross-sectional survey using an online questionnaire (Google form) was used to assess knowledge and need of transfusion, attitude towards modifications in transfusion process, and practices during pandemic. Analysis was done among subgroups based on experience (designation), user type (speciality) and frequency of blood usage in parent department. Of 1900 invitations, 437 responses were received from resident doctors and faculty members across various disciplines. Of these, 354(81%) participants were included in analysis. Mean knowledge score was 6.2, majority 297(83.9%) had adequate knowledge scores (>= 5 of total 12). Knowledge levels were higher among frequent blood users. Positive attitude towards changes in transfusion process was observed in 72.9% participants with similar scores in subgroups. Practice was assessed in 222(62.7%) participants. Mean practice score was 6.9, wherein 57.7% participants had optimal scores (>= 7 of total 14). Positive correlation was observed between attitude and practice, unlike knowledge and practice. Although most participants had demonstrated adequate transfusion knowledge levels and positive attitude, transfusion practices during pandemic were affected mainly due to shortage of blood components and modifications in transfusion requisition process due to stringent COVID-19 containment measures. Thus, indicating need for improvement in the basic understanding of the transfusion process.

AB  - Background To ascertain presence of physiological uptake and derive standardized uptake values (SUV) of Ga-68-DOTANOC in normal myocardium and establish reference values. Methods and results Dedicated cardiac Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT studies of patients referred for evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) or myocarditis and found to be normal on visual assessment and on cardiac MRI were analyzed semiquantitatively. The studies were acquired 45-60 minutes after intravenous injection of 111-185 MBq of Ga-68-DOTANOC. Myocardial SUVmax normalized to lean body mass (SUV(max_)lbm) values for septum, anterior wall, proximal lateral wall, distal lateral wall, inferior wall, and apical region were 1.12 +/- .39, 1.09 +/- .42, 1.26 +/- .49, 1.16 +/- .40, 1.23 +/- .39, and 1.05 +/- .40, respectively. Myocardial SUV(max_)lbm-to-blood pool SUVmean_lbm ratios were calculated for each region and 95th percentile values of these ratios were considered the upper limit of normal. 95th percentile values of myocardial SUV(max_)lbm-to-blood pool SUVmean_lbm ratio for the corresponding regions were 1.70, 1.70, 2.00 1.95, 2.05, and 1.70, respectively. Conclusion There can be physiological uptake of Ga-68-DOTANOC in normal myocardium and the reference values of semiquantitative parameters established in this study may be employed as a corroborative tool for visual assessment in patients undergoing Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT for suspected CS or myocarditis.

AB  - Combination chemotherapy with systemic administration of drugs in their free form can be challenging due to non-synchronized phar-macokinetics and sub-optimal tumor accumulation. The present study investigates a PLA-based block copolymeric nanocarrier for the co -delivery of navitoclax and decitabine (NAV/DCB NPs) for combination cancer therapy. NAV/DCB NPs exhibited potent in vitro synergistic cytotoxicity in both acute myeloid leukemia and breast cancer cell lines. Biodistribution studies of NAV/DCB NPs in tumor bearing mice, showed significant drug accumulation in tumor tissue and detectable quantities in plasma even after 48 h. Good hemocompatibility with reduced in vivo platelet toxicity indicated that encapsulation in PLA-based nanocarrier helped ameliorate navitoclax associated thrombo-cytopenia. In vivo biological activity of NAV/DCB NPs evaluated in xenograft AML and syngeneic breast cancer model, demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition efficacy. PLA-based NAV/DCB dual NPs present a novel, safe and effective nanoformulation for combination cancer therapy in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We evaluated impact of melphalan dose on transplant outcomes for multiple myeloma. Between 1995 and 2019 459 consecutive patients received a transplant; 69(15%) received melphalan <= 150 mg/m2 (Mel 150 cohort) and 390 (85%) melphalan 200 mg/m2 (MEL 200 cohort). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) from the date of transplant. Progression-free survival (PFS), engraftment, transplant response, and cumulative relapse at 2 years were secondary outcome measures. Patients in Mel 150 cohort had adverse clinical and laboratory parameters at base line. Transplant response was better for Mel 200 cohort (p < 0.024). Median OS at a median follow-up of 88 months was similar in the two cohorts; 100 Vs 102 months (Mel 200), p = 0.817. Median PFS (60.0 Vs 53 months, p = 0.746), relapse at two years (32.4% Vs 30.9%, p = 0.745) and grade 3-4 mucositis (p = 0.823) were similar. Initial treatment prepares patients better for subsequent similar transplant outcomes despite differences in baseline characteristics.

AB  - BackgroundFragment reattachment is the recommended treatment modality in uncomplicated crown fractures. There is a paucity of literature regarding the mechanisms responsible for increased resistance to fracture after fragment rehydration in such cases. Hence, the aim of this proof-of-concept study was to decipher the microscopic changes in the penetration characteristics of resin in tooth fragments after different rehydration protocols. Material and MethodsSixty bovine incisors free of structural deformities were fractured as per a standard protocol and the fragments were stored in saline at 4 degrees C. They were randomly allocated into three groups (n = 20)-Group 1: negative-control, no-rehydration, Group 2: rehydration by immersion in distilled water for 15 min, Group 3: rehydration by humidification for 15 min. They were subjected to the "experimental bonding protocol" using an eighth-generation bonding agent mixed with rhodamine-B dye. The samples were subjected to decalcification and sectioned into cubical blocks (2 x 2 x 2 mm(3)). They were embedded in paraffin wax, sectioned by an ultramicrotome and evaluated by using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The depths and width of the resin tags were assessed by image analysis software, and the number of tags was counted manually by blinded evaluators. Statistical analysis was done with Stata-14. ResultsThe depth of penetration of the resin tags was greatest in Group 2 (927.81 +/- 280.38 mu m) followed by Group 3 (902.03 +/- 371.85 mu m) and Group 1 (287.74 +/- 124.80 mu m). Similarly, the width of the penetrated resin tags was greatest in Group 2 (58.29 +/- 21.15), followed by Group 3 (35.53 +/- 22.15) and Group 1 (23.89 +/- 6.88). The number of resin tags in the majority of the samples in Group 1 had less than 25 tags (65%), whereas there were more than 25 tags in Group 2 (70%) and Group 3 (75%). These differences were statistically significant (p < .05). ConclusionThe resin penetration, as observed by the number of tags and their depth and width, was significantly affected by the rehydration of the fragments. The fragments rehydrated in the distilled water had greater penetration of resin tags than those rehydrated in a humidification chamber.

AB  - IntroductionThe InPOG-HL-15-01, a multicentric prospective study, used a risk-stratified and response-based approach with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) backbone to treat children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and reduce the use of radiation therapy (RT). Children/adolescents with bulky disease or inadequate response at early response assessment (ERA) after two cycles of chemotherapy were assigned to receive RT. For ERA, positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) was recommended but not mandatory in view of limited access. This study aimed to compare the impact of using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and PET-CT on treatment decisions and outcomes. Methodology396 patients were enrolled and 382 had an ERA at the assigned time point. Satisfactory response was defined as Deauville score 3 or less for patients undergoing PET-CT and complete response (CR)/very good partial response (VGPR) for patients undergoing CECT. Outcomes of interest incorporate 5 year event-free survival (EFS), EFS including abandonment (EFSa), and overall survival (OS). ResultsAt ERA, satisfactory response was documented in 277 out of 382 (72.5%) participants and this was significantly higher in PET-CT (151 out of 186, 81.2%) as compared with CECT-based assessments (126 out of 196, 64.3%) respectively (p value < .001). Amongst the 203 patients with nonbulky disease (wherein the indication for RT was entirely dependent on ERA), 96 out of 114 (84.2%) and 61 out of 89 (68.5%) patients achieved a satisfactory response according to the PET-CT and CECT (p value = .008) respectively and hence a lesser proportion of patients in the PET-CT arm received RT. Despite a lower usage of RT the 5 year OS of both groups, ERA based on CECT (91.8%) versus PET-CT (94.1%) was comparable (p value = .391) and so was the 5 year EFS (86.7 vs. 85.5%, p value = .724). ConclusionUse of PET-CT as the modality for ERA is more likely to indicate a satisfactory response as compared with CECT and thereby decreases the need for RT in response-based treatment algorithm for HL-afflicted children. The reduction in the application of RT did not impact the overall outcome and plausibly would lower the risk of delayed toxic effects.

AB  - Background We previously reported overexpression of miR-3692-3p in the serum of non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, the expression profile and clinical utility of miR-3692-3p in the tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are not yet reported. Methods and results We quantified the expression levels of miR-3692-3p in the tumors and adjacent normal lung tissues of early-stage (n = 29) and tissue biopsies of locally advanced and metastatic (n = 85) lung cancer patients using TaqMan advanced miRNA assay. We correlated miR-3692-3p expression with survival outcomes, therapeutic response, and other clinicopathological variables. We also predicted the target genes of miR-3692-3p, constructed a protein-protein interaction network, and performed functional enrichment analysis using various in silico tools. We found significant overexpression of miR-3692-3p in the tumors (Log2 fold change = 3.672; p < 0.0001) and tissue biopsies (Log2 fold change = 2.08; p = 0.0001) compared to normal lung tissues of lung cancer patients. The expression of miR-3692-3p did not correlate with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy. In multivariate analysis, therapeutic response emerged as an independent prognostic biomarker of OS (HR = 3.47; p = 0.022) and PFS (HR = 19.86; p < 0.001). Our in silico analysis predicted 238 target genes of miR-3692-3p. Conclusions Overexpression of miR-3692-3p could contribute to the development of lung cancer. However, mechanistic studies are warranted to shed further light on its role in lung carcinogenesis.

AB  - BackgroundAcute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is associated with a high short-term mortality rate in the absence of liver transplantation. The role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) in improving the outcomes of ACLF and acute decompensation (AD) is unclear. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to determine the impact of TPE on mortality in patients with ACLF.
   MethodsACLF patients receiving TPE with standard medical treatment (SMT) were propensity score matched (PSM) with those receiving SMT alone (1:1) for sex, grades of ACLF, CLIF C ACLF scores, and the presence of hepatic encephalopathy. The primary outcomes assessed were mortality at 30 and 90days. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan Meier survival curves.
   ResultsA total of 1151 patients (ACLF n = 864 [75%], AD [without organ failure] n = 287 [25%]) were included. Of the patients with ACLF (n = 864), grade 1, 2, and 3 ACLF was present in 167 (19.3%), 325 (37.6%), and 372 (43.0%) patients, respectively. Thirty-nine patients received TPE and SMT, and 1112 patients received only SMT. On PSM analysis, there were 38 patients in each group (SMT plus TPE vs SMT alone). In the matched cohort, the 30-days mortality was lower in the TPE arm compared to SMT (21% vs 50%, P = .008), however, the 90-day mortality was not significantly different between the two groups (36.8% vs 52.6%, P = .166); HR, 0.82 (0.44-1.52), P = .549.
   ConclusionTPE improves short-term survival in patients with ACLF, but has no significant impact on long-term outcomes. Randomized control trials are needed to obtain a robust conclusion in this regard.

TI  - Utility of CD229 as novel marker in measurable residual disease assessment in multiple myeloma-An evidence-based approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LABORATORY HEMATOLOGY
KW  - PLASMA-CELLS
KW  - LY9
AB  - Introduction: CD229 has been found to be a useful plasma cell (PC) gating marker in multiple myeloma (MM). This study analyses the expression profile of CD229 on various bone marrow compartments namely, PC, non-PC and hematogones (HGs) using Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). Furthermore, it evaluates the ability of CD229 to delineate normal PC (NPC) from aberrant PC (APC) in measurable residual disease assessment (MRD) in MM. Methods: Bone marrow aspirates from patients diagnosed with MM (per standard IMWG criteria) were collected in EDTA and processed for MFC using a single tube 14-color antibody panel as per standard operating procedure. Results: A total of 74 atients with a diagnosis of MM (26 treatment naive and 48 on therapy) were evaluated. The expression of CD229 was homogenous on both the PC and HG compartments as compared to CD138 and CD38. On comparing the expression of individual markers, it was found to be statistically significant between PC, HGs and non-PC for all three markers (p < 0.001). APC showed lower median expression of CD38 and higher median expression of CD138 and CD229 as compared to NPC and was found to be statistically significant for all markers (p < 0.001). In terms of differential expression on NPC and APC; CD38 was found to be the most aberrantly expressed (70%; 52/74) followed by CD229 (7%; 5/74) and CD138 (5%; 4/74). Conclusions: CD229 can be used for the identification of PC and due to relatively homogenous expression; it can be used as a suitable marker for targeted therapies. However, precise discrimination of NPC from APC cannot be reliably achieved with CD229, limiting its utility as a useful marker of diagnostic relevance and MRD assessment in MM.

AB  - Purpose: A videolaryngoscope(VL) with an intubation conduit like KingVision channeled(KVC) blade may provide an added advantage over a non-channeled VL like a KingVision non-channeled (KVNC) blade and direct laryngoscope (DL) for acquiring and retention of intubation skills, especially in novices. Methods: In this prospective two-period randomized crossover trial, one hundred medical students used three laryngoscopes KVC, KVNC and DL for intubation following standardized training with the study devices using a Laerdal Airway Management Trainer. After one month, all participants attempted intubation, in the same manner, using all devices. The duration of intubation, modified Cormack-Lehane (CL) grade, percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score, first-attempt success, number of attempts, ease of intubation and dental trauma was recorded. The retention of intubation skills after 1 month was also assessed on the same parameters. Results: Median intubation times of KVC and DL were comparable and significantly better than KVNC (P < 0.001). The median POGO score was better with both videolaryngoscopes when compared with DL. The ease of intubation (P < 0.0012) and first-attempt success rate (P = 0.001) at the time '0' was significantly better with KVC compared to KVNC and DL. KVC fared better with respect to these intubation parameters during intubation after one month as well. Conclusion: KVC performed better in terms of time to intubation, success rate and ease of procedure as compared to KVNC and DL, both for acquisition and retention of skill. Hence, we advocate that KVC should be the preferred device over KVNC and DL for teaching intubation skills to novices.

AB  - Background and purposeClinical outcome information on patients with neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with the severity of COVID-19 outcomes in people with NMDs. MethodsCases of NMD, of any age, and confirmed/presumptive COVID-19, submitted to the International Neuromuscular COVID-19 Registry up to 31 December 2021, were included. A mutually exclusive ordinal COVID-19 severity scale was defined as follows: (1) no hospitalization; (2) hospitalization without oxygenation; (3) hospitalization with ventilation/oxygenation; and (4) death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for severe outcome, adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, NMD, comorbidities, baseline functional status (modified Rankin scale [mRS]), use of immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory medication, and pandemic calendar period. ResultsOf 315 patients from 13 countries (mean age 50.3 [+/- 17.7] years, 154 [48.9%] female), 175 (55.5%) were not hospitalized, 27 (8.6%) were hospitalized without supplemental oxygen, 91 (28.9%) were hospitalized with ventilation/supplemental oxygen, and 22 (7%) died. Higher odds of severe COVID-19 outcomes were observed for: age >= 50 years (50-64 years: OR 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33-4.31; >64 years: OR 4.16, 95% CI 2.12-8.15; both vs. <50 years); non-White race/ethnicity (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.07-3.06; vs. White); mRS moderately severe/severe disability (OR 3.02, 95% CI 1.6-5.69; vs. no/slight/moderate disability); history of respiratory dysfunction (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.79-5.58); obesity (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.18-4.25); >= 3 comorbidities (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.76-5.83; vs. <= 2; if comorbidity count used instead of specific comorbidities); glucocorticoid treatment (OR 2.33, 95% CI 1.14-4.78); and Guillain-Barre syndrome (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.35-7.13; vs. mitochondrial disease). ConclusionsAmong people with NMDs, there is a differential risk of COVID-19 outcomes according to demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings could be used to develop tailored management strategies and evidence-based recommendations for NMD patients.

AB  - BackgroundHereditary Spastic Paraparesis (HSP) are a group of genetically inherited disorders, clinically and genetically heterogenous and characterized by degeneration of corticospinal tracts, manifesting with progressive spasticity and lower limbs weakness. Most HSPs have an autosomal dominant inheritance. "Ear of the Lynx" sign describes the characteristic abnormality in the forceps minor region of the corpus callosum (CC) on MRI brain. These bear a striking resemblance to the ears of a lynx. This finding has previously been described with hereditary spastic paraparesis 11 and 15, both of which are autosomal recessive HSPs. CasesWe describe this finding in two siblings with novel mutations causing HSP76, an extremely rare autosomal recessive HSP (less than 50 cases described worldwide), which has not been reported previously. ConclusionThis sign suggests the presence of pathogenic genetic mutations and is likely indicative of autosomal recessive HSPs.

AB  - Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an emerging ailment of global concern. Its diagnosis at the early stages is critical for recovery. Therefore, efforts are underway to produce digital pathology tools with human-level intelligence that are efficient, scalable, accessible, and cost-effective. Following the trend, a medical imaging challenge on "Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells in Microscopic Images (SegPC-2021)"was organized at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2021, France. The challenge addressed the problem of cell segmentation in microscopic images captured from the slides prepared from the bone marrow aspirate of patients diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. The challenge released a total of 775 images with 690 and 85 images of sizes 2040x1536 and 1920x2560 pixels, respectively, captured from two different (microscope and camera) setups. The participants had to segment the plasma cells with a separate label on each cell's nucleus and cytoplasm. This problem comprises many challenges, including a reduced color contrast between the cytoplasm and the background, and the clustering of cells with a feeble boundary separation of individual cells. To our knowledge, the SegPC-2021 challenge dataset is the largest publicly available annotated data on plasma cell segmentation in MM so far. The challenge targets a semi-automated tool to ensure the supervision of medical experts. It was conducted for a span of five months, from November 2020 to April 2021. Initially, the data was shared with 696 people from 52 teams, of which 41 teams submitted the results of their models on the evaluation portal in the validation phase. Similarly, 20 teams qualified for the last round, of which 16 teams submitted the results in the final test phase. All the top-5 teams employed DL-based approaches, and the best mIoU obtained on the final test set of 277 microscopic images was 0.9389. All these five models have been analyzed and discussed in detail. This challenge task is a step towards the target of creating an automated MM diagnostic tool.

AB  - Introduction: Response to lithium maintenance varies widely across patients with bipolar disorder (BD). The studies on neurochemical correlates of long-term lithium response in BD remain scant.Aim: To assess the neurochemical profile in DLPFC based on lithium response status among subjects with bipolar I disorder (BD-I) using in vivo MRS.Materials and method: This was an observational study of 40 right-handed, euthymic adult participants with DSM-5 BD-I on long-term lithium maintenance with no psychiatric comorbidities (MINI 7.0). Using Alda Lithium Response Scale (LRS), a cut-off >= 7 for excellent lithium response, the sample was grouped into study group I for responders and group II for non-responders. All participants were assessed using NIMH Life Chart Method and IGSLI typical/atypical features scale. 1H-MRS was carried out on a 3 T MR scanner (Achieva, Phillips) using a 32 -channel head coil, with a voxel placed at the left DLPFC. LC model was used to measure absolute concentrations of neurochemicals and their ratios in relation to creatine.Results: Group I (n = 20) was comparable to Group II (n = 20) with respect to demographic and illness profile. The GPC/Cr+PCr ratio was significantly higher (p = 0.028) among excellent lithium responders (0.32 +/- 0.20 mmol/l) compared to sub-optimal responders (0.25 +/- 0.05 mmol/l). Choline-containing compounds reflect al -terations in cell membrane synthesis or myelin turnover, and are a marker of overall cell density. No significant alterations were detected in NAA, glutamate, glutamine, myo-inositol and creatine.Conclusion: The lithium responders exhibited elevated choline (GPC) in the left DLPFC compared to non-responders.

AB  - AimTo compare the pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) based on the timing of diagnosis. MethodsThis retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2011 and September 2017 amongst 2638 Asian Indian pregnant women. The inclusion criteria included; singleton pregnancies having HbA1c <48 mmols/mol (6.5%) in the first trimester, GDM screening by 75 g OGTT using IADPSG criteria and delivery at our centre. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: Early GDM (E-GDM)-diagnosis <24 gestational weeks (Gw), Standard GDM (S-GDM)-diagnosis >= 24Gw, Non-GDM- No GDM >= 24 Gw. Multivariable logistic regression models compared the pregnancy outcomes between Non-GDM, S-GDM and E-GDM groups. A sub-group multivariable analysis was done amongst GDM women using gestational age at diagnosis both as a categorical and continuous variable. ResultsCompared to Non-GDM women, the odds were higher for premature birth, large for gestational age (LGA) babies, macrosomia, Neonatal ICU(NICU) admission and lower for normal vaginal delivery in the E-GDM group, but for the S-GDM group, the risk was higher for premature birth, LGA babies, NICU admission and induction of labour. Compared to GDM women in the 24-28 Gw category significantly higher odds for premature birth and LGA babies were observed in the <14 Gw category. A continuous increase of 19% odds for premature birth with every 4 weeks decrease in gestational age at GDM diagnosis was observed. ConclusionsAsian Indian women having a GDM diagnosis before 24Gw are at higher risk for adverse pregnancy events than those having diagnosis >= 24Gw or not having GDM.

AB  - Background: In this study, we aim to review the outcomes of children with Wilms tumor (WT) operated through the minimally invasive surgery (MIS) approach at our center. We also intend to highlight essential surgical steps during laparoscopic excision of large WTs.Methods: This retrospective study included children with unilateral WT who had undergone resection for a period of 4 years, w.e.f. July 2013 to July 2017. Simple maneuvers such as tilting the table in different positions and use of blunt metallic cannula to lift the tumor to access the hilar vessels were used to dissect large WT. An extended lumbotomy incision was used for retrieval of tumor and lymph-node sampling.Results: Eleven patients (male:female = 7:4) of WT, all having stage III disease, had undergone laparoscopic tumor resection at our center during the study period. The median age at presentation was 36 months (range = 17 months-5 years) and the median preoperative tumor volume was 1140 (range = 936-1560) cm(3). The average length of the lumbotomy incision was 6.3 (range = 5-8.2) cm. The median hospital stay was 6 (range = 5-10) days. Two children developed complications (port-site recurrence and grade III surgical site infection in one each) during the postoperative period. All cases are long-term survivors after a median follow-up of 86 (range = 56-104) months.Conclusion: This study highlights the feasibility and safety of the removal of large WT through the MIS approach. Problems due to large-sized tumors in children can be overcome by simple maneuvers. Also, adequate lymph node sampling is possible with a suitably placed extended lumbotomy incision for tumor removal.

AB  - IntroductionNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy in India except in north-eastern states. We present our institutional experience of 16 years highlighting management, outcomes, responses and toxicities.Materials and MethodsNPC patients registered at our center during the period of 2000-2015. The primary objective of the study was to assess the overall survival (OS). Secondary outcome included determinations of response rates, progression free survival (PFS) and to assess treatment-related toxicity (CTCAE v4.0). Institute ethics committee approval was obtained prior to initiation of this study.ResultsData was retrieved from complete records of 222 patients out of 390 registered during study period. There were 163 males (73.4%) and 59 females (26.6%) with a male to female ratio of 2.8:1. The median age was 35 years (range 6-73). Only 5.6% (n = 12) presented in early-stage disease (stage I and II) while 89.6% (n = 199) were advanced stage (stage III, IVA, IVB). Five patients (2.2%) presented as metastatic disease. Majority of patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) {76.1%, n = 169}. Relapses were documented in 10.4% patients. 5% patients had loco-regional relapse while distant metastases were seen in 4% patients. The 3-year PFS and OS rates are 60.9% and 68.4%, respectively. Achieving a CR predicted superior OS on multivariate analysis.ConclusionsNPC is a rare malignancy and majority presented with advanced stages. This data outlines our experience and outcomes with a predominantly induction chemotherapy followed by definitive CCRT based approach.

AB  - Background:Several augmentation strategies have been used to improve symptomatology in patients not adequately responding to clozapine. Several randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have evaluated the efficacy of different strategies to augment clozapine. This systematic review and meta-analysis reviewed the available RCTs that have evaluated the clinical efficacy of various pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological strategies (occupational therapy, cognitive behaviour therapy), and somatic treatment [electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, etc.)] as augmenting agents to clozapine. Methods:Data were extracted using standard procedures, and risk of bias was evaluated. Effect sizes were computed for the individual studies. Results:Forty-five clinical trials were evaluated. The pooled effect size for various antipsychotic medications was 0.103 (95% CI: 0.288-0.493, p < 0.001); when the effect size was evaluated for specific antipsychotics for which more than one trial was available, the effect size for risperidone was -0.27 and that for aripiprazole was 0.57. The effect size for lamotrigine was 0.145, and that for topiramate was 0.392. The effect size for ECT was 0.743 (CI: 0.094-1.392). Risk of bias was low (mean Jadad score - 3.93). Largest effect sizes were seen for mirtazapine (effect size of 5.265). Most of the studies can be considered underpowered and limited by small sample sizes. Conclusions:To conclude, based on the findings of the present systematic review and meta-analysis, it can be said that compared to other treatment strategies, clozapine non-responsive patients respond maximum to mirtazapine followed by ECT.

AB  - Background Fatty acid binding protein-2 (FABP-2) is involved in the metabolism of lipids in the intestine. FABP-2 Ala54Thr polymorphism involves a transition of G to A at codon 54 of FABP-2, resulting in an amino acid substitution Ala54 to Thr54 and is associated with elevated fasting triglycerides in some hyperlipidemic populations. In current genome builds and gene databases the variant of the Ala54Thr FABP-2 (rs 1 799 883) is annotated as c.163A>G (p. Thr55Ala). Aim and Objective The status of this polymorphism in hyperlipidemic Asian Indians from North India has not been investigated. This study was aimed to evaluate the distribution of the polymorphic variants of the Ala54Thr FABP-2 and their association with lipids in hyperlipidemic subjects. Methods Ala54Thr FABP-2 polymorphism in both hyperlipidemic (n = 210) and normolipidemic (n = 342) subjects was assessed by PCR-RFLP. Results Ala54Thr genotypes and alleles distribution did not differ between the hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic groups. The heterozygous genotype FABP-2 Ala/Thr was significantly associated with higher levels of triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins as compared to the homozygous variant (Thr/Thr) genotype and the wild type homozygous (Ala/Ala) genotype. Conclusions The heterozygous genotype FABP-2 Ala54Thr is a risk factor for the development of hypertriglyceridemia and increased levels of VLDL-c in Asian Indians from North India.

AB  - Purpose: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) signficantly affect day to day activities contributing to signficant disability. Patients with AS often report to have psychological problems and poor quality of life (QoL). This study investigates the effect of a three-month tele-yogic intervention on disease activity, functional index, inflammatory markers, quality of life and mental health measures in patients with AS. Methods: One hundred and twenty AS patients were assigned to either the yoga intervention group (YG) or the control group (CG). The YG (n = 57) received a 60-min structured yoga module online for 3 months in addition to standard medical care. The CG participants (n = 52) received only standard care during the same period. Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Ankylosing Spondylitis-Quality of Life (ASQOL) and psychological and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at baseline and after three months. Results: YG showed significant improvement in BASDAI (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.0004), and depression (p = 0.001) at three months compared to baseline. The CG showed no significant change in similar outcome measures. At three months, the intervention resulted in a significant improvement in BASDI (-0.79; 95% CI (-1.3, to -0.29); p = 0.0021), BASFI (-0.86, 95% CI (-1.59, to -0.14); p = 0.0193), anxiety (-0.42, 95% CI (-0.84 to -0.01), p = 0.0468), and AS-QoL (-3.37; 95% CI (-5.21 to 1.53); p = 0.0004) compared to the CG. Conclusions: The present study suggests that yoga helps improve pain, functional index, and mental health in patients with AS. Tele-yoga intervention is feasible and effective in treating AS.

AB  - Background Olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) is a rare neuroectodermal tumor with a propensity for lymph node and distant metastases in a proportion of cases, presenting opportunities for cytological diagnosis. Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) is a recently identified marker of neuroendocrine differentiation with higher sensitivity and specificity than traditional neuroendocrine immunostains used in diagnosis of ONB. Methods Archival aspirates diagnosed as metastatic ONB were retrieved and reviewed for described characteristics of ONB. Spare direct smears with sufficient cellular material from each case were selected, if available, and immunocytochemistry for INSM1 was performed on the destained alcohol-fixed smears. INSM1 was also performed on non-neuroendocrine malignant round cell tumors (MRCT). Results Seven fine needle aspirates (FNA) from five patients were identified, all of which showed a small round cell tumor with fine to coarse granular chromatin. Most cases had moderate to high cellularity, comprised of loosely cohesive clusters and dispersed cells. While two-cell pattern, nuclear streaking and moulding were frequent, background neuropil, fibrillary cytoplasm, and rosettes were uncommon. INSM1 immunostaining performed on spare direct smears showed strong positivity in 30%-100% of tumor cells (mean: 62%) in all aspirates tested (100%). In comparison with other immunostains, INSM1 showed more robust staining, and was easier to interpret. All non-neuroendocrine MRCTs were negative for INSM1. Conclusion Metatstatic ONB can resemble other small round cell tumors, as all the diagnostic features of ONB may not be readily evident. INSM1 immunocytochemistry has high sensitivity and specificity and can reliably be used as a single marker to support the cytomorphology for a confirmatory diagnosis of ONB, even on direct smears if a cell block is not available.

AB  - Purpose To study the role of prolonged prophylactic antibiotic therapy (PAT) in the prevention of Inter-costal drain (ICD) related infectious complications in patients with Blunt Trauma Chest (BTC). Methods Patients of age 15 years and above with BTC requiring ICD were included. Patients with penetrating chest injuries, associated injuries/illnesses requiring antibiotic administration, need for mechanical ventilation, known pulmonary disease or immuno-compromised status and need for open thoracotomy were excluded. 120 patients were randomized equally to two groups; no prolonged PAT group (Group A) and prolonged PAT group (group B). Both group patients received one shot of injectable antibiotic prior to ICD insertion. Primary outcome measure was comparison of ICD related infectious complications (pneumonia, empyema and SSI) and secondary outcome measures included the duration of ICD, Length of Hospital stay (LOS) and in-hospital mortality in both the groups. Results Infectious complications (pneumonia, empyema and SSI) were seen in only one patient in antibiotic group, and none in no antibiotic group (p value = 0.500). Other complications such as post ICD pain scores, respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, retained hemothorax or recurrent pneumothorax, did not show any statistical difference between both groups. Also, no significant difference was seen in both the groups in terms of mean duration of ICD (p value = 0.600) and LOS (p value = 0.259).m Conclusion Overall prevalence of ICD related infectious complications are low in BTC patients. Definitive role of prolonged prophylactic antibiotics in reducing infectious complications and other associated co morbidities in BTC patients with ICDs could not be established.

AB  - Aim The aim of this cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based study was to evaluate the outcome of nonsurgical root canal treatment (RCT) performed for the management of large cyst-like periapical lesions (LCPL) and to identify the predictive factors affecting healing. Methodology Fifty-four subjects (77 permanent maxillary anterior teeth) with LCPL (>10 mm) of endodontic origin were included. A single operator performed standardized multi-visit RCT. Patients were clinically and radiographically examined at 6, 12 months, and a CBCT scan was taken at 24 months. Two independent blinded evaluators measured the pre- and postoperative volume of periapical lesions on CBCT scans using ITK snap software (version 3.8.0-beta-20181028-win64). The outcome was assessed as a percentage change in lesion volume and dichotomized as success (resolved/reduced) or failure (unchanged/enlarged). Ten preoperative (gender; age; intraoral draining sinus, soft tissue swelling, tooth discoloration, pulp canal obliteration, open apex, root resorption, cortical bone defect and lesion volume) and four intraoperative (apical extent and density of root filling; number of treatment visits and type of root filling) predictive factors were observed. Bivariate and stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors affecting treatment outcomes. The significance level was set at 5%. Results A recall rate of 88% was achieved. The success rate of RCT was 82.2% (8.9% resolved, 73.3% reduced). Median lesion volume reduction was 75% (IQR 61%-93%). No pre- or intra-operative factors were related to treatment failure. However, presence of preoperative cortical bone defect (palatal versus no cortical defect, beta = -51.5; 95% CI: -86.9 to -16, p = .006) and apical extent of obturation (long versus flush, beta = -27.2; 95% CI: -53.8 to -0.6, p = .04) were negatively associated with reduction in lesion volume (%). Conclusion Large cyst-like periapical lesions may be successfully managed with RCT. Preoperative cortical bone defect and apical extent of obturation may negatively influence osseous healing.

AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the discriminatory value of various impulse oscillometry (IOS) parameters, and to find the cutoff value of the appropriate parameter for identifying exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in children with asthma.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in India from October 2016 to March 2018 in children with asthma who were 6-15 years of age. One hundred and five children were enrolled and subjected to pre-exercise IOS and spirometry followed by free running treadmill test as an exercise challenge. All children could achieve minute ventilation >17.5-21 times of FEV1 during the exercise challenge test. Then, IOS and spirometry were performed at 10 +/- 2, 20 +/- 2, and 30 +/- 2 min post-exercise challenge. EIB was defined as reduction of FEV1 >= 10% within 30 min of exercise. For purposes of analysis, the children were grouped into two categories: "EIB Present" or "EIB Absent".ResultsThe prevalence of EIB in our study was 20.95% (n = 22). Delta R5max percentage within 30 min post-exercise (AUC 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.84) had the best discriminating capacity among all IOS parameters for identifying EIB. A cutoff value of 14.1% increase in R5 within 30 min post-exercise was obtained for detection of EIB (sensitivity-95.45%, specificity-50.6%, PPV-33.87% and NPV-97.67%).ConclusionsA percentage change in R5 with a cutoff value of 14.1% increase post-exercise had the best discriminatory capacity among all IOS parameters for detection of EIB in children with asthma. However, low positive predictive value (PPV) with high negative predictive value (NPV) made this cutoff value more apt to rule out EIB.

AB  - Background and purpose Studies on stroke in South Asian populations are sparse. The aim of this study was to compare differences in age of onset of ischaemic stroke in South Asian patients living in the United Kingdom and South Asian patients living in India versus White British stroke patients. Methods We studied the UK and Indian arms of the ongoing BRAINS study, an international prospective hospital-based study of South Asian stroke patients. The BRAINS study includes 4038 South Asian and White British patients with first-ever ischaemic stroke, recruited from sites in the United Kingdom and India. Results Of the included patients, 1126 were South Asians living in India (ISA), while 1176 were British South Asian (BSA) and 1736 were White British (WB) UK residents. Patients in the ISA and BSA groups experienced stroke 19.5 years and 7.2 years earlier than their WB counterparts, respectively (mean [interquartile range] age: BSA 64.3 [22] years vs. ISA 52.0 [18] years vs. WB 71.5 [19] years; p < 0.001). Patients in the BSA group had higher rates of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hypercholesterolaemia than those in the ISA and WB groups. After adjustment for traditional stroke risk factors, an earlier age of stroke onset of 18.9 years (p < 0.001) and 8.9 years (p < 0.001) was still observed in the ISA and BSA groups, respectively. In multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis, ethnicity accounted for 24.7% of the variance in early age onset. Conclusion Patients in the BSA and ISA groups experienced ischaemic stroke approximately 9 and 19 years earlier, respectively, than their WB counterparts. Ethnicity is an independent predictor of early age of stroke onset. Our study has considerable implications for public health policymakers in countries with sizable South Asian populations.

AB  - Introduction: Pulmonary arterial compliance, the dynamic component of pulmonary vasculature, remains inadequately studied in patients with left to right shunts. We sought to study the pulmonary arterial compliance in patients with left to right shunt lesions and its utility in clinical decision-making. Materials and methods: In this single-centre retrospective study, we reviewed cardiac catheterisation data of consecutive patients of left to right shunt lesions catheterised over one year. In addition to the various other parameters, pulmonary arterial compliance was calculated, as indexed pulmonary flow (Qpi) / (Heart rate x pulse pressure in the pulmonary artery). RC time was also calculated, as the product of pulmonary arterial compliance and pulmonary vascular resistance index. Patients were divided into "operable," "borderline," and "inoperable" based on the decision of the treating team, and the pulmonary arterial compliance values were evaluated in these groups to study if it can be utilised to refine the operability decision. Results: 298 patients (Median age 16 years, 56% <18 years) with various acyanotic shunt lesions were included. Overall, the pulmonary arterial compliance varied with Qpi, pulmonary artery mean pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance index, but did not vary with age, type of lesion, or transpulmonary gradients. The median pulmonary arterial compliance in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressure (Mean pulmonary artery pressure less than 20 mmHg) was 4.1 ml/mmHg/m(2) (IQR 3.2). The median pulmonary arterial compliance for operable patients was 2.67 ml/mmHg/m(2) (IQR 2.2). Median pulmonary arterial compliance was significantly lower in both inoperable (0.52 ml/mmHg/m(2), IQR 0.34) and borderline (0.80 ml/mmHg/m(2), IQR 0.36) groups when compared to operable patients (p < 0.001). A pulmonary arterial compliance value lower than 1.18 ml/mmHg/m(2) identified inoperable patients with high sensitivity and specificity (95%, AUC 0.99). However, in borderline cases, assessment by this value did not agree with empirical clinical assessment. The median RC time for the entire study population was 0.47 S (IQR 0.30). RC time in operable patients was significantly lower than that in the inoperable patients (Median 0.40 IQR 0.23 in operable, 0.73 0.25 in inoperable patients (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Addition of pulmonary arterial compliance to the routine haemodynamic assessment of patients with shunt lesions may improve our understanding of the pulmonary circulation and may have clinical utility.

AB  - The present paper reports 10 patients (9 families) with Fanconi-Bickel syndrome managed during 2010-2021. Patients presented with polyuria, polydipsia, hepatomegaly, rickets, and stunting at a median of 5 (3, 7.3) mo; one had transient neonatal diabetes. Glucosuria, generalized aminoaciduria, beta(2)-microglobinuria, urinary phosphate wasting, and hypercalciuria were present in all patients; 3 patients had nephrocalcinosis. Other metabolic abnormalities included hypertriglyceridemia (n = 5/6), fasting hypoglycemia (n = 5/8), and postprandial hyperglycemia (n = 3/6). Genetic analysis showed 7 homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in SLC2A2. A pathogenic variant c.952G>A, common to 4 patients (3 families), might be a potential hotspot. At a median follow-up of 43 mo, 4 patients died at a median of 25 mo; short stature persisted in all except one patient who showed catch-up growth with uncooked corn-starch diet. The present findings suggest that the Fanconi-Bickel syndrome has a severe phenotype with an unsatisfactory outcome. A high index of suspicion for diagnosis and efforts for facilitation of dietary therapy are necessary.

TI  - Role of fluorescein angiography guided laser treatment in aggressive retinopathy of prematurity
T2  - EYE
KW  - POSTERIOR RETINOPATHY
AB  - Purpose To compare disease regression in cases of Fluorescein Angiography (FA) guided laser vs. conventional laser treatment in infants with Aggressive retinopathy of prematurity (AROP). Methods 60 eyes of 30 infants of AROP were randomized into two groups. In both the group's FA was done once. Montage of the fundus, FA images was created and the vascular area, avascular areas, and skip areas after laser treatment were demarcated and measured. In group 1, FA-guided laser treatment was done whereas in group 2 they were lasered without seeing FA. Infants were followed up every week to look for skip areas and disease regression. Results The mean vascular retinal area in group 1 and group 2 on fundus images was 302.7 sq. mm and 245.8 sq. mm respectively, while the same on FA was 285.2 sq. mm and 221.3 sq. mm respectively, suggesting overestimation of the vascular area on fundus imaging compared to FA which enabled more objective estimation of avascular loop areas. Retinal skip areas in group 1 and group 2 after 1st laser were 18.7 sq. mm and 73.1 sq. mm respectively (P = 0.001), after 2nd laser was 3.7 sq. mm and 19.2 sq. mm (P = 0.003), which suggests FA-guided laser led to significantly fewer skip areas. Infants had regression in 4.1 +/- 0.3 wks and 4.2 +/- 0.4 wks in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion FA-guided laser ensured lesser skip areas and more complete laser treatment, though regression was similar in both groups.

AB  - We describe the clinical and demographic characteristics, virological follow-up, and management of five confirmed monkeypox cases from New Delhi, India without any international travel history. The viral load kinetics and viral clearance were estimated in oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), EDTA blood, serum, urine, and various lesion specimens on every fourth day of follow-up ranging from 5 to 24 post onset day (POD) of illness. All five cases presented with mild to moderate-grade intermittent fever, myalgia, and lesions on the genitals, groins, lower limb, trunk, and upper limb. Four cases had non-tender firm lymphadenopathy. No secondary complications or sexually transmitted infections were recorded in these cases except for the presence of viral hepatitis B infection marker hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in one case. All the cases were mild and had a good recovery. A higher viral load was detected in lesion fluid (POD 9), followed by lesion roof (POD 9), urine (POD 5), lesion base (POD 5), and OPS/NPS (POD 5). The monkeypox virus (MPXV) DNA was detected in clinical samples from 5th to 24th POD. These monkeypox cases without international travel history suggest the underdiagnosed monkeypox infection in the community. This emphasizes the need for active surveillance of MPXV in the high-risk population such as men having sex with men and female sex workers.

AB  - Background: The development of digital technologies and the evolution of open innovation approaches have enabled the creation of diverse virtual organizations and enterprises coordinating their activities primarily online. The open innovation platform titled "International Natural Product Sciences Taskforce" (INPST) was established in 2018, to bring together in collaborative environment individuals and organizations interested in natural product scientific research, and to empower their interactions by using digital communication tools. Methods: In this work, we present a general overview of INPST activities and showcase the specific use of Twitter as a powerful networking tool that was used to host a one-week "2021 INPST Twitter Networking Event" (spanning from 31st May 2021 to 6th June 2021) based on the application of the Twitter hashtag #INPST. Results and Conclusion: The use of this hashtag during the networking event period was analyzed with Symplur Signals (https://www.symplur.com/), revealing a total of 6,036 tweets, shared by 686 users, which generated a total of 65,004,773 impressions (views of the respective tweets). This networking event's achieved high visibility and participation rate showcases a convincing example of how this social media platform can be used as a highly effective tool to host virtual Twitter-based international biomedical research events.

AB  - Objectives With a substantial number of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) experiencing disease relapse, the quest for more sensitive methods to assess deeper responses indicative of cure continues. Methods In this prospective analysis of 170 patients with MM at day 100 after autologous stem cell transplant, we evaluated the predictive value of conventional response, measurable residual disease (MRDTOTAL: the aberrant percentage of plasma cells [PC%] among total bone marrow cells), and neoplastic plasma cell index scores (NPCI: the aberrant PC% of total PCs). Results Significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed with deepening conventional response. Conventional response-based stratification within the MRD-positive and MRD-negative subgroups showed a significantly higher PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.11; P < .005) and OS (HR, 3.08; P = .01) in the conventional response-positive/MRD-positive group compared with the conventional response-negative/MRD-positive group. Using K-adaptive partitioning to find the optimum threshold for MRD, patients achieving less than 0.001% MRDTOTAL had superior PFS (MRDTOTAL 0.001% to <0.1%: HR, 6.66, P < .005; MRDTOTAL >= 0.1%: HR, 11.52, P < .005) and OS (MRDTOTAL 0.001% to <0.1%: HR, 5.3, P < .05; MRDTOTAL >= 0.1%: HR = 9.21, P < .005). The C index and Akaike information criterion metrics demonstrated the superior performance of the NPCI compared with MRDTOTAL in predicting treatment outcome. Conclusions Progressive deepening of response, conventional as well as MRD, correlates with superior survival outcomes. The NPCI proved to be a superior determinant of survival and can be explored as a better statistic than MRD.

AB  - Purpose Inter-clinician variation could cause uncertainty in disease management. This is reported to be high in Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding retinal disease affecting premature infants. Machine learning has the potential to quantify the differences in decision-making between ROP specialists and trainees and may improve the accuracy of diagnosis. Methods An anonymized survey of ROP images was administered to the expert(s) and the trainee(s) using a study-designed user interface. The results were analyzed for repeatability as well as to identify the level of agreement in the classification. "Ground truth" was prepared for each individual and a unique classifier was built for each individual using the same. The classifier allowed the identification of the most important features used by each individual. Results Correlation and disagreement between the expert and the trainees were visualized using the Dipstick (TM) diagram. Intra-clinician repeatability and reclassification statistics were assessed for all. The repeatability was 88.4% and 86.2% for two trainees and 92.1% for the expert, respectively. Commonly used features differed for the expert and the trainees and accounted for the variability. Conclusion This novel, automated algorithm quantifies the differences using machine learning techniques. This will help audit the training process by objectively measuring differences between experts and trainees. Translational relevance Training for image-based ROP diagnosis can be more objectively performed using this novel, machine learning-based automated image analyzer and classifier.

AB  - Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare immunologically mediated bone marrow failure syndrome, characterized by progressive loss of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in peripheral pancytopenia. Elaborative investigation including molecular tests is required to exclude inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IMBFS) as the treatment and prognosis vary dramatically between them. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant with a fully matched sibling donor (MSD-HSCT) is still the only curative treatment. Management of AA is a real-time challenge in India, because of the delay in the diagnosis, lack of proper supportive care, limited availability of the expertise centre, and the patient's affordability. Recently, results with intensified immunosuppressive therapy that includes anti-thymocyte globulin with cyclosporine-A (CsA) and eltrombopag, are enough encouraging to consider it as treatment of choice in patients lacking MSD or who are not fit for HSCT. However, limitations in resource constraints settings including the cost of therapy limit its full utilization. Relapse of the disease or evolution to myelodysplasia or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) in a proportion of patients is another challenge with immunosuppressants. The majority of the AA patients still receive CsA with or without androgens in India, mostly because of increased cost and limited availability of HSCT and ATG. The use of the unrelated or alternative donor is still upcoming in India, with unavailable data in terms of response and survival. Therefore, there is an utmost need for novel agents for the better management of AA having a balanced efficacy and toxicity profile to improve the survival and quality of life.

AB  - Background Chronic steroid intake has been associated with attenuation of neuromuscular block. Despite some promising animal and adult studies, the effect of a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone on neuromuscular blockers is not well established. Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of dexamethasone given at the time of induction for the prevention of PONV on the action of neuromuscular blockers in children undergoing elective surgery. Method After obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee and written informed parental consent, 100 ASA I and II children aged 4-15 years undergoing elective surgery randomized to receive either: 0.15 mg/kg (maximum of 5 mg) of dexamethasone diluted to a total volume of 2 ml with 0.9% saline (n = 50) or 2 ml of 0.9% saline (n = 50) at the time of induction. The time interval between application of atracurium and maximum T1 depression, 25% twitch height recovery of T1, amid 25% and 75% twitch height recovery of T1, amid the 25% twitch height recovery of T1 and recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9, and in between the initiation of atracurium injection till the recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was defined as onset time, clinical duration, recovery index, recovery time, and total recovery period, respectively, and recorded. Results The onset time and recovery index time were lower (1.96 +/- 0.39, 8.04 +/- 2.14, respectively) with dexamethasone in comparison with saline (2.01 +/- 0.51, 8.9 +/- 3.4, respectively) but not statistically significant. The clinical duration, recovery time, and total recovery period were similar. Conclusion Application of a single bolus dose (0.15 mg/kg) of dexamethasone during induction does not attenuate atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children.

AB  - Tumour budding is an established prognostic factor in various solid tumours, including colorectal cancers and oral squamous cell carcinomas. However, its role is unclear and needs to be defined for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (LSCC). Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the prognostic role of tumour budding in LSCC. PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for peer-reviewed literature investigating the association between tumour budding and survival outcomes or clinicopathological variables in LSCC. The primary outcomes were pooled estimates for overall and recurrence-free survival with hazard ratio (HR) as the effect measure. The association between tumour budding and clinicopathological parameters was also investigated. Of 243 studies, nine were included, comprising 2546 patients. An increased risk of death [HR = 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.50-2.05, P < 0.00001] and recurrence (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.12-1.68, P = 0.003) was evident in patients with high-grade tumour budding. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses revealed consistent results. Pathological stage II, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular and pleural invasion were associated with high-grade tumour budding. Tumour budding is a new and promising prognostic factor in patients with LSCC. However, pervasive heterogeneity and publication bias reduces the credibility of these findings and the applicability of tumour budding in clinical practice. Future studies are required to standardise reporting on tumour budding in LSCC.

AB  - Study objectives To determine if metabolic risk factors are associated with poor sleep quality and obstructive sleep apnea-like symptoms (OSA symptoms) independent of psychosocial problems and demographic and lifestyle factors in older Indian adults.
   Methodology We analyzed baseline data from adults (>= 50 years) from a population-based cohort, the LoCARPoN study, in India. Variables were grouped as (a) demographic and lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity; (b) psychosocial problems including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress; and (c) metabolic risk factors including glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, body mass index, and hypertension. Variables were examined as predictors of poor sleep quality and OSA symptoms. Groups of variables were added stepwise to a logistic regression. Variance explained by nested models was quantified using McFadden's pseudo R-2, and change was formally tested with the log-likelihood ratio test.
   Results Among 7505 adults, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 16.9% (95% CI: 16.0, 17.7), and OSA symptoms were present in 7.0% (95% CI: 6.4, 7.6). Psychosocial problems had a strong independent association with both poor sleep quality (pseudo R-2 increased from 0.10 to 0.15, p < 0.001) and more OSA symptoms (pseudo R-2 increased from 0.08 to 0.10, p < 0.001). Metabolic risk factors had a modest independent association with sleep quality (pseudo R-2 increased from 0.14 to 0.15, p < 0.01), but a strong association with OSA symptoms (pseudo R-2 increased from 0.08 to 0.10, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion Psychosocial and metabolic risk factors were independently associated with sleep quality and OSA symptoms. This fact implied that OSA symptoms may affect both mental health and physical health. Our findings have public health implications because the number and proportion of the elderly in India is increasing, while the prevalence of metabolic risk factors and psychosocial problems is high already. These facts have the potential to exacerbate not only the burden of sleep disorders and OSA symptoms but also associated cardiovascular and neurologic sequelae, further stretching the Indian health-care system.

AB  - Background In patients with multi-vessel disease presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the efficacy and safety of ischemia-guided, vs routine non-culprit vessel angioplasty has not been adequately studied. Methods We conducted an international, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing ischemia-guided non-culprit vessel angioplasty to routine non-culprit vessel angioplasty, following primary PCI for STEMI. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in percent ischemic myocardium at follow-up stress MPI. All MPI images were processed and analyzed at a central core lab, blinded to treatment allocation. Results In all, 109 patients were enrolled from nine countries. In the ischemia-guided arm, 25/48 (47%) patients underwent non-culprit vessel PCI following stress MPI. In the routine non-culprit PCI arm, 43/56 (77%) patients underwent angioplasty (86% within 6 weeks of randomization). The median percentage of ischemic myocardium on follow-up imaging (mean 16.5 months) was low, and identical (2.9%) in both arms (difference 0.13%, 95%CI - 1.3%-1.6%, P < .0001; non-inferiority margin 5%). Conclusion A strategy of ischemia-guided non-culprit PCI resulted in low ischemia burden, and was non-inferior to a strategy of routine non-culprit vessel PCI in reducing ischemia burden. Selective non-culprit PCI following STEMI offers the potential for cost-savings, and may be particularly relevant to low-resource settings. (CTRI/2018/08/015384).

AB  - Existing clinical indicators for metastatic risk classification and patient treatment of uveal melanoma (UM) in the Asian population are limited. Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has gained attention in the prognosis of cancers and considered as a potential biomarker in many tumors including UM. Therefore, this study investigated the expression of PRAME and its association with loss of nuclear BAP1 (nBAP1) as well as its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. Immunohistochemical expression of PRAME and BAP1 proteins were assessed in 66 prospective cases of UM. mRNA expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the correlation of protein expression with clinicopathological parameters, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. Nuclear PRAME (nPRAME) expression and loss of nBAP1 were observed in 24 and 62% cases, respectively. PRAME mRNA expression level was found to be upregulated in 64% (7/11) of metastatic patients. mRNA and immunoexpression of nPRAME were statistically significant with many clinicopathological high-risk factors. On univariate and multivariate analyses, high mitotic activity, extraocular invasion and presence of nPRAME expression were statistically significant (p < 0.05). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients expressing PRAME had significantly reduced metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS). MFS and OS were also reduced in patients expressing PRAME along with loss of nBAP1. Our data show that nPRAME expression, in combination with loss of nBAP1, could be a useful predictive biomarker in the therapeutic management of UM patients at high risk.

AB  - Sleep is important for cognitive and physical performance. Sleep deprivation not only affects neural functions but also results in muscular fatigue. A good night's sleep reverses these functional derangements caused by sleep deprivation. The role of sleep in brain function has been extensively studied. However, its role in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) or skeletal muscle morphology is sparsely addressed although skeletal muscle atonia and suspended thermoregulation during rapid eye movement sleep possibly provide a conducive environment for the muscle to rest and repair; somewhat similar to slow-wave sleep for synaptic downscaling. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of 24 h sleep deprivation on the NMJ morphology and neurochemistry using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry in the rat soleus muscle. Acute sleep deprivation altered synaptic ultra-structure viz. mitochondria, synaptic vesicle, synaptic proteins, basal lamina, and junctional folds needed for neuromuscular transmission. Further acute sleep deprivation showed the depletion of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the overactivity of its degrading enzyme acetylcholine esterase at the NMJ. The impact of sleep deprivation on synaptic homeostasis in the brain has been extensively reported recently. The present evidence from our studies shows new information on the role of sleep on the NMJ homeostasis and its functioning.

AB  - Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most frequent pediatric glomerular disease, affecting from 1.15 to 16.9 per 100,000 children per year globally. It is characterized by massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and/or concomitant edema. Approximately 85-90% of patients attain complete remission of proteinuria within 4-6 weeks of treatment with glucocorticoids, and therefore, have steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS). Among those patients who are steroid sensitive, 70-80% will have at least one relapse during follow-up, and up to 50% of these patients will experience frequent relapses or become dependent on glucocorticoids to maintain remission. The dose and duration of steroid treatment to prolong time between relapses remains a subject of much debate, and patients continue to experience a high prevalence of steroid-related morbidity. Various steroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs have been used in clinical practice; however, there is marked practice variation in the selection of these drugs and timing of their introduction during the course of the disease. Therefore, international evidence-based clinical practice recommendations (CPRs) are needed to guide clinical practice and reduce practice variation. The International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA) convened a team of experts including pediatric nephrologists, an adult nephrologist, and a patient representative to develop comprehensive CPRs on the diagnosis and management of SSNS in children. After performing a systematic literature review on 12 clinically relevant PICO (Patient or Population covered, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, recommendations were formulated and formally graded at several virtual consensus meetings. New definitions for treatment outcomes to help guide change of therapy and recommendations for important research questions are given.

AB  - Dermatophytosis is a common superficial fungal infection of the skin and its appendages caused by dermatophytes. Recent times have witnessed a dynamic evolution of dermatophytes driven by their ecology, reproduction, pathogenicity and host immune response, influenced by population migration and socioeconomic status. Dermatophytes establish infection following successful adherence of arthroconidia to the surface of keratinized tissues. The proteolytic enzymes released during adherence and invasion not only ascertain their survival but also allow the persistence of infection in the host. While the cutaneous immune surveillance mechanism, after antigen exposure and presentation, leads to activation of T lymphocytes and subsequent clonal expansion generating effector T cells that differentially polarize to a predominant Th17 response, the response fails to eliminate the pathogen despite the presence of high levels of IFN-g. In chronic dermatophytosis, antigens are a constant source of stimulus promoting a dysregulated Th17 response causing inflammation. The host-derived iTreg response fails to counterbalance the inflammation and instead polarizes to Th17 lineage, aggravating the chronicity of the infection. Increasing antifungal resistance and recalcitrant dermatophytosis has impeded the overall clinical remission. Human genetic research has the potential to generate knowledge to explore new therapeutic targets. The review focuses on understanding specific virulence factors involved in pathogenesis and defining the role of dysregulated host immune response against chronic dermatophytic infections for future management strategies.(c) 2022 SFMM.

AB  - The increase of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens has created challenges in treatment and warranted the design of antibiotics against comparatively less exploited targets. The peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis delineates unique pathways for the design and development of a novel class of drugs. Mur ligases are an essential component of bacterial cell wall synthesis that play a pivotal role in PG biosynthesis to maintain internal osmotic pressure and cell shape. Inhibition of these enzymes can interrupt bacterial replication and hence, form attractive targets for drug discovery. In the present work, we focused on the PG biosynthesis pathway enzyme, UDP-N-acetylpyruvylglucosamine reductase, from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (stMurB). Biophysical characterization of purified StMurB was performed to gauge the molecular interactions and estimate thermodynamic stability for determination of attributes for possible therapeutic intervention. The thermal melting profile of MurB was monitored by circular dichroism and validated through differential scanning calorimetry experiment. Frequently used chemical denaturants, GdmCl and urea, were employed to study the chemical-induced denaturation of stMurB. In the search for natural compound-based inhibitors, against this important drug target, an in silico virtual screening based investigation was conducted with modeled stMurB structure. The three top hits (quercetin, berberine, and scopoletin) returned were validated for complex stability through molecular dynamics simulation. Further, fluorescence binding studies were undertaken for the selected natural compounds with stMurB alone and with NADPH bound form. The compounds scopoletin and berberine, displayed lesser binding to stMurB whereas quercetin exhibited stronger binding affinity than NADPH. This study suggests that quercetin can be evolved as an inhibitor of stMurB enzyme.

AB  - Background: Lupus nephritis (LN) has variable prevalence, severity, and outcomes across the world.
   Objectives: This review compares the outcomes of childhood LN in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs) and aims to summarize long-term outcomes of pediatric LN from LMICs.
   Data sources: A systematic literature search, conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane database in the last 30-years from January 1992, published in the English language, identified 113 studies including 52 from lower (n = 1336) and upper MICs (n = 3014).
   Study eligibility criteria: Cohort studies or randomized controlled trials, of patients <= 18 years of age (or where such data can be separately extracted), with > 10 patients with clinically or histologically diagnosed LN and outcomes reported beyond 12 months were included.
   Participants and interventions: Patients <= 18 years of age with clinically or histologically diagnosed LN; effect of an intervention was not measured.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Two authors independently extracted data. We separately analyzed studies from developed countries (high income countries; HIC) and developing countries (LMICs). Middle-income countries were further classified as lower and upper MICs. Meta-analyses of data were performed by calculating a pooled estimate utilizing the random-effects model. Test for heterogeneity was applied using I-2 statistics. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.
   Results: Kidney remission was similar across MICs and HICs with 1-year pooled complete remission rates of 59% (95% CI 51-67%); one third of patients had kidney flares. The pooled 5-year survival free of stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5) was lower in MICs, especially in lower MICs compared to HICs (83% vs. 93%; P = 0.002). The pooled 5-year patient survival was significantly lower in MICs than HICs (85% vs. 94%; P < 0.001). In patients with class IV LN, the 5-and 10-year respective risk of CKD5 was 14% and 30% in MICs; corresponding risks in HICs were 8% and 17%. Long-term data from developing countries was limited. Sepsis (48.8%), kidney failure (14%), lupus activity (18.1%), and intracranial hemorrhage/infarct (5.4%) were chief causes of death; mortality due to complications of kidney failure was more common in lower MICs (25.6%) than HICs (6.4%).
   Limitations: The review is limited by heterogenous approach to diagnosis and management that has changed over the period spanning the review. World Bank classification based on income might not correlate with the standards of medical care. The overall quality of evidence is low since included studies were chiefly retrospective and single center.
   Conclusions and implications of key findings: Challenges in LMICs include limited access to pediatric nephrology care, dialysis, increased risk of infection-induced mortality, lack of frequent monitoring, and non-compliance due to cost of therapy. Attention to these issues might update the existing data and improve patient follow-up and outcomes.

AB  - Retrograde flow in endothelial cell cultures has been shown to induce a pro-atherogenic phenotype. Despite its potential role as a pathophysiological link between cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerotic disease, resting retrograde flows between patients with cardiovascular disease and healthy subjects have not been compared. Further, the vascular characteristics governing retrograde flow in human arteries have not been systematically investigated. Association of central and peripheral vascular characteristics with retrograde flow profile was investigated in 32 healthy subjects and 47 patients with ischemic heart disease. Endothelial dysfunction was assessed by brachial ultrasound-based calculation of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and sub-clinical atherosclerosis was estimated from carotid-intima media thickness (CIMT). Retrograde blood flow velocity (RBFV) and shear rate were comparable between the two groups (RBFV 1.82(0.97-3.32) vs 1.78(1.24-2.65) cm/s p = 0.79). Augmentation index was a significant determinant of retrograde flow in both patients and healthy subjects. Carotid artery incremental elastic modulus was an independent determinant of retrograde flow patterns in healthy subjects while ejection fraction, cf/cr PWV ratio and forearm vascular conductance emerged as independent determinants in patients. Retrograde flow patterns were also associated with FMD (RBFV r = -0.43, p = 0.004) and CIMT (r = 0.30, p = 0.041) in patients. The results of the study suggest a difference in the determinants of retrograde flow in patients and healthy subjects, with central arterial stiffness being a major contributor in healthy subjects while interaction between central, peripheral, and cardio-arterial factors influence retrograde flow in patients with ischemic heart disease.

AB  - Background Intrapartum care is of paramount importance in overall respectful maternity care (RMC). Uterine fundal pressure maneuver (UFPM) is the most controversial obstetric maneuver considered obsolete in many countries. UFPM is associated with adverse life threatening maternal and fetal effects. The baseline prevalence of UFPM in our tertiary care teaching hospital with a heavy patient load was 78.4% which was quite high. Our aim was to reduce the prevalence of UFPM by 75% from baseline over a period of 10 months. Methods After root cause analysis, we formulated the departmental Standard Operating Procedures on safe vaginal delivery and birth practices and initiated the Labour Room Quality Improvement Initiative. We sensitized and created awareness among the resident doctors and nursing staff regarding the high prevalence of UFPM through dedicated lectures, intercommunication via WhatsApp groups and strict vigilance in the labor wards. The point of care quality improvement (QI) methodology was used. The primary outcome was decrease in the prevalence of UFPM. Results The prevalence of UFPM reduced from the baseline value of 78.4%-4% over the period of 7 months. Post intervention it gradually increased and sustained at 21.2% over a follow-up period of 3 months. Conclusion QI methods can effectively and rapidly improve the acceptance and adherence to newer initiatives in a busy tertiary care health facility to reduce the prevalence of UFPM and eventually improve the overall RMC.

AB  - Myeloid differentiation in blasts is distinguished by the presence of one or more needle-shaped crystalline structures called Auer rods. Auer rods manifest either alone or as faggot cells (containing bundles of Auer rods) in various types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). Their presence largely portends a better prognosis in AML (as markers of maturation/differentiation) and upstages cases of MDS and MDS/MPN. Observation of these rods in residual blasts in treated cases of AML indicates an absence of remission. This article traces their historical discovery and examines their pathogenetic intricacies, as well as our current understanding of their relevance in myeloid neoplasms. Studies evaluating their prognostic impact in AML and MDS are catalogued. We also discuss a variety of other hematological and non-hematological neoplasms where structures potentially mistakable for Auer rods have been described. Even as the diagnostic approach to hematological malignancies has evolved from a morphology + cytochemistry + immunophenotyping-dependent one in the last century to a predominantly molecular genetics-based classification currently, and even as high-throughput sequencing and structural variation detection techniques surpass morphology in detecting clinically-relevant sub-categories of similar-appearing tumours, we review these curious microscopic structures that have withstood the test of time with respect to their diagnostic relevance.

AB  - Tracheal implantation remains a major therapeutic challenge due to the unavailability of donors and the lack of biomimetic tubular grafts. Fabrication of biomimetic tracheal scaffolds of suitable materials with matched rigidity, enhanced flexibility and biocompatibility has been a major challenge in the field of tracheal reconstruction. In this study, customized tubular grafts made up of FDA-approved polycaprolactone (PCL$$ \mathrm{PCL} $$) and polyurethane (PU$$ \mathrm{PU} $$) were fabricated using a novel solvent-based extrusion 3D printing. The printed scaffolds were investigated by various physical, thermal, and mechanical characterizations such as contact angle measurement, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), radial compression, longitudinal compression, and cyclic radial compression. In this study, the native goat trachea was used as a reference for the fabrication of different types of scaffolds (cylindrical, bellow-shaped, and spiral-shaped). The mechanical properties of the goat trachea were also compared to find suitable formulations of PCL/PU$$ \mathrm{PCL}/\mathrm{PU} $$. Spiral-shaped scaffolds were found to be an ideal shape based on longitudinal compression and torsion load maintaining clear patency. To check the long-term implantation, in vitro degradation test was performed for all the 3D printed scaffolds and it was found that blending of PU$$ \mathrm{PU} $$ with PCL$$ \mathrm{PCL} $$ reduced the degradation behavior. The printed scaffolds were further evaluated for biocompatibility assay, live/dead assay, and cell adhesion assay using bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). From biomechanical and biological assessments, PCL70/PU30$$ \mathrm{PCL}70/\mathrm{PU}30 $$ of spiral-shaped scaffolds could be a suitable candidate for the development of tracheal regenerative applications.

AB  - As a consequence of limb loss, unilateral lower limb amputees (LLAs) exert additional flexion torque in the intact limb during postural balance, leading to other secondary complications. A prosthetic device with torque delivery is required to avoid such complications. However, estimating desired torque is an acknowledged challenge in this domain. Motivated by the above, this paper focuses on estimating the corrective torque required from an assistive device to balance the individual while performing weight-shifting exercises. Further, a healthy individual's inverted pendulum (IP) model is explored to model LLA's dynamics during weight-shifting. The model and the control strategy are validated using forward and backward body lean angles recorded from healthy and LLA individuals. Finally, a robust Proportional Integral Derivative controller is designed to estimate the corrective torque for maintaining the postural balance during weight-shifting. Along with the IP dynamics, a suitable control law based on Coefficient Diagram Method achieves the experimentally recorded body lean angle. The proposed control scheme is validated through simulation studies to evaluate the tracking performance in two different biomechanically relevant IP postural models. The findings assist in determining the external torque required to maintain the postural balance during gait initiation and compensatory measures for pathologically reduced torque. Note to Practitioners-Gait initiation is a transition between vertical posture and gait. Since vertical stance is inherently unstable, a postural adjustment occurs before gait initiates, propelling the center of mass forward and towards the first stance leg. The absence of flexor torque in the amputated limb causes a loss of postural stability during weight shifting activities. In the case of powered exoskeletons and prosthetic devices, a prior estimation of corrective torque through a computational approach helps to select a suitable actuator that provides an appropriate joint torque while maintaining the postural balance. As a result, an efficient computational model of gait initiation that accounts for neuromuscular system components before designing assistive devices is necessary. The controllers further provide corrective action to the assistive device to obtain robust and optimal coordination between the prosthetic element and gait. Therefore, this study demonstrates the significance of neuromuscular controller and assists in determining how much corrective torque from an external device is required to maintain postural stability and adaptability during weight shifting exercises. The effectiveness of the neural controller is also tested for real-time data to compensate for the effect of external disturbance and noise, thereby achieving a proper and controlled degree of movement in amputee users. These findings could provide one of the fundamental aspects of gait initiation model paradigms of compensatory measures for pathologically diminished torque and contribute to developing low-cost prosthetic solutions for the benefit of the rehabilitation society in developing countries.

AB  - Glioma is a major brain tumor, and the associated mortality rate is very high. Contemporary therapies provide a chance of survival for 9-12 months. Therefore, a novel approach is essential to improve the survival rate. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) cell signaling is critical for early development in various tumors. This investigation attempted to explore the potential interaction and regulation of Shh-Gli1 cell signaling in association with paired box 6 (Pax6) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). The expression pattern of Shh, Gli1, Pax6, and IDH2 was examined by transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry, and confocal images. The results suggest the interaction of Shh-Gli1 cell signaling pathway with Pax6 and IDH2 and potential regulation. Thereafter, we performed protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) of Gli1 with Pax6 and IDH2. The results suggest differential dynamic interactions of Gli1-IDH2 and Gli1-Pax6. Gli1 knockdown downregulated the expression of Pax6 and upregulated the expression of IDH2. Moreover, Gli1 knockdown decreased the expression of the drug resistance gene MRP1. The knockdown of Pax6 gene in glioma cells downregulated the expression of Gli1 and IDH2 and promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, the efficacy of the treatment of glioma cells with temozolomide (TMZ) and Gli1 inhibitor GANT61 was higher than that of TMZ alone. MDS results revealed that the interactions of Gli1 with IDH2 were stronger and more stable than those with Pax6. Intriguingly, inhibition of Pax6 promoted glioma growth even in the presence of TMZ. However, the tumor-suppressive nature of Pax6 was altered when Gli1 was inhibited by GANT61, and it showed potential oncogenic character, as observed in other cancers. Therefore, we conclude that Pax6 interacted with IDH2 and Gli1 in glioma. Moreover, the Shh-Gli1-IDH2/Pax6 cell signaling axis provides a new therapeutic approach for inhibiting the progression of the disease and mitigating drug resistance in glioma.

AB  - Human spermatogenesis requires an orchestrated expression of numerous genes in various germ cell subtypes. Therefore, the genetic landscape of male infertility is highly complex. Known genetic factors alone account for at least 15% of male infertility. However, similar to 40% of infertile men remain undiagnosed and are classified as idiopathic infertile men. We performed exome sequencing in 47 idiopathic infertile men (discovery cohort), followed by replication study (40 variants in 33 genes) in 844 infertile men and 709 controls using Sequenom MassARRAY((R)) based genotyping. We report 17 variants in twelve genes that comprise both previously reported (DNAH8, DNAH17, FISP2 and SPEF2) and novel candidate genes (BRDT, CETN1, CATSPERD, GMCL1, SPATA6, TSSK4, TSKS and ZNF318) for male infertility. The latter have a strong biological nexus to human spermatogenesis and their respective mouse knockouts are concordant with human phenotypes. One candidate gene CETN1, identified in this study, was sequenced in another independent cohort of 840 infertile and 689 fertile men. Further, CETN1 variants were functionally characterized using biophysical and cell biology approaches. We demonstrate that CETN1 variant- p.Met72Thr leads to multipolar cells, fragmented nuclei during mitosis leading to cell death and show significantly perturbed ciliary disassembly dynamics. Whereas CETN1-5 ' UTR variant; rs367716858 leads to loss of a methylation site and increased reporter gene expression in vitro. We report a total of eight novel candidate genes identified by exome sequencing, which may have diagnostic relevance and can contribute to improved diagnostic workup and clinical management of male infertility.

AB  - Adamantinoma-like Ewing sarcoma (ALES) is a histological subtype of Ewing sarcoma that demonstrates the morphological and immunohistochemical features of the latter, harbors the EWSR1::FLI1 gene fusion, and additionally demonstrates complex epithelial differentiation on morphology and immunohistochemistry. Accurate preoperative diagnosis has potential to inform management and improve patient outcome. Cytomorphology of ALES is not well documented, with available reports showing a spectrum of features. An aspirate from a 30-year-old male with a swelling in right parotid region, interpreted elsewhere as acinic cell carcinoma (ACC), was submitted to us for review. Smears showed dispersed cells and loosely cohesive clusters with scant cytoplasm and large nuclei with focal nuclear molding, prompting a diagnosis of malignant neoplasm, possibly neuroendocrine carcinoma. Cytoplasmic vacuoles and tigroid background were present focally, the former of which had possibly led to interpretation as ACC. No material was available for ancillary tests. Parotidectomy revealed features of ALES. The cytological features of ALES in the parotid overlap with several basaloid and round blue cell neoplasms that are more common at this site. ALES should be considered in all salivary gland aspirates with isomorphic small round or basaloid cells, with or without the presence of squamous differentiation. Rosettes, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and a tigroid background are subtle morphological clues to the diagnosis, which if suspected on cytomorphology, can be confirmed using ancillary techniques.

AB  - Objective To study the prevalence of mental health problems among mothers of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Methods In this cross-sectional two-arm study, 130 mothers in each group, with either term infants not in NICU or preterm infants admitted to NICU, underwent mental health assessment using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire and Modified Parental Stress Scale-NICU. Their coping styles and quality of life were also assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS IBM 25.0. Results Anxiety (66.2% versus 46.9%) and depression (45.4% versus 23.1%) were more common among NICU mothers. Regarding subdomains of acute stress reaction, a higher number of NICU mothers showed symptoms of anxiety, re-experience and functional impairment. For mothers with infants in NICU, sight, sound, and parental role alterations were stressful. They had reduced quality of life scores in domains of physical health, psychological health, and social relationships. Also, a higher number of these mothers exhibited problem-solving and emotion-focused coping. Conclusion Preterm birth with NICU admission of the infant is more stressful for a mother than the term birth of a healthy neonate. It affects her mental health and quality of life. Both the obstetrician and the pediatrician should be mindful of this.

AB  - Purpose Our study aims to describe a novel low-cost indigenous design of goggles for delivery of oxygen during oxygen supplemented accelerated corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) Methods The goggles were prepared by modifying the safety goggles available in personal protective equipment (PPE) kit. The goggle has two side openings covered with plugs. One plug was removed to insert a tubing for oxygen delivery at a rate of 5 litres/minute. A 20-gauge intravenous cannula was introduced from superior aspect of the goggle for measuring oxygen saturation in periocular environment. Results The procedure could be successfully performed without any intraoperative difficulty with an oxygen concentration between 80-90% throughout procedure. The time to achieve maximum concentration after switching on oxygen supply was between 30-60 s. None of our patients complained of any discomfort due to goggles. There was no mechanical interference of the goggles with the UV delivery system and a focused UV light could be delivered. The opening in goggles allowed for uninterrupted alignment and centration of UV light at the corneal level. The effective cost of the goggles, canula and tubing amounted to 400INR (5.50USD). There was no distortion, kinking or slippage of the tubing allowing for uninterrupted oxygen flow. These goggles could be sterilized multiple times using plasma sterilization. Conclusion The current modified cost-effective goggle design could be an effective alternative to the currently available oxygen delivery goggles, especially in a low resource setting.

AB  - Despite the significant burden of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in India, there are areas of unmet needs at every level of the health care system. This includes screening and recognition, reliable and valid tools to evaluate, and to adequately manage ASD. There are also gaps in education and training of medical professionals, paraprofessionals, special education teachers and the related services. Lack of public awareness and cultural factors contribute to delays in early recognition and interventions. A framework is suggested to address these unmet needs at various levels to improve the care of these children with ASD. These include a) a focus on education of medical professionals, paraprofessionals, and teachers; b) setting up infrastructure at community, regional, and statewide levels, with adequate funding; and c) use of audiovisual technology and collaboration with international expertise.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to determine whether changes in acute severe colitis (ASC) management have translated to improved outcomes and to develop a simple model predicting steroid non-response on admission. Design Outcomes of 131 adult ASC admissions (117 patients) in Oxford, UK between 2015 and 2019 were compared with data from 1992 to 1993. All patients received standard treatment with intravenous corticosteroids and endoscopic disease activity scoring (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)). Steroid non-response was defined as receiving medical rescue therapy or surgery. A predictive model developed in the Oxford cohort was validated in Australia and India (Gold Coast University Hospital 2015-2020, n=110; All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi 2018-2020, n=62). Results In the 2015-2019 Oxford cohort, 15% required colectomy during admission vs 29% in 1992-1993 (p=0.033), while 71 (54%) patients received medical rescue therapy (27% ciclosporin, 27% anti-tumour necrosis factor, compared with 27% ciclosporin in 1992-1993 (p=0.0015). Admission C reactive protein (CRP) (false discovery rate, p=0.00066), albumin (0.0066) and UCEIS scores (0.015) predicted steroid non-response. A four-point model was developed involving CRP of >= 100 mg/L (one point), albumin of <= 25 g/L (one point), and UCEIS score of >= 4 (1 point) or >= 7 (2 points). Patients scoring 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the validation cohorts had steroid response rates of 100, 75.0%, 54.9%, 18.2% and 0%, respectively. Scoring of >= 3 was 84% (95% CI 0.70 to 0.98) predictive of steroid failure (OR 11.9, 95% CI 10.8 to 13.0). Colectomy rates in the validation cohorts were were 8%-11%. Conclusions Emergency colectomy rates for ASC have halved in 25 years to 8%-15% worldwide. Patients who will not respond to corticosteroids are readily identified on admission and may be prioritised for early intensification of therapy.

AB  - Horseshoe kidney is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the fusion of the lower pole leading to medial and caudal deviation of kidneys that pose challenges to successful stone clearance. We evaluated the various patient- and treatment-related factors that can impact successful stone clearance. A total of 34 patients with 36 renal moieties with urolithiasis in horseshoe kidneys from 2015 to 2021 were included with a median age of 38 years (11-56 years). The mean calculus size was 39.27 mm (21-70 mm). Twenty-two patients had left, 10 had right, and 2 had bilateral disease. Twelve patients (33%) had previous interventions done. As per Guy stone score (GSS), 14 patients had grade IV, 16 patients had grade III, and 4 patients had grade II disease. Of these patients, 22 underwent unilateral percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL), 2 underwent bilateral PCNL, 6 had pyelolithotomy, 2 had right nephrectomy, and 2 patients underwent shockwave lithotripsy (SWL). Six patients undergoing pyelolithotomy had complete clearance. In PCNL, infra-costal puncture was done uniformly. Complete clearance was seen in 12 out of 16 with superior calyceal access (75% stone-free rates, SFR), 2 out of 8 with middle calyceal puncture (25% SFR), and both the cases with inferior calyceal puncture (100% SFR). Factors affecting stone clearance are as follows: GSS, i.e., grade < IV vs >= IV (71.4 vs 50%, P = 0.42), STONE score < 12 vs >= 12 (83.3 vs 28.5%, P = 0.048), stone size < 40 vs >= 40 mm (50 vs 71.4%, P = 0.42). Our analysis showed that stone clearance was independent of mode of access, GSS, or stone size, although STONE score was a predictor of successful outcomes in PCNL.

AB  - Background Hemodialysis is the most common treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Excessive daytime sleepiness and poor nighttime sleep is a common problem among these patients. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) are regularly exposed to impaired fluid balance, which may cause overhydration of varying degree. However, the role of hydration status in sleep quality has not been explored in Indian setting. Hence, this study was undertaken to assess the factors affecting sleep quality among patients on MHD in a tertiary care hospital. Material and methods Patients (N = 55) were enrolled if they aged above18 years, on MHD for at least 3 months, and gave consent. The daytime sleep quality was assessed using Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and STATA software. Results The mean age of the patients was 40.4 +/- 14.7 years. The prevalence rate of predialysis fluid overload was 85.4%. The median ESS score was 7 and ISI score was 3 indicating normal daytime sleep and not significant insomnia. Multivariate regression with variables adjustment showed that interdialytic weight gain (P = 0.33), tingling sensation (P = 0.36) and numbness (P = 0.35) were significant predictive factors for quality of sleep. Conclusion The major factors affecting sleep quality were numbness, tingling sensation, and interdialytic weight gain. Fluid overload did not play any role in sleep quality. Another study may be carried out on assessment of pattern, duration, quality of sleep in multiple dialysis sessions, and effect of optimizing fluid status on the sleep parameters.

AB  - Distant metastasis from salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SC) is rare, with lung and pleura being the most frequent site. While cytological features of SC on fine needle aspirates are well documented, its morphology in serous effusions has not been described. We describe the cytomorphological features on effusion cytology of two patients with ETV6::NTRK3 fusion-positive SC, who subsequently developed pleural metastases. Cytospin preparations of pleural fluid showed tightly cohesive, irregularly shaped and ball-like clusters of large tumor cells with scant to abundant uni- and multi-vacuolated cytoplasm. Nuclei were eccentrically placed, round to oval, vesicular, with finely granular chromatin, irregular nuclear membranes and conspicuous to prominent nucleoli. With these features, the tumors resembled an adenocarcinoma, indistinguishable from a lung primary. Cell blocks from both cases showed tumor fragments, some of which had the hollow appearance of transversely sectioned cell spheres as seen in lung and breast adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry on cell blocks revealed nuclear pan-TRK positivity in both cases. Case 1 also showed focal mammaglobin staining, and TTF1 negativity. Pleural metastases from SC may mimic other adenocarcinomas. As targeted therapy, that is, selective TRK inhibitors are available for treatment of metastatic disease, NTRK3 fusion status is not only diagnostic, but also required to plan treatment. Pan-TRK immunohistochemistry serves as a viable cost-effective, easy to apply surrogate marker for NTRK3 fusion, particularly in diagnostic laboratories lacking easy access to molecular testing on cytological material.

AB  - Introduction Hemodialysis (HD) patients are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection but infection rates vary. Our objectives are to describe COVID-19 positive HD patients' characteristics, infection rates, and factors associated with mortality in HD COVID-19 cases in Kuwait. Methods Data on demographics, comorbidities, and treatments received, as well as mortality for HD patients admitted to hospitals for COVID-19, from 1/March to 31/July 2020, prospectively collected and analyzed. Results A total of 141 infected HD patients were admitted (Mean age 58 +/- 16.1; Males 56%), representing 7% of the total HD population and 0.2% of all COVID-19 cases during the study period. Of those 141 infected HD patients, 27 (19%) died, and this represents 6% of total COVID-19-related mortality and 27% of the total HD mortality. In contrast, total covid-19-related mortality of all positive cases was only 0.7%, and total HD mortality during the study period was only 5%. COVID-19-positive HD patients who died were older and 59% were males. However, the differences were not statistically significant. Of the 61 infected HD patients who needed to be switched to continuous kidney replacement therapy (CKRT), 34% died, and of the 29 infected HD patients who needed admission to intensive care, 65% died. Conclusion HD population represents a small fraction of the total population; however, positive HD COVID-19 cases represent a sizable proportion of COVID-19 cases and a significant percentage of total COVID-19-related mortality, and total HD mortality.

AB  - Several substitutes, including gastric transposition, colonic interposition, reverse gastric tube (RGT), etc., have been described for esophageal replacement in children and adolescents. However, the search for the ideal esophageal substitute continues due to adverse events associated with these procedures. This report presents our technique for creating an isoperistaltic gastric tube (IGT). We believe that the IGT is a versatile option for esophageal replacement as it is never length-limiting, and additional length can be gained by making minor adjustments.

AB  - Multifocal and toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) or the so-called premium IOLs are currently widely used in adult patients as a one-step refractive solution following cataract surgery. However, the decision to implant a premium IOL in a pediatric patient involves multiple factors affecting the child's visual development and is associated with several dilemmas and surgical challenges. The purpose of this review is to summarize these factors and analyse the influence of each of them on the visual outcomes following premium IOL implantation. A review of literature was conducted using the relevant keywords from various databases until 31(st) January 2022. All pertinent studies with multifocal or toric IOL implantation in children were reviewed, and relevant articles were studied in detail for age, IOL power calculation, visual outcomes (refractive outcomes, contrast sensitivity and stereopsis) and complications such as dysphotic phenomena and others. A total of 17 relevant studies (10 case series/interventional studies and 7 case reports) on the subject were included. All studies showed a favourable refractive outcome; however, the data available was significantly less. Studies with earlier models of multifocal IOLs showed a higher incidence of IOL decentration and posterior capsule opacification; however, more recent studies with newer IOL models showed much better safety profiles. Toric IOLs showed promising results in all the studies evaluated. Premium IOLs have shown promising results in the pediatric age group. However, their long-term outcomes specifically concerning refractive shift, capsular contraction and role in the management of amblyopia needs to be explored further.

AB  - Wheat is the major cereal crop in the world. While wheat proteins provide the nutritional requirement for humans, the major concern associated with them is their intolerance among a large genetically predisposed population. These proteins include gluten, albumins like amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs), serpins, thionins, and defensins. In this study, we performed a comparative (bread vs. durum wheat) expression analysis of the genes encoding for different intolerant proteins (IP) during grain development, through transcriptomics approach. Two libraries were generated from each genotype with an average of 103.81 million reads, resulting in 121.3K transcripts for bread wheat; and 75.20 million reads resulting in 117.7K transcripts for durum wheat. RNA-seq results were validated through qRT-PCR. All transcripts related to IPs were extracted; 146 and 133 transcripts were identified in case of bread and durum wheat, respectively. However, only five IP genes were differentially expressed (DEGslog2fold>2) and all of them were classified under the GO terms 'Molecular Function'. For comparative expression of the IP genes between the two genotypes, fragments per kilobase of exon model per million reads mapped (FPKM) values of each gene were studied. None of the IP transcripts were falling in any pathway, that is because these IPs are synthesized from the genes through transcription followed by translation. These IPs, during grain development, belonged to the major categories of thionin, serpin, ATI, gliadin and glutenin. Bread wheat was expressing a greater number of IP genes and mostly they were upregulated in comparison to the durum wheat. Highest numbers of IP transcripts were mapped on the BB genome; and maximum IP genes were located in chromosome1D. IP genes with higher expression in both the genotypes were further analysed for their stage-specific expression during grain development. Thionins, gliadins and glutenins were mainly expressed at 4-5 weeks after anthesis (WAA); whereas, serpins and ATIs were expressed at 3-4 WAA. The expression of thionin and serpin genes was comparatively low throughout the grain development process, when compared to other IPs. We have also analysed the transcripts related to amylose and amylopectin biosynthesis, where durum wheat showed a high amylose: amylopectin ratio in comparison to bread wheat. Our study through transcriptome analysis is another support for the hypothesis that tetraploid durum wheat is less intolerant and better for consumption for the vulnerable population than that of hexaploid bread wheat.

AB  - Objectives To demonstrate the clinical profile, management options, and outcomes of children with stage 4S neuroblastoma (NB 4S) diagnosed at a tertiary care center in a resource-challenged nation. The authors also intend to highlight the factors associated with an unfavorable prognosis in this series of patients. Methods The archives for children with NB 4S, diagnosed over a 24-y period (January 1996-December 2019), were retrospectively retrieved. Data on patient characteristics, management protocols, oncologic outcomes, and overall survival (OS) were reviewed. Multivariate logistic- regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently predicting unfavorable outcomes. Results A total of 22 children (59% males) were included. Adrenal was the most common (82%) primary site. Liver involvement (100%), bone marrow infiltration (23%), and subcutaneous nodules (9%) were observed upon evaluation. Management involved supportive treatment (22%), chemotherapy only (41%), chemotherapy and tumor excision (28%). Ventral hernia was created in two children (9%) due to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Four children died (4/22; 18%) due to ACS (n = 2) and refractory coagulopathy (n = 2). There were no recurrences and all survivors were disease-free. The 5-y OS was 81.8% with a median follow-up duration of 31 mo (range 9 mo-22 y). Age < 2 mo (p = 0.002), respiratory distress at presentation (p < 0.001), and chemotherapy nonresponsiveness (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with mortality. All three factors were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion Children with NB 4S have a favorable outcome with 5-y OS of 81.8%. Age < 2 mo, respiratory distress at presentation, and chemotherapy nonresponsiveness are independent predictors of a poor outcome.

AB  - This systematic review aims to determine the association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and periodontal disease. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed to conduct a literature search on five electronic databases till January 2022. Systemically healthy individuals consuming SSBs and presenting periodontal disease (gingivitis/periodontitis) were included. The modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Evaluation criteria were respectively used to assess the risk of bias and the evidence's quality. Of the 1303 eligible records identified in the initial search, ten studies (nine cross-sectional and one case-control) were selected for the final review. Among the included articles, five reported SSBs intake in the form of carbonated soft drinks, two as sugary drinks, two as soft drinks, and one as coffee with added sugar. Four studies reported gingivitis as an outcome, while the remaining six studies reported periodontitis using validated indices. The included studies were of medium to high quality. Consumption of SSBs may increase gingival bleeding, thereby gingivitis and the risk of periodontitis. Intake of added sugars like SSBs should be considered as a potential factor during gingival/periodontal risk assessment. Further studies are warranted to establish additional evidence of association.

AB  - Background Different studies performed on nasal subunit reconstruction by either the nasolabial flap or the paramedian forehead flap have reported contradictory outcomes and complications, claiming one flap or the other as superior. This inconsistency has led to a gap in existing literature regarding the preferable flap for nasal reconstruction. Our aim was to statistically evaluate and compare these two flaps for nasal reconstruction, in terms of subunit preference, complications, and outcomes, using data from previous studies.
   Methods This systematic review is reported using PRISMA protocol and was registered with the International prospective register of systematic reviews. The literature search was done using "paramedian forehead flap", "nasolabial flap", "melolabial flap", "nasal reconstruction". Data regarding demography of study and population, subunit reconstructed, complications, and aesthetic outcomes were extracted. Meta-analysis was performed using MetaXL and summary of findings using GRADEpro GDT.
   Results Thirty-eight studies were included, and data from 2036 followed-up patients were extracted for the review. Meta-analysis was done on data from nine studies. Difference in alar reconstruction by forehead versus nasolabial flap is statistically significant [pooled odds ratio (OR) 0.3; 95% CI 0.01, 0.92; p = 0.72; I-2 = 0%, n = 6 studies], while for dorsum and columella reconstruction the difference is not statistically significant. Risk of alar notching is marginally more in forehead flap, however difference in incidence of partial/complete flap necrosis, alar notching and hematoma/bleeding among the flaps is not statistically significant.
   Conclusion Alar reconstruction is preferred by nasolabial flap. Complications are similar in both groups. Comparison of aesthetic outcome needs further exploration.

AB  - Background Coronavirus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (CARDS) has limited effective therapy to date. NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 contributes to cytokine storm.
   Methods This randomised, multinational study enrolled hospitalised patients (18-80 years) with COVID-19-associated pneumonia and impaired respiratory function. Eligible patients were randomised (1:1) via Interactive Response Technology to DFV890 + standard-of-care (SoC) or SoC alone for 14 days. Primary endpoint was APACHE II score at Day 14 or on day-of-discharge (whichever-came-first) with worst-case imputation for death. Other key assessments included clinical status, CRP levels, SARS-CoV-2 detection, other inflammatory markers, in-hospital outcomes, and safety.
   Findings Between May 27, 2020 and December 24, 2020, 143 patients (31 clinical sites, 12 countries) were randomly assigned to DFV890+ SoC (n = 7 1) or SoC alone (n = 7 2) . Primary endpoint to establish clinical efficacy of DFV890 vs. SoC, based on combined APACHE II score, was not met; LSM (SE), 8.7 (1.06) vs. 8.6 (1.05); p = 0.467. More patients treated with DFV890 vs. SoC showed >= 1-level improvement in clinical status (84.3% vs. 73.6% at Day 14), earlier clearance of SARS-CoV-2 (76.4% vs. 57.4% at Day 7), and mechanical ventilation-free survival (85.7% vs. 80.6% through Day 28), and there were fewer fatal events in DFV890 group (8.6% vs. 11.1% through Day 28). DFV890 was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals.
   Interpretation DFV890 did not meet statistical significance for superiority vs. SoC in primary endpoint of combined APACHE II score at Day 14. However, early SARS-CoV-2 clearance, improved clinical status and in-hospital outcomes, and fewer fatal events occurred with DFV890 vs. SoC, and it may be considered as a protective therapy for CARDS.

AB  - BackgroundThe cellular and molecular mechanisms of the events that help spermatozoa acquire their fertilizing capability during capacitation and acrosome reaction are not completely understood.
   ObjectiveThis study was performed with a postulation that the identification of sperm proteins and their changes during in vitro capacitation and acrosome reaction will unravel unknown molecular aspects of fertilization that impact male fertility.
   Materials and methodsSpermatozoa collected from sequential conditions, that is, separation of ejaculated spermatozoa by Percoll gradient centrifugation, in vitro capacitation, and acrosome reaction were processed for tandem mass spectrometric analysis, followed by protein identification, label-free quantitation, and statistical analysis.
   Results and discussionCollectively, a total of 1088 sperm proteins were identified. In comparison to ejaculated spermatozoa, 44 and 141 proteins were differentially expressed in capacitated and acrosome reacted spermatozoa, respectively. A large number of proteins were found downregulated, including clusterin, pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component, semenogelin-1 and 2, heat shock protein 90, beta-microseminoprotein, and keratin. It was expected as sperm-membrane-associated proteins are removed during capacitation. There were significant proteomic alterations in asthenozoospermia compared to normozoospermia; however, variation was more noticeable among proteins of acrosome reacted spermatozoa and those released during the acrosome reaction. The processes enriched among downregulated proteins in asthenozoospermia included acrosome assembly, binding of spermatozoa to zona pellucida, nucleosome assembly, flagellated sperm motility, protein folding, oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, chromatin silencing, gluconeogenesis, glycolytic process, and glycolysis.
   ConclusionThe dynamic information generated about proteomic alterations in spermatozoa during capacitation and acrosome reaction and their variability in asthenozoospermia will contribute not only to enhancing our understanding of processes that prepare spermatozoa to acquire fertilization capability but also help in deciphering novel factors of male infertility.

AB  - Gastrointestinal endoscopies are often done in the prone position and anesthesiologists are needed to provide sedation. Airway access is limited in the prone position and may make timely airway management difficult in case of airway obstruction during sedation. Specialized laryngeal mask airway devices customized for endoscopy procedures like LMA(R) Gastro (TM) can be inserted in the prone position and may help anesthesiologists tide over such crisis situations while simultaneously allowing the endoscopy procedures through the dedicated conduit available for inserting the endoscopes. We have described one such case managed successfully by inserting LMA (R) Gastro (TM) in the prone position.

AB  - Background Non-invasive biomarkers for early chemotherapeutic response in Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) are useful for optimizing existing treatment protocol. Purpose To assess the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early evaluation of chemotherapeutic response in ESFT. Material and Methods A total of 28 patients (mean age = 17.2 +/- 5.6 years) with biopsy proven ESFT were analyzed prospectively. Patients underwent MRI acquisition on a 1.5-T scanner at three time points: before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (baseline), after first cycle chemotherapy (early time point), and after completion of chemotherapy (last time point). RECIST 1.1 criteria was used to evaluate the response to chemotherapy and patients were categorized as responders (complete and partial response) and non-responders (stable and progressive disease). Tumor diameter, absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and normalized ADC (nADC) values in the tumor were measured. Baseline parameters and relative percentage change of parameters after first cycle chemotherapy were assessed for early detection of chemotherapy response. Results The responder:non-responder ratio was 21:7. At baseline, ADC ([0.864 +/- 0.266 vs. 0.977 +/- 0.246]) x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; P = 0.205) and nADC ([0.740 +/- 0.254 vs. 0.925 +/- 0.262] x 10(-3)mm(2)/s; P = 0.033) among responders was lower than the non-responders and predicted response to chemotherapy with AUCs of 0.6 and 0.735, respectively. At the early time point, tumor diameter (27% +/- 14% vs. 4.6% +/- 10%; P = 0.002) showed a higher reduction and ADC (75% +/- 44% vs. 52% +/- 72%; P = 0.039) and nADC (81% +/- 44% vs. 48% +/- 67%; P = 0.008) showed a higher increase in mean values among responders than the non-responders and identified chemotherapy response with AUC of 0.890, 0.723, and 0.756, respectively. Conclusion Baseline nADC and its change after the first cycle of chemotherapy can be used as non-invasive surrogate markers of early chemotherapeutic response in patients with ESFT.

AB  - Background Sequential rituximab (RTX) administration has emerged as an important strategy to sustain remission of disease in patients with difficult-to-treat nephrotic syndrome. Methods We report the efficacy and safety of sequential therapy with two or more courses of intravenous RTX in 250 patients with difficult-to-treat steroid dependence (n = 127) and calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-dependent or CNI-refractory steroid resistance (n = 123) managed at one center during 2015-2021. Subsets of patients were cross-sectionally tested for hypogammaglobulinemia, seroprotection against and hyporesponsiveness to vaccines for hepatitis B and tetanus, BK/JC viruria and human antichimeric antibodies (HACAs). Results Sequential RTX therapy, initiated at a median of 10 years [interquartile range (IQR) 7.3-14.4], was administered for 1.8 courses/person-year [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.0] over 2.0 years (95% CI 1.2-3.0). Therapy was associated with postponement of relapses by a median of 3 years in patients with steroid-sensitive disease and 2 years in those with steroid resistance. Relapses were reduced by a mean of 2.0 relapses/person-year (95% CI 1.8-2.2), enabling a reduction in prednisolone dose to 0.04 mg/kg/day (95% CI 0.01-0.11) and withdrawal of additional immunosuppression in 154 (62%) patients. RTX-associated adverse events, occurring at 0.20 events/person-year (95% CI 0.17-0.23), were chiefly comprised of infusion reactions (n = 108) and infections (n = 46); serious adverse events were observed in 10.8% patients, at 0.03 events/person-year (95% CI 0.02-0.05). Hypogammaglobulinemia was observed in 35% of 177 patients and was moderate to severe in 8.5% of cases. Rates of seroprotection at baseline and response following vaccination were lower for hepatitis B [1.9% and 29.4% (n = 52)] than tetanus [65.5% and 34.5% (n = 58)]. BK/JC viruria, without viremia, was observed in 7.3% of 109 cases. A total of 19 of 107 patients (17.8%) had HACAs, which were associated with B cell nondepletion and serum sickness. Age at therapy of <9-10 years was associated with a risk of early relapse, treatment failure and hypogammaglobulinemia following RTX therapy. Conclusions Sequential therapy with RTX effectively reduces relapses in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid- and/or CNI-dependent or CNI-refractory nephrotic syndrome. Therapy is associated with high rates of hypogammaglobulinemia and infusion reactions.

AB  - Objective To assess cardiorespiratory fitness in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity using the Kasch pulse recovery (KPR) test, and its correlation with severity of obesity, insulin resistance, and blood pressure (BP). Methods This is a retrospective analysis of baseline data from a study evaluating the efficacy of yoga for reduction of body mass index (BMI) in children aged 8-15 y with overweight/obesity. KPR three-minute step test was done. Children were classified into cardiorespiratory fitness categories based on the post-KPR heart rate (HR); the maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) was calculated, and the correlation analysis was done. Results One hundred fifty-five children with mean age of 11.6 +/- 1.8 y and mean BMI of 26.2 +/- 4.1 kg/m(2) were included. Mean post-KPR-HR and calculated VO2 max were 119 +/- 14 per minute and 48.7 +/- 5.6 mL/kg/min, respectively. In children < 13 y, cardiorespiratory fitness was excellent or very good in 28%, good or sufficient in 58%, and poor or very poor in 14%. BMI, waist circumference (WC), resting HR, systolic BP, and homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were higher among those with poor/very poor fitness, with WC z score being statistically significant (p = 0.015). Post-KPR-HR showed positive correlation with BMI z score (r = 0.16, p = 0.044), WC z score (r = 0.21, p = 0.011), and HOMA-IR (r = 0.22, p = 0.012). Conclusion In children with overweight/obesity, 14% had poor cardiorespiratory fitness. Post-KPR-HR and calculated VO2 max had good correlation with measures of obesity and HOMA-IR. Further studies evaluating cardiorespiratory fitness and normative data of VO2 max for Indian children are warranted.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in bacteria poses major challenges in selection of the therapeutic regime for managing the infectious disease. There is currently an upsurge in the appearance of multiple drug resistance in bacterial pathogens and a decline in the discovery of novel antibiotics. DNA gyrase is an attractive target used for antibiotic discovery due to its vital role in bacterial DNA replication and segregation in addition to its absence in mammalian organisms. Despite the presence of successful antibiotics targeting this enzyme, there is a need to bypass the resistance against this validated drug target. Hence, drug development in DNA gyrase is a highly active research area. In addition to the conventional binding sites for the novobiocin and fluoroquinolone antibiotics, several novel sites are being exploited for drug discovery. The binding sites for novel bacterial type II topoisomerase inhibitor (NBTI), simocyclinone, YacG, Thiophene and CcdB are structurally and biochemically validated active sites, which inhibit the supercoiling activity of topoisomerases. The novel chemical moieties with varied scaffolds have been identified to target DNA gyrase. Amongst them, the NBTI constitutes the most advanced DNA gyrase inhibitor which are in phase III trial of drug development. The present review aims to classify the novel binding sites other than the conventional novobiocin and quinolone binding pocket to bypass the resistance due to mutations in the DNA gyrase enzyme. These sites can be exploited for the identification of new scaffolds for the development of novel antibacterial compounds.

AB  - Introduction Almost 80% of epithelial ovarian cancer present in advanced stage at diagnosis and despite excellent response to surgery and chemotherapy, more than 70% cancers recur. Subsequent therapies become decreasingly effective in controlling the disease, with each successful therapy being effective for a shorter duration. As a result, there is a need for novel therapeutic strategies to effectively treat recurrence. Areas covered In this extensive literature review of high-quality articles, we have focused on surveillance strategy to detect recurrence early, classification of recurrence based on timeline, role of surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted agents such as anti-angiogenetic drugs, PARP inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors in platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant disease, respectively. Expert opinion Recurrent ovarian cancers (ROC) are represented by a heterogenous group of patient population in terms of platinum-free interval (PFI), histology, molecular characteristics and immune recognition. In today's era of precision medicine, chemotherapy should be combined with appropriate targeted agent in a multipronged approach to prolong survival and provide better quality of life outcomes by minimizing side effects.

AB  - The appearance of red lesions on the retina can be an early indicator of diabetic retinopathy (DR, hereafter). Their timely detection can help mitigate the effects of DR and eventually save the vision. This paper proposes a DR-specific red lesion extraction using color fundus images. In the pre-processing stage, we suggest the removal of retinal blood vessels to enhance the red abnormalities and eventually minimize the false positives. To improve feature learning, we propose an integration of deep and handcrafted features. Here, we propose a set of five lesion-specific, handcrafted features and concatenate them with the U-net-based deep features. Moreover, to enhance the efficacy of the training process, we propose a novel 'characteristic patch-based training' to target the red lesions explicitly. In the paper, we also perform an ablation study to prove the significance of the handcrafted features and the characteristic training in improving the baseline model's performance. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm has out-performed the other state-of-the-art algorithms on IDRiD and DDR datasets by approximately 7% and 10%, respectively, in terms of area under the precision-recall curve.

AB  - Background PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors prolong survival in treatment-naive, locally advanced, and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with positive PD-L1 expression (> 1%/ > 50%). Recent evidence has suggested that tumors with < 1% PD-L1 expression may also be predictive of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibiting agents. Methods Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors that have assessed tumors with < 1% PD-L1 expression (negative PD-L1 expression). PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors-chemotherapy combinations (PC) were compared with histology-selected chemotherapy with respect to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results Twelve RCTs comprising 5410 participants (PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors-chemotherapy: 3051; chemotherapy: 2359) met the inclusion criteria. Tumors with PD-L1 expression < 1% were evident in 38.9% of the pooled study population. A significant OS [hazard ratio (HR) 0.71 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.80, p < 0.00001] and PFS [HR 0.65 95% CI 0.58-0.72, p < 0.00001] benefit of PC was evident in tumors with negative PD-L1 expression. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors-chemotherapy combinations were more likely to achieve an objective response than chemotherapy [odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.46-2.38, p < 0.00001]. Histologic subtypes and diagnostic assays did not modify the OS and PFS treatment effects for PC compared to chemotherapy. Conclusion Tumors harboring < 1% PD-L1 expression are likely to benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-chemotherapy regimens in advanced NSCLC.

AB  - Purpose Penetrating abdominal trauma was traditionally managed by mandatory exploration, which led to high rates of non-therapeutic surgery and prolonged hospital stay. Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) is a less-invasive alternative; however, it requires general anaesthesia and carries a potential risk of iatrogenic injuries. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)-guided selective non-operative management (SNOM) may avoid surgery altogether, but there is apprehension of missed injury. Randomised trials comparing these two modalities are lacking. This study is aimed at comparing outcomes of these two management approaches. Methods Hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating trauma to anterior abdominal wall were randomised in 1:1 ratio to DL or CECT-based management. Primary outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were rate of non-therapeutic surgery, complications, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Results There were 52 patients in DL group and 54 patients in CECT group. Mean LOS was comparable (3 vs 3.5 days; p = 0.423). Rate of non-therapeutic surgery was significantly lower in CECT group (65.4 vs 17.4%, p = 0.0001). Rate of complications and length of ICU stay were similar. Selective non-operative management based on CECT findings was successful in 93.8% of patients; 2 patients had delayed surgery. Conclusion In patients with penetrating trauma to anterior abdominal wall, DL and CECT-based management led to comparable hospital stay. Significant reduction in non-therapeutic surgery could be achieved using a CECT-based approach.

AB  - Measuring shoe-floor friction is critical for assessing the safety of footwear products. Portable devices for measuring coefficient of friction (COF) are needed. This study introduces such a device and evaluates its ability to predict human slip events across shoe designs. A portable device (18 kg) was utilized to measure 66 unique shoe-floor-fluid coefficients of friction (COF). Consistent with the shoes, flooring, and fluid contaminants from the COF tests, participants (n = 66) were unexpectedly exposed to the fluid while walking. Slip predictions were made based on a separate training data set. Slip predictions were made prospectively and using logistic regression analyses. The slip predictions were valid (p < 0.001), 91% sensitive, and 64% specific. The logistic regression fit also revealed that the COF values predicted slip outcomes (p = 0.006). This device is expected to expand the capacity of researchers, product developers, forensic engineers, and safety professionals to prevent slips and enhance human safety.

AB  - Background Orbital exenteration comes with psychological trauma of disfigurement of face. The study aimed to evaluate the quality of life, anxiety and depression in patients undergoing orbital exenteration, before and after the procedure; and also compared the same with patients previously rehabilitated by spectacle-mounted prosthesis after exenteration. Methods It was a prospective cohort study. Group I included patients who were planned to undergo orbital exenteration, and group II were those already using spectacle-mounted prosthesis post orbital exenteration for at least 3 months. Level of depression was assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-9(PHQ-9), anxiety using Generalised Anxiety and Depression scale-7(GAD-7), and quality of life was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy- General (FACT-G) score. Results A total of 19 patients were recruited in group I and 10 patients in group II. The baseline demographic factors were comparable. The scores for PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were significantly higher at 3-month post-exenteration follow-up, indicating significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression after orbital exenteration in group I. Both these scores were significantly lower in group II compared to group I (3 months follow-up), indicating lower levels of anxiety and depression after rehabilitation with prosthesis. The FACT-G and its subscores were all significantly higher in group II patients compared to post-operative scores of group I patients, indicating higher overall quality of life after rehabilitation with prosthesis. Conclusions Patients undergoing exenteration have a significant level of anxiety and depression, and lower quality of life that worsens after orbital exenteration.

AB  - Background Juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma is described as a primary open-angle glaucoma, with an age of onset before 40 years. These patients have a higher prevalence of myopia. Purpose We describe the phenotype of juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma in a patient with a rare variant in EFEMP1 gene, who was also detected to have Stickler syndrome(STL). Methods Whole exome sequencing (WES) was undertaken in 40 unrelated families where the proband had juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG). Results Out of these, eight were autosomal dominant, while the rest did not have any other affected first-degree relative. Out of the 8 autosomal dominant JOAG families, MYOC mutations were detected in 3(37.5%) and LTBP2 in 1(12.5%). One family (12.5%) had a rare EFEMP1 sequence variant in both affected father and daughter. The daughter also had high myopia and a pathogenic COL11A1 sequence variant that led to a coincidental diagnosis of STL in her. Conclusions This is a rare association of EFEMP1 and COL11A1 sequence variants in a JOAG patient with STL. The study also reiterates the association of JOAG with EFEMP1, which should be looked for, especially in families with autosomal dominant JOAG.

AB  - Visual impairment from corneal stromal disease affects millions worldwide. We describe a cell-free engineered corneal tissue, bioengineered porcine construct, double crosslinked (BPCDX) and a minimally invasive surgical method for its implantation. In a pilot feasibility study in India and Iran (clinicaltrials.gov no.NCT04653922), we implanted BPCDX in 20 advanced kera- toconus subjects to reshape the native corneal stroma without removing existing tissue or using sutures. During 24 months of follow-up, no adverse event was observed. We document improvements in corneal thickness (mean increase of 209 +/- 18 mu m in India, 285 +/- 99 um in Iran), maximum keratometry (mean decrease of 13.9 +/- 7.9 D in India and 11.2 +/- 8.9 D in Iran) and visual acuity (to a mean contact-lens-corrected acuity of 20/26 in India and spectacle-corrected acuity of 20/58 in Iran). Fourteen of 14 initially blind subjects had a final mean best-corrected vision (spectacle or contact lens) of 20/36 and restored tolerance to contact lens wear. This work demonstrates restoration of vision using an approach that is potentially equally effective, safer, simpler and more broadly available than donor cornea transplantation.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, the causing agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), first broke out in Wuhan and rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in a global health emergency. The lack of specific drugs against the coronavirus has made its spread challenging to control. The main protease (M-pro) is a key enzyme of SARS-CoV-2 used as a key target in drug discovery against the coronavirus. Medicines derived from plant phytoconstituents have been widely exploited to treat various diseases. The present study has evaluated the potential of Illicium verum (star anise) phytoconstituents against M-pro by implementing a computational approach. We performed molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation study with a set of 60 compounds to identify their potential to inhibit the main protease (M-pro) of SARS-CoV-2. DFT study and post dynamics free energy calculations were also performed to strengthen the findings. The identified four compounds by docking study exhibited the highest potential compared to other selected phytoconstituents. Further, density functional theory (DFT) calculation, molecular dynamics simulation and post dynamics MM-GBSA energy calculation predicted Verimol-G as a potential compound, which formed stable interactions through the catalytic dyad residues. The HOMO orbital energy (-0.250038) from DFT and the post dynamics binding free energy calculation (-73.33 Kcal/mol) correlate, suggesting Verimol-G is the best inhibitor compared to the other phytoconstituents. This compound also complies with the ADME properties of drug likeliness. Thus, based on a computational study, we suggest that Verimol G may be developed as a potential inhibitor against the main protease to combat COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Background: Neuroendocrine differentiation in the prostate gland ranges from clinically insignificant neuroendocrine differentiation detected with markers in an otherwise conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma to a lethal high-grade small/large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The concept of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic adenocarcinoma has gained considerable importance due to its prognostic and therapeutic ramifications and pathologists play a pivotal role in its recognition. However, its awareness, reporting, and resource utilization practice patterns among pathologists are largely unknown. Methods: Representative examples of different spectrums of neuroendocrine differentiation along with a detailed questionnaire were shared among 39 urologic pathologists using the survey monkey software. Participants were specifically questioned about the use and awareness of the 2016 WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, understanding of the clinical significance of each entity, and use of different immunohistochemical (IHC) markers. De-identified respondent data were analyzed. Results: A vast majority (90%) of the participants utilize IHC markers to confirm the diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. A majority (87%) of the respondents were in agreement regarding the utilization of type of IHC markers for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma for which 85% of the pathologists agreed that determination of the site of origin of a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma is not critical, as these are treated similarly. In the setting of mixed carcinomas, 62% of respondents indicated that they provide quantification and grading of the acinar component. There were varied responses regarding the prognostic implication of focal neuroendocrine cells in an otherwise conventional acinar adenocarcinoma and for Paneth cell-like differentiation. The classification of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was highly varied, with only 38% agreement in the illustrated case. Finally, despite the recommendation not to perform neuroendocrine markers in the absence of morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation, 62% would routinely utilize IHC in the work-up of a Gleason score 5 + 5 = 10 acinar adenocarcinoma and its differentiation from high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. Conclusion: There is a disparity in the practice utilization patterns among the urologic pathologists with regard to diagnosing high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma and in understanding the clinical significance of focal neuroendocrine cells in an otherwise conventional acinar adenocarcinoma and Paneth cell-like neuroendocrine differentiation. There seems to have a trend towards overutilization of IHC to determine neuroendocrine differentiation in the absence of neuroendocrine features on morphology. The survey results suggest a need for further refinement and development of standardized guidelines for the classification and reporting of neuroendocrine differentiation in the prostate gland.

AB  - Purpose: To compare a smartphone-based dichoptic video game with occlusion therapy in children with anisometropic amblyopia.
   Methods: In this prospective, randomized, interventional study, 55 children aged 5 to 15 years with anisometropic amblyopia were randomized into two groups: the video game group (n = 27) played a dichoptic video game with adjusted contrast for 2 hours/day and the patching group (n = 28) received occlusion therapy of the non-amblyopic eye for 6 hours/day. All patients were evaluated for best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), near vision, contrast sensitivity, and near and distance stereoacuity at baseline and 1, 2, and 3 months.
   Results: Mean distance BCVA improved from 0.74 +/- 0.19 and 0.70 +/- 0.18 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline to 0.53 +/- 0.19 and 0.49 +/- 0.19 logMAR, respectively, at 3 months (P < .001 for both). Mean near vision was 0.82 +/- 0.19 and 0.81 +/- 0.17 logMAR in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline and improved to 0.60 +/- 0.16 and 0.63 +/- 0.17 logMAR at 3 months (P <.001 for both). There was no significant difference in distance and near vision between the two groups at baseline and final follow-up visit. Contrast sensitivity was 1.41 +/- 0.20 and 1.38 +/- 0.20 in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline and 1.74 +/- 0.18 and 1.61 +/- 0.21 at 3 months (P <.001 for both). At the final follow-up visit, contrast sensitivity was significantly better in the video game group compared to the patching group (P = .01). Near stereoacuity significantly improved only in the video game group (P = .006), whereas distance stereoacuity did not improve in either group.
   Conclusions: Dichoptic video game therapy showed better results in terms of improvement in contrast sensitivity and near stereoacuity and similar outcomes for distance and near vision when compared to patching in children with anisometropic amblyopia. However, the availability of interesting games is essential to maintain children's interest.

KW  - Enterolith
AB  - Chlorinated polyvinyl chloride (CPVC) solvent cement ingestion causing small bowel obstruction has not been reported previously. We hereby report a case of a gentleman in his 20s who had intentionally consumed CPVC solvent cement and presented with features of small bowel obstruction 8 months after consumption. Laparotomy was performed where intraoperatively a perforation was noted in the ileum, and an enterolith was found at around 30 cm from the ileocecal junction. Resection of the perforated ileal segment with milking of enterolith and ileoileal anastomosis was performed. Delayed presentation possesses diagnostic challenges in such cases. Attention to obtaining a clinical history is key to diagnosis. Timely intervention with laparotomy is necessary in such cases as conservative management has high failure rates.

AB  - Segmentation of retinal blood vessels is crucial in the automated diagnosis of many retinal and cardiovascular diseases. The process of precise vessel extraction using fundus images is still a challenge due to spatially varying vessel-width and non-homogeneous retinal backgrounds. This work targets the challenges mentioned above with an adaptive multi-scale decomposition of the input image and a novel characteristic patch-based deep network training. In order to enhance vessels of different widths, we use the observed field of view of the input image to estimate the most significant scales for Gabor decomposition. Enhanced vessel maps corresponding to real, imaginary, and absolute coefficients at the estimated scales are linearly combined using a trainable 1 x 1 convolutional layer of U-net. Moreover, the 'characteristic patch-based training' uses 'random' and 'specific' patches to learn vessels in non-homogeneous retinal backgrounds. The proposed algorithm minimizes false negatives and extracts promising vessel maps in various challenging regions of the retina. The significant improvement in accuracy, sensitivity and AUC compared to other state-of-the-art values proves the proposed method's outstanding performance.

AB  - Metallic biomaterials, though certified biocompatible, does not hold good for a long period given the ionic leaching. Biomaterial surface alterations are therefore crucial for addressing the complexity of the biological system and increasing bioimplant function. Cell proliferation and regeneration on implants have taken a leap with the advancement of biomaterials, tissue engineering and surface modification techniques. Further, materials surface functionalization hastens the development and design of next-generation biomaterials and medical devices. This article focuses on the cutting-edge methods for altering the surface of implants to improve their overall performance and longevity with an emphasis on two significant metallic biomaterials viz. cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) and duplex stainless steel (DSS). Different surface modification approaches employed to enhance the significant properties such as biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and wear performances of Co-Cr and DSS alloys are reviewed. Furthermore, a futuristic surface modification technique is suggested that has the potential for investigating challenges like bioimplant manufacturing and precise sculpting is proposed.

AB  - Introduction Palate development involves a genetic regulation through a complex molecular mechanism that may be disrupted by environmental factors, resulting in impaired fusion and cleft palate formation. An encounter with a case of cleft palate due to dorsal tongue hamartoma prompted us to perform this systematic review. Objective To review the clinical profile and management approach for a case with cleft palate and tongue hamartoma. Design A systematic literature search was conducted using keywords related to cleft palate and tongue hamartoma in PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Scielo databases through December 2021, with no time or language restrictions. Patients, Participants Studies reporting patients with cleft palate and tongue hamartoma were included. Main outcome measure(s) Information related to clinical profile, diagnostic tests, histopathology, management, and outcomes were extracted. Results Fourteen relevant publications were identified with 16 cases reported so far. Among them, thirteen patients were females (81.25%), and 3 were males (18.75%). The age of presentation varied from birth to 19 years. Oral-facial-digital syndrome (type II) was the most commonly associated syndrome. Conclusion Congenital tongue hamartoma with cleft palate is a rare presentation, which can present as an isolated entity or part of a syndrome. Genetic evaluation is warranted, particularly for multiple hamartomatous lesions. The preferred treatment is immediate excision of hamartoma while following a standard timeline for palatoplasty.

AB  - Introduction In resource-limited settings, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) often goes undiagnosed as polysomnography (PSG) is expensive, time-consuming, and not readily available. Imaging studies of upper airway have been tried as alternatives to PSG to screen for OSA. However, racial differences in upper airway anatomy preclude generalizability of such studies. We sought to test the hypothesis that ultrasonography (USG), an inexpensive, readily available tool to study soft tissue structures of the upper airway, would have predictive value for OSA in South Asian people. Methods Adult patients with sleep-related complaints suspicious for OSA were taken for overnight PSG. After the PSG, consecutive patients with and without OSA were studied with submental ultrasonography to measure tongue base thickness (TBT) and lateral pharyngeal wall thickness (LPWT). Results Among 50 patients with OSA and 25 controls, mean age was 43.9 +/- 11.4 years, and 39 were men. Patients with OSA had higher TBT (6.77 +/- 0.63 cm vs 6.34 +/- 0.54 cm, P value = 0.004) and higher LPWT (2.47 +/- 0.60 cm vs 2.12 +/- 0.26 cm, P value = 0.006) compared to patients without OSA. On multivariate analysis, TBT, LPWT, and neck circumference were identified as independent factors associated with OSA. These variables could identify patients with severe OSA with a sensitivity of 72% and a specificity of 76%. Conclusion Patients with OSA have higher tongue base thickness and lateral pharyngeal wall thickness proportionate to the severity of the disease, independent of BMI and neck circumference. These findings suggest that sub-mental ultrasonography may be useful to identify patients with severe OSA in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Lay Summary This systematic review of Crohn's disease (CD) case definitions identified that complex case definitions such as >= 1 diagnosis code + >= 1 prescription had desirable diagnostic accuracy properties.
   Background We sought to review Crohn's disease (CD) case definitions that use diagnosis, procedure, and medication claims. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase from inception through January 31, 2022, using terms related to CD, inflammatory bowel disease, administrative claims, or validity. Each article was scrutinized by 2 authors independently screening and abstracting data. Collected data included participant characteristics, case definition characteristics, and case definition validity. When diagnostic accuracy was provided for multiple case definitions, we extracted the case definition selected by the authors. All diagnostic accuracy characteristics were captured. Results We identified 30 studies that evaluated a case definition using claims data to identify CD patients. The most common case definition included counts of diagnosis codes (57%) followed by a combination of diagnosis codes and medications (20%). All but 1 study validated the case definition with a medical chart review. In 2 studies, the patient's primary care provider completed a survey to confirm disease status. The positive predictive value of the case definitions ranged from 18% (>= 1 code at a single U.S. health plan) to 100% (>= 1 code plus a relevant prescription at a U.S. hospital). More complex case definitions (eg, >= 1 code + prescription or >= 2 codes) had lower variability in positive predictive value (>= 80%) and specificity (>= 85%) than the >= 1 code requirement. Conclusions Health services researchers should validate case definitions in their research cohorts. When such validation cannot be performed, we recommend using a more complex case definition. Studies without a validated CD case definition should use sensitivity analyses to confirm the robustness of their results.

AB  - Cyclical mastalgia of moderate to severe degree requires systemic drug therapy. Tamoxifen is the drug of choice worldwide. A novel molecule, centchroman/Ormeloxifene, developed in India, was found to be equally effective in previous studies. However, its optimal dose regimen is uncertain. We conducted three-arm randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness in relieving breast pain. Group 1 received tamoxifen 10 mg daily, and groups 2 and 3 received centchroman 30 mg twice and 30 mg thrice a week, respectively, for 3 months with a follow-up of 3 more months. Breast pain score, nodularity score, sonographic evaluation of the breasts and ovaries, quality of life scores, and adverse events were recorded. The number of patients enrolled was 32, 31, and 30 in group 1, group 2, and group 3, respectively. All three groups had significant improvement in breast pain scores [group 1 (5 -> 2), group 2 (5 -> 2), group 3 (6 -> 2), p < 0.001)], nodularity scores [group1 (1 -> 0), group 2 (1 -> 0), group 3 (1 -> 0), p < 0.001)] and in the quality of life scores over time. However, no significant differences were observed in-between the groups. Transient ovarian cyst formation and menstrual irregularities were more common with a higher dose of centchroman. Centchroman in the dosages of 30 mg twice or thrice a week is as effective as a daily dose of tamoxifen 10 mg in relieving pain, nodularity, and improving quality of life scores. The dose of centchroman 30 mg twice a week for 12 weeks has the least adverse effects and should be accepted as the optimal dosage regimen. There is a need of further study with a greater number of participants and longer follow-up.

AB  - The breast pain or mastalgia is the commonest presenting symptom to a breast clinic. It is estimated that about 60 to 70% of all patients visiting breast clinic suffer from mastalgia. In majority of women, mastalgia is a manifestation of "aberration in normal development and involution" (ANDI). It is considered to arise from disturbed hormonal interplay between hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries, and the ductolobular tissue of the breast. The present guide has been prepared by a group of experts in the field who are members of Asian Society of Mastology (ASOMA) and who represent the practice in USA (I.J.), Great Britain (A.G.), and Asia ( S.K., A.D. C.M. A.S., R.A.)The proposed management algorithm should serve all women across different continents.

AB  - The fibroadenoma is considered as a manifestation of aberration in normal development and involution (ANDI); however, its exact etiopathogenesis is poorly understood. We investigated the role of oestrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in Fibroadenoma, to assess the ER and PR expression in epithelium and stroma of fibroadenoma and to co-relate this expression with the response to centchroman therapy. Fifty ladies with 65 fibroadenomas were investigated. Tissue from core biopsy of lesions was stained for estimating the ER and PR expression in the epithelial cells and in stroma. Patients received tablet centchroman 30 mg daily for 3 months, and the response to therapy was evaluated. A regression >= 30% in largest dimension of fibroadenoma on sonography was considered a significant response. The association between the response and ER and PR expression in epithelium and stroma was assessed. In the epithelium: ER positivity = 62.5%; PR positivity = 93.75%. In the stroma, the ER positivity = 2% and PR positivity = 8.3%. Response to centchroman was observed in 33/48 = 68.7%. Among the 33 responders, 23 lesions expressed ER in epithelium, while 10 lesions were ER negative. The relative risk of regression with "ER positivity of epithelium" as exposure = 1.38 (95% CI; 1.35-1.40, p = 0.12). Among responders, 30/33 exhibited PR positivity in epithelium. Expression of ER and PR in the epithelium of fibroadenoma is associated with significant regression in size with 3 months of therapy with centchroman.

AB  - Objective To measure changes in muscle thickness and echogenicity, reflecting muscle bulk and quality, respectively, of quadriceps femoris (QF), in critically ill children. Methods This study was done on 58 children aged 1-18 y requiring mechanical ventilation, admitted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital from January 2018 to June 2019. QF thickness was measured twice in longitudinal plane and twice in transverse plane, and an average of these four measurements was used. Muscle quality was assessed using ImageJ software to determine the mean echogenicity, and was calculated separately for vastus intermedius and rectus femoris. These observations were repeated on day 3 and day 7 of the ICU stay. Results The median muscle thickness of QF was 1.58 cm, and vastus intermedius and rectus femoris echogenicity was 35.5 and 25.88 units, respectively in the present cohort, with median age of 6 y. Only 36 of the 58 patients underwent day 7 ultrasonography, as the remainder were either extubated or died. There was no significant change in the muscle thickness over 7 d. Rectus femoris echogenicity increased significantly over 7 d by 16.1% (p = 0.03). Baseline vastus intermedius echogenicity was significantly higher in patients who subsequently died during the course of their illness (p = 0.026). Conclusion There was a significant change in rectus femoris echogenicity, but not in QF thickness. Echogenicity rather than muscle thickness may be a more sensitive marker for changes in muscle properties.

AB  - The p53 is the master regulator of the cell known for regulating a large array of cellular processes. Inactivation of p53 by missense mutations is one of the leading causes of cancer. Some of these mutations endow p53 with selective oncogenic functions to promote tumor progression. Due to the vast array of mutations found in p53, the experimental studies showing the role of different mutant p53 as an oncogene are also expanding. In this review, we discuss the oncogenic roles of different p53 mutants at the cellular level identified by multi-omics tools. We discuss some of the therapeutic studies to tackle p53 mutants and their downstream targets identified by omics. We also highlight the future prospective and scope of further studies of downstream p53 targets by omics.

AB  - Background Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan utilizes 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18-FDG), based on the principle of higher glycolytic activity and reduced glucose-6-phosphatase levels in cancer cells. This imaging modality is usually advised in the metastatic evaluation of stage III breast cancer patients. The correlation of maximum standard uptake values of primary lesion with different pathological and molecular markers has not been studied extensively. Methods Retrospective analysis of the data was performed from our prospectively maintained breast cancer database. All the patients who had undergone 18-FDG PET-CT scan at initial evaluation for staging between June 2017 and April 2020 were included in the study. One-way ANOVA test or Student's t-test as appropriate was performed to assess the difference of means in maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) of the primary lesion and axillary nodes with clinical stage, histological grade, molecular subtype. Bonferroni post hoc test was also applied. Results Out of 388 patients in the breast cancer database, 45 patients met inclusion criteria. There was a significant correlation of molecular subtype (p = 0.029) with SUVmax of the primary lesion. Higher primary SUVmax was associated with higher T stage (p = 0.01) and higher histological grade (p = 0.06). In each molecular subtype, there was an increase in mean SUVmax of the primary lesion with increasing histological grade and vice versa. Conclusions SUVmax of the primary lesion in breast cancer patients reflects tumor biology. Higher SUVmax can predict patients with triple-negative breast cancers and higher grades in primary tumors. However, further large-scale validatory studies are essential.

AB  - Objectives To prospectively assess the performance of pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) in diagnosing acute appendicitis in the children with lower abdominal pain and correlated with ultrasound findings; and to assess the impact of the PAS on clinical outcome and its efficacy in differentiating between complicated and uncomplicated appendicitis.
   Methods A prospective study was done which included cases of lower abdominal pain. Appendectomy was done for PAS >= 6, and diagnosis was confirmed on histopathology. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was created to assess the PAS performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasonography in diagnosing appendicitis were assessed, and analysis of agreement between ultrasonography and PAS score was done by kappa statistics.
   Results Of 260 cases with lower abdominal pain, 205 were suspected of having appendicitis. One hundred fifty-nine had PAS >= 6. There were 2/159 (1.26%) cases of negative appendectomies and 2/46 (4.34%) cases of missed appendicitis. The mean PAS was significantly higher in patients with appendicitis than in those without appendicitis. The area under the ROC curve was 0.9925. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of PAS were 98.74%, 95.65%, 95.7% and 95.65%, respectively. Complicated appendicitis had significantly more PAS, fever, and cough tenderness than uncomplicated appendicitis. The sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography were 86.79% and 17.39%, respectively. Agreement between ultrasonography-proven appendicitis and PAS-dependent appendicitis was weak.
   Conclusion PAS has high efficacy in diagnosing acute appendicitis. Clinical outcome was more favorable with the use of PAS. Ultrasonography should be used judiciously and in combination with clinical judgment.

AB  - Objective This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the global prevalence of gingival recession (GR) in the general population. Materials and Methods Population-based observational studies reporting the prevalence of GR and published from 1991 to 2021 were identified from five electronic databases and manual searches. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Checklist for Prevalence Studies. The pooled prevalence of GR was calculated by using a random-effect model. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to summarize the overall certainty of evidence. Results A total of 15 studies involving 37,460 participants were included. The overall pooled prevalence was 78.16% at the minimal reported threshold values and 84.92% at >= 1 mm "cut-off" with high heterogeneity among studies. A separate analysis for the buccal GR revealed a pooled prevalence of 75.42%. The risk of bias was found to be high for 10 and low for 5 studies. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed to be very low. Conclusion More than two-thirds of the population worldwide was found to be affected by GR. Studies with standard case definition and less heterogeneity are required to accurately estimate the prevalence of GR.

AB  - Objectives To examine the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of sustained low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) in hemodynamically unstable, critically ill children. Methods Critically ill patients, 1-18 y old with hemodynamic instability (>= 1 vasoactive drugs) and severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in a tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit were prospectively enrolled. Patients weighing <= 8 kg or with mean arterial pressure < 5(th) percentile despite > 3 vasoactive drugs, were excluded. Patients underwent SLED until hemodynamically stable and off vasoactive drugs, or lack of need for dialysis. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in whom the first session of SLED was initiated within 12 h of its indication and completed without premature (< 6 h) termination. Efficacy was estimated by ultrafiltration, urea reduction ratio (URR), and equilibrated Kt/V. Other outcomes included: changes in hemodynamic scores, circuit clotting, adverse events, and changes in indices on point-of-care ultrasonography and echocardiography. Results Between November 2018 and March 2020, 18 patients with median age 8.6 y and vasopressor dependency index of 83.2, underwent 41 sessions of SLED. In 16 patients, SLED was feasible within 12 h of indication. No session was terminated prematurely. Ultrafiltration achieved was 4.0 +/- 2.2 mL/kg/h, while URR was 57.7 +/- 16.2% and eKt/V 1.17 +/- 0.56. Hemodynamic scores did not change significantly. Asymptomatic hypokalemia was the chief adverse effect. Sessions were associated with a significant improvement in indices on ultrasound and left ventricular function. Fourteen patients died. Conclusions SLED is feasible, safe, and effective in enabling KRT in hemodynamically unstable children with severe AKI.

AB  - The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the devastating pandemic which has caused more than 5 million deaths across the world until today. Apart from causing acute respiratory illness and multiorgan dysfunction, there can be long-term multiorgan sequalae after recovery, which is termed 'long COVID-19' or 'post-acute COVID-19 syndrome'. Little is known about long-term gastrointestinal (GI) consequences, occurrence of post-infection functional gastrointestinal disorders and impact the virus may have on overall intestinal health. In this review, we put forth the various mechanisms which may lead to this entity and possible ways to diagnose and manage this disorder. Hence, making physicians aware of this spectrum of disease is of utmost importance in the present pandemic and this review will help clinicians understand and suspect the occurrence of functional GI disease post recovery from COVID-19 and manage it accordingly, avoiding unnecessary misconceptions and delay in treatment.

AB  - Background The initial management of patients with acute pancreatitis impacts both morbidity and mortality. Point-of-care decisions have been reported to differ from clinical guideline recommendations. Methods An online anonymous questionnaire was distributed through scientific associations and social media using REDCap. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify the characteristics of participants associated with compliance with the recommendations. Results A total of 1054 participants from 94 countries completed the questionnaire; median age (IQR) was 39 (32-47) years; 30.7% were women. Among the participants, 37% opted for nonmoderate flow of i.v. fluid, 31% for fluid type other than Ringer's lactate; 73.4% were in favor of nil per os to patients who could eat, 75.5% for other than enteral feeding to patients with oral intolerance; 15.5% used prophylactic antibiotic in patients with severe acute pancreatitis, 34.1% in necrotizing acute pancreatitis, and 27.4% in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome; 27.8% delayed cholecystectomy after biliary acute pancreatitis. Participants with publications in PubMed on acute pancreatitis showed better compliance (OR, 1.62; 95% CI: 1.15-2.32; P = .007) with recommendations of the clinical guidelines. Conclusions Feeding and nutrition require the greatest improvement efforts, but also the use of prophylactic antibiotics and timing of cholecystectomy should be improved.

AB  - The population of older individuals is increasing rapidly, but only a small fraction among them is able to experiences a healthy life. Due to lack of physical exercise and oxidative stress, aging leads to sarcopenia and finally end up with frailty. Sarcopenia is a component of the frailty and described as age related degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle mass, strength and quality. Though the loss of muscle strength and mass gradually seem inevitable during aging, it can be partially prevented or overcome by a deeper insight into the pathogenesis. Sirtuin protein leads to longevity across different organisms ranging from worms to mammals. Expression of sirtuin protein increases during physical exercise and thus strengthens muscle mass. Satellite cells leads to muscle repair in a SIRT1 dependent manner. In addition, SIRT1 improves insulin sensitivity and induces autophagy in the aged mice. The current paper discussed the putative role of sirtuins in sarcopenia and frailty. Moreover, it highlighted the pathways by which sirtuins can inhibit ROS production, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions and therefore confers a protective role against frailty and sarcopenia. The critical role of sirtuins in the sarcopenia and frailty pathogenesis can eventually fuel the development of novel interventions by targeting sirtuins.

AB  - Purpose This study compares the 8th edition staging of AJCC for prognosis of eyelid Sebaceous Gland Carcinoma (SGC) patients with respect to the 7th edition. Methods A retrospective study was undertaken over a period of 100 months. Ninety-nine histopathologically proven cases of eyelid SGC available for follow-up were recruited. Patients were staged by both the 7th and 8th editions of AJCC and followed up at six monthly intervals after surgery. Results Of the 99 eyelid SGC patients recruited, recurrence and orbital invasion developed in 22%, lymph node metastasis in 21% and 4% had distant metastasis and also died. High-risk features include tumour size>20 mm, orbital invasion, exenteration and staging by both the 7th and 8th editions of AJCC. Cox regression analysis revealed that staging by AJCC 8th edition was associated with greater risk for local recurrence (HR 3.01,95% CI-1.65-5.51%, p < 0.01) lymph node metastasis (HR 8.26, 95% CI 3.96-17.19%, p < 0.01) and disease-free survival (HR 4.61, 95% CI 2.81-7.54). The Kaplan-Meir survival curves of eyelid SGC patients by the 8th edition AJCC staging were also significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p < 0.01), tumour-related deaths (p < 0.01) and reduced disease-free survival (p = 0.07). The higher Harrell's values by the 8th edition signify better predictive value for lymph node metastasis and DFS (disease-free survival). The lower AIC values indicate a better monotonicity of gradients for lymph node metastasis, recurrence and DFS. Conclusion Staging by the 8th AJCC edition is, therefore, recommended for eyelid SGC as it gives a better perspective about disease outcome. The orbital extension was the single most important predictor of lymph node metastasis, recurrence and death.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the proportion of patients who received empirical treatment with antitubercular therapy (ATT) prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the first multicentric, prospective study on HL from India, and to assess its impact on extent of disease at diagnosis and outcomes. Methods Children < 18 y with biopsy proven HL were enrolled in InPOG-HL-15-01. Along with other clinical and epidemiological data, history of prior treatment with ATT was documented. All patients received treatment as per a risk-stratified, response-adapted strategy. Results Out of 396, 115 (29%) children had received ATT prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis of HL. This cohort presented with advanced-stage disease (p = 0.001) and B symptoms (p = 0.001) in a higher proportion of cases. Consequently, those children were more likely to receive 6 rather than 4 cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.001). They were more likely to have infradiaphragmatic involvement (p = 0.001). Overall survival and event-free survival were not different. Conclusion Empirical treatment with ATT in children presenting with lymphadenopathy continues to be practiced widely in India. The delay in diagnosis may contribute to children presenting with advanced-stage disease warranting more intensive treatment for successful outcomes.

AB  - Purpose To map healthcare utilized by subjects with chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma and perform a cost analysis to determine key drivers of healthcare expenditure. Methods A registry study of 656 adult subjects with chronic otitis media that underwent a middle ear surgery between 2014 and 2018. Healthcare contacts related to all publicly funded specialist ENT care, audiological care and primary care for a disease of the ear and mastoid process were extracted. The data are extracted from the Swedish National Patient Registry on subjects that reside in western Sweden. Results Subjects made 13,782 healthcare contacts at a total cost 61.1 million SEK (6.0 million EUR) between 2014 and 2018. The mean cost per subject was 93,075 SEK (9071 EUR) and ranged between 3971 SEK (387 EUR) and 468,711 SEK (45,683 EUR) per individual. In the most expensive quartile of subjects, mean cost was 192,353 SEK (18,747 EUR) over the 5-year period. These subjects made 3227 ENT contacts (roughly four each year) and 60% of total costs were associated with in-patient ENT care. Conclusion Patients with chronic otitis media are associated with high ENT resource utilization that does not diminish after surgical intervention and the disease places a long-term burden on healthcare systems. Significant costs are attributed to revision surgeries, indicating that these patients could be managed more effectively. In many such cases, reoperation cannot be avoided, especially due to recurrence of cholesteatoma. However, in some patients, when the indication for subsequent surgery is only hearing improvement, alternative options, such as hearing aids or implants, should also be considered. This is especially true in difficult cases, where revision ossiculoplasty is likely.

AB  - Objectives To determine sleep disorders and quality of life (QOL) in children with cerebral palsy (CP) and to find the association between them. Methods This cross-sectional study included children (4-12 y) with CP (n = 117) and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (n = 117). Pediatric Sleep Questionnaire (PSQ) was used to record sleep-related symptoms. Sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD) scale and sleep disturbance scale for children (SDSC) were used to evaluate sleep disorders. Cerebral palsy quality-of-life questionnaire for children (CPQOL-CHILD) was used to assess QOL. Results Sleep disorders by SRBD scale (score >= 0.33) were significantly more in CP (n = 7, 6%) than controls [(n = 0, 0%) (p value 0.014, OR 15.95)]. Using T score > 70 by SDSC scale, sleep disorders were seen in 7.7% (n = 9) CP children and 0% (n = 0) in controls (p value 0.04, OR 20.6). Using T score >= 51, 43.6% CP children and 17% controls had sleep disorders (p value 0.001, CI 2.1, 6.9). About 43.6% CP children had abnormal T score on at least one SDSC factor. Presence of epilepsy, motor disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and type of CP significantly correlated with sleep disorders. The overall SRBD scores and SDSC T scores of CP children were negatively correlated with QOL (r = -0.489, p < 0.001 and r = -0.445, p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion Sleep disorders are more common in CP which adversely affect QOL. Routine screening and appropriate treatment are suggested.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the risk factors associated with lifetime suicide attempts in bipolar disorder (BD) patients. Methodology 773 BD patients with a duration of illness of at least ten years, currently in clinical remission, were evaluated for suicidal attempts in their lifetime. Those with and without lifetime suicide attempt(s) were compared for various demographic and clinical risk factors. Results 242 (31.3%) patients had a history of at least one lifetime suicide attempt. Compared to those without lifetime suicide attempts, those with suicidal attempts were less educated, were more often females, spent more time in episodes, and had a significantly more number of total episodes (in the lifetime, first five years of illness, and per year of illness), had significantly more number of total depressive episodes (in the lifetime, first five years of illness, and per year of illness), spent more time in depressive episodes, had more severe depressive episodes, more often had depression as the first episode in the lifetime, spent more time in mania/hypomania/mixed episodes, had higher residual depressive and manic symptoms, more often had rapid cycling affective disorder pattern in the lifetime, use of cannabis in dependence pattern, had poorer insight into their illness and had a higher level of disability (especially in three out of the four domains of Indian disability evaluation assessment scale). Conclusions About one-third of the patients with BD have at least one-lifetime suicidal attempt, and those with suicide attempts usually have a poorer course of illness.

KW  - translational research
AB  - Air pollution has emerged as a serious threat to human health due to close association with spectrum of chronic ailments including cardiovascular disorders, respiratory diseases, nervous system dysfunctions, diabetes and cancer. Exposure to air-borne pollutants along with poor eating behaviours and inferior dietary quality irreversibly impacts epigenomic landscape, leading to aberrant transcriptional control of gene expression which is central to patho-physiology of non-communicable diseases. It is assumed that nutriepigenomic interventions such as vitamins can control such adverse effects through their immediate action on mitochondrial epigenomic-axis. Importantly, the exhaustive clinical utility of vitamins-interceded epigenetic synchronization is not well characterized. Therefore, improving the current limitations linked to stability and bioavailability issues in vitamin formulations is highly warranted. The present review not only sums up the available data on the role of vitamins as potential epigenetic modifiers but also discusses the importance of nano-engineered vitamins as potential epidrugs for dietary and pharmacological intervention to mitigate the long-term effects of air pollution toxicity.

The search was conducted electronically, using MeSH-terms, keywords, and Boolean-operators "AND" and "OR" in different combinations in multiple databases and Screening of titles and abstracts followed by the full-text evaluation was performed. The risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist.
   Results: Five studies were included in the qualitative synthesis and three of them showed a high ROB. When participants enquired about which other specialists worked in the cleft team in addition to the orthodontists, 84% of them reported it to be general-dentist in one study. Furthermore, the absence of an interdisciplinary team was reported in two studies from Africa. When enquired about the percentage of their practice devoted to the care of cleft lip and palate (CLP)-patients, a study reported that 52% (n= 88) orthodontists had treated <10 such patients in their entire career.
   Conclusion: The qualitative synthesis showed the lack of knowledge and experience among orthodontists and orthodontic residents regarding the management of CLP patients. Efforts must be made to design the validated questionnaires and conduct methodologically sound studies in different geographical locations to develop adequate modules for improving the knowledge of orthodontists in this domain, globally.

AB  - Objective To assess the effect of birth size and postnatal body mass index (BMI) gain from birth to adulthood on leucocytes cellular senescence in adult life. Methods Participants were aged 43.04 (+/- 0.92) y, and were enrolled from the New Delhi Birth Cohort study, who participated in phase 7 of the study (n = 210). Cellular senescence markers, p16 and p21 gene expression were determined by RT-qPCR in leucocytes and their association with birth size and conditional BMI gain at 2, 11, and 29 y were assessed in univariate and multivariate regression models. Results Birth weight (regression coefficient; B = -0.087, p = 0.011) and birth BMI (unadjusted B = -0.024, p = 0.026; adjusted B = -0.032, p = 0.022) were inversely associated with p21 gene expression in adult life. The p16 gene expression was not associated with any birth parameters. Conditional BMI gain at 2 y, 11 y, and 29 y was not associated with either p16 or p21 gene expression. The p21 gene expression was inversely associated with circulating insulin (B = -0.065, p = 0.026) and C-peptide levels (unadjusted B = -0.097, p = 0.014; adjusted B = -0.133, p = 0.003). Conclusion Small size at birth is associated with accelerated cellular senescence in adult life. An altered senescent state is likely to be one of the links between LBW and adult chronic diseases.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) after primary therapy is a common condition, causing physical and psychological distress. Decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT) using multi-layered compression bandages is an effective treatment. We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of a specific mobilizing bandage (Mobiderm (R)) on lymphedema volume reduction during the intensive phase of DLT.
   Methods and Results: Fifty female BCRL patients were randomized to receive either conventional multilayered bandages or mobilizing bandaging by using Mobiderm. Affected limb volume and excess volume were evaluated at baseline (D0) and after 15 days. The primary outcome was change in affected limb volume after adjustment for baseline. Symptom scores were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS); safety and tolerability were also assessed. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Affected limb volume reduction was observed in both study groups after 15 days: by 19.0% in the Mobiderm arm and 8.6% in controls (adjusted values). The between-group mean difference in adjusted volume reduction at day 15 was 256mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.5 to 421.3 mL; p = 0.003) favoring Mobiderm. Reductions in excess volume of 57.3% ( Mobiderm) and 25.1% (controls) were observed (adjusted values); with between-group mean difference in adjusted excess volume of 220.2 mL (95% CI, 69.3 to 371.3 mL; p = 0.006) favoring Mobiderm. Pain/heaviness VAS scores fell significantly in both groups, with mean reductions of 1.84 (Mobiderm) versus 0.83 (control; p = 0.001). Both regimens were well tolerated.
   Conclusion: The use of Mobiderm in multilayer compression bandaging shows benefit in lymphedema reduction and in alleviating functional symptoms/pain in patients with BRCL.

AB  - Objective To assess the changes in hearing after rapid maxillary expansion (RME) and at the end of 6 months retention period in complete unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) patients using pure tone audiometry and tympanometry test. Design Prospective pilot study. Setting Tertiary health care teaching hospital in New Delhi. Patients This study was conducted on 6 UCLP patients in the age range of 6-14 years with normal ear anatomy. All 6 patients had undergone primary repair of cleft lip and palate and required no more than 5 mm expansion in the intermolar region. Intervention RME was done using a Hyrax expander with daily activation of one-quarter turn per day for a period of 15-20 days (0.25 mm per day). Main outcome measure Audiometry and tympanometry readings at the baseline as compared to the post expansion and at the end of 6 months retention period. Results There were no significant changes in the hearing levels on the audiometry test after RME on the cleft side (p-value -0.51) and the noncleft side ear (p-value -0.26). No significant changes were observed in the middle ear volume on the tympanometry test after RME on the cleft side (p-value -0.09) and the noncleft side ear (p-value -0.28). Conclusion There was no improvement or deterioration in the hearing levels after RME and at the end of 6 months retention period in UCLP patients as evaluated using pure tone audiometry and tympanometry test. Hence RME may be undertaken in UCLP patients safely in terms of hearing is concerned.

AB  - Background Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (compensated advanced chronic liver disease [cACLD]) are clinically indistinguishable and increase risk of developing clinically significant portal hypertension. Baveno VII recommends using elastography to rule out and diagnose cACLD with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) cut-offs of 10/15 kPa. Methods In a retrospective analysis of 330 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, performance of the Baveno VII cut-offs for diagnosing cACLD was compared with newly suggested lower cut-offs (8/12 kPa). A model for detecting cACLD among those with LSM between 8 and 12 kPa was developed and compared with recently published models. Results Seventy (21.2%) of the 330 NAFLD patients had biopsy-proven cACLD. The Baveno VII cut-offs (10/15 kPa) had a lower sensitivity of 72.8% (60.9-82.8%) and a specificity of 93.4% (89.7-96.1%). Sensitivity and specificity of lower cut-offs (8/12 kPa) were 91.4% (82.3-96.8%) and 88.5% (83.9-92.1%), respectively. Modeling based on the presence of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.625[1.161-11.320], p = 0.027) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (OR 1.636[1.098-2.436], p = 0.015) correctly identified 75.7% of patients with LSM between 8 and 12 kPa. Our model performed best with an area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.725 (95%CI 0.609-0.822), compared to Papatheodoridi (AUROC 0.626, CI 0.506-.736) and Zhou (AUROC 0.523, CI 0.403-0.640) models. A two-step strategy comprising application of lower LSM cut-offs followed by the predictive model correctly identified the presence of cACLD in 83% of the patients as compared to 75% by the Baveno VII cut-offs. Conclusion A two-step strategy employing lower LSM cut-offs and modeling based on diabetes and AST levels outperforms Baveno VII cut-offs for identifying cACLD in NAFLD patients.

TI  - An outbreak of <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> bloodstream infections in a tertiary-care facility in northern India detected by a healthcare-associated infection surveillance network
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL & HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
KW  - DISEASES
AB  - Objective: The burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is higher in low- and middle-income countries, but HAIs are often missed because surveillance is not conducted. Here, we describe the identification of and response to a cluster of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with high mortality in a surgical ICU (SICU) that joined an HAI surveillance network. Setting: A 780-bed, tertiary-level, public teaching hospital in northern India. Methods: After detecting a cluster of BCC in the SICU, cases were identified by reviewing laboratory registers and automated identification and susceptibility testing outputs. Sociodemographic details, clinical records, and potential exposure histories were collected, and a self-appraisal of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices using assessment tools from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducted. Training and feedback were provided to hospital staff. Environmental samples were collected from high-touch surfaces, intravenous medications, saline, and mouthwash. Results: Between October 2017 and October 2018, 183 BCC BSI cases were identified. Case records were available for 121 case patients. Of these 121 cases, 91 (75%) were male, the median age was 35 years, and 57 (47%) died. IPC scores were low in the areas of technical guidelines, human resources, and monitoring and evaluation. Of the 30 environmental samples, 4 grew BCC. A single source of the outbreak was not identified. Conclusions: Implementing standardized HAI surveillance in a low-resource setting detected an ongoing Burkholderia cepacia outbreak. The outbreak investigation and use of a multimodal approach reduced incident cases and informed changes in IPC practices.

AB  - Aim: To learn how to achieve high-quality, effective coverage of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), defined as 8 hours or more of skin-to-skin contact per day and exclusive breastfeeding in district Sonipat in North India, and to develop and evaluate an implementation model.
   Methods: We conducted implementation research using a mixed-methods approach, including formative research, followed by repeated, rapid cycles of implementation, evaluation and refinement until a model with the potential for high and effective coverage was reached. Evaluation of this model was conducted over a 12-month period.
   Results: Formative research findings informed the final implementation model. Programme learning was critical to achieve high coverage. The model included improving the identification of small babies, creating KMC wards, modification in hospitalisation criteria, private sector engagement and in-built programme learning to refine implementation progress. KMC was initiated in 87% of eligible babies. At discharge, 85% received skin-to-skin contact care, 60% effective KMC and 80% were exclusively breastfed. At home, 7-day post discharge, 81% received skin-to-skin care and 79% were exclusively breastfed in the previous 24 hours.
   Conclusion: Achieving high KMC coverage is feasible in the study setting using a model responsive to the local context and led by the Government.

The vertical distance of the MB2 orifice from the pulp floor (depth), inter-orifice distance (IOD) of MB2 from mesiobuccal (MB) and palatal (P) orifices, the horizontal distance of the MB2 orifice from the line joining MB-P orifices [mesial deviation (MD)] and root canal configuration (RCC) were evaluated on 330 scans. The Student's t-test, ANOVA, Spearman's correlation and linear regression analysis were applied. The MB2 depth was 1.69 +/- 0.86 mm. IOD (MB-MB2, MB2-P) was 2.18 +/- 0.58 mm and 4.63 +/- 1.06 mm, respectively. MD was 1.02 +/- 0.37 mm. The predominant RCC was Vertucci's type II (75.5%). No correlation of depth with IOD of MB-MB2 (rho = 0.0367, p = 0.506) was observed. Significant correlation of depth with IOD of MB2-P (rho = 0.696, p < 0.001) and MD (rho = 0.174, p = 0.001) was established. No association of depth with age and IOD (MB-MB2) was observed on linear regression analysis. However, a significant positive association was established with IOD (MB2-P) (p < 0.001) and MD (p = 0.001).

AB  - Anemia remains a significant public health challenge, disproportionately impacting lower-income patients residing in areas of lesser healthcare resources. We sought to evaluate the accuracy of physical exam techniques to diagnose anemia among patients 5 years of age or older. A systematic review of 5 databases (MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE, Scopus, Global Health and Global Health Archives, and WHO Global Index Medicus) was conducted. Studies that (1) compared non-invasive physical exam techniques with anemia diagnoses using standard laboratory measurements and (2) solely assessed or separately reported the diagnostic accuracy of physical exam techniques for patients 5 years or older were considered for inclusion. The diagnostic accuracies of individual and combinatorial physical exam techniques todiagnose anemia were documented. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO. The systemic literature search yielded 6,457 unique studies after removal of duplicates. Fourteen studies were ultimately selected for inclusion. Eight studies solely assessed pregnant females, 4 solely assessed hospitalized patients, and 2 evaluated the general population. The diagnostic accuracy ranged widely for pallor assessments of conjunctivae (sensitivity: 19-97%, specificity: 65-100%), nailbed (sensitivity: 41-65%, specificity: 58-93%), and palms (sensitivity: 33-91%, specificity: 54-93%). Examining 9 or more sites leads to higher sensitivity (73.8-82.9%) and specificity (76.0-90.9%). No individual examination technique is superior to others for diagnosing anemia. Combinatorial approachs are associated with more acceptable accuracy measures, but improvements need to be balanced with time available for examination.

AB  - Background Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. To clarify rates of actionable mutations, and thereby identify opportunities to improve the delivery of best available care for a large volume of patients, a comprehensive review of available data is warranted. Methods Studies that reported prevalence of any actionable gene variant among adult Indian patients with advanced NSCLC were selected from three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library). Ranges in actionable variant prevalence were reported. Meta-analysis of proportions was completed among studies specifically evaluating mutational prevalence within ALK or EGFR. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken among populations sharing high heterogeneity. Results Twenty-six studies were selected. Ranges in actionable mutational prevalence among NSCLC patients were as follows: ALK: 4.1-21.4%, BRAF: 1.5-3.5%, EGFR: 11.9-51.8%, HER2: 0-1.5%, KRAS: 4.5-6.4%, NTRK: 0-.7%, and ROS-1: 3.5-4.1%. Following sensitivity analysis, pooled ALK mutational prevalence rates were 8.3% (95% CIs: 6.6-10.4%) and 4.01% (95% CIs: 2.3-7.0) for adenocarcinoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. Pooled EGFR mutational prevalence rates were 28.7% (95% CIs: 23.5-34.6%) and 24.2% (95% CIs: 19.9-29.1%) for adenocarcinoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. Conclusions Nearly 40% of Indian patients with advanced adenocarcinoma and 30% with NSCLC share an actionable mutation in ALK or EGFR. Approximately one-half of adenocarcinoma patients have an actionable variant. Efforts should be directed toward efficiently identifying candidates for targeted agents and delivering such treatments.

AB  - We investigated the safety and efficacy of bendamustine-rituximab (BR) in previously untreated symptomatic and advanced CLL patients, as there is no data available on BR from the Indian subcontinent.This retrospective study included 120 consecutive treatment naive patients with CLL without del (17p), who were registered at the Department of Medical Oncology, AIIMS between January 2010 and July 2018. Bendamustine was given at a dose of 90 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2, combined with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) rituximab on day 1, every 28 days for up to 6 courses. Event-free survival (EFS) was defined as the date of treatment to date of relapse, disease progression, or death due to any cause.The median age was 57 years (range: 30-75 years). As per the clinical Rai stage, 30 (25%) patients were in stage II, 42 (35%) were in stage III and 48 (40%) were in stage IV. ZAP70 was positive (> 20%) in 50%, CD 38 was positive (> 30%) in 33%, and CD49d was positive (> 30%) in 49% of cases. Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) was elevated (>= 3.5 mg/L) in 80% of cases. Fifty-five cases (50%, n = 110) were IGHV mutated. The mean number of cycles was 5 (1-6). The overall response rate (ORR) seen with BR was 90% and complete response was 45%. Median progression-free survival was 24 months with a median follow-up period of 29 months. Haemoglobin (< 10 g/dL), elevated B2 M, unmutated IGHV had a statistically significant adverse impact on EFS on univariate analysis but on multivariate analysis, only IGHV mutation status was found to had significance on EFS. The median EFS was 27 months in IGHV mutated versus 18 months in IGHV unmutated-CLL patients (p = 0.001). Grade 3/4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and infections were observed in 30.6%, 8%, and 12% respectively. The most common non-hematological toxicity was skin rash which was grade 1/2 in 24 (20%) cases and grade 3/4 in 12 (10%) cases. This is the largest study from India to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of BR in symptomatic CLL patients. BR is an effective and safe regimen in the first-line treatment of CLL. Unmutated-CLL patients have inferior EFS than mutated-CLL patients. Skin toxicity was the most common adverse effect seen in our population which was observed in around one-third of cases.

AB  - Introduction: Long-term levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) can cause levodopa induced dyskinesia (LID). Genetic predisposition has a significant role to play in inter-individual heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of LID. Despite accumulating evidence for the role of COMT gene polymorphism (rs4680) as a genetic basis for LID, to date results have been inconsistent. Early assessment of the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) genotype might be helpful to stratify PD patients concerning their individual risk for LID. Method: In this meta-analysis, we have used 9 studies, which were selected through online databases. Statistical analysis was performed using R (v-3.6) software. 5 genetic models have been used in the present study: Allele model (A vs. G), Dominant model (AA+AG vs. GG), Homozygote model (AA vs. GG), Co-donninandheterozygote model (AG vs. GG), and Recessive model (AA vs. AG + GG). Results: The results indicated a significant association between COMT rs4680 (Val158Met) polymorphism and LID risk. The genotype AA of COMT rs4680 is a risk factor for LID in PD patients under the recessive model (AA vs GG+AG) in the random-effect model. Analysis based on ethnicity showed that COMT rs4680 SNP allele A is a risk factor for LID development in Asian PD patients, while GG genotype is a risk factor for LID development in non-Asian PD patients using different genetic models. Conclusion: The results of the present meta-analysis support that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism is a risk factor for the development of LID in PD patients having ethnic variations.

AB  - Objective To compare the performance of regional versus global charts for identifying small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonates with short-term adverse outcomes. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Level-3 neonatal unit in India. Patients Neonates were categorised into SGA and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA; 10th-90th centile) using four charts, namely, the AIIMS, Lubchenco, Fenton and Intergrowth 21st charts. They were followed up for adverse outcomes until 28 days. Outcomes We evaluated the (1) burden of SGA, (2) sensitivity and diagnostic OR (DOR), (3) relative risk (RR) and number needed to screen (NNS) to detect adverse outcomes in SGA versus 'optimal' AGA (50th-90th centile) and (4) RR of morbidities in 'additional SGA' (ie, classified as SGA by others but not by AIIMS chart). Results Among 1367 neonates, 19.6%, 4.5% and 12.5% were classified as SGA by Intergrowth 21st, AIIMS and Lubchenco charts, respectively. Intergrowth 21st had the highest sensitivity (39.1%) but the least DOR (2.6) to detect adverse outcomes; AIIMS chart had low sensitivity (19.3%) but higher DOR (4.3). RR and NNS were 3.7 and 14; 4.4 and 7; 4.0 and 8; 3.6 and 10 with Intergrowth 21st, AIIMS, Lubchenco and Fenton charts, respectively. 'Additional SGA' identified by Intergrowth 21st had lower risk of adverse outcomes than SGA identified by both the charts (RR 0.39; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82). Conclusions Compared with AIIMS and Lubchenco charts, Intergrowth 21st runs the risk of overdiagnosing SGA neonates who may not be at a higher risk of short-term morbidities.
   This prospective study from India explores the short terms outcomes (up to 28 days) in small for gestation age babies as identified by regional vs global growth charts.

AB  - Objectives To study the thickness of levator palpebra superioris-Muller's muscle complex (LMC) on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and to correlate with the clinical response to botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection in patients with inactive-stage of thyroid-related upper eyelid retraction (UER). We also studied the correlation of clinical parameters, preinjection with postinjection values. Methods This was a prospective, interventional study. Patients with thyroid-related UER who underwent subconjunctival injection of BTA were recruited. Demographic data and clinical details were evaluated. UBM (50 MHz) was done to measure the thickness of LMC. Patient's satisfaction was graded at each follow-up. Follow-up was done at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months' time intervals. Results A total of 13 patients were recruited and 26 eyes were divided into two groups; group 1 included eyes with UER (n = 17), and group 2 included eyes without UER (n = 9). There was a statistically significant reduction in margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) after BTA injection at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months follow-up with maximum reduction at 1 month. The mean LMC thickness of 26 eyes was 0.96 mm which was found to be significantly more than normal controls. On comparison of mean LMC thickness with the amount of UER and reduction in MRD1, we did not find a significant difference. Conclusions Patients with TED have significantly thicker LMC on UBM than controls. Further studies are needed with a larger sample size on the correlation of UBM features of levator aponeurosis with response to BTA injection.

AB  - Objective Describe the first hybrid global simulation-based comprehensive cleft care workshop, evaluate impact on participants, and compare experiences based on in-person versus virtual attendance. Design Cross-sectional survey-based evaluation. Setting International comprehensive cleft care workshop. Participants Total of 489 participants. Interventions Three-day simulation-based hybrid comprehensive cleft care workshop. Main Outcome Measures Participant demographic data, perceived barriers and interventions needed for global comprehensive cleft care delivery, participant workshop satisfaction, and perceived short-term impact on practice stratified by in-person versus virtual attendance. Results The workshop included 489 participants from 5 continents. The response rate was 39.9%. Participants perceived financial factors (30.3%) the most significant barrier and improvement in training (39.8%) as the most important intervention to overcome barriers facing cleft care delivery in low to middle-income countries. All participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the workshop and a strong positive perceived short-term impact on their practice. Importantly, while this was true for both in-person and virtual attendees, in-person attendees reported a significantly higher satisfaction with the workshop (28.63 +/- 3.08 vs 27.63 +/- 3.93; P = .04) and perceived impact on their clinical practice (22.37 +/- 3.42 vs 21.02 +/- 3.45 P = .01). Conclusion Hybrid simulation-based educational comprehensive cleft care workshops are overall well received by participants and have a positive perceived impact on their clinical practices. In-person attendance is associated with significantly higher satisfaction and perceived impact on practice. Considering that financial and health constraints may limit live meeting attendance, future efforts will focus on making in-person and virtual attendance more comparable.

AB  - Objective To assess the effect of clear aligners on the speech of patients undergoing orthodontic therapy through a systematic review of the literature. Search methods and selection criteria: The protocol of this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42021278694. An electronic search of the Scopus, Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases was done for papers published between January 2000 till September 2021. Studies that evaluated speech difficulties in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with clear aligners using objective and subjective analyses were included. The evaluated primary outcome was speech difficulties. Secondary outcomes were time to adaptation and recovery from speech difficulties. Study quality was assessed based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Handbook guidelines and ROBINS-I tool. Results Two hundred and eighty-three articles were screened to identify seven studies (n = 332 patients) that assessed speech difficulty with aligners, of which two were randomized trials. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity in the study designs. Five studies compared speech difficulty with aligners to fixed appliances. Two studies showed a moderate risk of bias and five studies had a serious risk of bias. Level of evidence was downgraded to low due to the methodological insufficiencies and risk of bias in the studies. All seven studies reported that aligners could influence the clarity and delivery of speech, similar to fixed appliances. Various phonemes were affected including /s/,/z/,/zh/,/sh/,/th/,/ch/ on wearing aligners. Errors in articulation of consonants and sibilants were noted with lisping and speech impairment. These speech difficulties were temporary and most patients recovered in 7-14 days while few patients took 30-60 days to recover. Conclusion The likelihood of speech difficulties appears high with clear aligners. However, patients adapt quickly and speech returns to normal. The results of this review must be interpreted with caution and more well-designed randomized trials examining long-term effects of aligners on speech are indicated. Clinical Significance Orthodontists should counsel patients opting for clear aligner treatment of the potential transient speech difficulties. Registration The protocol for this systematic review was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) CRD42021278694.

TI  - Hypertension treatment cascade in India: results from National Noncommunicable Disease Monitoring Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN HYPERTENSION
KW  - AWARENESS
AB  - Hypertension is a major risk factor for ischemic heart disease and stroke. We estimated prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension along with its determinants in India. We used data from the National NCD Monitoring Survey-(NNMS-2017-2018) which studied one adult (18-69 years) from a representative sample of households across India and collected information on socio-demographic variables, risk factors for NCDs and treatment practices. Blood pressure was recorded digitally and hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) >= 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >= 90 mmHg or currently on medications. Awareness was defined as being previously diagnosed with hypertension by a health professional; on treatment as taking a dose of medication once in the last 14 days and; control as SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg. Multivariate Logistic regression was performed to estimate determinants. Out of 10,593 adults with a blood pressure measurement (99.4%), 3017 (28.5%; 95% CI: 27.0-30.1) were found to have hypertension. Of these hypertensives, 840 (27.9%; 95% CI: 25.5-30.3) were aware, 438 (14.5%; 95% CI: 12.7-16.5) were under treatment and, 379 (12.6%; 95% CI: 11.0-14.3) were controlled. Significant determinants of awareness were being in the age group 50-69 years (aOR 2.45 95% CI: 1.63-3.69), women (1.63; 95% CI: 1.20-2.22) and from higher wealth quintiles. Those in the age group 50-69 (aOR 4.80; 95% CI: 1.74-13.27) were more likely to be under treatment. Hypertension control was poorer among urban participants (aOR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.33-0.90). Significant regional differences were noted, though without any clear trend. One-fifth of the patients were being managed at public facilities. The poor population-level hypertension control needs strengthening of hypertension services in the Universal Health Coverage package.

AB  - Burst abdomen is a grave complication of laparotomy. X-suturing has been developed as a new method for reducing risk of burst abdomen. Five randomised controlled trials were conducted comparing X-suture with continuous suture in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The analysis of pooled data is presented. Data from five randomised controlled trials were collated. Data on individual patients were obtained from each centre on an Excel database format. A total of 1005 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy were studied. Of these 494 patients were randomised to X-suture arm and 511 to the continuous suture arm. The occurrence of burst abdomen was the main outcome of interest and the suture technique the main predictor of burst. The continuous suture group was considered the reference category. Risk ratio, risk difference, attributable proportion in exposed and prevented fraction in the exposed were calculated. Burst abdomen occurred in 9.31% patients in the X-suture group and in 20.35% patients in the continuous suture group. The risk difference (11%) and relative risk = 0.45 were highly significant (p = 0.0001) with a prevented fraction = 54%. Presence of diabetes, intraperitoneal sepsis, uraemia, and raised serum bilirubin were associated with increased risk of burst abdomen. The risk of burst abdomen can be substantially reduced with the use of X-suture in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy.

AB  - Almost half of the patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) are refractory to primary induction chemotherapy or undergo reactivation. The ideal treatment modality for refractory/relapsed LCH is yet not evidenced. This review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib (a BRAF pathway inhibitor) in LCH, particularly the refractory/relapsed cases. The literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and abstracts published in the SIOP meetings. Studies that described the outcome of patients of LCH being treated with vemurafenib, alone or in combination, were included. A total of 416 studies were screened, and after applying exclusion criteria, 22 studies (n = 107) were included in the final analysis. The first-line therapy was prednisolone plus vinblastine for most patients (n = 92, 86%), and vemurafenib was started upfront in 3 patients (3%). The median time to first clinical response with vemurafenib was one week. The median time to best response was 5.25 months. Out of 107 patients, 62 patients (58%) had ultimately no active disease (NAD) while 39 (36%) had active disease better (ADB), making the overall response rate (ORR) of 101/107, ie, 94.4% (CI 0.88; 0.98). The main adverse effects of vemurafenib were rash or photosensitivity (47%) and other cutaneous adverse events (15%). Vemurafenib is highly efficacious and safe in the treatment of refractory LCH; however, the timing of its commencement and duration of therapy is yet to be established. Larger prospective collaborative trials are needed to answer the appropriate treatment duration and effective maintenance therapy approach.

AB  - Background: Distal radial artery cannulation at the "anatomical snuffbox" carries several theoretical advantages over conventional radial arterial cannulation at the wrist. However, these two techniques have not been evaluated in perioperative settings. Methods: In this randomized controlled trial, n = 200 patients requiring arterial cannulation for perioperative monitoring were recruited. Patients were randomized to either ultrasound guided distal radial artery cannulation group (group D) or ultrasound guided conventional radial artery cannulation group (group W). Primary outcome of this study was first attempt cannulation success rate. Results: First attempt cannulation success rate was significantly lower in distal radial artery cannulation (57% in group D and 77% in group W; p = 0.003). Use of alternative cannulation site was significantly higher in group D when compared to group W (p = 0.015) and number of attempts for successful cannulation was significantly higher in group D when compared to group W (p = 0.015). None of the patients in any group developed thrombosis and related complications and intraoperative catheter dislodgement. Time to puncture the artery (p < 0.0001), total cannulation time (p < 0.0001), and actual catheter insertion time (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in group D in comparison to group W. Conclusion: Distal radial artery cannulation was associated with lower first attempt cannulation success rate and requires longer time to perform. As distal radial artery is a new technique, further studies are required in different clinical settings.

AB  - Background Children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) generally have worse educational and psychosocial outcomes compared with their healthy peers. This can impair their ability to manage their treatment, which in turn can have long-term health consequences through to adulthood. We attempted to capture the experiences of children with CKD and to describe the perspectives of their parents and caregivers on access to educational and psychosocial support.
   Methods Children with CKD (n = 34) and their caregivers (n = 62) were sampled via focus groups from pediatric hospitals in Australia, Canada, and the USA. Sixteen focus groups were convened and the transcripts were analyzed thematically.
   Results We identified four themes: disruption to self-esteem and identity (emotional turmoil of adolescence, wrestling with the sick self, powerlessness to alleviate child's suffering, balancing normality and protection); disadvantaged by lack of empathy and acceptance (alienated by ignorance, bearing the burden alone); a hidden and inaccessible support system (excluded from formal psychological support, falling behind due to being denied special considerations); and building resilience (finding partners in the journey, moving towards acceptance of the illness, re-establishing childhood).
   Conclusions Children with CKD and their caregivers encountered many barriers in accessing psychosocial and educational support and felt extremely disempowered and isolated as a consequence. Improved availability and access to psychosocial and educational interventions are needed to improve the wellbeing and educational advancement of children with CKD.

AB  - SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma is a recently described molecularly defined entity among the subset of aggressive undifferentiated uterine tumors. Mutation in the SMARCA4 gene is a key driver alteration, as also seen in small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and thoracic undifferentiated carcinoma. Limited number of cases of SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma has been reported in literature. We hereby describe a case of this distinct entity in a 52-year-old woman. Histomorphological examination showed sheets of monomorphic epithelioid cells with a variable proportion of cells displaying rhabdoid features, brisk mitotic activity, and lymphovascular invasion. A panel of immunohistochemical markers was required to exclude the differential diagnoses. The tumor was microsatellite stable. Loss of SMARCA4 expression and intact expression of INI1 in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the diagnosis of SMARCA4- deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma. The patient had a rapidly progressive clinical course.

AB  - The objective of this study is to synthesise the findings of clinical studies in order to derive evidence for use of the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in the treatment of neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxias. In order to find relevant studies for the systematic review, we searched through Medline (1985 to July 2020), PubMed and Clinical trial register. We included both single-arm and comparative studies in which MSCs were given as intervention in neurodegenerative ataxia patients at any time after the diagnosis. We used Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) quality scale to evaluate the methodological qualities of the included studies. Our literature search obtained 81 publications. Three articles comprising a total of 47 patients were included in the meta-analysis. None of them were randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Pooled analysis noted that there was a decrease in the Berg Balance Scale (BBS)/Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score from pre to post assessment; however, the difference was statistically not significant (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0.20; 95% CI - 0.78 to 0.38). No significant side effects were reported in any of the studies. We did not observe any statistically significant difference in the pooled mean difference in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score between pre and post assessment in patients with ataxia after receiving the stem cells (SMD 0.36, 95% CI - 0.08 to 0.81). Our systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that MSC cell therapy appeared safe but provided insufficient evidence to support the use of MSCs to treat patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxia at present. No l RCTs was available in the literature to test efficacy; therefore, well-designed RCTs are needed to ascertain the effectiveness of MSCs in patients with neurodegenerative cerebellar ataxias.

AB  - Currently, the management of acute osteochondral fractures (OCFs) of the patella is well established. However, the management of chronic OCFs remains debatable, as it is not clear whether such lesions can be accurately reduced or whether they will reliably heal. With well proven results of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with headless compression screws (HCS) for acute OCFs, the application of this technique in late presenting cases is inconclusive. Thus, we present the clinicoradiological outcome of patients with chronic osteochondral injuries managed with ORIF. Fifteen patients who underwent surgical fixation by ORIF with HCS for chronic OCFs of the patella, between February 2013 and June 2018, were retrospectively analyzed after a mean follow-up of 3.8 years (range: 2-7 years). The mode of injury, size of the osteochondral fragment, and knee range of motion along with Kujala's scoring were examined clinically and radiological assessment was done by X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Fifteen patients (11 males and 4 females), with a mean age of 17 years with chronic OCF of patella were enrolled. Noncontact twisting injuries were the most common mode of injury seen in 86.66% of patients and postcontact injuries in two patients (13.33%). The mean time from trauma to presentation was 7 weeks (range: 6-14 weeks). The mean preoperative Kujala's score improved from 44 to 84.8 at 6 months and 92.6 at 2 years, postoperatively. Intraoperatively, the lesion was found in medial patellar facet in 12 patients and 3 had lesions in the central facet. The mean size of the lesion was 20 mm x 18 mm. Radiological union was observed in all patients, at a mean duration of 16 weeks (range: 12-20 weeks). One patient underwent implant removal 1 year after initial surgery for mechanical symptoms. ORIF of OCFs of the patella using headless cannulated screws is simple, reliable, reproducible, and provides satisfactory outcomes. This technique can be considered for fixation of fragments with adequate subchondral bone.

AB  - Objective Data on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy are lacking and the potential role and effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnancy is yet to be completely investigated. Method This is a cross-sectional observational study wherein pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G levels, irrespective of their infective status or presence or symptomatology. Result Of the 220 pregnant women tested, 160 (72.7%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgG positive, 37 (16.8%) were SARS-CoV-2 IgM positive and 27 (16.9%) were both IgG and IgM positive. The average antibody titer found was 10.49 BAU/ml (+/- 14.0) and 0.6 (+/- 0.55) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM non neutralizing antibodies respectively. ROC analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgG positivity showed a cut-off value of 1.19 with a sensitivity of 99.3% (0.99 AUC, 95% CI) and specificity of 98.3% (0.99 AUC, 95% CI), respectively. Similarly, ROC analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgM positivity showed a cut-off value of 1 with a sensitivity of 97.3% (0.99 AUC, 95% CI) and specificity of 98.9% (0.99 AUC, 95% CI), respectively. Conclusion First trimester sero-molecular screening suggests a high prevalence of COVID antibodies in the study population of pregnant women in the first trimester, without the patients being symptomatic.

   Objectives This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed to assess effectiveness, safety, clinical, functional and radiological outcome of either combined anteroposterior or posterior-only approach in the surgical management of active tubercular disease of paediatric thoracolumbar spine.
   Methods A systematic literature search through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane Library database was performed. Data extraction was undertaken following methodological quality assessment.
   Results 9 out of the 182 publications identified, were included for analysis. A total of 247 patients were analysed. Two amongst the 9 studies were retrospective comparative studies evaluating posterior approach with combined anteroposterior approach and were considered for comparative meta-analysis. Blood loss and duration of surgery was significantly higher in the anteroposterior group, as compared to the posterior-only group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of post-operative kyphosis angles, final kyphosis angles, number of complications, functional outcome and spinal fusion time. However, all the included studies were non-randomised and retrospective. Only 2 of them had a control group with a high heterogeneity amongst these 2 studies.
   Conclusion The inference from the studies included in this review suggests that equivalent results can be achieved with posterior-only approach for thoracolumbar tuberculosis in children as compared to anteroposterior approach, with much lower complexity, reduced blood loss and shorter surgical time. However, due to the high risk of bias and considerable heterogeneity among the studies included, we cannot conclude whether one approach is better than the other.

AB  - There is a lot of ambiguity in the usage of correct terminology in the description of vascular malformations and tumors. Hemangioma and arteriovenous malformation (AVM) are the most commonly used terms and are the mostly incorrectly used as well! The aim of this review article was to lay out the correct nomenclature and describe the correct usage for the physicians and radiologists involved in diagnosing and managing these lesions. We describe the various classification systems which have been devised to define the multiple entities included under vascular anomalies. The latest classification system that should be adhered to is per the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies, approved at the 20th ISSVA Workshop held in Melbourne in April 2014, last revised in May 2018. The main features of the latest revision have been highlighted. This classification, however, does not list the diagnostic clinico-radiological features for each entity. In addition, guidelines regarding the appropriate use of available imaging modalities are lacking in the literature. We, hereby, aim to address these pertinent issues in this review article.

AB  - Objective The objective of the study was to assess nasolabial aesthetics in patients with complete unilateral cleft lip, with or without cleft palate (UCL +/- P) using two scoring systems. Design A cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary care government hospital. Patients Photographic records of 91 patients with complete UCL +/- P from the age group of 5-18 years (mean age = 13.2 +/- 3.14 years) were included. Method A panel of three orthodontists with varying experience in cleft management rated nasolabial aesthetics using two scoring systems, that is Asher Mc-Dade index (AMAI) and Cleft Aesthetic Rating Scale (CARS). Intraclass correlation coefficient, Fleiss' kappa and Cronbach's alpha were used to measure the internal consistency amongst three raters and Spearman-Brown formula was used for measuring overall reliability. Time required for assessment of each photograph was compared with ANOVA. Results Overall, both AMAI and CARS showed high reliability and outcome assessment with good inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, when used independently by orthodontists having varied experience. Statistically significant difference was present in time taken for assessment of nasolabial aesthetics with CARS index (8.75 +/- 1.65 seconds) as compared to AMAI (18.62 +/- 3.49 seconds). Conclusion Asher Mc-Dade index and CARS are equally reliable and consistent for the assessment of nasolabial aesthetics in patients with UCL +/- P. However, considerably less time was taken for the assessment using CARS index as compared to AMAI. The use of CARS index is recommended for the initial assessment and screening of patients by orthodontists using two dimensional photographs.

AB  - Purpose/aim of the study: Purpose/aim of the study:Central nervous system (CNS), skull, and vertebral metastases from anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are an exceedingly rare entity. We report the first case of multiple vertebral metastases from a primary anal SCC with the aim of define a target therapeutic strategy. Case presentation: We present the case of a 68-year-old male admitted to our hospital for acute exacerbation chronic low back pain and left L2 radiculopathy. His medical history included the diagnosis of a human papilloma virus related, moderately differentiated anal SCC (cT3N0M0-stage IIB), treated with standard chemoradiotherapy regimen two years earlier. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging revealed an isolated solid lesion of the L2 vertebral body. After the surgical removal, histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of moderately differentiated SCC. At 1-month radiological follow-up, two new lesions at the level of T7 to T11 were identified. Additional chemotherapy and radiotherapy for metastatic localization of L2, T7, and T11 were administered. Two-year follow-up demonstrated a radiologically and clinically well-controlled disease. To supplement our case, a systematic literature review on the CNS, skull, and vertebral metastases and their treatments has been performed. Conclusion: Despite several proposed guidelines for the management of vertebral metastases, at present, a universally accepted treatment strategy for vertebral metastases from anal SCC has not been defined. Based on our clinical experience and literature review, in case of vertebral metastases from anal SCC, a prompt and aggressive, local and systemic, and multimodal treatment of the vertebral lesions may be paramount to improve the patient outcomes.

KW  - Bolus insulin dose prediction
KW  - Carbohydrate counting
AB  - Background Diabetes care in type 1 diabetes has remained a challenge over time. Ability to count carbohydrates in every meal and varying insulin dose according to individual insulin/carbohydrate ratio allows people with type 1 DM to have wider food choices with better glycemic control. Difficulties in carbohydrate counting may largely be solved by use of technology. Methods This work was done at the endocrine unit of a superspeciality centre involved in care of people with type 1 diabetes. The process of development of software and its preliminary application and results from its use in clinical care in a small group of interested patients is presented in this manuscript. Carbohydrate counting tool for Indian foods was developed, and subsequently, bolus dose calculation was automated by using the reinforcement algorithm in an android app platform named "T1-Life". Data on app usability and acceptability is documented in this pilot study report. Results Five patients completed 3 months of this app usage. Among five people with combined usage over 115 patient weeks, a total of 2661 insulin dose predictions were made. This translates to 3.31 patient-initiated bolus dose predictions per day. Of the total bolus dose predictions made, 82% were accepted by the participants. With usage of app, time in range (70-180 mg/dl) increased by an average of 16.67% in children who used CGMS in their first week as well as last week of observation. Conclusion T1-life, integrated carbohydrate counting and reinforcement-based insulin bolus dose prediction system, has good patient usability and acceptability.

AB  - The use of focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) examination in pediatric blunt abdominal trauma (BAT) has not been well accepted because of its poor sensitivity. We aim to determine whether the FAST combined with elevated liver enzymes, i.e., aspartate transaminase (AST), could be used as a better screening tool for intra-abdominal injury (IAI) in pediatric BAT and develop a new prediction model.
   A case series analysis was performed among pediatric patients (age < 18 years) with BAT, presenting to a level-1 trauma center. Data on patient demographics, vital signs, mechanism of injury, FAST finding, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scan of the abdomen, and serum AST levels, were collected. Multiple logistic regression (MLR) was used to develop a prediction model for IAI.
   Overall, 499 children were identified. FAST was positive in 72 patients, whereas 69 patients had IAI in a CECT. FAST alone had a sensitivity of 76.8%. FAST examination's negative predictive value (NPV) and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 95.8% and 0.24, respectively. Combining FAST and AST levels led to an increase in sensitivity to 91.3%, NPV to 97.9%. The NLR decreased to 0.1, which was clinically more relevant. In the MLR model, the odds ratios for the presence of IAI were significant for FAST and AST levels. Hence, FAST and AST levels were included in the new 'F-AST score'. A score of one was assigned for FAST positive and zero for FAST negative. AST level < 90 U/L was assigned a score of zero and > 90 U/L as one. Aggregate F-AST score ranged from 0 to 2. The receiver's operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed the F-AST score to be very accurate with an area under the ROC curve of 0.905.
   Pediatric patients with a F-AST score of 0 (negative FAST and AST < 90 U/L) may be observed rather than subjected to CT scan radiation risk.

AB  - The portal vein is the largest vessel supplying the liver. A number of radiological interventions are performed through the portal vein, namely for primary pathologies of the portal vein, for inducing liver hypertrophy or to treat the sequelae of portal hypertension among others. The routes used include direct transhepatic, transjugular, and, uncommonly, trans-splenic and through subcutaneous varices. Portal vein embolization and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt are among the most common portal vein interventions that are performed to induce hypertrophy of the future liver remnant and to treat complications of portal hypertension, respectively. Other interventions include transhepatic obliteration of varices and shunts, portal vein thrombolysis, portal vein recanalization, pancreatic islet cell transplantation, and embolization of portal vein injuries. We present a detailed illustrative review of the various radiological portal vein interventions.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy is the enlargement of cardiomyocytes in response to persistent release of catecholamine which further leads to cardiac fibrosis. Chrysin, flavonoid from honey, is well known for its multifarious properties like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and antiapoptotic. To investigate the cardioprotective potential of chrysin against isoproterenol (ISO), cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are induced in rats. Acclimatised male albino Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (n 6): normal (carboxymethyl cellulose at 0.5 % p.o.; as vehicle), hypertrophy control (ISO 3 mg/kg, s.c.), CHY15 + H, CHY30 + H & CHY60 + H (chrysin; p.o.15, 30 and 60 mg/kg respectively thorn ISO at 3 mg/kg, s.c.), CHY60 (chrysin 60 mg/kg in per se) and LST + H (losartan 10 mg/kg p.o. thorn ISO 3 mg/kg, s.c.) were treated for 28 d. After the dosing schedule on day 29, haemodynamic parameters were recorded, after that blood and heart were excised for biochemical, histological, ultra-structural and molecular evaluations. ISO administration significantly increases heart weight:body weight ratio, pro-oxidants, inflammatory and cardiac injury markers. Further, histopathological, ultra-structural and molecular studies confirmed deteriorative changes due to ISO administration. Pre-treatment with chrysin of 60 mg/kg reversed the ISO-induced damage to myocardium and prevent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through various anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic pathways. Data demonstrated that chrysin attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and prevented fibrosis via activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta)/Smad signalling pathway.

AB  - Objective The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the maxillary sinus characteristics of patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP). Design The study included manuscripts which met the following criteria: (1) study of individuals with CLP in any age group or gender and (2) study of individuals in whom assessment of maxillary sinus characteristics had been done by cone-beam computed tomography. Studies with (1) individuals having special health-care needs and (2) individuals with any syndrome affecting the development of the head and neck were excluded. Results In total, 11 articles were included in the review, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pooled maxillary sinus volume (MSV) on the cleft sides of patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) was found to be 9433.14 mm(3) (95% CI, 7453.99-11 412.30), which was significantly smaller than that of controls. The meta-analyses also revealed significantly reduced MSV on the cleft sides of patients with UCLP. The differences between cleft and noncleft sides of the patients with UCLP were not found to be statistically significant. Strength-of-evidence was found to be moderate in 4 characteristics, along with 10 out of 11 articles showing low risk-of-bias. Conclusions It was concluded that MSV was reduced and mucosal thickening was increased/present in patients with CLP as compared with controls. The differences between MSV of cleft and noncleft sides of the patients with UCLP could not be established. However, heterogeneity was found in terms of sample size, stratification of samples by age, and evaluation of some confounding factors.

AB  - Introduction Although nephroblastomas are frequently treated without prior biopsy, there are the occasional other pediatric renal tumors that require different management. In the literature, there are around 30 primary renal germ cell tumors (GCT), including four cases of Yolk sac tumor (YST). We present another primary renal YST.Case report: A five-year-old boy was diagnosed as Wilms tumor on radiology and needle biopsy. He received chemotherapy, with no response. The post-chemotherapy resection specimen revealed a YST.Conclusion: Renal YST may be indistinguishable from Wilms tumor clinically and radiologically. For pre-biopsy chemotherapy management protocols, serum tumor markers such as AFP may be recommended to identify the occasional GCT, including YST. Pre-chemotherapy needle biopsies may lead to misdiagnosis, and may require confirmation by an experienced pathologist or central review.

AB  - Objective To determine high resolution CT (HRCT) patterns of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in children; and their etiological correlates. Methods This was a retrospective study involving 149 children with diffuse lung disease (DLD). Patterns of involvement were classified based on dominant lung finding as ground glass opacity (GGO) dominant, nodule dominant, cystic lung disease, or PF. Patterns of PF were classified based on distribution and morphology into airway centric fibrosis (ACF), subpleural fibrosis (SPF), progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) and fibrocavitary. A comparison was made between the two dominant groups for apicobasal distribution, associated findings (GGO, nodules, cysts), and pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). Results Nineteen patients showed PF on HRCT. ACF was commonest (52.6%), followed by SPF (42.1%). The common etiology was sarcoidosis (30%) in ACF, and connective tissue disorders (CTD) (50%) in SPF. Significant difference was found between ACF and SPF in apicobasal distribution (p = 0.04), presence of nodules (p = 0.03), and cysts (p = 0.02). Conclusion PF may present as an end stage of several childhood lung diseases. PF on imaging has discernible morphological patterns that correlate with underlying etiology.

AB  - Purpose To compare the effectiveness of three procedures: modified Nishida procedure alone vs modified Nishida procedure combined with medial rectus recession (MRc) vs modified Nishida procedure combined with MRc and botulinum toxin (BT) for severe unilateral sixth nerve palsy. Design Consecutive, interventional case series. Methods The medical records of a consecutive series of patients with severe unilateral sixth nerve palsy who underwent modified Nishida procedure in multiple centres were reviewed. Surgical technique was decided preoperatively at the surgeon's discretion. The preoperative and postoperative findings were compared. Results Of the 43 patients with abducens palsy that received the procedure, 32 were included (mean age 38.6 +/- 19.8 years). Mean preoperative deviation was 63.0 +/- 27.3 prism dioptres (PD) and mean limitation of abduction -4.5 +/- 1.2. Five patients underwent a modified Nishida procedure alone, 24 patients had an additional MRc and 3 patients were also injected with BT. Overall, the average correction of modified Nishida technique by itself was 29.4 +/- 6.6 PD (range 20-36) and adding a MRc corrected 62.6 +/- 23.8 PD (range 24-120). Modified Nishida procedure, MRc and BT altogether corrected 95.0 +/- 18.0 PD (range 75-110). No postoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. Conclusions Excellent outcomes with fewer complications are obtained with modified Nishida procedure alone. The need for additional procedures such as MRc and BT which increase the effect in primary position can be determined depending on passive duction and preoperative horizontal deviation.

AB  - A Summary of background data The results of conventional corrective procedures remain suboptimal for severe cubitus varus deformities (> 30 degrees) in children. We present the results of shortening dome osteotomy for the correction of such deformities.
   Patients and methods We present retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 18 patients (11 boys and 7 girls) who underwent shortening dome osteotomy between January 2011 and December 2019 for severe cubitus varus deformities (> 30 degrees) secondary to malunited supracondylar fracture. The procedure involved the removal of convexo-concave bone (5-8 mm wide) between the two domes. Humero-ulnar angles, lateral condylar prominence index (LCPI), and elbow range of movements were recorded preoperatively and postoperatively.
   Results Mean age was 7.5 years (range 5 years-11 years). Indication for surgery was poor cosmesis in all the patients and tardy ulnar nerve symptoms in three patients. Mean preoperative humero-ulnar angle was 26.1 degrees varus (range 22 degrees -34 degrees), while it was 7.1 degrees valgus (range 0 degrees-12 degrees) for contralateral normal elbow. They were followed for a mean duration of 2.2 years (range 12 months-5.8 years). The mean postoperative valgus angle achieved was 7.3 degrees (range 2 degrees-12 degrees) as total angular correction achieved was 34.4 degrees (range 30 degrees-44 degrees) (p < 0.001). Radiological healing was observed in all the patients at mean duration of 7.1 weeks (range 5 weeks-9 weeks). Mean preoperative and postoperative LCPI were - 2.4 (range +4.7 to - 10.5) and - 1.7 (range +4.5 to - 5.1), respectively (p = 0.595). Three patients had pin tract infections and two of them responded to aseptic dressings and oral antibiotics, while another required early pin removal and additional protection in splint. All patients regained preoperative arc of motion within 6 months after the procedure.
   Conclusion Shortening dome osteotomy is a safe and effective method for correcting severe cubitus varus deformities (>30 degrees) secondary to malunited supracondylar fracture in children.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative, rod shape bacterium that infects people with compromised immune systems, such as those suffering from AIDS, organ transplantation and cancer. This bacterium is responsible for diseases like cystic fibrosis, chronic lung infection, and ulcerative keratitis. It is diagnosed in most of the patients who were on prolonged ventilation with long term critical care stay. P. aeruginosa develops rapid antimicrobial resistance that is challenging for the treatment and eventually it causes high mortality rate. Thus, the search for potential novel inhibitors that can inhibit the pathogenic activity of P. aeruginosa is of utmost importance. In P. aeruginosa, an important protein, LasR that participates in the gene regulations and expressions has been proposed to be a suitable drug target. Here, we identify a set of hygrophorone molecules as effective inhibitors for this LasR protein based on molecular docking and simulations studies. At first, large number of hygrophorone series of small molecules were screened against the LasR protein and their binding affinities were assessed based on the docking scores. Top scored molecules were selected for calculating various pharmacophore properties, and finally, their potential in inhibiting the LasR protein was delineated by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area-based calculations. Both docking and simulations studies reveal that a subset of hygrophorone molecules have a good binding affinity for LasR protein and form stable LasR-inhibitor complexes. The present study illustrates that the hygrophorones can be effective inhibitors for the LasR protein and will spur further in vitro studies that would aid to the ongoing search for new antibiotics.

AB  - Purpose There are limited studies in the literature comparing the alignment accuracy of the large console, imageless, computer-assisted navigation (CAN) and portable, hand-held, accelerometer-based navigation (ABN) in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). This study was aimed to compare the operative time, blood loss, radiological, clinical and functional outcomes between CAN- and ABN-guided bilateral TKA. Methods From Jan 2016 to Dec 2017, 50 patients who underwent bilateral TKA were randomized to undergo either CAN-guided or ABN-guided TKA. Tourniquet time and blood loss were recorded, and intra-op complications were noted. Post-op radiological outcomes at 2 weeks were compared between the groups. The clinical and functional outcomes using the American Knee Society Scores (KSS) and Oxford Knee Score (OKS) were recorded pre-operatively and post-operatively at 3, 6, 12 months and at the end of the study with a minimum follow-up of 48 months. Results Both groups were well-matched in terms of patient demographic parameters. The mean surgical time per knee was significantly lower in the ABN group (54.5 +/- 5.6 min) compared to the CAN group (61.7 +/- 13.7 min; p < 0.01). Mean blood loss per knee in the ABN group was 592.1 +/- 245.3 mL compared to 682.8 +/- 322.0 in the CAN group (p = 0.11). In the ABN group, the mean post-op mechanical axis was 1.2 +/- 3.2 degrees (vs 1.5 +/- 2.2 degrees in the CAN group, p 0.6), the frontal femoral angle was 88.8 +/- 2.3 degrees (vs 88.8 +/- 1.8 degrees in the CAN group, p 1.0) and frontal tibial angle was 90.1 +/- 1.6 degrees (vs 89.7 +/- 1.1 degrees in the CAN group, p 0.14). At 48 month follow-up, the mean functional KSS in the ABN group was 89.0 +/- 5.7 (vs 88.1 +/- 4.5 in the CAN group, p 0.37) and the mean OKS was 40.5 +/- 2.8 (vs 39.6 +/- 3.2 in the CAN group, p 0.12). Conclusion Portable, hand-held ABN offers alignment accuracy and functional outcomes in TKA similar to that with CAN, with a reduced duration of surgery. There was no advantage of either of the techniques in terms of clinical or functional outcomes at 48 month follow-up.

AB  - Leishmania donavani is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, responsible for social and economic disruption, especially in developing countries. Lack of effective drugs with few side effects have necessitated the discovery of newer therapeutic solutions for leishmaniasis. Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) synthesis plays a vital role in protozoan cell membranes structural formation and antigenic modification. Hence, any disruption in its biosynthesis can prove fatal to the parasitic protozoans. N-acetylglucosamine-phosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase (NAGP-deacetylase) is an enzyme from the GPI biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol to glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol, a step essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme. In the quest for novel scaffolds as anti-leishmaniasis agents, we have executed in silico virtual screening, density function theory, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA based energy calculations with a natural product library and a diverse library set from Chembridge database. Two compounds, 14671 and 4610, were identified at the enzyme's active site and interacted with catalytic residues, Asp43, Asp44, His41, His147, His 150, Arg80 and Arg231. Both molecules exhibited stable conformation in their protein-ligand complexes with binding free energies for compound-14671 and compound-4610 of -54 +/- 4 and -50 +/- 4 kcal/mol, respectively. These scaffolds can be incorporated in future synthetic determinations, focusing on developing druggable inhibitor support, increasing potency, and introducing species selectivity.

AB  - Focal renal lesions in the background of chronic kidney disease (CKD) present a diagnostic challenge. Contrast administration is usually avoided in such a setting, undermining the usefulness of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Focal regenerating nodules may occur in the background of CKD and closely mimic renal neoplasms. The aim of the present article was to highlight the salient manifestations of such CKD pseudotumors on different imaging modalities and also to depict the differentiating features from malignancy. Radiologists must be aware of the imaging appearance of this uncommonly talked about entity so as to avoid inadvertent surgery or cause undue anxiety to the patient.

AB  - Isolated innominate artery injury is very rare and accounts for less than 3% of recognized arterial injuries. Surgical exploration of the artery, especially at the origin of the artery from the arch of the aorta, is surgically challenging. Due to its rarity, any 1 surgeon's experience in dealing with innominate artery injury is bound to be limited. We report 2 cases of innominate artery injury post-blunt chest trauma. Both patients underwent thoracotomy and innominate artery Dacron graft repair and both had an uneventful postoperative course.

AB  - A mass or a tumor may not always be an underlying cause for a clinically apparent swelling. A wide range of myotendinous disorders can present as pseudomasses. These include muscle/myofascial hernia, tendon tears, benign hypertrophy, accessory muscles, tendon xanthomas, diffuse myositis, and exertional compartment syndromes. We have briefly reviewed these lesions highlighting their typical radiological findings and have also highlighted the role of different imaging modalities and the role of dynamic imaging. Although rare, radiologists should be aware of these entities to avoid mislabeling a pseudomass as a mass or malignancy and to detect the abnormality in not-so-apparent masses.

AB  - Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are a diverse group of autoantibodies found in various systemic autoimmune disorders. They represent a key diagnostic marker in the diagnosis of connective tissue disorders (CTD). Although many techniques exist, ANA by indirect immunofluorescence remains the gold standard for diagnosing CTDs. Neurologists should be aware of the type of assay used for detection and the advantages and disadvantages of using each method. Through this article, we aimed to review the methodological aspects of the detection of ANA and its subtypes and their clinical relevance in various neurologic disorders.

AB  - Cephalic vein <= 2.5 mm is associated with high failure rate. Preoperative balloon angioplasty in <= 2 mm veins improve the patency rate of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) compared with hydrostatic technique. This study was done to determine difference in the efficacy between two surgical techniques (hydrostatic dilatation with balloon angioplasty (HD + BA) versus hydrostatic dilatation with malleable dilatation (HD + MD)) on patency rates of AVF in patients with cephalic veins <= 2 mm in diameter. This randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Surgical Disciplines, AIIMS, New Delhi between 2017 and 2018. Two hundred patients of chronic kidney disease (CKD) were evaluated for AVF, 120/200 (60%) agreed to participate in the study. Computer generated randomization via sealed envelope was done into two groups, i.e., HD + BA (n = 60) or HD + MD (n = 60). Efficacy on clinical maturation (CM) and radiological maturation (RM) of AVF was observed. CM-use of AVF for repetitive (>= 3) hemodialysis. RM-cross-sectional diameter > 4 mm and intra-access flow rate > 500 ml/h. CM and RM between HD + BA versus HD + MD at the end of 8 and 24 weeks was 83.63% and 58.2%: 83.6% and 58.11% versus 85.71% and 64.3%: 82.1% and 64.28% (p values 0.81 and 0.51: p value 0.83 and 0.29). CM and RM in brachiocephalic AVF (BCAVF) subgroup at 24 weeks was 40/43 (93.0%) and 30/43 (69.70%). CM and RM in RCAVF subgroup at 24 weeks were 52/68 (76.4%) and 38/68 (55.8%). Both surgical techniques were equally effective in increasing the patency of AVF. HD + BD is not superior to HD + MD at 6 months of follow-up.

AB  - Aim To estimate prevalence and characterise clinical features and vision-related quality of life (VR-QoL) of corneal opacities (COs) resulting from infectious keratitis in a rural North Indian population.
   Methods The Corneal Opacity Rural Epidemiological study was a cross-sectional study conducted in 25 randomly selected clusters of rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India to determine prevalence of corneal disease across all age groups. During house-to-house visits, sociodemographic details, presence, type and clinical characteristics of corneal disease, laterality and resultant visual impairment (VI) was noted. Subgroup analysis of data was performed to understand the prevalence, clinical characteristics, VR-QoL in patients with CO due to infectious keratitis. VR-QoL scores were compared with healthy controls.
   Results Overall, 65 of 12113 participants had evidence of infectious keratitis-related CO with a mean age of 63.3 (14.7SD) years. Prevalence of infectious keratitis-related CO, including both bilateral (12/65) and unilateral (53/65) cases was 0.54% (95% CI 0.41 to 0.66) seen in a total of 77 eyes of 65 participants. Mean visual acuity was 1.18 +/- 0.80 with 30/77 (38.9%) eyes having a presenting visual acuity <3/60. Most of the CO due to infectious keratitis was <3mm in size (61.03%; 47/77), nebular (42.85%; 33/77) and central (49.35%; 38/77) in location. These participants had significantly higher VR-QoL scores and hence poorer VR-QoL across all three domains of vision function (scores of 28 vs 22, 7.5 vs 5 and 15.5 vs 9, respectively; p<0.0001) when compared with healthy controls.
   Conclusion The data from this study give an insight into the burden and clinical characteristics of COs resulting from infectious keratitis. VR-QoL is significantly impaired in patients with CO resulting from infectious keratitis, both in bilateral and unilateral cases.

AB  - Background The etiopathogenesis of vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is incompletely understood. Bioactive lipids play a key role in allergic disorders. This study focused on the sphingolipid metabolism on the ocular surface of VKC and to explore if it has a contributory role in the refractoriness of the disease. Methods Active VKC cases, (n=87) (classified as mild/moderate and severe/very severe based on the disease symptoms) and age-matched healthy controls (n=60) were recruited as part of a 2-year prospective study at a tertiary eye care centre in South India. Conjunctival imprint cytology was used to assess gene expression of enzymes of sphingolipids metabolism. Sphingolipids were estimated in the tears by LC-MS/MS analysis. In vitro study was done to assess IgE-induced alterations in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor expression and histone modification in cultured mast cells. Results Significantly altered gene expression of the sphingolipids enzymes and S1P receptor (SIP3R) were observed in conjunctival imprint cells of VKC cases. Pooled tears analysis revealed significantly lowered levels of S1P(d17:0), S1P(d20:1) (p<0.001) and S1P(d17:1) (p<0.01) specifically in severe/very severe VKC compared with both mild/moderate VKC and control. Cer(d18:/17:0) (p<0.001), ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P)(d18:1/8:0) (p<0.01) and C1P(d18:1/2.0 (p<0.05) were lowered in severe/very severe VKC compared with mild/moderate VKC. Cultured mast cells treated with IgE revealed significantly increased gene expression of S1P1 and 3 receptors and the protein expression of histone deacetylases (1, 6). Conclusion Altered sphingolipid metabolism in the ocular surface results in low tear ceramide and sphingosine levels in severe/very severe VKC compared with the mild/moderate cases. The novel finding opens up fresh targets for intervention in these refractory cases.

AB  - Purpose Molecular pathogenesis underlying persistent ocular surface inflammation in chronic Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) still remains largely unexplored. The present study investigates the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), MMP3, MMP9, MMP11 and TIMP1 (tissue inhibittor of matrix metalloproteinase 1) in pannus tissues of chronic ocular SJS undergoing cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET) and their prognostic relevance. Methods In this prospective study, 45 eyes with chronic SJS underwent COMET for visual and anatomical rehabilitation. Preoperative and postoperative clinical parameters were documented. MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, MMP11 and TIMP1 expression were assessed using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real time PCR. Inflammadry MMP9 assay was performed at 1-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to correlate protein expression with clinicopathological parameters and COMET graft survival outcomes. Results MMP9 and MMP11 positivity was seen in both pannus epithelia (48% and 55%, respectively) and in stromal layer (57% and 33%, respectively) while MMP2 and MMP3 showed only pannus epithelial positivity in 35% and 51% cases, respectively. High MMP9 stromal expression was significantly associated with preoperative corneal keratinisation (p=0.011), conjunctival hyperaemia (p=0.014), symblepharon (p=0.028). High MMP9 and MMP3 epithelial expression were found to be independent risk factors for poor best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) outcomes post-COMET (p=0.022 and p=0.048). Multivariate analysis revealed MMP9 to be the best prognostic marker (p=0.050). Conclusion Our findings suggest that differential expression of MMPs and TIMP1 is seen in SJS in chronic stage. Emergence of MMP9 as a poor prognostic predictor of BCVA post COMET and postoperative MMP9 immunoassay positivity could be a useful tool in further studies to understand the unresolved ocular surface inflammation seen in SJS.

AB  - Intrathoracic goiter when encountered can be treated by thyroidectomy using cervical incision, only occasionally requiring extra cervical approach. We are reporting one such case in a patient with pituitary macroadenoma with extension of the adenomatous goiter into the posterior mediastinum. It was removed through the cervical collar incision using a vessel sealing device. There were no intraoperative and postoperative complications during the procedure. The need for extra cervical incision should be decided on a case-to-case basis to avoid the increased morbidity associated with sternotomy and lateral thoracotomy incision.

AB  - Background Comminuted fractures of the posterior acetabular wall, pose a significant challenge in the reduction and fixation of the fracture fragments and usually result in dubious functional outcomes. Primary reconstruction of the severely comminuted posterior wall using the autologous tricortical iliac crest graft has shown promising results, especially in fractures not amenable for anatomical reduction and fixation. Thus, the present study analyses the functional and radiological outcomes of severely comminuted posterior wall acetabular fractures, primarily reconstructed with an autologous tricortical iliac crest graft. Methodology This is a retrospective study, where all cases of comminuted posterior wall acetabulum fractures treated primarily with reconstruction using ipsilateral autologous tricortical iliac crest graft between January 2011 and November 2018 were included. The data of patients were retrieved from the hospital records and all the patients were assessed clinically and radiologically at the final follow-up. Results Fourteen patients (ten males and four females) were operated on with a mean operative time of 160 min (range 125 to 190 min) and a mean blood loss of 410 ml (range 320 ml to 830 ml). At 2 years of follow-up, 11 patients (78.57%) had good to excellent functional outcomes based on the modified Merle d'Aubigne and Postel scoring system. The radiological assessment using Matta's criteria indicated excellent outcomes in two patients (14.48%), good in six patients (42.85%), fair in six patients (42.85%). Conclusion Primary reconstruction of the comminuted posterior wall acetabulum fractures is a potential alternative and salvageable option with favourable outcomes. However, it ought to be considered in severely comminuted fractures where anatomical reduction and internal fixation is not feasible.

   Petrous cholesteatoma is rare but frequently leads to complications. A thorough radiological evaluation helps in identifying the pathology and the extent of disease. Sound anatomical knowledge is vital for the planning of surgical approach to get adequate access without damaging important structures. Presentations in congenital lesions are varied due to the uneven growth model of the temporal bone. To the best of our knowledge, the pattern of involvement in this case has never been reported earlier.

KW  - INJURIES
AB  - The most common cause of pneumoperitoneum in trauma patients is hollow viscus injury; however, in patients with pneumoperitoneum on imaging and normal hollow viscus during the laparotomy, other rare causes of pneumoperitoneum like intraperitoneal urinary bladder rupture should be ruled out. Urinary bladder can rupture either extraperitoneally or intraperitoneally or both. Rupture of the urinary bladder is commonly seen in patients with abdominal trauma; however, pneumoperitoneum is usually not seen in patients with traumatic bladder rupture. Intraperitoneal bladder rupture is usually due to the sudden rise in intra-abdominal pressure following abdominal or pelvic trauma. However, it is a rare cause of pneumoperitoneum and is managed by surgical repair. We present a case of blunt trauma abdomen with pneumoperitoneum due to isolated intraperitoneal bladder rupture who was managed by exploratory laparotomy and primary repair of the urinary bladder.

AB  - Objective: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed formidable challenges, including overwhelming biomedical waste management. Guidelines have been rapidly changing along with the mounting pressure of waste generation.
   Methods: These challenges were managed by smart re-engineering of structure and processes for the desired outcomes. Dedicated staff, in personal protective equipment with appropriate training, were deployed to collect waste using dedicated trolleys. A dedicated route plan was drawn with a dedicated elevator meant for COVID-19. A new temporary holding area was created. Dedicated trucks with requisite labels were deployed to transport COVID-19 waste to a common biomedical waste treatment facility. Communication challenges were addressed through timely circulars, which were further reinforced and reiterated during various on-going training programs.
   Results: Before the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the amount of biomedical waste generated was 1.93 kg/bed/day; currently, the quantity of COVID-19 biomedical waste generated is 7.76 kg/COVID bed/day. Daily COVID-19 waste generation data are maintained and uploaded in an android application monitored by Central Pollution Control Board, Government of India. To date, none of the workers handling COVID-19 waste has acquired health-care associated COVID-19 infection, which reflects on the soundness of the new system and the infection control practices in the institute.
   Conclusions: A responsive leadership harmonizing with a robust communication and training system has augmented timely re-engineering of structure and processes for better outcomes in the war on waste.

AB  - Objective Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important outcome for paediatric cancer studies. We compared the HRQoL between patients of progressive paediatric solid tumours randomised to metronomic chemotherapy versus placebo.
   Methods In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomised study of 108 children with progressive malignancies, HRQoL was evaluated using the PedsQOL Cancer module V.3 at baseline (A1), A2 (9 weeks or earlier if progressed) or A3 (18 weeks or earlier if progressed).
   Results There was no statistically significant difference in the change in quality of life produced by each arm from A1 to A2 in either mean total scores or individual domain scores, reported by children or their parents. On analysing the response according to the minimal clinically important difference, defined as an improvement by 4.5 points, we found no significant differences, be it among bone-sarcomas, other tumours, responders (those who received >= 9 weeks of treatment) or non-responders.
   Conclusions The present study concludes that there was no significant difference in HRQoL, between the patients in the two arms at second and later assessments. This is consistent with the other survival endpoints in the study.

AB  - Buerger's disease or thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) is a disease of unknown aetiology. It involves progressive segmental inflammation of small- and medium-sized blood vessels of the limbs which leads to the manifestations of chronic vascular ischemia of peripheral vessels. It is a limb-threatening condition and has a strong association with chronic smoking. The management of TAO has always remained controversial with the number of medical and surgical treatments available. However, so far, none of them has proved to be consistent and promising with the outcomes. The main principle of the management of TAO is to restore the vascular supply of the affected limb to elude pernicious complications like amputation. Since 1989, Ilizarov's method of bone transport has been widely used with satisfactory outcomes to treat bone defects and for limb reconstruction. This principle of distraction osteogenesis not only promotes bone formation but also the adjoining soft-tissue growth. This advantage has been popularized over decades for its significant implication in the neovascularization of ischemic limb in the management of TAO.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that presents with acute febrile illness associated with rash, arthralgia and conjunctivitis. After years of sporadic reports in Africa, the three major outbreaks of this disease occurred in Yap Islands (2007), French Polynesia (2013-14) and South Americas (2015-16). Although, serological surveys suggested the presence of ZIKV in India in 1950s, cross-reactivity could not be ruled out. The first four proven cases of ZIKV from India were reported in 2017. This was followed by major outbreaks in the states of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in 2018. Fortunately, the outbreaks in India were not associated with neurological complications. These outbreaks in India highlighted the spread of this disease beyond geographical barriers owing to the growing globalization, increased travel and ubiquitous presence of its vector, the Aedes mosquito. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, clinical features and management of ZIKV in India.
