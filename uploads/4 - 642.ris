AB  - BACKGROUND: Predicted increases in suicide were not generally observed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the picture may be changing and patterns might vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide a timely, granular picture of the pandemic's impact on suicides globally.
METHODS: We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries, searching websites and academic literature and contacting data custodians and authors as necessary. We sent our first data request on 22nd June 2021 and stopped collecting data on 31st October 2021. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemic's emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age- and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed and expected numbers of suicides in the pandemic's first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation.
FINDINGS: We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income; 25 with whole-country data, 12 with data for area(s)-within-the-country, four with both). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis; more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countries' COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, economic support level, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. Nor were they explained by countries' income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well.
INTERPRETATION: Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these countries/areas-within-countries are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.
FUNDING: None.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the effect of subthreshold micropulse yellow laser treatment on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and to compare two laser protocols. As per our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the two protocols of subthreshold laser.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with non-resolving CSC of at least three months duration were treated with subthreshold laser (577 nm). Ten patients were treated with 5% duty cycle (group A) and 13 patients with 10% duty cycle (group B). At one month, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), subretinal fluid (SRF), choroidal thickness (CT) and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were evaluated.
RESULTS: In group A, BCVA improved from 0.508 ± 504 to 0.174 ± 0.171 (P = 0.0058), CMT improved from 349.8 ± 168.9 micrometers (μm) to 183.3 ± 70.312 μm (P = 0.0093) and SRF reduced from 202.4 ± 158.024 to 43.8 ± 46.599 μm (P = 0.0069). In group B, BCVA improved from 0.437 ± 0.426 to 0.289 ± 0.470 (P = 0.0026), CMT improved from 280.846 ± 72.668 to 196.769 ± 72.62 μm (P = 0.0002) and SRF reduced from 110.385 ± 57.687 μm to 52.538 ± 52.111 μm (P = 0.0064). No significant difference was found in BCVA and CMT between the groups (P = 0.8716 and P = 0.8523, respectively). CSC completely resolved in 50% of cases in group A and in 69.2% of cases in group B. This difference was not statistically significant (0.423); however, the odds ratio of resolution was 2.25 times more with 10% duty cycle. No change was observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) following laser.
CONCLUSION: Subthreshold micropulse laser can lead to resolution of SRF in 60.87% of cases (groups A and B combined). Ten per cent duty cycle had higher odds of resolution without causing any RPE damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge of Indian patients with sarcoma about their illness in the sarcoma medical oncology clinic of a tertiary care centre.
METHOD: This prospective cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was done on patients attending the adult sarcoma clinic at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Patients aged between 18 and 60 years who gave consent and could understand Hindi or English were recruited for the study. A questionnaire (bilingual - English/Hindi) was given to the patients in the language they understood. The questionnaire captured the knowledge of patients about their illness (cancer/sarcoma), sub-type of sarcoma, the occurrence of the disease (common or rare), origin (bone or soft tissue), metastatic or non-metastatic and the understanding of the possibility of recurrence/progression.
RESULT: There were 102 patients in the study with a median age of 31.5 years. About 62% of patients had soft tissue sarcomas, and the rest had bone sarcomas. The most common sarcoma in the studied population was Ewing's sarcoma (23.5%). Metastatic disease was present in 48 (47.1%) of the total patients studied. About 87.2% of patients were aware that they had some form of cancer, and only 62 (69.9%) patients said that they had sarcoma. Only 55 of the 102 patients (56%) knew that the illness was rare. About 70.6% of patients knew about their disease's actual stage. More patients with metastatic disease understood the stage correctly (35 of 54 patients) as compared to patients with the non-metastatic disease (37 of 48 patients) (77% versus 64.8%, p = 0.001). About 77% of patients reported the site of origin of cancer correctly. The patients who had a higher level of education and belonged to a higher socioeconomic status had significantly better knowledge regarding the diagnosis, stage, rarity and prognosis of the disease.
CONCLUSION: Our patients have poor knowledge about different types of sarcomas, and very few patients know that sarcoma is a rare malignancy. The most crucial factor that influenced the knowledge was the level of education. Through this study, we could identify the sub-group wherein the knowledge gap was significant. Thus, active patient education programmes can help these patients to identify their illness and henceforth therapeutically manage it more wisely.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive DECT based characterization of renal stones using their effective atomic number (Zeff) and the electron density (ρe) in patients.
AIM: This paper aims to develop a method for in-vivo characterization of renal stone. Differentiation of renal stones in-vivo especially sub types of calcium stones have very important advantage for better judgement of treatment modality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 extracted renal stones were scanned ex-vivo using dual energy CT scanner. A method was developed to characterize these renal stones using effective atomic number and electron density obtained from dual energy CT data. The method and formulation developed in ex-vivo experiments was applied in in-vivo study of 50 randomly selected patients of renal stones who underwent dual energy CT scan.
RESULTS: The developed method was able to characterize Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (COM) and the combination of COM and Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD) stones non-invasively in patients with a sensitivity of 81% and 83%respectively. The method was also capable of differentiating Uric, Cystine and mixed stones with the sensitivity of 100, 100 and 85.71% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The developed dual energy CT based method was capable of differentiating sub types of calcium stones which is not differentiable on single energy or dual energy CT images.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings of tissue samples obtained from patients with radial longitudinal deficiency (RLD) and investigate the contribution of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.
METHODS: Specimens from radial-sided muscles and tendons were obtained at the time of surgery (either radialization or centralization) from 14 patients with 16 limbs affected with Bayne type 3 and type 4 RLD. The specimens were evaluated using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical examination.
RESULTS: Among the 16 frozen muscle specimens, 6 (37%) showed normal muscle, while 10 (63%) showed the presence of atrophic fibers. The 6 cases with normal muscle showed no abnormality in fiber type distribution. Six patients showed predominance of type 1 muscle fibers. None of the specimens had myofibroblasts; 4 of 16 specimens had mast cells, and 9 of 16 specimens showed the presence of platelet derived growth factor-positive cells. Features of myofibroblasts (the presence of basal lamina, intercellular junctions, or pinocytic vesicles) were not identified in any specimen on electron microscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: The histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings, in particular the absence of myofibroblasts, in tissue samples obtained from patients with RLD, do not support the assumption of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides a preliminary insight into a possible role of soft tissues in the development of the deformity in RLD.

The purpose of the case report is to describe the treatment of metachronous second primary carcinoma of soft palate by high-dose-rate, remote, afterload brachytherapy. The brachytherapy was done in remote settings by afterloading Iridium 192 isotope carried through a custom fabricated surface mold. The mold enabled good adaptation, stability, and repeatable positioning of the radiation source at each treatment session of fractionated brachytherapy offering consistent dosimetric advantage through a single dosimetry calculation. Collaborative efforts of radiation oncologist and prosthodontist ensured conservative treatment in outpatient set up with minimal adverse effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Burn care in India is limited by multiple constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures restricted access to non-COVID emergency conditions, including burns. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the pandemic on burn care in India.
METHODS: Using the qualitative exploratory methods, we conducted in-depth interviews (IDI) with plastic and general surgeons representing burn units from across India. Participants were selected purposively to ensure representation and diversity and the sample size was guided by thematic saturation. Thematic analysis was undertaken adopting an inductive coding using NVivo 12 Pro.
RESULTS: 19 participants from diverse geographic locations and provider types were interviewed. Three major emerging themes were, change in patient and burn injury characteristics; health system barriers, adaptation, and challenges; and lessons and emerging recommendations for policy and practice. There was change in patient load, risk factors, and distribution of burns. The emergency services were intermittently disrupted, the routine and surgical services were rationally curtailed, follow-up and rehabilitation services were most affected. Measures like telemedicine and decentralising burn services emerged as the most important lesson.
CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing pandemic has compounded the challenges for burns care in India. Urgent action is required to prioritise targeted prevention, emergency transport, decentralise service delivery, and harnessing technology for ensuring resilience in burns services.

AB  - Angina is a type of chest pain, experienced by patients with ischemic heart diseases. Cardiac autonomic modulation as assessed by heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity is found reduced in ischemic heart disease patients. Marked reduction in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity in ischemic heart disease patients is found associated with sudden cardiac death. We report a case of a 35-year-old man who presented with angina for the last few months. Thorough investigations showed no evidence of any cardiac or other systemic diseases. However, his cardiovascular autonomic modulation (as assessed by heart rate variability) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity were markedly reduced. The patient had sudden death within 6 months of follow-up. Reportedly, no other specific abnormalities were found before death. This case report suggests that patients presenting with typical chest pain as angina may have severe dysautonomia and risk of sudden death even in the absence of cardiovascular or any other known end-organ diseases.

AB  - PURPOSE: Evaluation of fluorescein along with blue dye as an affordable tracer for sentinel node biopsy in comparison with technetium + methylene blue. A randomized trial was conducted with the following objectives: (1) to demonstrate that the identification of sentinel lymph node by fluorescein + methylene blue is not inferior to the identification by Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue and (2) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of sentinel node biopsy by above two tracers.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One-thirty patients above age 18 years presenting with early breast cancer T1, T2, N0 breast carcinoma were randomized to undergo sentinel node biopsy by either fluorescein + methylene blue or Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue.
RESULTS: The sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 89% in Fluorescein + methylene blue group and 90.9% with Tc-99 m sulfur colloid + methylene blue group. The trial demonstrated noninferiority of fluorescein + methylene blue as compared to isotope + methylene blue with effect size = 1; 95% confidence interval- 9.54 to + 11.54. The fluorescein + methylene blue was more cost-effective than isotope guided sentinel node biopsy.
CONCLUSION: Fluorescein-guided sentinel node biopsy is noninferior and more cost-effective than isotope-guided sentinel node biopsy.

AB  - Introduction India is the biggest contributor to the global incidence of tuberculosis (TB). A major reason behind the persistently high incidence of TB in India is treatment loss-to-follow-up (LTFU). The consequences of LTFU include continuous transmission to uninfected individuals, drug resistance, and a higher rate of death in incompletely treated patients. It is a significant hurdle to making India 'TB-Free' by 2025. Hence, we conducted a community-based qualitative study to understand the determinants of treatment of LTFU in TB patients in the Faridabad district of Haryana, India.  Methodology We enrolled TB patients who had completed treatment as well as those who had been LTFU. We also enrolled National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) functionaries, healthcare providers, family members, and community members. In-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to understand stakeholders' perceptions of reasons for LTFU. The grounded theory approach was used with inductive analysis. Data were triangulated from stakeholders' interviews. Themes and sub-themes were identified. A Health Belief Model for TB treatment completion was developed. Results Fifty-eight IDIs and four FGDs were conducted between May-June 2018. The major themes influencing the treatment of LTFU which emerged from the analyses were - the role of external motivators, regular use of alcohol, lack of/or inappropriate knowledge related to treatment, lack of family support, and side effects of anti-tubercular drugs, and a poor experience with the health system. Stigma was not found to be a major determinant - in the few cases that it affected treatment, it spurred treatment completion rather than LTFU. "I completed the course with great difficulty. Then they started it again! […] I said-Sorry, sir, I can't go through this again. It's better to die once than to die a thousand deaths." - Fifty-one-year-old male patient who was lost-to-follow-up on re-treatment. Discussion This study was a comprehensive multi-stakeholder qualitative undertaking to identify the determinants of LTFU. Our qualitative approach explained the associations between LTFU and certain factors (e.g.: alcohol use, side effects, etc.) found in previous quantitative studies. The strength of this study was that we ensured participation by patients as well as all district-level stakeholders from the national health programme, which no previous qualitative study on the treatment LTFU in India had achieved. The entire qualitative analysis was done manually and in Hindi (the language in which interviews were conducted). Hence, no data were lost in translation. The limitation was that its findings were specific to the study area and study population, as is the case with all qualitative studies. Conclusion All healthcare providers should be sensitised to the determinants of treatment LTFU, so that they can pay special attention to at-risk patients and take appropriate steps to prevent LTFU. For instance, patients with a pattern of regular alcohol use should be counselled and may be referred to deaddiction centres, with the continuum of care maintained. The journey from tuberculosis diagnosis to treatment completion is often extremely traumatic for the patient. The onus to successfully complete treatment lies not with the patient alone, but with the health system as well.

AB  - Improving postural stability of lower limb amputees by integrating vibrotactile sensory feedback (VF) with balancing exercises has been proved advantageous. However, the cortical processes engaged in human balance control which process the VF and help to improve postural stability remain elusive. To this end, Electroencephalography in synchronization with the center of pressure (CoP) signals was collected from six transfemoral amputees during a balance control task in two sessions: with and without VF. The improved limit of stability (LOS) during the balance task with VF was in response to elicited strong theta and gamma oscillations. The secondary somatosensory cortex-S2 (contralateral to amputated side) processes the sensory information from VF by significantly reducing the theta spectral power. Additionally, the fronto-central (FC) region executed the motor response to improve the LOS by significantly increasing the gamma power. The intra-regional functional-connectivity at the S2 and FC region was significantly stronger with VF, in comparison to no feedback condition, and the two regions (S2 and FC) were strongly connected while perceiving the VF during forward voluntary sway in comparison to no feedback sessions. These findings provide fundamental insights into the cortical activity associated with the VF and helps in understanding the cortical mechanism of balance improvement in transfemoral amputees.

AB  - Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is constitutively active in almost every cell of our body at basal level. This self-eating process primarily serves to remove superfluous constituents of the cells and recycle the degraded products. Autophagy plays an essential role in cell homeostasis and can be enhanced in response to stressful conditions. Impairment in the regulation of the autophagic pathway is implicated in pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cardiac disorders, and cancer. However, the role of autophagy in cancer initiation and development is controversial and context-dependent. Evidence from various studies has shown that autophagy serves dual purpose and may assist in cancer progression or suppression. In the early stages of cancer initiation, autophagy acts as a quality control mechanism and prevents cancer development. When cancer is established and progresses to a later stage, autophagy helps in the survival of these cells through adaptation to stresses, including exposure to anti-cancer drugs. In this review, we highlight various studies on autophagic pathways and describe the role of autophagy in cancer, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also discuss the prognostic significance of autophagy genes involved in AML leukemogenesis and implications in conferring resistance to chemotherapy.

AB  - We report a case of omicron infection in a biopsy-proven case of carcinoma breast sent for staging F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) during the omicron COVID wave. FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) revealed increased FDG uptake in nasopharyngeal, oropharynx, and tonsillar regions and bilateral cervical lymph nodes along with uptake in primary carcinoma and locoregional lymph nodes. Based on the clinical history and specific pattern of FDG PET/CT findings (as suggested by SNMMI Taskforce), COVID history and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction positivity was elicited.

AB  - We present a case of a 23-year-old male patient with complaints of fever, cough, and persistent anemia for the past 6 months and with a known history of hereditary spherocytosis. Computed tomography (CT) thorax demonstrated multiple paravertebral lesions in the bilateral thoracic cavities, suggestive of lymphadenopathy; subsequently, 18Flurodeoxyglucose PET/CT was done with suspicion of lymphoma, which showed no significant metabolic activity in those lesions. Thus, in view of clinical and metabolic status, lesions were considered extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). This case highlights the importance of considering EMH, while interpreting suspicious lymphadenopathy in cases of chronic anemia and also possible scan findings in the same.

AB  - BACKGROUND: FOXO3, a member of the FOX transcription factor family, is frequently described as being deregulated in cancer. Additionally, notable role of FOXO3 can be easily recognized in the process of ageing and survival. Even though various studies have been done to acknowledge the tumour-suppressive or oncogenic role of FOXO3 in cancer, still there exist a lack of understanding in terms of cancer prognosis and treatment. Therefore, to provide better insight, our study aims to evaluate the role and function of FOXO3 in breast cancer in Indian female patients. We examined the FOXO3 expression levels in breast cancer samples by analyzing mRNA and protein expression along with its clinicopathological parameters.
RESULTS: A total of 127 cases of breast cancer with equal normal cases (n=127) were assessed with methylation (MS-PCR), Immunohistochemistry (IHC), mRNA expression using Real-time PCR was analysed and 66.14% cases at mRNA level were found to be downregulated, while 81.10% of cases had little or very little protein expression. Our data state, the promoter hypermethylation of the FOXO3 gene and the downregulated protein expression are significantly correlated (p=0.0004). Additionally, we found a significant correlation between the level of FOXO3 mRNA with ER (p=0.04) and status of lymph node (p=0.01) along with this.
CONCLUSION: Data suggests the prognostic significance and the tumour-suppressive role of FOXO3 in breast cancer cases studied in India. However, there is a need for the extended research targeting FOXO3 to measure its clinical potential and develop well-defined therapeutic strategies.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This was a double-blind randomized study.
PURPOSE: The primary purpose was to compare the effects of propofol and ketofol on amplitudes and latencies of transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs) during thoracolumbar spine surgery. In addition, intraoperative hemodynamics and muscle power were compared.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Propofol is commonly used during intraoperative TcMEP monitoring. However, propofol inhibits TcMEP amplitudes and causes hypotension in a dose-dependent fashion.
METHODS: Amplitude and latency of TcMEPs were recorded bilaterally from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and abductor hallucis (AH) muscles in 38 adult American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II patients undergoing thoracolumbar spine surgery. Baseline recordings of TcMEPs in both groups were recorded under propofol infusion. Group X patients then received propofol and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg/hr), and group Y patients received ketofol and fentanyl (1 mcg/kg/hr). Bispectral index was maintained at 40-60 in both groups. Amplitude and latency were recorded at 30 minutes intervals for 2 hours.
RESULTS: Propofol caused no significant changes in amplitude and latency in any muscle. In contrast, amplitude increased significantly at all time points in the bilateral APB muscles and 60, 90, and 120 minutes in the left AH muscle without changes in latency in response to ketofol. When the two groups were compared, ketofol induced significantly higher amplitudes at 60, 90, and 120 minutes in the (left) APB, at all time points in the (right) APB, and at 120 minutes in both AH muscles, compared with propofol. Blood pressures were lower and fluid and vasopressor requirements were higher in group X. Muscle power was similar between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Ketofol facilitates TcMEP amplitudes without affecting latency. Use of ketofol resulted in a better and more stable hemodynamic profile than did use of propofol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of autoantibody generation in anti-factor H (FH) antibody associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is unknown and is perhaps triggered by an infectious or environmental agent. We observed an unusual increase of patients with anti-FH antibody associated aHUS coinciding with the second pandemic wave in New Delhi and suspected that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be a potential trigger.
METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology in 13 consecutive patients with anti-FH antibody associated aHUS during the past year in New Delhi.
RESULTS: We report 5 patients, 4-13 years old, who presented with a febrile illness without respiratory symptoms during the second pandemic wave. Of these, 3 patients presented with a relapse 25-85 months following the initial episode of aHUS. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in 1 patient and by serology in 4 patients (median titer 47.1 cut-off index). Patients had high titers of anti-FH antibodies (median 2,300 AU/ml). Genetic studies, done in 3 of the 5 patients, showed homozygous CFHR1 deletion without other significant genetic abnormalities. Specific management comprised plasma exchanges and oral prednisolone, combined with either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. At median follow-up of 3.3 months, the estimated glomerular filtration rate in 4 patients ranged from 62 to 110 ml/min/1.73 m2; one patient was dialysis-dependent.
CONCLUSION: Increased vigilance is required during the pandemic, especially in patients with anti-FH associated aHUS, who might relapse despite quiescent disease for a prolonged period. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.

AB  - Poor infant young child feeding (IYCF) practices result in malnutrition, poor psychosocial development, poor school performance and less productivity in later life, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle. The current study aims to characterize the IYCF practices during the first year of life in a maternal-child birth cohort (DHANI) in Belagavi, Karnataka, India. We collected data from the dyad at birth, 6 and 12 months postpartum. We examined dietary diversity among these infants at 12 months using WHO criteria. A total of 902 live births were recorded, and 878 mother-child pairs completed the 12-month follow up. The overall prevalence of early (within 1 h of delivery) initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) was 77.9%, and that of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) at 6 months was 52.4%. At 12 months, most (90%) infants were breastfed, while 39% also received formula. The large majority (94.4%) of infants met minimum meal frequency (MMF), but only 55% of infants were receiving a minimum acceptable diet (MAD). The mean dietary diversity (DD) score was 4.7 ± 1.1. Only 21.9% of infants consumed egg and/or flesh food. A large proportion (33.8%) of infants received no vegetables and/or fruits till 12 months of age. Consumption of sweet beverage was 4.8%, but consumption of ultra-processed foods high in trans-fats, sugars and salt was high (85.8%). High-quality, sustainable and scalable interventions to enhance knowledge and support positive behaviour change for adopting and implementing better IYCF practices may be urgently needed in low- and middle-income group settings to improve diet diversity and overall nutritional intake amongst young children.

TI  - Drug-Induced vs. Viral Maculopapular Exanthem-Resolving the Dilemma
AU  - Khandpur, Sujay

T2  - Dermatopathology (Basel, Switzerland)
AB  - Maculopapular exanthem is a commonly encountered presentation in routine clinical practice, and differentiation between its two most common etiologies, i.e., viral- and drug-induced, often poses a diagnostic dilemma. Clinical, hematological and biochemical investigations are seldom reliable in distinguishing between a drug reaction and a viral exanthem. Certain key histopathological features such as the presence of a moderate degree of spongiosis, extensive basal cell damage with multiple necrotic keratinocytes and dermal infiltrate rich in eosinophils or lymphocytes and histiocytes may favor a drug exanthem, while distinctive epidermal cytopathic changes and lymphocytic vasculitis point towards a viral etiology. Similarly, notable immunohistochemical markers such as IL-5, eotaxin and FAS ligand may support a diagnosis of a drug-induced maculopapular eruption. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations may help in distinguishing between the two etiologies when faced with a clinical overlap, especially in patients on multiple essential drugs when drug withdrawal and rechallenge is not feasible.

T2  - Journal of Neurosciences in Rural Practice
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We have very little information about sexual activity and concerns of patients with myelopathy from India. The objectives of this study were to assess the sexual dysfunction and sexual concerns among patients with myelopathy due to spinal cord lesion (SCL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a single-center, cross-sectional, and hospital-based study among male and female patients in the age-group 18-50 years, with disability due to myelopathy due to SCL. The data were collected using a self-designed, pretested, and semi-structured questionnaire by face-to-face interview.
RESULTS: Eighty participants were recruited in the study, of which 62 (77.5%) were men. The mean standard deviation (SD) age of the participants was 33.7 (8.6) years, and mean (SD) age at time of illness was 31.4 (8.6) years with median duration of 17 months. Among 62 males, psychogenic erection was impaired in 77.2%, reflex erection was impaired in 78.9%, and ejaculation was affected in 70.7%. Orgasm was absent or reduced in 66.1% males. Among 18 female participants, psychogenic genital arousal was reduced in 66.5%, reflex genital arousal was impaired in 55.5%, and orgasm was absent in 38.8% subjects. Sexual desire in these patients was unchanged in 41 (51.2%) and decreased or absent in 39 (48.8%). Sexual activity involvement was there in 46 (57.5%) and 34 (42.5%) had not involved in any kind of sexual activity after injury/illness. The main reasons of non-involvement in sexual activity were bladder and bowel accidents, spasticity, and difficulty in positioning.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive neurological rehabilitation should address sexual function of affected individual to allow them highest level of function and quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sedation and analgesia are the integral components of modern-day upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures. Irrespective of the sedative agent, hypoxia is the most commonly encountered unwarranted event with sedation. The current study intends to scrutinize whether high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is advantageous for providing respiratory support during upper GI endoscopic procedures over other conventional low-flow oxygen delivery modalities, e.g. nasal cannula, facemask, etc. METHODS: An extensive screening of electronic databases was done till July 31, 2022, after enlisting in International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021245409). Randomized controlled trials (RCT), comparative cohort studies, case series, cross-sectional studies and case-control studies evaluating the utility of HFNO during upper GI endoscopy under sedation were included in this meta-analysis.
RESULTS: We retrieved eight randomized control studies and one longitudinal study with 3294 patients. The application of HFNO during endoscopy led to lesser incidence of desaturation spells (odds ratio [OR] = 0.23; 95% CI 0.11-0.48; I2 = 71%), reduced procedural interruption (OR = 0.11; 95% CI 0.02-0.60; I2 = 88%), better nadir SpO2 level during procedure (mean difference [MD] = 3.16; 95% CI 0.54-5.78; I2 = 73%), overall lesser incidence of sedation-related adverse events (OR = 0.63; 95% CI 0.42-0.93; I2 = 25%), with no significant impact on the duration of endoscopy (MD = 0.15; 95% CI - 0.02 to 0.31, I2 = 0%).
CONCLUSION: HFNO is a novel option for upper GI endoscopy under sedation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The utility of instantaneous evaluation of coagulation during primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is paramount in the context of empirical blood product transfusion-related risk of dilutional and consumptive coagulopathy and circulatory overload.
METHODS: A profound screening of electronic databases till August 15, 2022 was carried out after being enlisted in PROSPERO (CRD42021275514). Randomized control studies, comparative cohort studies, and cross-sectional studies comparing point-of-care viscoelastic test guided blood product transfusion with empirical transfusion in patients with PPH were included.
RESULTS: We retrieved five studies, with a total of 1914 parturient with PPH. Patients receiving transfusion based upon point of care viscoelastic tests had lesser risk of having emergency hysterectomy (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.95, I2 = 7%), transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) (OR = 0.03, 95% CI 0.00-0.50), reduced transfusion of fresh frozen plasma (OR = 0.07, 95% CI 0.04-0.14, I2 = 89%), platelets (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.91, I2 = 89%), packed red blood cell transfusion (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.88, I2 = 89%), and had better cost-effective treatment [Mean difference (MD) = -357.5, 95% CI - 567.75 to -147.25, I2 = 93%] than patient received empirical transfusion. However, there was no significant difference in the requirement of ICU admissions (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.46-1.29, I2 = 82%). No mortality was detected across the studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Point of care viscoelastic assessment guided transfusion in PPH confederates with reduced morbidity. Nevertheless, more studies on the triggering values for transfusion, long-term survival, and cost-benefit in patients with PPH are warranted to establish its utility.

AB  - CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGLs) have recently been shown to be associated with lower bone mineral density (BMD) and trabecular bone score as compared to healthy controls suggesting low bone mineral concentration and disrupted bone microarchitecture. There is paucity of data on prevalence and clinical predictors of low BMD/osteoporosis in PPGL from India and the extent of change in BMD post-operatively.
AIMS: This study aimed to find prevalence of low BMD/osteoporosis and trabecular bone score (TBS)-adjusted FRAX score in subjects with PPGL and to see the post-operative change in BMD and TBS at follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 32 consecutively diagnosed adult cases with PPGL were enrolled. Although the provisional diagnosis of PPGL was made based on imaging consistent with PPGL supported by biochemical evidence of catecholamine excess, its confirmation was made histopathologically before final analysis.
RESULTS: We found significantly low average BMD T-score/Z-score at spine, hip or wrist. Osteoporosis was evident in 87.5% of subjects (nine of 11 post-menopausal women or men >50 years of age) and BMD below the expected range for age in 42.9% of subjects (nine of 21 pre-menopausal women or men <50 years of age) by International Society for Clinical Densitometry criteria.
CONCLUSIONS: 87% of older subjects with PPGL had osteoporosis while 43% of younger subjects had BMD below expected range for age (Z-score ≤-2.0), more at lumbar spine than at hip. Decreased body weight was associated with osteoporosis in older or Z-score ≤-2.0 in younger subjects. There was no significant change in BMD and TBS scores at a median of four months post-operatively.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus has been rapidly evolving over the time and the genetic variation has led to the generation of Variants of Concerns (VoC), which have shown increased fitness. These VoC viruses contain the key mutations in the spike protein which have allowed better survival and evasion of host defense mechanisms. The D614G mutation in the spike domain is found in the majority of VoC; additionally, the P681R/H mutation at the S1/S2 furin cleavage site junction is also found to be highly conserved in major VoCs; Alpha, Delta, Omicron, and its' current variants. The impact of these genetic alterations of the SARS-CoV-2 VoCs on the host cell entry, transmissibility, and infectivity has not been clearly identified. In our study, Delta and D614G + P681R synthetic double mutant pseudoviruses showed a significant increase in the cell entry, cell-to-cell fusion and infectivity. In contrast, the Omicron and P681H synthetic single mutant pseudoviruses showed TMPRSS2 independent cell entry, less fusion and infectivity as compared to Delta and D614G + P681R double mutants. Addition of exogenous trypsin further enhanced fusion in Delta viruses as compared to Omicron. Furthermore, Delta viruses showed susceptibility to both E64d and Camostat mesylate inhibitors suggesting, that the Delta virus could exploit both endosomal and TMPRSS2 dependent entry pathways as compared to the Omicron virus. Taken together, these results indicate that the D614G and P681R/H mutations in the spike protein are pivotal which might be favoring the VoC replication in different host compartments, and thus allowing a balance of mutation vs selection for better long-term adaptation.

AB  - Inflammatory well-differentiated liposarcoma is a rare soft-tissue tumor which is predominantly retroperitoneal in origin. We report a 72-year-old male without co-morbidities with suspected urosepsis and an obstructing ureteric calculus. Despite adequate diversion and broad-spectrum antimicrobials, the leukocytosis persisted. Further imaging revealed a locally infiltrating prepubic mass which was suspicious of a lymphoid malignancy and was found to be a high-grade liposarcoma on biopsy. He underwent open wide local resection of the tumor and the histopathology revealed an inflammatory well-differentiated liposarcoma with areas of neutrophilic abscess and necrosis. A dramatic response to the surgical resection was seen and the leukocytosis resolved within a few days.

AB  - PURPOSE: The study sought to describe the clinical presentation pattern of pediatric cataracts and factors leading to delay in surgery at a tertiary care center in North India.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, interview-based study was conducted from January 2020 to October 2020, that included pediatric patients <12 years, with unilateral or bilateral congenital or developmental cataract. A pre-validated questionnaire was used to record data. The parameters recorded were age at first symptoms, age at diagnosis of cataract, age at surgery, laterality of cataract, first symptom, first family member noticing the abnormality, the morphology of cataract, association of perinatal complications, family history, systemic diseases, and cause (s) of delay in surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were included. The mean age of subjects was 4.75(±3.51) years. A white pupil was the most common symptom (64.04%) and appeared in infancy in 30.3% of cases. Parents first detected the problem in 60.67%, and the pediatrician was the first medical contact in 11.23% of cases. The median (IQR) delay period between diagnosis of cataract and cataract surgery was 4 (3-6) months, the major causes were long GA waiting (30.33%), and delay due to systemic ill health (14.61%).
CONCLUSION: Parental education on cataract detection is recommended to help in the timely detection and hence, improved outcomes of pediatric cataract surgery. Pediatricians, consulted for any systemic illness, have the role of the second most important contact in the detection of pediatric cataract.

AB  - Traditional Indian medical practices (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, and homeopathy) are a vast reservoir of knowledge about medicinal plants. The promising pharmacological properties of these plants have paved the way for developing therapy against novel Coronavirus (CoV) infection. The current review will summarize published works of literature on the effects of traditional Indian medicinal plants against acute respiratory infection (COVID-19, SARS, Influenza, and Respiratory syncytial virus infection) and registered clinical trials of traditional Indian herbal medicines in COVID-19. The current study aims to comprehensively evaluate the data of traditional Indian medicinal plants to warrant their use in COVID-19 management. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched along with different clinical trial databases. A total of 22 relevant traditional Indian medicinal plants (35 relevant studies) were included in the current study having potential antiviral properties against virus-induced respiratory illness along with promising immunomodulatory and thrombolytic properties. Further, 36 randomized and nonrandomized registered clinical trials were also included that were aimed at evaluating the efficacy of herbal plants or their formulations in COVID-19 management. The antiviral, immunomodulatory, and thrombolytic activities of the traditional Indian medicinal plants laid down a strong rationale for their use in developing therapies against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study identified some important potential traditional Indian medicinal herbs such as Ocimum tenuiflorum, Tinospora cordifolia, Achyranthes bidentata, Cinnamomum cassia, Cydonia oblonga, Embelin ribes, Justicia adhatoda, Momordica charantia, Withania somnifera, Zingiber officinale, Camphor, and Kabusura kudineer, which could be used in therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Vertebral tuberculosis (TB) is a common form of extrapulmonary TB. Here, the slow-growing Mycobacterium bacillus reaches the disc space through the hematogenous route and leads to various complications. Radiological imaging and histopathology have been the mainstay of diagnosis, but radionuclide imaging techniques using radiolabeled antitubercular drugs have rarely found space in the clinical domain. Here, we present a case of vertebral TB, where a technetium-labeled antitubercular drug, ethambutol, was synthesized and used for imaging the bacteria in vivo. Thus, we demonstrate a rarely used potentially specific agent for tuberculous-infection imaging, which can be produced in-house, and provides rapid results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to describe the scintigraphic patterns of 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake in patients who were referred to the department of nuclear medicine for evaluating and diagnosing ectopic gastric mucosa in foregut and midgut duplication cysts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This hospital-based, retrospective cum prospective research spans a period of 8 years from April 2014 to January 2022. Previous hospital medical records were analyzed and subsequently, a database was prepared which included the age, sex, clinical indication of a 99m Tc-pertechnetate scan, and the planar and SPECT-computed tomography (CT) imaging findings. Postoperative histopathological reports were available for 21 patients. Dynamic and planar static imaging was performed. We included SPECT-CT in suspected duplication cysts to increase the sensitivity and specificity which is a tradeoff for a small amount of additional radiation exposure. A total of 69 patients were subjected to a 99m Tc-pertechnetate scan for suspected foregut or midgut duplication cysts. All were subjected to dynamic planar and delayed static images up to 24 h or until focal uptake of radiotracer was noted which corroborated the anatomical findings, whichever was earlier. SPECT-CT was performed along with the planar study in 31 patients which confirmed the findings. Previously performed CT scans were used for anatomical correlation in the remaining ones.
RESULTS: Duplication cysts were localized in a total of 28 patients (19 foregut duplication cysts and 12 small bowel duplications - 3 patients had dual duplication cysts, both foregut, and midgut). Forty-one patients had no scintigraphic evidence of ectopic gastric mucosa. Of these 69 patients, histopathological diagnosis was available for 21 patients (22 lesions). The report was concordant with the scan findings in 15 patients (16 lesions) and 6 patients showed discordance in histopathological diagnosis and scan findings.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, multi-time point imaging is the key to diagnosing ectopic gastric mucosa of various sizes and in various locations. An abnormal radiotracer uptake in dynamic sequences, even before the appearance of the stomach in the region of the small bowel is indicative of intestinal duplication, and delayed radiotracer visualization in the region of the thorax is characteristic of intrathoracic foregut duplication cyst.

AB  - The present prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of OXIS contact areas, namely, O (open type), X (point type), I (straight type), and S (curved type) in the development of approximal caries. We conducted this study among 953 school children with 3,812 contacts in Puducherry, India. At baseline, the contacts were assessed in accordance with OXIS criteria. At the end of 12 months, two calibrated dentists measured dental caries following the International Caries Detection and Assessment (ICDAS) criteria. Information about feeding practices, diet, and oral hygiene was collected by means of a structured questionnaire from each child's parent. Data were analyzed by unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression analysis with a multilevel approach. The two levels of analysis were tooth and child. Of 3,812 contacts observed during the follow-up, 127 (3.3%) were observed as carious. Poisson regression analysis revealed a significant association between type of contact and caries prevalence (p < 0.05). The risk ratios for the development of approximal caries in X contacts were 2.4 (0.3-17.2), p value 0.38; in I contacts 4.9 (1.2-19.9), p value 0.027; and in S contacts 8.2 (1.9-34.2), p value 0.004, when compared with the O contacts. Among the child variables, male gender (relative risk [RR] = 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3, 3.5), parental supervision while toothbrushing (RR = 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1, 2.4), and the use of toothpaste (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3, 3.1) were found to be associated with approximal caries after adjustment for the other variables. Among the OXIS contacts, the S type was most susceptible to approximal caries due to its complex morphology, followed by I, X, and O.

T2  - Clinical Ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this review article is to provide a comprehensive review of the current applications of intravitreal DEX implant (Ozurdex®, Allergan Inc, Irvine, CA) for a variety of ophthalmic conditions - ranging from FDA approved indications to off-label uses. We have attempted to provide relevant evidence from the literature to help a reader develop an understanding of the biological and pharmacokinetic properties of DEX implant, its uses, and potential side effects.
METHODS: PubMed searches were performed using the terms "Ozurdex", or "intravitreal DEX implant", AND "retinal vein occlusion", or "diabetic macular edema", or "uveitis". The search was performed in July of 2021, with an additional search in October 2021. All original English language articles were considered for this review.
RESULTS: DEX implant has evidence of efficacy in a variety of clinical situations including macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion, diabetes, uveitis, and others. Safety concerns include cataract formation and progression, intraocular pressure elevation, complications related to intravitreal injection, and opportunistic infections secondary to steroid-induced immune suppression.
CONCLUSION: DEX implant is a useful tool in the management of several retinal disorders. Further studies are needed for head-to-head comparison with other treatment modalities and to determine its precise place in clinical practice.

AB  - p73 belongs to p53 family transcription factor activating more than 50% of cell fate p53 target genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response alongside neuronal system development and differentiation by binding to 20-bp response elements (REs) having sequence motif (PPPC-A/T-T/A-GYYY) where P-purines and Y-pyrimidines with each 10-bp separated by minimum 0 to 13-bp spacer. The promiscuous nature of recognizing both cell fate and development genes and the underlying RE selectivity mechanism by p73 is not well understood. Here, we report the molecular details of p73 recognizing the REs using the crystal structure of p73 DNA binding domain (DBD) in complex with 12 base pair DNA sequence 5'-cAGGCATGCCTg-3' and molecular dynamics simulations with six different p53 natural promoter sequences. Each 20-base pair natural promoter forms a different major/minor groove due to the presence of nucleotides A/T, A/C, G/G, T/T and G/T at positions 3, 8, 13, 18 uniquely recognized by p73 key residues Lys138 and Arg268. The loops L1 and L3 bearing these residues influence inter-and intra-dimer interfaces interactions and hence p73 forms a unique tetramer with each natural promoter sequence. Structural features of the DNA and the spacing between half-sites influence p73 tetramerization and its transactivation function.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the autonomic function in specific learning disorder (SLD) and comorbid SLD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (SLD-ADHD).
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital with 20 adolescent subjects each of confirmed SLD, SLD-ADHD, and healthy control (mean age 15.32 y). Heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests were carried out using standard protocols.
RESULTS: Heart-rate variability parameters, viz., mean RR interval, number of RR intervals which differ by ≥ 50 ms (NN50), percentage NN50, standard deviation of differences between adjacent RR intervals, root square of mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals, coefficient of variance and absolute power of high-frequency band (HF) recorded apparently lower levels in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control indicating lower parasympathetic tone. Whereas, higher absolute power of low- frequency band (LF) in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated enhanced sympathetic activity. Higher LF/HF and lower SD1/SD2 ratios in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated higher sympathetic tone over parasympathetic tone. Values of autonomic-function tests such as E:I ratio, change in heart rate during deep-breathing test, 30:15 ratio, and Valsalva ratio showed a decrease in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control implying reduction in parasympathetic reactivity. Increased values for rise in diastolic blood pressure in the isometric handgrip test and cold pressor test recorded in SLD as compared to healthy control, revealed the increased sympathetic reactivity.
CONCLUSION: Overall, results of heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests imply dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities with sympathetic dominance in SLD and SLD-ADHD.

AB  - PURPOSE: With age, human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) accumulates bisretinoid fluorophores that may impact cellular function and contribute to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Bisretinoids are comprised of a central pyridinium, dihydropyridinium, or cyclohexadiene ring. The pyridinium bisretinoid A2E has been extensively studied, and its quantity in the macula has been questioned. Age-changes and distributions of other bisretinoids are not well characterized. We measured levels of three bisretinoids and oxidized A2E in macula and periphery in human donor eyes of different ages.
METHODS: Eyes (N = 139 donors, 61 women and 78 men, aged 40-80 years) were dissected into 8 mm diameter macular and temporal periphery punches. Using liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and an authentic synthesized standard, we quantified A2E (ng). Using LC-ESI-MS and a 50-eye-extract of A2E, we semiquantified A2E and 3 other compounds (eye extract equivalent units [EEEUs): A2-glycerophosphoethanolamine (A2GPE), dihydropyridine phosphatidyl ethanolamine (A2DHPE), and monofuranA2E (MFA2E).
RESULTS: A2E quantities in ng and EEEUs were highly correlated (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). From 262 eyes, 5 to 9-fold higher levels were observed in the peripheral retina than in the macula for all assayed compounds. A2E, A2DHPE, and MFA2E increased with age, whereas A2GPE remained unaffected. No significant right-left or male-female differences were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: Significantly higher levels were observed in the periphery than in the macula for all assayed compounds signifying biologic differences between these regions. Levels of oxidized A2E parallel native A2E and not the distribution of retinal illuminance. Data will assist with the interpretion of clinical trial outcomes of agents targeting bisretinoid-related pathways.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are a leading cause of hospitalizations in children, especially due to viral pathogens. We studied the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children aged <5 years hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in Kashmir, India.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study in two tertiary care hospitals from October 2013 to September 2014, systematically enrolling two children aged <5 years with SARI per day. We defined SARI as history of fever or measured fever (≥38°C) and cough with onset in the last 7 days requiring hospitalization for children aged 3-59 months and as physician-diagnosed acute lower respiratory infection for children aged <3 months. Trained study staff screened children within 24 hours of hospitalization for SARI and collected clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs from enrolled participants. We tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza viruses, rhinoviruses (HRV)/enteroviruses, adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A and B, coronaviruses (OC43, NL65, C229E), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4 using standardized duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: Among 4548 respiratory illness admissions screened from October 2013 to September 2014, 1026 met the SARI case definition, and 412 were enrolled (ages = 5 days to 58 months; median = 12 months). Among enrolees, 256 (62%) were positive for any virus; RSV was the most commonly detected (n = 118, 29%) followed by HRV/enteroviruses (n = 88, 21%), PIVs (n = 31, 8%), influenza viruses (n = 18, 4%), BoV (n = 15, 4%), coronaviruses (n = 16, 4%), AdV (n = 14, 3%), and hMPV (n = 9, 2%). Fifty-four children had evidence of virus co-detection. Influenza-associated SARI was more common among children aged 1-5 years (14/18, 78%) while most RSV detections occurred in children <12 months (83/118, 70%). Of the RSV viruses typed (n = 116), the majority were type B (94, 80%). Phylogenetic analysis of G gene of RSV showed circulation of the BA9 genotype with 60bp nucleotide duplication.
CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, contributed to a substantial proportion of SARI hospitalizations among children <5 years in north India. These data can help guide clinicians on appropriate treatment and prevention strategies.

AB  - Background Dietary salt intake is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Estimation of 24-hour salt intake using morning urine samples needs to be validated in the Indian context. We examined the performance of INTERSALT, Tanaka and Kawasaki equations for the estimation of 24-hour urinary sodium from morning fasting urine (MFU) samples. Methods We enrolled 486 adults aged 18-69 years from four regions of India with equal rural/urban and sex representation to provide 24-hour urine samples. The next day, a MFU sample was obtained. Based on the volume and sodium content of the 24-hour urine sample, 24-hour sodium excretion (reference method) was calculated. Sodium levels in the MFU samples were measured along with other parameters required, and the above equations were used to estimate 24-hour urinary sodium levels. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the degree of agreement between the estimates from the reference method and the three equations. Bland-Altman (BA) plots were used to identify systematic bias and limits of agreement. A difference of 1 g of salt (0.39 g of sodium) between the mean salt intake by 24-hour urine and as estimated by equations was considered acceptable. Results A total of 346 participants provided both the samples. The mean (SD) daily salt intake estimated by the 24-hour urine sample method was 9.9 (5.8) g. ICC was low for all the three equations: highest for Kawasaki (0.16; 95% CI 0.05-0.26) and least for Tanaka (0.12; 0.02-0.22). Only Tanaka equation provided estimates within 1 g of measured 24-hour salt intake (-0.36 g). BA plots showed that as the mean values increased, all the three equations provided lower estimates of salt intake. Conclusion Tanaka equation provided acceptable values of 24-hour salt intake at the population level. However, poor performance of all the equations highlights the need to understand the reasons and develop better methods for the measurement of sodium intake at the population level.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: The National Monitoring Framework for the prevention and control of NCDs in India has set targets for reduction of risk factors relative to the measure recorded in 2010. Estimates for 2010 and 2015 were established using meta-analyses in the absence of a national risk factor survey till 2017.
METHODS: We searched national survey reports and also articles published in English from India between 2008 and 2017 in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane review databases for specific risk factors among 18-69 yr Indians. Quality of studies was evaluated using Joanna-Briggs tool, but all studies were included in analyses. Estimates for each of the eight strata by age, gender and place of residence, respectively, were generated. MetaXL was used to calculate the pooled estimate for 2010 and 2015 using a random effects model. Strata-specific estimates were combined to arrive at national estimate using population weight of each stratum. The credibility of the estimates was determined using four parameters - average Briggs score; representativeness of the contributing studies and precision and stability of the estimates.
RESULTS: The estimates [95% confidence interval (CI)] for 2010 for different risk factors were as follows: current alcohol use, 15.7 per cent (13.2-18.2); current tobacco use, 27 per cent (21.4-32.6); household solid fuel use, 61.5 per cent (50.2-72.5); physical inactivity, 44.2 per cent (37.8-50.6); obesity, seven per cent (3.8-10.2) and raised blood pressure, 20.2 per cent (18.4-22.1). In 2015, compared to 2010, tobacco use showed a relative decline of 18 per cent, household solid fuel use of nine per cent and physical inactivity of 15 per cent. The estimates were stable for alcohol use, raised blood pressure and obesity between 2010 and 2015. All estimates varied between moderate and high degrees of credibility.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The estimates are consistent with other available estimates and with current national-level initiatives focused on tobacco control and improving access to clean fuel. These estimates can be used to monitor progress on non-communicable disease risk factor targets for India.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease (COVID-19) has caused more than 6 million deaths globally. Understanding predictors of mortality will help in prioritizing patient care and preventive approaches. This was a multicentric, unmatched, hospital-based case-control study conducted in nine teaching hospitals in India. Cases were microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients who died in the hospital during the period of study and controls were microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 patients who were discharged from the same hospital after recovery. Cases were recruited sequentially from March 2020 until December-March 2021. All information regarding cases and controls was extracted retrospectively from the medical records of patients by trained physicians. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was done to assess the association between various predictor variables and deaths due to COVID-19. A total of 2,431 patients (1,137 cases and 1,294 controls) were included in the study. The mean age of patients was 52.8 years (SD: 16.5 years), and 32.1% were females. Breathlessness was the most common symptom at the time of admission (53.2%). Increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 46-59 years, 3.4 [95% CI: 1.5-7.7]; 60-74 years, 4.1 [95% CI: 1.7-9.5]; and ≥ 75 years, 11.0 [95% CI: 4.0-30.6]); preexisting diabetes mellitus (aOR: 1.9 [95% CI: 1.2-2.9]); malignancy (aOR: 3.1 [95% CI: 1.3-7.8]); pulmonary tuberculosis (aOR: 3.3 [95% CI: 1.2-8.8]); breathlessness at the time of admission (aOR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.4-3.5]); high quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at the time of admission (aOR: 5.6 [95% CI: 2.7-11.4]); and oxygen saturation < 94% at the time of admission (aOR: 2.5 [95% CI: 1.6-3.9]) were associated with mortality due to COVID-19. These results can be used to prioritize patients who are at increased risk of death and to rationalize therapy to reduce mortality due to COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) has been suggested as a biomarker for acute appendicitis (AA) in the adult population. The utility of MPV in pediatric AA remains vague. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically summarize and compare all relevant data on MPV as a diagnostic biomarker for AA in children.
METHODS: Databases were systematically searched using keywords ((mean platelet volume) OR mpv) AND (appendicitis). The inclusion criteria were all comparative studies of MPV in children aged less than 18 years and diagnosed with AA. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality using the Downs and Black scale.
RESULTS: We included fourteen studies in the final meta-analysis; most were retrospective. Eight studies compared the MPV values between AA and non-AA; four studies compared the same between AA and healthy controls; two studies compared the MPV values among all three groups. The estimated heterogeneity among the studies for all outcomes was high and statistically significant. The pooling the data showed no statistically significant difference in MPV (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.42, 95% CI = (-1.04, 0.20), p = 0.19) between AA and healthy controls or AA and non-AA cases (WMD = 0.01, 95% CI = (-0.15, 0.17), p = 0.90).
CONCLUSION: While MPV levels seem to have some utility in adult AA diagnosis, MPV levels should not dictate treatment options in pediatric AA.

AB  - Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common disorder with rising incidence due to increased use of digital devices. While multiple treatment options are available, some are not efficacious or sometimes even safe for use in DES. This is particularly true for Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) that may contain ingredients having no rational for their use or may actually be harmful. Various committees appointed by the Government have reviewed several FDCs marketed in India and found some of them to be irrational and recommended for their removal. This paper discusses the contents of some of these FDCs marketed for DES with an aim to ensure that prescribers are mindful of their ingredients and whether there is adequate data about their efficacy and safety and prescribe them only if they consider them necessary for managing the patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to comprehensively assess bone health in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus, including bone microarchitecture (TBS), bone mineral density (BMD, DXA) and bone turnover (osteocalcin).
DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Study participants underwent a detailed anthropometric, biochemical and hormone assessment, including insulin and osteocalcin measurement. BMD was measured at lumbar spine, femur neck and total hip using DXA and TBS derived from lumbar spine DXA images using TBS iNsight software.
RESULTS: A total of 240 women (mean age: 33.3 ± 5.0 years; median postpartum duration: 34 [interquartile range 13.0-54.5] months were evaluated. At the current visit, 115 (47.9%) and 36 (15%) women had prediabetes and diabetes, respectively. Women with dysglycemia (diabetes/prediabetes) had a higher BMD at all three sites, compared to those with normoglycemia; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Women with dysglycemia had a significantly lower TBS (1.32 ± 0.09 vs. 1.35 ± 0.09; p = .038). In the fully adjusted model, the odds ratio for association between diabetes and low TBS was 2.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.20, 7.08; p = .018). Women with dysglycemia had significantly lower serum osteocalcin levels (18.6 ± 8.5 ng/ml vs. 21.5 ± 9.7 ng/ml; p = .018). HOMA-IR (r = -.285, p < .001) was negatively correlated, while Matsuda index (r = .274, p < .001) and disposition index (r = .159, p = .016) were positively correlated with serum osteocalcin levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Bone health is affected early in the natural history of diabetes and is associated with an overall low bone turnover state.

AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason's score ≥7) by PI-RADS v2 and to assess the ability of quantitative MRI parameters to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) in Indian men.
METHODS: Adult men (n = 95) with serum PSA >4 ng/ml were prospectively evaluated with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) followed by histopathological evaluation using systematic 12-core prostate biopsy in 69 patients and prostatectomy specimens in 26 patients, performed within six weeks of mpMRI. The imaging and the pathology were divided into 12 sectors per prostate. For the validation of PI-RADS v2, a cut-off of PI-RADS v2 score ≥ 3 and PI-RADS v2 score ≥ 4 were compared to histopathology as a reference standard. Further, quantitative parameters, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), Ktrans, and Kep were correlated with the Gleason score and evaluated for their ability to distinguish between sectors with CSPCa and sectors without CSPCa.
RESULTS: PI-RADS score ≥ 4 showed higher specificity (89%) than PI-RADS score ≥ 3 (72.2%) at the cost of mild but not significant reduction of sensitivity (sensitivity-87.6% vs 91.9), (n = 1,140 sectors, 95 patients). PI-RADS v2 and quantitative parameters demonstrated the ability to discriminate sectors positive vs negative for CSPCa: AUC (area under the curve) for ADC was 0.928, PI-RADS v2 was 0.903, Ktrans was 0.897 and Kep was 0.695. Gleason score correlated well with PI-RADS (r = 0.74), ADC (r = -0.73) and Ktrans (r = 0.69).
CONCLUSION: PI-RADS v2 is a reliable method for the detection and localization of clinically significant prostate cancer in Indian men, suggesting applicability beyond European or American demographics. Quantitative mpMRI parameters can detect clinically significant prostate cancer with similar test characteristics as PI-RADS v2.

TI  - New biochemical insights of CCA enzyme role in tRNA maturation and an efficient method to synthesize the 3'-amino-tailed tRNA
AU  - Kulandaisamy, Rajkumar
AU  - Velpula, Kiran K.

T2  - Biochimie
AB  - The maturation of tRNA and its quality control is crucial for aminoacylation and protein synthesis. The CCA enzyme, also known as tRNA nucleotidyltransferase, catalyzes the addition or repair of CCA at the 3'-terminus of tRNAs to facilitate aminoacylation. Structural studies of CCA enzyme in complex with ATP and CTP suggested that adding CCA at the 3'-terminus of tRNAs is a sequential process [1-4]. However, there are many inconsistent results of CCA addition from the biochemical studies, which raise the ambiguity about the CCA enzyme specificity in vitro [5-7]. On the other hand, there are no effective methods for preparing the 3'-amino-tailed tRNA to provide a stable amide linkage, which is vital to make homogeneous samples for structural studies of stalling peptides to understand ribosome mediated gene regulation [7-11]. In this study, we examined the functional specificity of the Class II CCA enzyme from E. coli, and optimized the benchmark experimental conditions to prepare the 3'-NH2-tRNA using the CCA enzyme. Our results suggest that the CCA enzyme has a specific ability to catalyze the CCA addition/repair activity within the stoichiometric range of the reactants, and excess amounts of nucleotides lead to non-specific polymerization of the tRNA. Further, we developed an efficient method for synthesizing 3'-amino tRNA, which can facilitate stable aminoacyl/peptidyl-tRNA preparation.

T2  - Journal of Back and Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is associated with widespread autonomic dysfunction where sympathetic predominance explains associated complaints such as widespread pain, sleep disorders and anxiety. Recent studies indicate a possible neurovascular autonomic interaction in the pathogenesis of FM.
OBJECTIVE: Our study paradigm included a modified Ewing's battery of autonomic function tests to find the cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in FM patients. The battery comprises some tests such as the Valsalva maneuver, which are effort-dependent, so we also aimed to identify a potential simplified test out of the whole battery as an index marker of CAN in FM patients.
METHODS: Forty-two female patients with FM were included in this study and were administered sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity tests to explore the presence of CAN. We compared the results from each sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity test against CAN.
RESULTS: Delta heart rate in the deep breathing test was significantly different in patients with and without CAN. Delta heart rate also exhibited best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.769, 95% CI: 0.619-0.920, p< 0.001), with 88% sensitivity, 64% specificity, and 89% negative predictive value (NPV). The 30: 15 ratio during the lying to standing test also emerged as a suitable index; however it did not show any difference between CAN and non-CAN patients.
CONCLUSION: The delta heart rate has the best diagnostic accuracy, primarily in CAN's exclusion by its very high sensitivity and NPV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study was conducted to establish use of printed investigation sheets as checklists for timely workup and clinical evaluation of antenatal women with medical diseases; admitted in maternity ward, by third day of their hospital admission. This was aimed to standardize care, avoid repeated blood sampling of patients, avoid delay in starting the treatment and help teams perform optimally by systematic use of quality improvement (QI) tools.
METHODS: The present study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at a tertiary care teaching hospital using point-of-care quality improvement methodology systematically. A QI team was made who formulated an aim statement, conducted a root-cause analysis, performed plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles. The outcome was measured as complete clinical evaluation of antenatal women with anaemia, hypertension, and/or diabetes by third day of admission in the maternity ward.
RESULTS: The baseline data showed that median percentage of patients with complete clinical evaluation was only 29.2%. After a root-cause analysis with fishbone tool, three PDSA cycles were conducted to achieve the target of 80%. After the third PDSA cycle, complete clinical evaluation in anaemia, hypertension, diabetes showed an improving trend with a median of 75%.
CONCLUSION: Adopting simple principles of quality improvement, initiating use of printed investigation sheets as checklist can streamline and expedite clinical evaluation of antenatal patients with medical problems so as to avoid unnecessary delay in initiating the management in busy maternity wards.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the outcome of patients with symptomatic arterio-venous malformation (AVM), formed following pregnancy and managed by uterine artery embolization (UAE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted after ethical approval and included 15 patients presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding following pregnancy, who were suspected to have an AVM which later was confirmed by angiography and managed with UAE. Presenting symptoms, post-UAE complications and subsequent fertility outcomes were noted. Follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 2.5 years.
RESULTS: The mean age was 28.4±3.82 years and mean parity was 1.3. Out of 15 cases, 9 (60%) presented after abortion, 4 (26.6%) after normal vaginal delivery and 2 (13.3%) after cesarean delivery; of these 10/15 (66.7%) patients had a history of curettage. The most common presenting symptom was continuous bleeding per-vaginum since the antecedent pregnancy in 9/15 (60%) patients and 6/15 (40%) patients had irregular bleeding. The mean duration of symptoms was 91±85.7 (30-360) days. For UAE, embolic agents used were polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles (300-500 μm) in 2 (13.3%), 30% glue injection in 3 (20%), the combination of PVA with glue injection in 4 (26.6%) and PVA with gelfoam in 6 (40%) patients. After UAE, bleeding responded within 3.6±0.97 (3-6) days in all but one patient who required repeat UAE one month later. All women resumed their normal menstrual cycle in 31.3±5.2 (24-42) days. Ten patients desired conception, of whom 5 (50%) conceived within 13.2±5.1 (6-19) months after UAE. Two women carried pregnancy to term, one underwent preterm cesarean for growth restriction with oligohydramnios. One patient had postpartum hemorrhage, which was managed medically. One had spontaneous abortion at 6 weeks gestation and the other is 13 weeks pregnant at present.
CONCLUSION: UAE is an effective treatment modality for the management of symptomatic post-pregnancy AVMs.

AB  - In recent times Gallbladder cancer (GBC) incidences increased many folds in India and are being reported from arsenic hotspots identified in Bihar. The study aims to establish association between arsenic exposure and gallbladder carcinogenesis. In the present study, n = 200 were control volunteers and n = 152 confirmed gallbladder cancer cases. The studied GBC patient's biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood and hair samples were collected for arsenic estimation. Moreover, n = 512 gallbladder cancer patients blood samples were also evaluated for the presence of arsenic to understand exposure level in the population. A significantly high arsenic concentration (p < 0.05) was detected in the blood samples with maximum concentration 389 µg/L in GBC cases in comparison to control. Similarly, in the gallbladder cancer patients, there was significantly high arsenic concentration observed in gallbladder tissue with highest concentration of 2166 µg/kg, in gallbladder stones 635 µg/kg, in bile samples 483 µg/L and in hair samples 6980 µg/kg respectively. Moreover, the n = 512 gallbladder cancer patient's blood samples study revealed very significant arsenic concentration in the population of Bihar with maximum arsenic concentration as 746 µg/L. The raised arsenic concentration in the gallbladder cancer patients' biological samples-gallbladder tissue, gallbladder stone, bile, blood, and hair samples was significantly very high in the arsenic exposed area. The study denotes that the gallbladder disease burden is very high in the arsenic exposed area of Bihar.

AB  - PURPOSE: We planned this prospective study to evaluate PSMA expression in recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG), including anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma using Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-68 (HBED-CC)]- (Ga-68 PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), with its theranostic potential in mind.
METHODS: This was a prospective study enrolling patients with clinical and MRI evidence of rHGG on follow-up. Three treated cases of HGG with RN on MRI were also included as negative controls. Abnormal tracer accumulation in the brain parenchyma, more than the contralateral hemisphere was interpreted as positive study. For semiquantitative analysis, a 3D spherical region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the site of the abnormal Ga-68 PSMA uptake, and the ratio of SUVmax of tumor (T) to SUVmax of the contralateral corresponding area (TBR) was calculated. Each patients' PSMA brain PET was fused to the corresponding MRI and reviewed for concordance.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were included in the study, a total of 49 lesions were detected on MRI, and fused PET/MR images showed increased Ga-68 PSMA uptake in all these lesions. Multifocal lesions were better appreciated on fused PET-MR images, and concordance between MRI and PET was 100 % for patient and lesion-wise detection. Recurrent glioma lesions showed SUVmax and SUVmean values (median and IQR) 6.0 (4.4-8.2) and 3.3 (2.8-3.7), respectively. Lesions labeled as radiation necrosis on MRI did not show tracer accumulation.
CONCLUSION: Ga-68 PSMA has potential utility for evaluating recurrence in HGG and its potential for theranostics would encourage its use in the evaluation of these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: High mortality has been observed in the cancer population affected with COVID-19 during this pandemic. We undertook this study to determine the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19 and assessed the factors predicting outcome.
METHODS: Patients of all age groups with a proven history of malignancy and a recent diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nasal/nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR tests were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were compared between survivors and non-survivors groups, with respect to observed mortality.
RESULTS: Between May 11 and August 10, 2020, 134 patients were included from the three centres and observed mortality was 17.1 per cent. The median age was 53 yr (interquartile range 39-61 yr) and thirty four patients (25%) were asymptomatic. Solid tumours accounted for 69.1 per cent and breast cancer was the most common tumour type (20%). One hundred and five patients (70.5%) had received chemotherapy within the past four weeks and 25 patients (19.3%) had neutropenia at presentation. On multivariate analysis, age [odds ratio (OR) 7.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-54.00); P=0.033], haemoglobin [OR 6.28 (95% CI 1.07-37.04); P=0.042] neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [OR 12.02 (95% CI 2.08-69.51); P=0.005] and baseline serum albumin [OR 18.52 (95% CI 2.80-122.27); P=0.002], were associated with higher mortality. Recent chemotherapy, haematological tumours type and baseline neutropenia did not affect the outcome.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Higher mortality in moderate and severe infections was associated with baseline organ dysfunction and elderly age. Significant proportion of patients were asymptomatic and might remain undetected.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem in India. Its magnitude is particularly high among the elderly. Old age and comorbidity may lead to misdiagnosis and under treatment of this condition. COPD is not curable; however, various forms of treatment can help control symptoms and improve the quality of life. Most of the earlier studies lacked uniformity in definitions, designs, methodology and reporting techniques. Studies based on spirometry are only a few. Understanding the current prevalence and associated factors of COPD is important for planning control strategies. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of COPD and associated factors among the elderly.
METHODS: In this community-based study among 449 elderly persons in a rural area, information regarding socio-demographic details, selected health conditions and exposure to risk factors was recorded. The assessment of airway obstruction was done by using a portable spirometer (MIR Spirolab). The diagnosis of COPD was based on the GOLD criteria. The association of COPD with sociodemographic and other variables was analysed by the multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Acceptable spirometry findings were available for 392 (87.3%) participants. The prevalence of COPD was 42.9 per cent (95% confidence interval 37.9-47.7%). The prevalence was 54.5 per cent among men and 33.4 per cent among women. Smoking, higher age group and low body mass index were significantly associated with COPD.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of COPD was found to be high among the rural elderly in this study. Interventions aimed at cessation of smoking and preparedness of health systems for diagnosis and management of COPD are hence required.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Volume replacement remains the cornerstone of resuscitation in critically ill patients. This study explored the ability of subclavian vein collapsibility index in predicting fluid responsiveness.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study conducted in the Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, hypotensive patients presenting to the emergency underwent sonographic evaluation of Inferior Vena Cava and right Subclavian vein at three time points. The study population was divided into two groups: Responders and non-responders, based on ≥ 15 % increase in stroke volume following fluid bolus.
OBSERVATION AND RESULTS: Among 45 recruited patients, 33 patients were responders. The area under ROC curve for SCV CI at baseline to predict fluid responsiveness was 0.745 (95% confidence interval: 0.549 - 0.941; p = 0.014). An SCV-CI of 46 % predicts fluid responsiveness in a hypotensive patient in terms of change in stroke volume by 15% following fluid bolus with a sensitivity of 87.88 % (95 % confidence interval: 71.80% to 96.60%) and specificity of 66.67 % (95 % confidence interval: 34.89% to 90.08%). Spearman's correlation coefficient between IVC CI and SCV CI was 0.59 (p &lt; 0.001, n = 135).
CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that right subclavian vein respiratory variation has the ability to predict fluid responsiveness in a spontaneously breathing patient in circulatory shock and correlates with Inferior Vena Cava collapsibility index. Subclavian vein can be an alternative to Inferior Vena Cava in predicting fluid responsiveness in spontaneously breathing patients.

AB  - Faecal carriage of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is being observed as an important risk factor for bacteremia among patients with hematological malignancies. A prospective surveillance study was conducted among these patients to determine the gut colonization of CRE. Rectal/perianal swabs were collected to isolate CRE. Carbapenem resistance was detected by disk diffusion, modified-Hodge, Carba-NP test, and PCR for bla NDM-1, bla KPC, bla OXA-48, bla VIM, bla IMP genes. A total of 209 CRE isolates were identified from 151 patients. E. coli was the most common (83.2%) CRE identified, followed by Klebsiella spp. (9.6%). The majority of CRE were observed resistant to ertapenem (86%). bla NDM-1 was the most common gene (57.3%), followed by bla OXA-48 (37.8%). 26.8% isolates found to carry both bla NDM-1 and bla OXA-48 genes. CRE is increasingly observed to cause bacteremia among hematological malignancy patients due to increased colonization. Screening for gut CRE colonization is necessary to guide empirical therapy and apply infection control measures among these patients.

AB  - The synthesis of a novel carboxylate-type organic linker-based luminescent MOF (Zn(H2L) (L1)) (named PUC2) (H2L = 2-aminoterephtalic acid, L1 = 1-(3-aminopropyl) imidazole) is reported by the solvothermal method and comprehensively characterized using single-crystal XRD, PXRD, FTIR, TGA, XPS, FESEM, HRTEM, and BET. PUC2 selectively reacts with nitric oxide (▪NO) with a detection limit of 0.08 µM, and a quenching constant (0.5 × 104 M-1) indicating a strong interaction with ▪NO. PUC2 sensitivity remains unaffected by cellular proteins or biologically relevant metals (Cu2+/ Fe3+/Mg2+/ Na+/K+/Zn2+), RNS/ROS, or H2S to score ▪NO in living cells. Lastly, we used PUC2 to demonstrate that H2S inhibition increases ▪NO production by ~ 14-30% in various living cells while exogenous H2S suppresses ▪NO production, indicating that the modulation of cellular ▪NO production by H2S is rather generic and not restricted to a particular cell type. In conclusion, PUC2 can successfully detect ▪NO production in living cells and environmental samples with considerable potential for its application in improving the understanding of the role of ▪NO in biological samples and study the inter-relationship between ▪NO and H2S.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic evaluation using Eckardt score and achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life and physiological evaluation using timed barium examination (TBE) and high-resolution manometry is integral to the diagnosis of achalasia. However, the correlation of physiological outcomes with symptomatic outcomes and their role in routine follow-up after laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy (LHCM) is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the role of physiological testing in achalasia patients undergoing LHCM and its correlation with symptomatic evaluation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case records of patients undergoing LHCM for achalasia between January 2017 and March 2020 were reviewed for symptom scores (Eckardt score and achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life) and physiological parameters [5-min column height on TBE and median integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) on high-resolution manometry]. Sixty-one patients with complete data in the preoperative period and on follow-up were included in the study. The data was analyzed for symptomatic and physiological outcomes and their correlation using paired t test and the Spearman correlation test.
RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 16 months following LHCM, there was a significant improvement in Eckardt score (7.03±1.53 to 0.93±1.10, P<0.001), achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life (58.34±7.81 to 14.57±13.45, P<0.001), column height on TBE (115.14±46.9 to 27.89±34.31, P<0.001) and IRP (23.95±8.26 to 4.61±4.11, P<0.001). Eckardt score correlated significantly with achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life scores preoperatively (ρ=0.410, P<0.001) and on follow-up (ρ=0.559, P<0.001). There was no correlation between symptomatic parameters and physiological parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients of achalasia, LHCM leads to significant improvement in symptomatic and physiological parameters. Symptom scores correlate among themselves but not with physiological scores. Thus, physiological testing may not be needed for routine follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The risk of contracting infection while intubating a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patient can be reduced by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), video laryngoscope (VL) and aerosol-preventing intubation box. We compared two VLs (C-MAC and King Vision laryngoscope [KVL]) for ease of intubation and time taken to intubate the manikin using an intubation box.
METHODS: This randomised study involved healthcare workers having experience in using both C-MAC and KVL. After explaining the study and five practice sessions, a total of 63 volunteers were included; 61 participants gave consent and were enroled. The participants were allowed to intubate initially with one VL as per random sequence. Each participant performed three tracheal intubations with each device (C-MAC VL and KVL) on a manikin using an aerosol-prevention box over the head end at the time of intubation.
RESULTS: Time taken, percentage of glottic opening (POGO) score and the number of attempts taken for successful intubation with C-MAC and KVL were comparable in any of the three attempts (P > 0.05). The participants reported more difficulty in using KVL compared to C-MAC, and insertion of laryngoscope blade into the mouth of manikin for intubation was easy in group C-MAC compared to KVL in all three intubations (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: C-MAC and KVL take comparable time for successful intubation under COVID-19 simulation conditions. But C-MAC is more user-friendly.

AB  - Extra-nodal (NK/T) cell lymphoma (NKTCL) of nasal type (ENKL) presents with extranodal involvement and is associated with EBV. They are localized primarily to nasal and upper airway region but can rarely involve skin, testis, intestine, muscle, or present as a disseminated disease. We present a case of a 65-year-old male presented with bilateral orbital swelling, right parotid swelling, fever, mediastinal nodes, pleural effusion and hepatomegaly. Cytology of pleural fluid showed monomorphic lymphoid cells with folded nuclei, vesicular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and granular cytoplasm. Few histiocytes showing hemophagocytosis were also noted in a background of inflammatory cells. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of pleural fluid showed abnormal lymphoid cells which were positive for CD45, CD2 and CD56. Histopathological examination of the right eye swelling showed many atypical lymphoid cells which were positive for CD56 and negative for B and T cell markers. Based on morphological and immunophenotypic features a diagnosis of NKTCL, extra-nasal type was suggested. Patient succumbed to the disease despite aggressive therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis, a progressive manifestation of coronary artery disease, has been observed to be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting various protein-coding genes involved in several pathophysiological events of coronary artery disease.
OBJECTIVE: In our previous report, we identified differential expression profiles of candidate miRNAs, miR-133b and miR-21, in patients with coronary artery disease as compared with controls, suggesting their possible implication in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. To better understand the functional role of these miRNAs, we sought to predict and validate their target genes while assessing the expression pattern of these genes in patients with coronary artery disease, as well as in macrophages.
METHODS: Potential target genes of miR-133b and miR-21 were predicted bioinformatically followed by validation through the identification of their expression at  the protein level in patients with coronary artery disease (n-30), as well as in macrophages treated with respective miRNA inhibitors (antagomiRs), through immunoblotting.
RESULTS: SGPP1, a gene associated with the sphingolipid pathway, was predicted to be a potential target gene of miR-133b while ATG5 and LRP6 were target genes of miR-21 while being associated with autophagy and Wnt signalling pathways, respectively. SGPP1 was observed to be upregulated significantly (p = 0.019) by 2.07-fold, whereas ATG5 and LRP6 were found to be downregulated (p = 0.026 and 0.007, respectively) by 3.28-fold and 8.46-fold, respectively, in patients with coronary artery disease as compared with controls. Expression patterns of all the genes were also found to be modulated when cells were treated with respective miRNA inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Results from the present study suggest that SGPP1, ATG5 and LRP6, target genes of miR-133b and miR-21, may serve as potential therapeutic hotspots in the management of coronary artery disease, which undoubtedly merit further experimental confirmation.

AB  - A middle-aged woman presented with symptomatic complete heart block and underwent an uneventful dual chamber pacemaker implantation. Three weeks post procedure, she developed left arm pain and weakness, with neurological localization to the lower trunk of left brachial plexus. Possibilities of traumatic compression by the device/leads or postoperative idiopathic brachial plexopathy were considered. After ruling out traumatic causes, she was started on oral steroids, to which she responded remarkably. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this rare cause of brachial plexopathy following pacemaker implantation, because not only does an expedited diagnosis and medical treatment lead to prompt recovery with minimal neurological deficits, but it also circumvents an unnecessary surgical re-exploration.

AB  - Low-grade dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are a frequent cause of drug-refractory epilepsy. Molecular mechanisms underlying seizure generation in these tumors are poorly understood. This study was conducted to identify altered genes in nonneoplastic epileptogenic cortical tissues (ECTs) resected from DNT patients during electrocorticography (ECoG)-guided surgery. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these high-spiking ECTs compared to non-epileptic controls. A total of 477 DEGs (180 upregulated; 297 downregulated) were observed in the ECTs compared to non-epileptic controls. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of genes belonging to the following Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways: (i) glutamatergic synapse; (ii) nitrogen metabolism; (iii) transcriptional misregulation in cancer; and (iv) protein digestion and absorption. The glutamatergic synapse pathway was enriched by DEGs such as GRM4, SLC1A6, GRIN2C, GRM2, GRM5, GRIN3A, and GRIN2B. Enhanced glutamatergic activity was observed in the pyramidal neurons of ECTs, which could be attributed to altered synaptic transmission in these tissues compared to non-epileptic controls. Besides glutamatergic synapse, altered expression of other genes such as GABRB1 (synapse formation), SLIT2 (axonal growth), and PROKR2 (neuron migration) could be linked to epileptogenesis in ECTs. Also, upregulation of GABRA6 gene in ECTs could underlie benzodiazepine resistance in these patients. Neural cell-type-specific gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed transcriptome of ECTs to be predominantly contributed by microglia and neurons. This study provides first comprehensive gene expression profiling of nonneoplastic ECTs of DNT patients and identifies genes/pathways potentially linked to epileptogenesis.

AB  - Amongst various manifestations of pulmonary aspergillosis, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is the most common. We conducted this study to identify different morphological forms of CPA, on computed tomography angiography (CTA), and to correlate these with clinical presentation, as well as, associated imaging features. The study design was cross-sectional, with a final sample size of 65 patients, recruited over a period of 2years from January 2017 to October 2018. Patients with past history of tuberculosis (TB), presenting with haemoptysis and found to have aspergilloma on computed tomography and lab tests were included in the study. All patients underwent CTA for evaluation of haemoptysis. Three morphological types of intracavitary aspergilloma on imaging were identified: type 1-nodular soft tissue along the cavity-wall, type-2 soft tissue density with multiple air lucencies and type-3 homogenous soft tissue opacity with air-crescent sign. Aspergilloma types were correlated with grade and duration of haemoptysis, associated imaging findings and vascularity score on CTA. Mean age of the patients was 40.97 +/- 13.69 years. As the type of aspergilloma changed from 1 to 3, there was a decrease in cavity wall thickness, peri-cavitary inflammation and vascularity. It is the type 1 and 2 aspergillomas, which caused more inflammation in the lungs, and hence recruited more abnormal vasculature. No significant correlation was found between haemoptysis severity and type of aspergilloma; type 3 aspergilloma however had longer duration of haemoptysis. In conclusion, the initial stages of formation of aspergilloma (type 1 and 2) cause more parenchymal inflammation and symptoms. The classical Monod sign is observed in the late stage of aspergilloma, since the peri-cavitary inflammation is reduced by then and thus the symptoms.

AB  - To know the normative ranges of VEMP response metrics in healthy young adults. To know the pathological cutoff of VEMP metrics in unilateral vestibular loss patients. To compare our VEMP metrics with the normative values of other studies from the western world. Prospective cross-sectional study. Tertiary care audiovestibular laboratory. 30 healthy subjects and 15 cases with a unilateral complete compensated loss. Various VEMP parameters-p1 latency, n1 latency, p1-n1 amplitude and Interaural asymmetry ratio (IAR) were entered into databases and analyzed. We compared our parameters with the most cited scientific data on VEMP available in the PubMed database, and we analyzed the results. 90% of controls and 80% of cases got VEMP responses at 95 dB HL threshold, 500 Hz with subject/patient placed in sitting upright with head turned to opposite side position. The normative data of VEMP response metrics in young adults for p1, n1 latencies, p1-n1 amplitude, and IAR are 13 ± 2 ms, 21 ± 2 ms, 91 ± 33 uV, and 9.25 ± 7.3, respectively. As the VEMP test has 100% sensitivity and 100% (95% CI 87-100%) negative predictive value in detecting the saccular dysfunction, we recommend the VEMP test as a mandatory tool in the vestibular test battery. There is no statistically significant difference in various VEMP parameters between the control and normal sides of the case group.

AB  - Background  Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy is an established mode of enteral feeding for nutritional support for patients with dysphagia from upper digestive tract malignancy. Its role as a rescue measure in patients with advanced malignancy, presenting with absolute dysphagia and failure of nasogastric tube insertion has not been well established. Purpose  This study was performed to assess technical success and long-term outcomes of percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (push type) for nutritional support for patients with absolute dysphagia as a last ditch nonsurgical rescue effort for enteral access. Materials and Methods  This was a prospective observational study of 31 patients who underwent push-type percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy over a period of 2 years (March 2017-March 2019). The study was a part of a larger trial approved by the institutional ethics committee. Patients were followed till the removal of tube, death, or 1 year, whichever was earlier. Gastrostomy tube-related problems and complications were documented. Descriptive summary statistics were employed to analyze the success rate and complications. Results  Thirty-one patients with mean age 56 years (26-78 years) including 18 males and 13 females with head and neck squamous cell cancer and esophageal cancer presenting with absolute dysphagia or significant dysphagia with failed nasogastric or endoscopic enteral access were included. Overall technical success was 93.5% (29/31), achieved in 26/31 patients with just fluoroscopy guidance and 3/5 patients with computed tomography guidance. One major (3.3%) and two minor (6.5%) complications were encountered. Five out of 29 gastrostomy tubes had to be exchanged, after a mean of 44 days (1-128 days) after insertion. Conclusion  Percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy is a safe and effective intervention even as a rescue measure in patients with absolute dysphagia from advanced upper digestive tract malignancies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of 12 weeks of physical exercise as complementary management strategy on quality of life (QOL) in people with epilepsy (PWE).
METHODS: In a parallel-group, randomized controlled study with blinded outcome assessment, PWE of 18-65 years old, smartphone users were randomized into two groups. The exercise group was advised minimum 150 min per week of moderate-intense aerobic activity, as per current WHO recommendation [1], in addition to standard medical care; the control group received only standard medical care. QOL was assessed using Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) inventory [2,3]; physical activity, with Global Physical Activity Questionnaire version 2 (GPAQ), and Pedometer Step Counter (a smartphone-based activity tracker application), at baseline and after 12 weeks. Body weight, body mass index, seizure frequency, and stigma scores (Epilepsy Stigma Scale Austin and colleagues) [4] were also noted.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventeen PWE were recruited (58 exercise, 59 control). Although there was an improvement in the physical activity correlates after 12 weeks compared to mean values at baseline, the differences were not significant between the groups. The total QOL mean scores at baseline in the exercise and control groups were 64.9 and 63.7 (p = 0.597) and after 12 weeks, 68.4 and 66.9 (p = 0.660), respectively. However, intragroup comparison of energy/fatigue score in the exercise group showed significant change with a p value of 0.009 and intragroup comparison of Overall QOL score in the control group showed a significant change with a p value of 0.003. Similar improvement was seen in stigma scores (p = 0.500) and seizure frequency (p = 0.388) at 12 weeks in exercise and control groups. After 12 weeks, mean values of METS ((metabolic equivalents) were 794.81 and 714.27 (p = 0.159), steps per day were 4018.32 and 3730.0 (p = 0.314), calories spent per day were 173.85 and 159.68 (p = 0.320 and distance walked per day in meters were 2576.52 and 2198.42 (p = 0.072), in the exercise and control groups, respectively.
SIGNIFICANCE: Regular physical activity for at least 150 min per week, in the form of moderate-intense aerobic exercises resulted in positive yet non-significant improvement of QOL, seizure frequency, and stigma in PWE.

AB  - Leishmania donavani is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, responsible for social and economic disruption, especially in developing countries. Lack of effective drugs with few side effects have necessitated the discovery of newer therapeutic solutions for leishmaniasis. Glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) synthesis plays a vital role in protozoan cell membranes structural formation and antigenic modification. Hence, any disruption in its biosynthesis can prove fatal to the parasitic protozoans. N-acetylglucosamine-phosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase (NAGP-deacetylase) is an enzyme from the GPI biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the deacetylation of N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol to glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol, a step essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme. In the quest for novel scaffolds as anti-leishmaniasis agents, we have executed in silico virtual screening, density function theory, molecular dynamics and MM-GBSA based energy calculations with a natural product library and a diverse library set from Chembridge database. Two compounds, 14671 and 4610, were identified at the enzyme's active site and interacted with catalytic residues, Asp43, Asp44, His41, His147, His 150, Arg80 and Arg231. Both molecules exhibited stable conformation in their protein-ligand complexes with binding free energies for compound-14671 and compound-4610 of -54 ± 4 and -50 ± 4 kcal/mol, respectively. These scaffolds can be incorporated in future synthetic determinations, focusing on developing druggable inhibitor support, increasing potency, and introducing species selectivity.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The adoption of telemedicine became a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic because patients found commuting to be difficult owing to travel restrictions. Initially, audio-based teleconsultations were provided. Later, on the basis of the feedback of patients and caregivers, the authors started to provide video-based teleconsultations via WhatsApp. The authors subsequently surveyed the patients and caregivers to determine their satisfaction levels with telemedicine services.
METHODS: An anonymized telephone survey of patients who had participated in teleconsultation was conducted with a structured questionnaire. The responses were analyzed and their correlations with the perceived benefits and limitations of audio and video teleconsultation were determined.
RESULTS: Three hundred respondents were included in the first round of surveys, of whom 250 (83.3%) consented to video teleconsultation. Among the respondents who participated in both audio and video teleconsultations (n = 250), paired analysis showed that video teleconsultation was perceived as better in terms of providing easier access to healthcare services (p < 0.001), saving time (p < 0.001), and satisfaction with the way patient needs were conveyed to healthcare providers (p = 0.023), as well as in terms of adequacy of addressing healthcare needs (p < 0.001) and consequently providing a higher rate of overall satisfaction (p < 0.001). For both audio and video teleconsultation, overall patient satisfaction was significantly related to only previous exposure to WhatsApp. However, for video consultation, longer call duration (p = 0.023) was an important independent factor. Video teleconsultation was preferable to face-to-face consultation irrespective of educational status, but higher education was associated with preference for video teleconsultation.
CONCLUSIONS: Both audio and video teleconsultation are viable cost-effective surrogates for in-person physical neurosurgical consultation. Although audio teleconsultation is more user-friendly and is not restricted by educational status, video teleconsultation trumps the former owing to a more efficient and satisfactory doctor-to-patient interface.

AB  - Existing clinical indicators for metastatic risk classification and patient treatment of uveal melanoma (UM) in the Asian population are limited. Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME) has gained attention in the prognosis of cancers and considered as a potential biomarker in many tumors including UM. Therefore, this study investigated the expression of PRAME and its association with loss of nuclear BAP1 (nBAP1) as well as its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. Immunohistochemical expression of PRAME and BAP1 proteins were assessed in 66 prospective cases of UM. mRNA expression level was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the correlation of protein expression with clinicopathological parameters, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. Nuclear PRAME (nPRAME) expression and loss of nBAP1 were observed in 24 and 62% cases, respectively. PRAME mRNA expression level was found to be upregulated in 64% (7/11) of metastatic patients. mRNA and immunoexpression of nPRAME were statistically significant with many clinicopathological high-risk factors. On univariate and multivariate analyses, high mitotic activity, extraocular invasion and presence of nPRAME expression were statistically significant (p < 0.05). On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients expressing PRAME had significantly reduced metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS). MFS and OS were also reduced in patients expressing PRAME along with loss of nBAP1. Our data show that nPRAME expression, in combination with loss of nBAP1, could be a useful predictive biomarker in the therapeutic management of UM patients at high risk.

AB  - Thyroid cancer is very rare in children. 131 I therapy after thyroidectomy is established in pediatric differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). Pediatric DTC guideline is silent on the optimum amount of 131 I that could be safely and effectively administered to children who are more radiosensitive. Like adult DTC, children are also given 131 I therapy empirically based either on age or body weight. Pediatric DTC guideline recommends that patient-specific dosimetry is important in children. Still, due to the low incidence rate and the practical difficulties of dosimetry, it has neither been established nor adopted in routine practice. This review article aims to discuss current approaches of 131 I therapy in children and young adult patients with DTC and dosimetric data obtained by several investigators. Efforts are required to simplify dosimetric procedures and precise results, especially in determining lesion size. We prefer 3-dimensional dosimetry over planar dosimetry, where lesion size could be measured accurately. 124 I PET/CT-based dosimetry is expected to give accurate dosimetric results. The most challenging aspect is that no randomized controlled trials are available to compare the empiric 131 I therapy results versus dosimetry-based treatment outcomes in children and young adults. Suppose dosimetry-based 131 I therapy could be shown to have better outcomes, namely, successful ablation rate, better disease-free survival, and lesser treatment-emergent adverse events than empirical 131 I treatment. In that case, one can argue in favor of the former. Unfortunately, no convincing study is currently available. Thus, there is a need for a randomized control trial to settle this issue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) has emphasized on the incidence-prevalence ratio (IPR) and incidence-mortality ratio (IMR) to measure the progress in HIV epidemic control. In this paper, we describe the status of epidemic control in India and in various states in terms of UNAIDS's recommended metrices.
METHOD: The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) of India spearheads work on mathematical modelling to estimate HIV burden based on periodically conducted sentinel surveillance for providing guidance to program implementation and policymaking. Using the results of the latest round of HIV Estimations in 2019, IPR and IMR were calculated.
RESULTS: National level IPR was 0.029 [0.022-0.037] in 2019 and ranged from 0.01 to 0.15 in various States and Union Territories (UTs). Corresponding Incidence-Mortality Ratio was at 0.881 [0.754-1.014] nationally and ranged between 0.20 and 12.90 across the States/UTs.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on UNAIDS recommended indicators for HIV epidemic control, namely IPR and IMR; national AIDS response in India appears on track. However, the program success is not uniform and significant heterogeneity as well as expanding epidemic was observed at the level of States or UTs. Reinforcing States/UTs specific and focused HIV prevention, testing and treatment initiatives may help in the attainment of 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

AB  - Stereology and semiautomated binary image histomorphometry are two common methods used for morphometry of nerve fibres. Nucleator probe can be used for the estimation of morphometric parameters like diameter, perimeter, area and volume of a structure that is approximately either a circle or a sphere. In this study, we estimated these parameters with the help of ImageJ software on calibrated transmission electron micrographs. We procured samples of the cochlear nerve (CN) during winter months, within 6-12 hours of death, to reduce post-mortem autolytic changes. The temporal bones containing the CN were fixed by immersion in chilled paraformaldehyde. After dissecting out from the petrous part of the temporal bone, the CN were osmicated and processed for embedding in resin. From the resin blocks, silver coloured (70 nm) ultrathin sections were cut and picked on 300-mesh copper grids, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and viewed under Tecnai G2-20 transmission electron microscope. The transmission electron micrographs had scale bars embedded into them by the software at the time of imaging, and the morphometric parameters of randomly selected nerve fibres were measured using the ImageJ software. The ImageJ software could become a low-cost and dependable tool for nerve fibre morphometry.•Nucleator probe is used for the estimation of morphometric parameters like diameter, perimeter, area or volume•Morphometric parameters were estimated by the ImageJ software on calibrated transmission electron micrographs•The ImageJ software could become a low-cost and dependable tool for nerve fibre morphometry.

AB  - Intestinal lymphoma, although rare, is the second most common extra-nodal site of lymphoma, following stomach. It is usually secondary to systemic involvement and is predominantly of non-Hodgkin's subtype. In addition to the risk factors for lymphomas occurring elsewhere, certain risk factors are specific for intestinal lymphoma. These include enteropathies such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Imaging is the cornerstone in the management of intestinal lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography are the preferred modalities for diagnosis, staging, monitoring response to treatment, and for follow-up evaluation. Bowel lymphomas can have various morphological patterns on imaging; however, certain characteristic features, if present, may prove invaluable in its diagnosis. Hence, it is imperative to be acquainted with the myriad of imaging findings in bowel lymphoma and its complications which may not only help in vivo distinction from other commoner bowel lesions but alter the management accordingly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) monoclonal antibody, infliximab, is the primary therapeutic modality for patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), refractory to conventional therapy. Biosimilars of infliximab have been shown to have equivalent efficacy to originator infliximab. We compared the safety and efficacy of infliximab biosimilar with the originator in Indian patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
METHODS: Patients with IBD treated with either originator or biosimilar infliximab from January 2005 to October 2020 were included in this retrospective analysis. The safety and efficacy of originator or biosimilar infliximab in inducing and maintaining clinical remission at weeks 14 and 52 for CD and UC were evaluated. Disease activity was estimated at baseline, after induction therapy, after 1 year of treatment, and during 12 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: In all, 137 patients (82 CD; 55 UC) were included, of whom 102 were on originator, and 35 patients received biosimilar. In biosimilar group, clinical response and remission rates at weeks 14 and 52 were 84.2%, 58% and 68.4%, 52.6% in CD and 81.2%, 56.2% and 68.7%, 62.5% in UC patients, respectively. Among patients who were on originator, clinical response and remission rates at weeks 14 and 52 were 79.4%, 46% and 57.1%, 43% in CD and 72%, 64.1% and 66.7%, 56.4% in UC patients, respectively. Thirty-three (24.1%) patients experienced adverse events; eighteen developed tuberculosis (TB), of whom 17 received originator and one patient received biosimilar.
CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab biosimilar is comparable to originator infliximab in terms of safety profile and its efficacy in inducing and maintaining remission in patients with IBD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) leads to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation despite latent tuberculosis (LTB) screening, especially in TB endemic regions.
AIM: We evaluated the effect of stringent screening strategy and LTB prophylaxis on TB reactivation.
METHODS: We performed an ambispective comparison between patients who received anti-TNF therapy after January 2019 (late cohort) and between Jan 2005 and Jan 2019 (early cohort). Late cohort patients were subjected to stringent screening criteria which included all: history of past TB/recent contact with active TB, chest X-ray, CT (computed tomography) chest, IGRA (interferon-gamma release assay), TST (tuberculin skin test), and if any positive were given chemoprophylaxis. A cohort comparison was done to evaluate for risk reduction of TB following the stringent screening strategy.
RESULTS: One hundred seventy-one patients (63: ulcerative colitis/108: Crohn's disease, mean age diagnosis: 28.5 ± 13.4 years, 60% males, median follow-up duration after anti-TNF: 33 months [interquartile range: 23-57 months]) were included. Among the 112 in the early cohort, 29 (26%) underwent complete TB screening, 22 (19.6%) had LTB, 10 (9%) received chemoprophylaxis, and 19 (17%) developed TB. In comparison, in the late cohort, 100% of patients underwent complete TB screening, 26 (44%) had LTB, 23 (39%) received chemoprophylaxis, and only 1(1.7%) developed TB (p < 0.01). On survival analysis, patients in early cohort had a higher probability of TB reactivation compared with the late cohort (HR: 14.52 (95% CI: 1.90-110.61 [p = 0.01]) after adjusting for gender, age at anti-TNF initiation, concomitant immunosuppression, anti-TNF doses, and therapy escalation.
CONCLUSION: The high risk of TB reactivation with anti-TNF therapy in TB endemic regions can be significantly mitigated with stringent LTB screening and chemoprophylaxis.

AB  - An excessive amount of fat deposition in the body leads to obesity which is a complex disease and poses a generic threat to human health. It increases the risk of various other diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple types of cancer. Genomic studies have shown that the expression of the fat mass obesity (FTO) gene was highly altered and identified as one of the key biomarkers for obesity. This study has been undertaken to investigate the mutational profile of the FTO gene and elucidates its effect on the protein structure and function. Harmful effects of various missense mutations were predicted using different independent tools and it was observed that all mutations were highly pathogenic. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the structure and function of FTO protein upon different mutations and it was found that mutations decreased the structure stability and affected protein conformation. Furthermore, a protein residue network analysis suggested that the mutations affected the overall residues bonding and topology. Finally, molecular docking coupled with MD simulation suggested that mutations affected FTO substrate binding by changing the protein-ligand affinity. Hence, the results of this finding would help in an in-depth understanding of the molecular biology of the FTO gene and its variants and lead to the development of effective therapeutics against associated diseases and disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bispectral Index (BIS) is used to monitor anesthetic depth and is a useful instrument to keep a check on intraoperative awareness. But there are various situations in which it shows false readings. Our aim of the study was to observe the changes in BIS value with steep Trendelenburg position, which is usually done, in robotic pelvic surgeries.
METHODS: We included 100 patients in our study who underwent robotic prostatectomies and hysterectomies. After anesthetizing the patient, the patient's heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal desflurane, end-tidal CO2, and BISwere recorded at three min. intervals, for 15 minutes before and 15 minutes after the Trendelenburg position without surgical stimulus.
RESULTS: We found a significant increase in BIS values (p <0.05) after the change of position from supine to steep Trendelenburg. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure were almost constant.
CONCLUSION: Our study concluded that the BIS value increases when patients were shifted from the supine to Trendelenburg position, which might raise the concern of a decrease in anesthetic depth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical manifestations, risk factors, treatment modalities and maternal outcomes in pregnant women with lab-confirmed COVID-19 and compare it with COVID-19 negative pregnant women in same age group.
DESIGN: Multicentric case-control study.
DATA SOURCES: Ambispective primary data collection through paper-based forms from 20 tertiary care centres across India between April and November 2020.
STUDY POPULATION: All pregnant women reporting to the centres with a lab-confirmed COVID-19 positive result matched with controls.
DATA QUALITY: Dedicated research officers extracted hospital records, using modified WHO Case Record Forms (CRF) and verified for completeness and accuracy.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Data converted to excel files and statistical analyses done using STATA 16 (StataCorp, TX, USA). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimated using unconditional logistic regression.
RESULTS: A total of 76,264 women delivered across 20 centres during the study period. Data of 3723 COVID positive pregnant women and 3744 age-matched controls was analyzed. Of the positive cases 56·9% were asymptomatic. Antenatal complications like preeclampsia and abruptio placentae were seen more among the cases. Induction and caesarean delivery rates were also higher among Covid positive women. Pre-existing maternal co-morbidities increased need for supportive care. There were 34 maternal deaths out of the 3723(0.9%) positive mothers, while covid negative deaths reported from all the centres were 449 of 72,541 (0·6%).
CONCLUSION: Covid-19 infection predisposed to adverse maternal outcomes in a large cohort of Covid positive pregnant women as compared to the negative controls.

AB  - Acute neurological insult can trigger a cascade of events in other organ systems such as the heart and lung. Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM) and Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) are mostly reported after stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or seizures whenever sympathetic storm and autonomic dysregulation occurs. We report here for the first time, a case of postoperative infratentorial extradural hematoma in a patient triggering NSM and NPE at the same time. The challenges involved in the management of such a patient are described in this case report. The patient was successfully managed and discharged home with no new neurological deficits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously reported overexpression of miR-3692-3p in the serum of non-small cell lung cancer patients. However, the expression profile and clinical utility of miR-3692-3p in the tumor tissues of lung cancer patients are not yet reported.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We quantified the expression levels of miR-3692-3p in the tumors and adjacent normal lung tissues of early-stage (n = 29) and tissue biopsies of locally advanced and metastatic (n = 85) lung cancer patients using TaqMan advanced miRNA assay. We correlated miR-3692-3p expression with survival outcomes, therapeutic response, and other clinicopathological variables. We also predicted the target genes of miR-3692-3p, constructed a protein-protein interaction network, and performed functional enrichment analysis using various in silico tools. We found significant overexpression of miR-3692-3p in the tumors (Log2 fold change = 3.672; p < 0.0001) and tissue biopsies (Log2 fold change = 2.08; p = 0.0001) compared to normal lung tissues of lung cancer patients. The expression of miR-3692-3p did not correlate with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and response to therapy. In multivariate analysis, therapeutic response emerged as an independent prognostic biomarker of OS (HR = 3.47; p = 0.022) and PFS (HR = 19.86; p < 0.001). Our in silico analysis predicted 238 target genes of miR-3692-3p.
CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of miR-3692-3p could contribute to the development of lung cancer. However, mechanistic studies are warranted to shed further light on its role in lung carcinogenesis.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a ubiquitous bacterium and contributes significantly to the burden of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer across the world. Adaptive phenotypes and virulence factors in H. pylori are heterogeneous and dynamic. However, limited information is available about the molecular nature of antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and virulence factors of H. pylori strains circulating in India. In the present study, we analyzed the whole genome sequences of 143 H. pylori strains, of which 32 are isolated from two different regions (eastern and southern) of India. Genomic repertoires of individual strains show distinct region-specific signatures. We observed lower resistance phenotypes and genotypes in the East Indian (Kolkata) H. pylori isolates against amoxicillin and furazolidone antibiotics, whereas higher resistance phenotypes to metronidazole and clarithromycin. Also, at molecular level, a greater number of AMR genes were observed in the east Indian H. pylori isolates as compared to the southern Indian isolates. From our findings, we suggest that metronidazole and clarithromycin antibiotics should be used judicially in the eastern India. However, no horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance gene was observed in the current H. pylori strains. The comparative genome analysis shows that the number of genes involved in virulence, disease and resistance of H. pylori isolated from two different regions of India is significantly different. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based phylogenetic analysis distinguished H. pylori strains into different clades according to their geographical locations. Conditionally beneficial functions including antibiotic resistance phenotypes that are linked with faster evolution rates in the Indian isolates.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patellar fractures constitute almost 1% of total skeletal injuries. Existing common operative methods include the use of different types of Tension band wiring techniques like cannulated screws and K-wires. The Patellar plating construct is a relatively newer operative method for patellar fracture fixation with promising outcomes with fewer complications.
METHOD: We conducted a pilot prospective study at our Apex Trauma center in twenty patients aged 18-65years with displaced patellar fractures, AO type A2, A3, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3. Fractures were fixed with low profile patellar plates (1.8 mm). Radiological and functional follow-up was done using X-rays, CT scans and BKS scoring (Bostman-Knee-Scale), Knee Society Score(KSS), and Tegner Lysholm knee scores respectively for two years.
RESULT: Mean functional outcome scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 2 years was 25.5, 28.3, 29.05 and 29.9 for BKS; 64.62, 84.12, 90.6, and 97.5 for KSS; 73.75, 89.7,94.8, and 99.3 for Tegner Lysholm knee score respectively. Radiological union, confirmed by CT scan, was observed in all patients at 3 months. Two patients had superficial surgical site infection (SSI) at 2 weeks. Implant impingement was also found in 2 patients at 3 months. None of the patients had a failure of fixation at the end of the study.
CONCLUSION: Patients with low profile patellar plate constructs have favorable clinical and radiological outcomes with minimal non-specific complications.

AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in the majority of patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) of viral and non-viral etiologies, which requires screening for early HCC diagnosis. Liquid biopsy holds great promise now for early detection, prognosis, and assessment of response to cancer therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a liquid biopsy marker can be easily detected by a real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for a change in its concentration, integrity, and fragmentation in cancer. Methods: Patients with HCC (n = 100), CLD (n = 100), and healthy (n = 30) controls were included in the study. The cfDNA was isolated from serum and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out using primer pairs for large (>205 bp) and small (110 bp) fragments of repetitive elements (ALU and LINE1) and housekeeping genes (β-Actin and GAPDH). Total cfDNA concentrations and integrity index were determined by the absolute quantitation method (L/S ratio or cfDII-integrity). The cfDII as a measure of fragmentation was determined by comparative Ct (2-ΔΔCt) method of relative quantification (cfDII-fragmentation). Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, cfDII-integrity and cfDII-fragmentation were used to differentiate HCC from CLD patients or healthy controls. Results: The total cfDNA concentrations in the sera of HCC (244 ng/ml) patients were significantly higher than those of CLD (33 ng/ml) patients and healthy (16.88 ng/ml) controls. HCC patients have shown poor DNA integrity or excess cfDNA fragmentation than CLD patients and healthy controls. The cfDII-integrity of GAPDH and ALU fragment significantly differentiate HCC from CLD at AUROC 0.72 and 0.67, respectively. The cfDII-fragmentation following normalization with cfDNA of healthy control has shown significant differential capabilities of HCC from CLD at AUROC 0.67 using GAPDH and 0.68 using the ALU element. The ROC curve of LINE1 and β-actin cfDII was not found significant for any of the above methods. The cfDII-fragmentation trend in HCC patients of different etiologies was similar indicating increased cfDNA fragmentation irrespective of its etiology. Conclusion: The cfDII measuring both DNA integrity (L/S ratio) and fragmentation of the Alu and GAPDH genes can differentiate HCC from CLD patients and healthy individuals.

AB  - PURPOSE: Available literature on peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome (PPS) is very limited. The purpose of this study is to evaluate features of PPS using multimodal imaging and shed further light on this entity.
METHODS: This is a retrospective case series at a tertiary eye-care center. Patients with features of pachychoroid with preferential choroidal thickening in nasal macula along with pachyvessels were identified and included for analysis. The patients underwent fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine angiography. Images were separately analyzed by two different retina specialists.
RESULTS: A total of 27 eyes of 14 patients with mean age of 52.2 years were included. Seven patients had bilateral PPS, whereas six had unilateral; one patient had only one seeing eye. A total of 21 eyes with PPS were studied. 52.4% of the eyes revealed retinal pigment epithelium gravitational tracks, outer retinal atrophy, and serous PEDs. None of the eyes showed choroidal folds. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed late leakage at macula in 33% eyes. Fundus autofluorescence showed features of PPS to be similar to central serous chorioretinopathy in most cases.
CONCLUSION: Peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome shares common findings with central serous chorioretinopathy and seems to be a subset of central serous chorioretinopathy than a separate entity in pachychoroid disease spectrum.

AB  - PURPOSE: Malignant stroke is a life-threatening emergency, with a high mortality rate (1-3). Despite strong evidence showing decreased morbidity and mortality in the adult population, decompressive hemicraniectomy (DCH) has been scarcely reported in the pediatric stroke population, and its indication remains controversial, while it could be a potential lifesaving option.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed an extensive literature review on pediatric malignant arterial ischemic stroke (pmAIS) and selected 26 articles reporting 97 cases. Gathering the data together, a 67% mortality rate is observed without decompressive therapy, contrasting with a 95.4% survival rate with it. The median modified Rankin score (mRS) is 2.1 after surgery with a mean follow-up of 31.8 months. For the 33% of children who survived without surgery, the mRS is 3 at a mean follow-up of 19 months. As an illustrative case, we report on a 2-year-old girl who presented a cardioembolic right middle cerebral artery stroke with subsequent malignant edema and ongoing cerebral transtentorial herniation in the course of a severe myocarditis requiring ECMO support. A DCH was done 32 h after symptom onset. At the age of 5 years, she exhibits an mRS of 3.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric stroke with malignant edema is a severe condition with high mortality rate if left untreated and often long-lasting consequences. DCH might minimize the vicious circle of cerebral swelling, increasing intracranial pressure and brain ischemia. Our literature review underscores DCH as an efficient therapeutic measure management of pmAIS even when performed after a significant delay; however, long-lasting morbidities remain high.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to evaluate COVID-19 associated psychological distress among pregnant and postpartum women during the second wave of COVID-19 in India.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was done using a pre-validated tool involving 491 participants attending a tertiary-care hospital during the second wave of COVID-19 in India.
RESULTS: Three-fourths of participants experienced negative emotions such as fear and various features of depression. Participants (75%) reported COVID-related news on TV/Radio/Newspapers including social media as the major trigger for these negative emotions. Loss of social support mainly affected postpartum women (p < 0.001) and working women (p < 0.001). Inability to access healthcare services had negative associations with age (p < 0.001), education (p < 0.001), and socioeconomic class (p < 0.001). Various coping strategies being followed by participants included watching TV/Videos or reading books (93%), resorting to social media (77%), spending more time praying and meditating (86%), and engaging in hobbies (56%).
CONCLUSION: During the second wave, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significantly high negative impact on the psychological and social well-being of pregnant and postpartum women. Hence, it is important to initiate appropriate preventive and corrective steps by the policymakers for any future waves of the pandemic.

AB  - IDH wild-type (wt) grade 2/3 astrocytomas are a heterogenous group of tumors with disparate clinical and molecular profiles. cIMPACT-NOW recommendations incorporated in the new 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors urge minimal molecular criteria to identify a subset that has an aggressive clinical course similar to IDH -wt glioblastomas (GBMs). This paper describes the use of a panel of molecular markers to reclassify IDH -wt grade 2/3 diffuse astrocytic gliomas (DAGs) and study median overall survival concerning for to IDH -wt GBMs in the Indian cohort. IDH -wt astrocytic gliomas (grades 2, 3, and 4) confirmed by IDHR132H immunohistochemistry and IDH1/2 gene sequencing, 1p/19q non-codeleted with no H3F3A mutations were included. TERT promoter mutation by Sanger sequencing, epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, and whole chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss by fluorescence in situ hybridization was assessed and findings correlated with clinical and demographic profiles. The molecular profile of 53 IDH -wt DAGs (grade 2: 31, grade 3: 22) was analyzed. Eleven cases (grade 2: 8, grade 3: 3) (20.75%) were reclassified as IDH -wt GBMs, WHO grade 4 ( TERT promoter mutation in 17%, epidermal growth factor receptor amplification in 5.5%, and whole chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss in 2%). Molecular GBMs were predominantly frontal (54.5%) with a mean age of 36 years and median overall survival equivalent to IDH -wt GBMs (18 vs. 19 mo; P =0.235). Among grade 2/3 DAGs not harboring these alterations, significantly better survival was observed for grade 2 versus grade 3 DAGs (25 vs. 16 mo; P =0.002). Through the incorporation of a panel of molecular markers, a subset of IDH -wt grade 2 DAGs can be stratified into molecular grade 4 tumors with prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, IDH -wt grade 3 DAGs behave like GBMs irrespective of molecular profile.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the optimum strength of advanced modeled iterative reconstruction (ADMIRE) to achieve the best subjective and objective image quality when combining three-dose reduction strategies, ultra-high-pitch computed tomography coronary angiography (FLASH CTCA; with single-dose ivabradine to lower heart rate), low tube voltage, and ADMIRE.
METHODS: Sixty consecutive patients underwent FLASH CTCA at 100 kVp in this single-center prospective study. Single-dose ivabradine was administered to patients whose heart rate was above 75 bpm. Images were reconstructed using the three highest strengths of ADMIRE (A3, A4, and A5). Objective and subjective image quality (using a Likert scale) were evaluated in the three datasets.
RESULTS: The signal strength remained unchanged but mean noise significantly reduced across the increasing strengths of ADMIRE [signal: 513.78 ± 101.7 Hounsfield units (HU) at A3, 515.6 ± 100.5 HU at A4, and 519.7 ± 107.9 HU at A5; noise: 23.4 ± 4.5 HU at A3, 20.2 ± 3.6 HU at A4, and 17.2 ± 3.3 HU at A5]. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios were the highest at A5, and A5 offered significantly higher Likert scores in image noise, vessel sharpness, and overall image quality than A3 or A4. Additionally, A5 did not interfere with image interpretation in any patient.
CONCLUSION: Using all three dose reduction strategies during FLASH CTCA along with single-dose ivabradine administration ensures minimal radiation exposure in daily practice. In this study, A5 datasets had the best overall subjective and objective image quality despite their "plastic appearance". In the future, enhanced dose reduction can be obtained by further lowering tube voltages.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates are becoming more common over the world, posing a severe public health danger, particularly in developing nations like India. Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial (CR-GNB) infection has become a fast-expanding global threat with limited antibiotic choice and significant mortality. This study aimed to highlight the carbapenem-resistance among clinical isolates of hospital admitted patients in Bihar, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 101 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All GNB isolates were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Double disc synergy test / modified Hodge test (DDST/MHT) were used to detect carbapenemase production by these isolates. Subsequently, these isolates were evaluated for carbapenem-resistance genes using whole-genome sequencing method. The overall percentage of carbapenem-resistance among GNB was (17/101) 16.8%. The genomic analysis of antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) demonstrates a significantly high prevalence of blaCTX-M followed by blaSHV, blaTEM, blaOXA, and blaNDM β-lactam or carbapenem resistance genes among clinical isolates of GNB. Co-occurrence of blaNDM with other beta-lactamase-encoding genes was found in 70.6% of carbapenemase-producing isolates. Our study highlights the mechanism of carbapenem-resistance to curb the overwhelming threat posed by the emergence of drug-resistance in India.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary bladder cancer ranks the fourth most common cancer in men worldwide. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are antioxidant enzymes that play an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether PRDX 1 and 2 can be used as a urinary biomarker for surveillance of recurrence in urothelial cancer. Materials and Methods: PRDX1 and PRDX2 expression levels were examined in 119 bladder tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry and in 150 urine samples (case: 100; healthy controls: 50) using ELISA and their association with recurrence and survival of patients was evaluated. Results: Immunohistochemistry on FFPE tissue showed that both PRDX1 and PRDX2 were positive in bladder tumors and expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells. A significant elevation of urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 concentration was found in bladder cancer patients and recurrent cases compared to the urine of healthy controls and primary bladder cancer patients (p<0.001 & p<0.01) respectively. However, the concentration of both proteins was not found associated with survival. Conclusion: Elevated urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 in bladder cancer patients was found to be associated with recurrence and the estimation of urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 during follow-up may help to extend the period between cystoscopies in patient follow-up.

AB  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, characterized by an abnormal transformation of T cells into highly proliferative leukemic lymphoblasts. Identification of common genetic alterations has provided promising opportunities for better risk stratification in T-ALL. Current treatment in T-ALL still poses the major challenge of integrating the knowledge of molecular alterations in the clinical setting. We utilized the Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method to determine the frequency of common copy number alterations (CNAs) in 128 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients. We also studied the association of these CNAs with patient's clinical characteristics and survival. The highest frequency of deletion was observed in CDKN2A (59.38%), followed by CDKN2B (46.88%), LMO1 (37.5%), and MTAP (28.12%). PTPN2 (22.66%), PHF6 (14.06%), and MYB (14.06%) had the highest number of duplication events. A total of 89.06% patients exhibited CNAs. STIL::TAL1, NUP214::ABL1, and LMO2::RAG2 fusions were observed in 5.47%, 3.12%, and 0.78% of patients, respectively. CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and PTPN2 gene deletions were mainly observed in pediatric patients, while CNAs of NF1 and SUZ12 were observed more frequently in adults. In pediatric patients, alterations in CDKN2B, CASP8AP2, and AHI1 were associated with poor prognosis, while SUZ12 and NF1 CNAs were associated with favorable prognosis. In adult patients, ABL1 CNA emerged as an independent indicator of poor prognosis. The observed molecular heterogeneity in T-ALL may provide the basis for variations observed in clinical response in T-ALL and MLPA based CNA detection may help in risk stratification of these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize the effects of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) counselling on epilepsy-related childcare behaviour and practices, and emotional distress, measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scale-21 (DASS-21), among parents of children with epilepsy (CWE), and to obtain feedback about SUDEP counselling.
METHODS: We conducted a single-arm, pre- and post-intervention study design. We enrolled 120 parents of CWE. At enrolment, we collected clinical and demographic data, assessed 18 epilepsy-related childcare and behaviour and practices and the DASS-21 score. Parents underwent a three-phase counselling, comprising SUDEP information via written material, followed by an informative video, and then a detailed face-to-face counselling session with treating clinicians. Changes in epilepsy-related childcare behaviour and practices, and DASS-21 scores were reassessed at one month. Qualitative feedback was obtained about SUDEP counselling.
RESULTS: At one month, 84.2 % of parents reported a change in >2 epilepsy-related childcare behaviour and practices. Significant improvement compared to baseline was observed in reported administration of anti-seizure medications at fixed time (100 % versus 57.5 %; p < 0.0001), regular exercise (87.5 % versus 60 %; p < 0.0001), supervision of activity as advised (56.7-39.2 %; p = 0.0096), having a seizure action plan (97.5 % versus 20 %; p < 0.0001), rescue medications (95 % versus 25.8 %; p < 0.0001), providing information of child's epilepsy to schools (100 % versus 62 %; p < 0.0001), providing an emergency contact number in schools (100 % versus 58 %; p < 0.0001), and a seizure action plan in their child's school (54 % versus 8 %; p < 0.0001). There was no significant change in DASS-21 scores at one month. Parents expressed a preference for face-to-face interaction, in combination with other audiovisual modes, for SUDEP counselling, and being counselled when they were comfortable with their child's diagnosis of epilepsy.
SIGNIFICANCE: SUDEP disclosure among Indian parents of CWE was associated with significant improvement in self-reported epilepsy-related childcare behaviour and practices, without increase in depression, stress or anxiety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the progressive brain disorder which degenerates brain cells connection and causes memory loss. Although AD is irreversible, it is not impossible to arrest or slow down the progression of the disease. However, this would only be possible if the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, and early diagnosis requires clear understanding of the pathogenesis at molecular level. Overactivity of GSK-3β and p53 accounts for tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation of amyloid-β plaques.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we explored GSK-3β and p53 as blood-based biomarkers for early detection of AD.
METHODS: The levels of GSK-3β, p53, and their phosphorylated states were measured using surface plasmon resonance and verified using western blot in serum from AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and geriatric-control (GC) subjects. The neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cell line was treated with antioxidant Emblica Officinalis (EO) for rescue effect.
RESULTS: GSK-3β, p53, and their phosphorylated states were significantly over expressed (p > 0.001) in AD and MCI compared to GC and can differentiate AD and MCI from GC. The expression level of GSK-3β and p53 proteins were found to be downregulated in a dose-dependent manner after the treatment with EO in amyloid-b-induced neurotoxic cells.
CONCLUSION: These proteins can serve as potential blood markers for the diagnosis of AD and EO can suppress their level. This work has translational value and clinical utility in the future.

AB  - The molecular heterogeneity of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) makes this disease complex. Early T-cell precursor ALL (ETP-ALL) is a recognized subtype of T-ALL associated with a high probability of induction failure with conventional therapy. Higher expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (MEF2C) and the absence of a biallelic deletion (ABD) are the designated markers for the ETP-ALL. Co-deletion of the contiguous genes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/2B (CDKN2A/2B) and the methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) cluster, located at 9p21.3, is another common alteration in T-ALL and confers poor response to treatment. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to assess MEF2C mRNA expression and ABD status. Copy number alterations (CNAs) in key genes previously reported to be altered in T-ALL were assessed using multiple ligation probe amplification (MLPA). We observed that CNAs in this co-deletion cluster of CDKN2A/B and MTAP genes exhibited low MEF2C expression while ABD was associated with CNA in the Abelson murine leukemia 1 (ABL1) gene. Assessment of MEF2C expression based on immunophenotype revealed that its association with CDKN2A/2B alteration is present in non-immature immunophenotype. Additionally, ABD was associated with copy number alterations of T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1), myeloblastosis (MYB), and LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) genes in immature immunophenotypes. Further, STIL::TAL1 fusion was associated with low expression of MEF2C. These associations may help explain the difficulties in assessing disease heterogeneity and the prognostic importance of 9p21.3 alterations in T-ALL.

T2  - Journal of Indian Society of Periodontology
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to describe the demographics and clinicopathological characteristics of the cases of plasma cell gingivitis (PCG) reported in our institute, supported by a review of pertinent literature. Further, we investigated the role of the cluster of differentiation CD138, Ki67, CD56, and CD117 immunoexpression in the differential diagnosis of PCG from plasma cell dyscrasias.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All histopathologically confirmed cases of PCG, whose relevant details could be obtained, were included in this study. They were subjected to panel of immunohistochemical markers to exclude plasma cell malignancies. Further, published English literature for PCG since 1970-2020 was reviewed.
RESULTS: Nine histopathologically confirmed cases of PCG, were retrieved from the archives of our department. The cases comprised 3 males and 6 females with their ages ranging between 14 and 82 years. The plasma cells exhibited equivocal reactivity for kappa and lambda; and immunonegativity for CD56, CD117 with low Ki67 proliferation index. Published literature in English showed 43 cases of PCG were predominantly female; the diffuse involvement of maxilla and mandible was a common finding.
CONCLUSION: In addition to kappa lambda reactivity, an immunoprofile of CD138, Ki67, CD56, and CD117 may be used as a diagnostic adjunct to exclude malignant plasma cell lesions in confusing cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the macular vessel density (VD) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) using proprietary software (automated) and image processing software (manual) in diabetic patients.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, OCT-A images (Triton, TOPCON Inc.) of type 2 diabetics presenting to a tertiary eye care center in North India between January 2018 and December 2019 with or without nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and with no macular edema were analyzed. Macular images of size 3 × 3 mm were binarized with global thresholding algorithms (ImageJ software). Outcome measures were superficial capillary plexus VD (SCP-VD, automated and manual), deep capillary plexus VD (DCP-VD, manual), and correlation between automated and manual SCP-VD.
RESULTS: OCT-A images of 89 eyes (55 patients) were analyzed: no diabetic retinopathy (NoDR): 29 eyes, mild NPDR: 29 eyes, and moderate NPDR: 31 eyes. Automated SCP-VD did not differ between NoDR and mild NPDR (P = 0.69), but differed between NoDR and moderate NPDR (P = 0.014) and between mild and moderate NPDR (P = 0.033). Manual SCP-VD (Huang and Otsu methods) did not differ between the groups. Manual DCP-VD differed between NoDR and mild NPDR and between NoDR and moderate NPDR, but not between mild and moderate NPDR with both Huang (P = 0.024, 0.003, and 0.51, respectively) and Otsu (P = 0.021, 0.006, and 0.43, respectively) methods. Automated SCP-VD correlated moderately with manual SCP-VD using Huang method (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) with a mean difference of -0.01% (agreement limits from -6.60% to +6.57%).
CONCLUSION: DCP-VD differs consistently between NoDR and NPDR with image processing, while SCP-VD shows variable results. Different thresholding algorithms provide different results, and there is a need to establish consensus on the most suited algorithm.

TI  - Modeling ligand-macromolecular interactions as eigenvalue-based transition-state dissociation constants may offer insights into biochemical function of the resulting complexes
AU  - Kundu, Siddhartha
T2  - Mathematical biosciences and engineering: MBE
AB  - A ligand when bound to a macromolecule (protein, DNA, RNA) will influence the biochemical function of that macromolecule. This observation is empirical and attributable to the association of the ligand with the amino acids/nucleotides that comprise the macromolecule. The binding affinity is a measure of the strength-of-association of a macromolecule for its ligand and is numerically characterized by the association/dissociation constant. However, despite being widely used, a mathematically rigorous explanation by which the association/dissociation constant can influence the biochemistry and molecular biology of the resulting complex is not available. Here, the ligand-macromolecular complex is modeled as a homo- or hetero-dimer with a finite and equal number of atoms/residues per monomer. The pairwise interactions are numeric, empirically motivated and are randomly chosen from a standard uniform distribution. The transition-state dissociation constants are the strictly positive real part of all complex eigenvalues of this interaction matrix, belong to the open interval (0,1), and form a sequence whose terms are finite, monotonic, non-increasing and convergent. The theoretical results are rigorous, presented as theorems, lemmas and corollaries and are complemented by numerical studies. An inferential analysis of the clinical outcomes of amino acid substitutions of selected enzyme homodimers is also presented. These findings are extendible to higher-order complexes such as those likely to occur in vivo. The study also presents a schema by which a ligand can be annotated and partitioned into high- and low-affinity variants. The influence of the transition-state dissociation constants on the biochemistry and molecular biology of non-haem iron (Ⅱ)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (catalysis) and major histocompatibility complex (Ⅰ) mediated export of high-affinity peptides (non-enzymatic association/dissociation) are examined as special cases.

TI  - TemporalGSSA: A numerically robust R-wrapper to facilitate computation of a metabolite-specific and simulation time-dependent trajectory from stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA)-generated datasets
AU  - Kundu, Siddhartha
T2  - Journal of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
AB  - Whilst data on biochemical networks has increased several-fold, our comprehension of the underlying molecular biology is incomplete and inadequate. Simulation studies permit data collation from disparate time points and the imputed trajectories can provide valuable insights into the molecular biology of complex biochemical systems. Although, stochastic simulations are accurate, each run is an independent event and the data that is generated cannot be directly compared even with identical simulation times. This lack of robustness will preclude a biologically meaningful result for the metabolite(s) of concern and is a significant limitation of this approach. "TemporalGSSA" or temporal Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is an R-wrapper which will collate and partition SSA-generated datasets with identical simulation times (trials) into finite sets of linear models (technical replicates). Each such model (time step of a single run, absolute number of molecules for a metabolite) computes several coefficients (slope, intercept, etc.). These coefficients are averaged (mean slope, mean intercept) across all trials of a technical replicate and along with an imputed time step (mean, median, random) is incorporated into a linear regression equation. The solution to this equation is the number of molecules of a metabolite which is used to compute the molar concentration of the metabolite per technical replicate. The summarized (mean, standard deviation) data of this vector of technical replicates is the outcome or numerical estimate of the molar concentration of a metabolite and is dependent on the duration of the simulation. If the SSA-generated dataset comprises runs with differing simulation times, "TemporalGSSA" can compute the time-dependent trajectory of a metabolite provided the trials-per technical replicate constraint is complied with. The algorithms deployed by "TemporalGSSA" are rigorous, have a sound theoretical basis and have contributed meaningfully to our comprehension of the mechanism(s) that drive complex biochemical systems. "TemporalGSSA", is robust, freely accessible and easy to use with several readily testable examples.

AU  - Kusuma, Yadlapalli S.
AU  - Kant, Shashi
T2  - Vaccine: X
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the most desired solution to combat COVID-19. We examined the willingness to accept the vaccine and reasons for vaccine hesitancy, and identified some factors associated with the vaccine hesitancy among the socio-economically disadvantaged urban population from Delhi, India.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a randomly selected sample of 1539 households from 31 urban clusters. Data on socio-demographics, health beliefs, and willingness to accept the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were collected through a face-to-face interviewer-administered, pre-tested questionnaire from an adult member. Vaccine acceptance/hesitancy was analysed by various socio-demographic and health belief variables. Multinomial regressions were carried out to identify the factors associated with the vaccine hesitancy.
RESULTS: Overall, 64.9% (95% CI: 62.5 to 67.3) of the respondents would accept the vaccine, 17.4% (95% CI: 15.6 to 19.4) were undecided, and 17.7% (95% CI: 15.8 to 19.7) would not accept the vaccine. The reasons for not accepting the vaccine were: belief that they had immunity (12.9%), the corona was a hoax (11.8%), the vaccine was not necessary (7.4%), and did not want to disturb the natural bodily systems by the vaccine (5.6%). The undecided group mainly would like to wait and see (37.7%), decide when the vaccine become available (11.6%), will take if everyone in their community takes (10.4%). Multinomial logistic regression identified older age, low perceived susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, low perceived severity of COVID-19, low self-efficacy to protect against COVID-19, and unawareness and non-use of Arogyasetu App as significant predictors of vaccine hesitancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of Delhi's low-income groups would accept the vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine hesitancy was associated with older age, low perceived susceptibility, low perceived severity, and low self-efficacy to protect themselves from COVID-19. Hence, efforts are needed to address these issues and vaccine concerns to increase the vaccine uptake.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare osteocalcin and crestal bone loss in implants placed under an immediate loading (IL) compared to a delayed loading (DL) protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This preliminary, split-mouth, randomized controlled trial included 14 participants who required replacement of both mandibular first molars opposing a completely dentate maxillary arch. Two implants were placed in each participant. According to the split-mouth randomization method, a temporary crown was used for the IL protocol and a healing abutment was used for the DL protocol in each participant. Definitive crowns were cemented 3 months after implant placement. Osteocalcin levels were determined using ELISA, and crestal bone loss was evaluated using radiographs at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after implant placement.
RESULTS: The mean osteocalcin level was significantly higher with IL than DL at each point (P < .001), with 95% CI of -262.89 to -439.10 (2 weeks); -238.02 to -375.98 (3 months); and -83.24 to -211.61 (12 months). Higher crestal bone loss was observed in IL when compared to DL implants at 2 weeks (P = .458, 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.21). Less crestal bone loss was observed with IL than DL at 3 months (P = .935) and 12 months (P = .42).
CONCLUSION: Osteocalcin levels increased in both IL and DL implants, but higher levels were observed with IL. Higher crestal bone loss was observed with IL during the initial stages of treatment only.

AB  - Central granular cell odontogenic tumor (CGCOT) is sporadic benign odontogenic tumor and it especially occurs in women older than 50 years of age. Radiologically it manifests as unilocular to the multilocular radiolucency with sometimes mixed densities. Histopathology displays sheets and islands of large eosinophilic cells with abundant granular cytoplasm, however few cases exhibit inadequate epithelium, thus creating a diagnostic confusion. Though, resection is advocated by some surgeons, however because of the non-aggressive biological behaviour, enucleation or curettage is the treatment of choice for this lesion. Till now only 39 cases have been reported in the past six decades. We are reporting the first case of CGCOT occurring in the youngest age of eleven-year-old patient with massive size of 11 × 7 × 6 cm. This would add CGCOT as a differential diagnosis in the bony lesions of younger individuals. In addition, the importance of immunohistochemistry studies in cases with scarce odontogenic epithelium and the potential role of Carnoy's solution in the management of this rare tumor in this age group was emphasized.

AB  - The Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI-DAD) is a nationally representative in-depth study of cognitive aging and dementia. We present a publicly available dataset of harmonized cognitive measures of 4,096 adults 60 years of age and older in India, collected across 18 states and union territories. Blood samples were obtained to carry out whole blood and serum-based assays. Results are included in a venous blood specimen datafile that can be linked to the Harmonized LASI-DAD dataset. A global screening array of 960 LASI-DAD respondents is also publicly available for download, in addition to neuroimaging data on 137 LASI-DAD participants. Altogether, these datasets provide comprehensive information on older adults in India that allow researchers to further understand risk factors associated with cognitive impairment and dementia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted many facets of critical care delivery.
METHODS: An electronic survey was distributed to explore the pandemic's perceived impact on neurocritical care delivery between June 2020 and March 2021. Variables were stratified by World Bank country income level, presence of a dedicated neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and experiencing a COVID-19 patient surge.
RESULTS: Respondents from 253 hospitals (78.3% response rate) from 47 countries (45.5% low/middle income countries; 54.5% with a dedicated NCCU; 78.6% experienced a first surge) participated in the study. Independent of country income level, NCCU and surge status, participants reported reductions in NCCU admissions (67%), critical care drug shortages (69%), reduction in ancillary services (43%) and routine diagnostic testing (61%), and temporary cancellation of didactic teaching (44%) and clinical/basic science research (70%). Respondents from low/middle income countries were more likely to report lack of surge preparedness (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.8) and struggling to return to prepandemic standards of care (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 4.4-34) compared with respondents from high-income countries. Respondents experiencing a surge were more likely to report conversion of NCCUs and general-mixed intensive care units (ICUs) to a COVID-ICU (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3), conversion of non-ICU beds to ICU beds (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5), and deviations in critical care and pharmaceutical practices (OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.2). Respondents from hospitals with a dedicated NCCU were less likely to report conversion to a COVID-ICU (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) or conversion of non-ICU to ICU beds (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9).
CONCLUSION: This study reports the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global neurocritical care delivery, and highlights shortcomings of health care infrastructures and the importance of pandemic preparedness.

AB  - PURPOSE: To map healthcare utilized by subjects with chronic otitis media, with or without cholesteatoma and perform a cost analysis to determine key drivers of healthcare expenditure.
METHODS: A registry study of 656 adult subjects with chronic otitis media that underwent a middle ear surgery between 2014 and 2018. Healthcare contacts related to all publicly funded specialist ENT care, audiological care and primary care for a disease of the ear and mastoid process were extracted. The data are extracted from the Swedish National Patient Registry on subjects that reside in western Sweden.
RESULTS: Subjects made 13,782 healthcare contacts at a total cost 61.1 million SEK (6.0 million EUR) between 2014 and 2018. The mean cost per subject was 93,075 SEK (9071 EUR) and ranged between 3971 SEK (387 EUR) and 468,711 SEK (45,683 EUR) per individual. In the most expensive quartile of subjects, mean cost was 192,353 SEK (18,747 EUR) over the 5-year period. These subjects made 3227 ENT contacts (roughly four each year) and 60% of total costs were associated with in-patient ENT care.
CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic otitis media are associated with high ENT resource utilization that does not diminish after surgical intervention and the disease places a long-term burden on healthcare systems. Significant costs are attributed to revision surgeries, indicating that these patients could be managed more effectively. In many such cases, reoperation cannot be avoided, especially due to recurrence of cholesteatoma. However, in some patients, when the indication for subsequent surgery is only hearing improvement, alternative options, such as hearing aids or implants, should also be considered. This is especially true in difficult cases, where revision ossiculoplasty is likely.

AB  - We aimed to estimate the household secondary infection attack rate (hSAR) of SARS-CoV-2 in investigations aligned with the WHO Unity Studies Household Transmission Investigations (HHTI) protocol. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and medRxiv/bioRxiv for "Unity-aligned" First Few X cases (FFX) and HHTIs published 1 December 2019 to 26 July 2021. Standardised early results were shared by WHO Unity Studies collaborators (to 1 October 2021). We used a bespoke tool to assess investigation methodological quality. Values for hSAR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted or calculated from crude data. Heterogeneity was assessed by visually inspecting overlap of CIs on forest plots and quantified in meta-analyses. Of 9988 records retrieved, 80 articles (64 from databases; 16 provided by Unity Studies collaborators) were retained in the systematic review; 62 were included in the primary meta-analysis. hSAR point estimates ranged from 2% to 90% (95% prediction interval: 3%-71%; I 2 = 99.7%); I 2 values remained >99% in subgroup analyses, indicating high, unexplained heterogeneity and leading to a decision not to report pooled hSAR estimates. FFX and HHTI remain critical epidemiological tools for early and ongoing characterisation of novel infectious pathogens. The large, unexplained variance in hSAR estimates emphasises the need to further support standardisation in planning, conduct and analysis, and for clear and comprehensive reporting of FFX and HHTIs in time and place, to guide evidence-based pandemic preparedness and response efforts for SARS-CoV-2, influenza and future novel respiratory viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The potential role of the transcription factor Differentiated embryo-chondrocyte 2 (Dec2) in the progression of inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis has been unclear. Here, the effect of Dec2 on the expression of RANKL and on osteoclastogenesis was determined.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and Dec2 knockout (KO) mice as a model for periodontitis were used to assess alveolar bone resorption by microcomputed tomography (CT). Western blot, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses were utilized to detect inflammation and osteoclasts. Luciferase reporter and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays examined the interaction between Dec2 and RANKL.
RESULTS: Micro-CT showed that the alveolar bone resorption of Dec2KO mice was more severe than WT mice after treatment with P. gingivalis. Immunohistochemistry and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining showed active osteoclast differentiation in Dec2KO mice. There was an increase in CD11b+ F4/80+ and CD4+ RANKL+ T cells in Dec2KO mice treated with P. gingivalis. Moreover, inflammatory and immune markers were expressed at significantly higher levels in gingival mononuclear cells in Dec2KO mice. Furthermore, luciferase reporter and ChIP assays confirmed the direct binding of Dec2 protein to the RANKL gene.
CONCLUSION: Dec2 has an immune regulation ability that modulates P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis via RANKL.

AB  - AIM: We aimed to estimate the coverage of a population-based Non-communicable Disease (NCD) screening program using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS) and identify factors affecting its implementation in district Nuh of Haryana, India.
METHOD: A mixed-methods study was conducted with an initial LQAS coverage survey, followed by in-depth interviews. Thirty lots (villages or towns) were sampled in the district, and 20 people aged ≥ 30 years were randomly sampled from each lot. Participants were asked about receiving services under the program. Weighted coverage estimates, which is the proportion of people who had received screening services, were estimated. Using a decision value of more than nine negative responses out of 20 persons, all 30 lots were classified as good or poor performing. In-depth interviews of healthcare providers of good performing lots and district-level health officials were conducted, and factors affecting program implementation were identified.
FINDINGS: Six hundred participants were interviewed (mean age of 44.8 years, 57.2% women). The proportion of people who reported having undergone screening for diabetes or hypertension was 2.1%, and all lots performed poorly based on decision value. Key factors affecting the program were leadership, prioritization of NCD activities, ensuring human resource and material requirements, regular incentives, qualities of workers, and community engagement.
CONCLUSION: The screening coverage under the population-based NCD screening program was low in district Nuh, Haryana. This needs to be improved by addressing the identified health system and community-related factors.

AB  - We estimated the proportion of children with stereopsis following surgery in congenital and developmental cataracts by systematic review and meta-analysis and also considered the factors influencing stereopsis, such as intervention age and presence of strabismus. Stereopsis is directly related to quality of life, and investigating its levels following cataract surgery in children may help decide the right time to intervene, particularly in the context of brain plasticity. We conducted a systematic literature search using Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science and found 25 case series, 3 cohorts, and 3 clinical trial studies from 1/1/1995 to 31/12/2020. Study-specific proportions of stereopsis from 923 children were pooled using a random-effects model, and stratified analyses were conducted based on intervention age and pre-existing strabismus as a confounder. We appraised the risk of bias using tools published by National Institutes of Health and evaluated publication bias with funnel plots and the Egger test. The pooled proportions of stereopsis based on 8 unilateral and 6 bilateral congenital cataract studies were 0.37 (95% CIs: [0.24, 0.53]) and 0.45 (95% CIs: [0.24,0.68]) when patients with preexisting strabismus were excluded as a confounder. When the intervention age was ≤6 months, proportions in unilateral congenital cataract group significantly increased to 0.52 (95% CIs: [0.37, 0.66]; P = 0.49) compared to 0.26 (95% CIs: [0.14, 0.44]; P = 0.16) otherwise. A similar increase in proportions was found when intervention age ≤4 months. In both unilateral and bilateral congenital cataract groups, proportions increased significantly when the confounder was excluded. Overall, proportions in bilateral congenital cataracts were significantly greater than unilateral cases (irrespective of confounder). Eight unilateral and 5 bilateral developmental cataract studies resulted in pooled proportions of 0.62 (95% CIs: [0.27, 0.88] and 0.82 (95% CIs: [0.4, 0.97]), respectively. Although proportions for bilateral developmental cataracts were greater than unilateral cataracts (irrespective of confounder), results were not statistically significant. Finally, proportions in unilateral developmental cataracts were significantly greater than unilateral congenital cataracts (Z = 7.413, P = 6.173694e-14). We conclude that surgical intervention within first 4-6 months can significantly affect postoperative outcomes in unilateral congenital cataracts. Analysis of existing data does not show a significant effect of intervention age on stereopsis outcomes for developmental cataracts.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: A crown-root fracture is a fracture of both the crown and the root of a tooth. The International Association of Dental Traumatology (2020) guidelines recommended fragment reattachment and stabilization of loose fragments as an immediate management protocol for uncomplicated crown-root fractures. However, the lack of evidence and unpredictability make it a less popular treatment option. The aim of this study was to compare three protocols of fragment reattachment for the management of teeth with crown-root fractures.
METHODOLOGY: Eighty mandibular bovine incisors with similar dimensions and no structural deformities were selected and randomized into four groups: Group I (Control/sound teeth); Group II (no rehydration); Group III (rehydration in distilled water for 15 min) and Group IV (rehydration in a humidification chamber for 15 min). A fracture was simulated to extend from the labial side of the middle-third of the crown to the palatal side of the cervical-third of the root. Fragments were exposed to the environment under normal temperature and pressure. Fragments were later reattached as per the standard protocol following the rehydration as specified for each group. Samples were subjected to thermocycling, and the force required to fracture them was evaluated by using a universal testing machine.
RESULTS: The highest mean force required to fracture was seen in Group IV (208.27 ± 75.99 N) followed by Group III (182.01 ± 90.13 N) and Group II (158.85 ± 68.04 N). These differences were statistically significant. Comparison of the mean difference of force required to fracture between pairs of groups revealed statistically significant mean differences only between the controls and each experimental group.
CONCLUSION: The force required to fracture the reattached fragments in teeth with crown-root fractures was affected by rehydration of the fragments. The force was higher in fragments reattached after rehydration, and the highest force was required in the teeth that had been rehydrated in a humidification chamber.

AB  - Objective: To present an atypical case of tuberculous dacryocystitis. Method: An adult female presented with long standing epiphora with gradual swelling over lacrimal sac region. On syringing, water was felt in throat with no regurgitation. CT-DCG and CECT orbit were done subsequently and simultaneously. Ill-defined, enhancing soft tissue surrounding and involving the lacrimal sac wall was identified. The sac wall outline was seen distorted with contrast in NLD. The histopathology was suggestive of non-specific chronic inflammation. GeneXpert analysis was shown to be very low positive for M. tuberculosis. Montoux test was strongly positive (40 x 40 mm). ATT was started. Results: The swelling and watering subsided over the next few months. Conclusion: Tuberculosis should be considered in cases of chronic granulomatous dacryocystitis. CECT with CT-DCG is essential imaging. GeneXpert is a new and sensitive tool with considerable specificity in cases in which histopathology is not conclusive. ATT is curative and DCR is reserved for only unresolved NLDO with persistent epiphora.

AB  - CASE: We report 2 cases of atraumatic, bilateral femoral neck fracture nonunions. Both the patients were relatively young and had underlying nutritional osteomalacia. In both cases, valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy was performed along with vitamin D and calcium supplementation. The patients were followed up for an average of 3 years and achieved bone union without any complications.
CONCLUSION: Bilateral femoral neck fractures are rare, and bilateral nonunion of femoral neck fractures secondary to osteomalacia is even rarer. Valgus intertrochanteric osteotomy can salvage the hip. Correction of underlying osteomalacia by vitamin D and calcium supplementation preceeded surgical intervention in our cases.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the highest incidence of all common neurological disorders, and poses a substantial public health burden. TBI is increasingly documented not only as an acute condition but also as a chronic disease with long-term consequences, including an increased risk of late-onset neurodegeneration. The first Lancet Neurology Commission on TBI, published in 2017, called for a concerted effort to tackle the global health problem posed by TBI. Since then, funding agencies have supported research both in high-income countries (HICs) and in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). In November 2020, the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of WHO, passed resolution WHA73.10 for global actions on epilepsy and other neurological disorders, and WHO launched the Decade for Action on Road Safety plan in 2021. New knowledge has been generated by large observational studies, including those conducted under the umbrella of the International Traumatic Brain Injury Research (InTBIR) initiative, established as a collaboration of funding agencies in 2011. InTBIR has also provided a huge stimulus to collaborative research in TBI and has facilitated participation of global partners. The return on investment has been high, but many needs of patients with TBI remain unaddressed. This update to the 2017 Commission presents advances and discusses persisting and new challenges in prevention, clinical care, and research. In LMICs, the occurrence of TBI is driven by road traffic incidents, often involving vulnerable road users such as motorcyclists and pedestrians. In HICs, most TBI is caused by falls, particularly in older people (aged ≥65 years), who often have comorbidities. Risk factors such as frailty and alcohol misuse provide opportunities for targeted prevention actions. Little evidence exists to inform treatment of older patients, who have been commonly excluded from past clinical trials—consequently, appropriate evidence is urgently required. Although increasing age is associated with worse outcomes from TBI, age should not dictate limitations in therapy. However, patients injured by low-energy falls (who are mostly older people) are about 50% less likely to receive critical care or emergency interventions, compared with those injured by high-energy mechanisms, such as road traffic incidents. Mild TBI, defined as a Glasgow Coma sum score of 13–15, comprises most of the TBI cases (over 90%) presenting to hospital. Around 50% of adult patients with mild TBI presenting to hospital do not recover to pre-TBI levels of health by 6 months after their injury. Fewer than 10% of patients discharged after presenting to an emergency department for TBI in Europe currently receive follow-up. Structured follow-up after mild TBI should be considered good practice, and urgent research is needed to identify which patients with mild TBI are at risk for incomplete recovery. The selection of patients for CT is an important triage decision in mild TBI since it allows early identification of lesions that can trigger hospital admission or life-saving surgery. Current decision making for deciding on CT is inefficient, with 90–95% of scanned patients showing no intracranial injury but being subjected to radiation risks. InTBIR studies have shown that measurement of blood-based biomarkers adds value to previously proposed clinical decision rules, holding the potential to improve efficiency while reducing radiation exposure. Increased concentrations of biomarkers in the blood of patients with a normal presentation CT scan suggest structural brain damage, which is seen on MR scanning in up to 30% of patients with mild TBI. Advanced MRI, including diffusion tensor imaging and volumetric analyses, can identify additional injuries not detectable by visual inspection of standard clinical MR images. Thus, the absence of CT abnormalities does not exclude structural damage—an observation relevant to litigation procedures, to management of mild TBI, and when CT scans are insufficient to explain the severity of the clinical condition. Although blood-based protein biomarkers have been shown to have important roles in the evaluation of TBI, most available assays are for research use only. To date, there is only one vendor of such assays with regulatory clearance in Europe and the USA with an indication to rule out the need for CT imaging for patients with suspected TBI. Regulatory clearance is provided for a combination of biomarkers, although evidence is accumulating that a single biomarker can perform as well as a combination. Additional biomarkers and more clinical-use platforms are on the horizon, but cross-platform harmonisation of results is needed. Health-care efficiency would benefit from diversity in providers. In the intensive care setting, automated analysis of blood pressure and intracranial pressure with calculation of derived parameters can help individualise management of TBI. Interest in the identification of subgroups of patients who might benefit more from some specific therapeutic approaches than others represents a welcome shift towards precision medicine. Comparative-effectiveness research to identify best practice has delivered on expectations for providing evidence in support of best practices, both in adult and paediatric patients with TBI. Progress has also been made in improving outcome assessment after TBI. Key instruments have been translated into up to 20 languages and linguistically validated, and are now internationally available for clinical and research use. TBI affects multiple domains of functioning, and outcomes are affected by personal characteristics and life-course events, consistent with a multifactorial bio-psycho-socio-ecological model of TBI, as presented in the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) 2022 report. Multidimensional assessment is desirable and might be best based on measurement of global functional impairment. More work is required to develop and implement recommendations for multidimensional assessment. Prediction of outcome is relevant to patients and their families, and can facilitate the benchmarking of quality of care. InTBIR studies have identified new building blocks (eg, blood biomarkers and quantitative CT analysis) to refine existing prognostic models. Further improvement in prognostication could come from MRI, genetics, and the integration of dynamic changes in patient status after presentation. Neurotrauma researchers traditionally seek translation of their research findings through publications, clinical guidelines, and industry collaborations. However, to effectively impact clinical care and outcome, interactions are also needed with research funders, regulators, and policy makers, and partnership with patient organisations. Such interactions are increasingly taking place, with exemplars including interactions with the All Party Parliamentary Group on Acquired Brain Injury in the UK, the production of the NASEM report in the USA, and interactions with the US Food and Drug Administration. More interactions should be encouraged, and future discussions with regulators should include debates around consent from patients with acute mental incapacity and data sharing. Data sharing is strongly advocated by funding agencies. From January 2023, the US National Institutes of Health will require upload of research data into public repositories, but the EU requires data controllers to safeguard data security and privacy regulation. The tension between open data-sharing and adherence to privacy regulation could be resolved by cross-dataset analyses on federated platforms, with the data remaining at their original safe location. Tools already exist for conventional statistical analyses on federated platforms, however federated machine learning requires further development. Support for further development of federated platforms, and neuroinformatics more generally, should be a priority. This update to the 2017 Commission presents new insights and challenges across a range of topics around TBI: epidemiology and prevention (section 1); system of care (section 2); clinical management (section 3); characterisation of TBI (section 4); outcome assessment (section 5); prognosis (Section 6); and new directions for acquiring and implementing evidence (section 7). Table 1 summarises key messages from this Commission and proposes recommendations for the way forward to advance research and clinical management of TBI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasound elastography noninvasively estimates tissue hardness. Studies have evaluated elastography for differentiating malignant from benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Several methods of performing elastography are described with variable diagnostic accuracy.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate endobronchial ultrasound-guided elastography in differentiating malignant from benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to extract the relevant studies. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity [with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)], and positive and negative likelihood ratios of elastography.
RESULTS: After a systematic search, 20 studies (1600 patients, 2712 nodes) were selected. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. The summary receiver operating curve demonstrated an area under the curve for elastography of 0.90 (0.88-0.93). The positive and negative likelihood ratios and the diagnostic odds ratio were 4.3 (95% CI, 3.3-5.5), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07-0.20), and 35 (95% CI, 19-63), respectively. Of the most commonly described methods, the color classification method (type 3 malignant vs. type 1 benign) demonstrated the highest area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.93). There was significant heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analyses indicated no significant difference between the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative and qualitative elastography methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound elastography is useful in differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. However, elastography does not replace the requirement of lymph node aspiration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ultrasonographic characteristics may help differentiate between benign and malignant lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). There is limited data on the utility of various ultrasonographic lymph node features to differentiate between malignant and tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
METHODS: We studied the various EBUS ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics (size, shape, margins, heterogeneous echotexture, calcification, central hilar structure, lymph node conglomeration, central intranodal vessel, and coagulation necrosis sign) from our available EBUS-TBNA database.
RESULTS: We extracted 1086 subjects [547 with tuberculosis (TB) and 539 with malignant diagnosis]. Comparing the 2 groups (multivariate analysis), presence of central hilar structure (8.2% vs. 2.6%), coagulation necrosis sign (37.5% vs. 13.7%), lymph node conglomeration (30.5% vs. 7.2%), calcification (5.1% vs. 1.5%), and distinct margins (83.5% vs. 69.8%), were significantly more common in TB ( P <0.05). On the other hand, malignant lymph nodes were larger and more likely to show the presence of a central intranodal vessel (20% vs. 15.8%, P =0.04, multivariate analysis). The absence of lymph node conglomeration had the highest overall diagnostic accuracy (0.61) for the differentiation between malignant and tuberculous lymph nodes.
CONCLUSION: Sonographic lymph node characteristics may help differentiate malignant and tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Contrary to previously published literature, we observed coagulation necrosis sign, heterogeneous echotexture and absent central intranodal vessel, more commonly in TB than malignant nodes. These findings from a TB endemic setting are different from other settings, where the prevalence of lung cancer is high in patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease with a varied clinical presentation. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients with sarcoidosis from a tuberculosis (TB) endemic setting.
METHODS: We performed an analysis of the sarcoidosis database at a tertiary care facility in North India.
RESULTS: Of the 327 patients, 50.8% were male, with a mean age of 42.8 years (range: 16-70 years). Females were significantly older. 42.6% had comorbidities, of which diabetes (17.1%) was most common. More than half (57.1%) were obese. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were elevated in 186 (57.9%). Eleven (3.8%) had hypercalcemia, while hypercalciuria was present in 54 (31.7%). The majority (89.9%) were tuberculin skin test negative (<10 mm induration), while 71.9% were tuberculin anergic. 47.7% had normal spirometry, while a restrictive impairment was the most common abnormality (44.6%). Obstruction on spirometry was present in 8.3%. Nearly half (160, 49%) had involvement of an extrapulmonary site. Most patients were (96%) symptomatic. Cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, and fever were the predominant symptoms. A majority had Stage 1 (47.7%) sarcoidosis. Two hundred and eighty-seven (87.8%) patients underwent bronchoscopy or endosonographic (endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration [EBUS-TBNA] or transesophageal bronchoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration [EUS-B-FNA]) sampling. A histopathological diagnosis with the demonstration of granulomas was achieved in 90.8%. The diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA/EUS-B-FNA was 77.4%. In 13.5% of patients, necrotizing granulomas were present in tissue samples.
CONCLUSION: The clinical profile of patients with sarcoidosis in TB endemic settings has certain differences from nonendemic populations. Bronchoscopy and endosonography allow a confident diagnosis in the majority of patients.

AB  - Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis has associations with both thrombosis and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH). Management of patients having coexistence of both thrombotic and hemorrhagic manifestations is challenging. Thrombotic conditions require anticoagulation, which can theoretically increase the risk of bleeding and thereby worsen DAH. In this review, we highlight the management of a patient of granulomatosis with polyangiitis with DAH who developed deep vein thrombosis. A systematic review of the literature was also performed summarizing and discussing the issues pertaining to the management of such patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Elastography is a non-invasive tool that may allow differentiation between benign and malignant lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). In tuberculosis (TB) endemic areas, clinicoradiological features of mediastinal TB and sarcoidosis often overlap, rendering an accurate diagnosis challenging. There is interest in the identification of modalities to aid in this differentiation. There are currently no published data on the utility of EBUS-elastography in differentiating between TB and sarcoidosis.
METHODS: Subjects undergoing EBUS-TBNA were prospectively enrolled, and elastography features were observed. Subjects with definitive diagnosis of TB or sarcoidosis were enrolled. The elastography features recorded included the three-colour classification patterns and strain ratio.
RESULTS: We enrolled 96 subjects with a definitive diagnosis (53 with TB and 43 with sarcoidosis). Of the 27 patients in whom the lymph nodes were classified as type 1 on endobronchial ultrasound elastography colour pattern, 17 had a diagnosis of TB (62.9%), while 10 were sarcoidosis (37%). For type 2 lymph nodes, 20/45 (44.4%) were TB and 25/45 (55.6%) were sarcoidosis. Type 3 lymph nodes were TB in 16/24 (66.7%) and sarcoidosis in 8/24 (33.3%). In classifying type 1 as 'sarcoidosis' and Type 3 as 'tubercular', the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy were 48.5%, 55.6%, 66.7%, 37%, and 0.51, respectively. The strain ratio (Median [IQR]) was 1.29 (0.37-5.98) in TB and 2.10 (0.83-4.52) in sarcoidosis group (P = 0.48).
CONCLUSION: Ultrasound elastographic lymph node characteristics have a poor diagnostic utility to differentiate between TB and sarcoidosis during EBUS-TBNA.

AB  - The median age of presentation for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is lower in developing countries with a higher proportion under 5 years of age possibly attributable to the high prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus-driven disease. It is unclear whether the clinical presentation and outcomes of this cohort are different with concern regarding late effects being most pronounced in this age group. We report the outcome of children under 5 years of age enrolled in the InPOG-HL-15-01, the first multicentric collaborative study for newly diagnosed children and adolescents with HL from India. Thirty-five (9%) of the study population was younger than 5 years with a striking male preponderance of 34:1. They were less likely to have bulky disease, mediastinal or splenic involvement. The outcomes appear to be at least as favorable as in the older patient group. Efforts need to be made to evolve treatment strategies that spare this very young cohort from potential late effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which not only produces respiratory symptoms but is known to involve almost every system, and its neuroinvasive properties have been well demonstrated throughout the pandemic. Also, to combat the pandemic, there was rapid development and induction of various vaccination drives, following which many adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) have been reported, which include neurological complications as well.
METHOD: We present a series of three cases, post vaccination, with and without a history of COVID illness that showed remarkably similar findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
RESULT: A 38-year-old male presented with complaints of weakness of the bilateral lower limbs with sensory loss and bladder disturbance a day after receiving his first dose of ChadOx1 nCoV-19 (COVISHIELD) vaccine. A 50-year-old male with hypothyroidism characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis and impaired glucose tolerance experienced difficulty in walking 11.5 weeks after being administered with COVID vaccine (COVAXIN). A 38-year-old male presented with subacute onset progressive symmetric quadriparesis 2 months after their first dose of a COVID vaccine. The patient also had sensory ataxia, and his vibration sensation was impaired below C7. All three patients had typical pattern of involvement of the brain and spine on MRI with signal changes in bilateral corticospinal tracts, trigeminal tracts in the brain, and both lateral and posterior columns in the spine.
CONCLUSION: This pattern of brain and spine involvement on MRI is a novel finding and is likely a result of post-vaccination/post-COVID immune-mediated demyelination.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) incurs substantial health and economic burden, as it is the leading reason for death and disability globally. Endocrine abnormalities are no longer considered a rare complication of TBI. The reported prevalence is variable across studies, depending on the time frame of injury, time and type of testing, and variability in hormonal values considered normal across different studies. The present review reports evidence on the endocrine dysfunction that can occur after TBI. Several aspects, including the pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical consequences/challenges (in the acute and chronic phases), screening and diagnostic workup, principles of therapeutic management, and insights on future directions/research agenda, are presented. The management of hypopituitarism following TBI involves hormonal replacement therapy. It is essential for health care providers to be aware of this complication because at times, symptoms may be subtle and may be mistaken to be caused by brain injury itself. There is a need for stronger evidence for establishing recommendations for optimum management so that they can be incorporated as standard of care in TBI management.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surgical complication following esophageal atresia repair is one of the several factors known to influence the final outcomes. Early identification of such complications may help in timely institution of therapeutic measures and translate into improved prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of procalcitonin in early prediction of the adverse events after surgery in patients of esophageal atresia and the temporal relationship with clinical manifestations and other inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study on consecutive patients of esophageal atresia (n = 23). Serum procalcitonin and CRP levels were assessed at baseline (prior to surgery) and on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14. The trends in the biomarker values and temporal relationships of deviation in trend with the clinical and conventional laboratory parameters and patient outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Baseline serum procalcitonin was elevated (n = 23; 1.7 ng/ml: min: 0.07 ng/ml-max: 24.36 ng/ml) in 18/23 (78.3%) patients. Procalcitonin nearly doubled on POD-1 (n = 22; 3.28 ng/ml: min: 0.64 ng/ml-max: 16.51 ng/ml) followed by a gradual decline. CRP was also elevated on POD-1 (three times the baseline) and depicted a delayed peak at POD-3. POD-1 procalcitonin and CRP levels correlated with survival. POD-1 procalcitonin cutoff at 3.28 ng/ml predicted mortality with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 57.9% (P = 0.05). Serum procalcitonin and CRP were higher for patients who sustained complications, so was the time required for hemodynamic stabilization. Procalcitonin (baseline and POD-5) and CRP (POD-3 and POD-5) values correlated with the clinical course after surgery. Baseline procalcitonin cutoff at 2.91 ng/ml predicted the possibility of a major complication with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 93.3%. POD-5 procalcitonin cutoff at 1.38 ng/ml predicted the possibility of a major complication with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 93.3%. Patients who sustained major complications depicted a change in serum procalcitonin trend 24-48 h ahead of clinical manifestation of an adverse event.
CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin is a good indicator to identify the adverse events in neonates after surgery for esophageal atresia. The procalcitonin levels in patients who sustained a major complication depicted a reversal in trend 24-48 h of clinical manifestation. POD-1 procalcitonin correlated with survival while the baseline and POD-5 serum procalcitonin predicted the clinical course.

AB  - Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) are rare tumors accounting for less than 1% of astrocytomas. They commonly occur in young patients and have relatively favorable prognosis. However, they are well known to have heterogenous morphology and biological behavior with the potential to recur and disseminate throughout the central nervous system, especially their anaplastic counterparts. Recent advances in the molecular characterization have discovered BRAFp.V600E mutations in conjunction with CDKN2A/B deletions and TERTp mutations to be the most frequent alterations in PXAs. These tumors can present a diagnostic challenge as they share overlapping histopathological, genomic as well as methylation profile with various other tumor types, particularly epithelioid glioblastomas (eGBs). This review provides the spectrum of evolution of PXAs from their genesis to recent molecular insights and attempts to review pathogenesis and relationship to other tumors that they mimic especially eGB. It is postulated based on evidence from literature that PXA and eGB are possibly related and not distinct entities, being two ends of a continuous spectrum of malignant progression (grade 2-grade 4) with anaplastic PXA (grade 3) lying in between. Future WHO classifications will have to possibly redefine these tumors using more confirmatory data from larger studies.

AB  - Anoctaminopathies are a group of autosomal recessive skeletal muscle disorders with various clinical phenotypes, caused by anoctamin 5 (ANO5) gene mutations and the abnormal expression of ANO5 protein. Patients with recessive mutations in ANO5 present with variable symptoms ranging from asymptomatic hyperCKemia and exercise-induced myalgia to proximal and/or distal muscle weakness. Here, we describe the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of two unrelated patients with ANO5-related muscular dystrophy (MD). Ninety-six histologically identified MD cases were subjected to next-generation sequencing using a customized panel of 54 genes (IIlumina Design Studio). Two patients were diagnosed with ANO5-related MD. One patient had a pathogenic homozygous mutation of c.1406G>A in exon 14, while the other patient had a novel heterozygous mutation of c.2141C>G in exon 19 of ANO5 gene. Both showed two different phenotypes (limb girdle MD and Miyoshi myopathy) and histomorphological patterns. Muscle biopsy of one patient in addition showed amyloid deposit in the walls of interstitial blood vessels. ANO5-related MD is a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes as well as genotypes. All muscle biopsies with unclassified muscular dystrophies should be subjected to Congo red stain. The results of this study suggest that screening for ANO5 gene should represent an early step in the diagnostic work-up of the patients with undiagnosed MD and persistent asymptomatic hyperCKemia, even when muscle biopsy histomorphology is normal.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In lung cancer patients presenting with malignant pleural effusion (MPE), cytology might represent the only source of tumor tissue for diagnosis and predictive biomarker testing. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in tumor cells is a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy in non-small cell lung carcinomas and is tested using immunohistochemistry. However, knowledge of the validity of PD-L1 testing on MPE samples is limited. We evaluated the feasibility of immunocytochemistry (ICC) for PD-L1 in MPE cell blocks (CBs) and assessed the concordance in expression with patient-matched histologic samples.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: ICC for PD-L1 was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CBs of MPE and patient-matched histologic samples, if available, using the automated Ventana PD-L1 SP263 assay. The tumor proportion score (TPS), based on partial or complete membranous tumor cell staining, was categorized as negative (&lt;1%), low (≥1% to &lt;50%), and high (≥50%). In CBs with any degree of PD-L1 expression, ICC for CD163 highlighting macrophages was performed to exclude nonspecific PD-L1 expression in macrophages. The CB PD-L1 TPS was compared with the TPS obtained from the patient-matched histologic samples.
RESULTS: Of 43 MPE CBs available, 25 were positive for PD-L1 (25 of 42; 59%), and 1 sample was inadequate. Of the 11 patient-matched histologic samples tested, the PD-L1 TPS categories were concordant for 10 of the 11 (91% concordance) cases.
CONCLUSIONS: PD-L1 expression in MPE CBs showed good concordance with expression in histologic samples and is feasible as a source for PD-L1 testing. The concurrent use of CD163 immunostains will aid in the manual assessment of PD-L1 TPS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately, 80% of civilian cranial gunshot injuries in India are mainly due to unlicensed mostly country-made guns, called the "Desi-Kattas," manufactured by the traditional gunsmiths. These injuries constitute a unique subgroup, with respect to the make and design along with the unique wound ballistics compared to the factory-made firearms.
OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at defining the prognostic factors in predicting the outcomes related to cranial gunshot injuries due to these desi-kattas.
METHODS: Ten patients with kata-related cranial gunshot injury underwent surgical intervention at our institution, between 2014 and 2018. Their clinical status, imaging features, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Ten patients with kata-related gunshot injuries to the head were identified. Homicidal injuries were documented in six cases. Five had a GCS of 13-15 at presentation. Exit wounds were noted in 50% of the suicidal cases. Multilobar involvement was seen in 70% of cases, with the bullet crossing the midline in only 40% cases. Decompressive craniectomy was required in five cases. Eight patients had a Glasgow Outcome Score of four or more at 6 months of follow-up. There was one death during the follow-up period, while the other patient remains to be in vegetative state.
CONCLUSION: The Katta-related cranial injuries constitute low-muzzle velocity injuries with the majority of the patients sustaining nonfatal injuries, especially homicidal. The presence of positive CT findings and the crossing of the bullet across the midline on CT brain predicts dismal prognosis. Optimal neurosurgical approach should consist of minimal local debridement and attain water seal dural closure.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the corneal tissue of asymptomatic deceased novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study performed at a tertiary eye hospital. All corneas of the deceased asymptomatic donors who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab at the time of corneal tissue harvesting were included in the study. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed. mRNA in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all specimens that showed positive immunostaining. The main outcome measure was the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the corneal tissues.
RESULTS: Twenty-two corneal tissues of 11 donors were analyzed. The mean age was 72.2 ± 14.2 years. On histological examination, no signs of inflammation or any other abnormalities were detected in the cornea and adjacent bulbar conjunctiva. Immunohistochemistry revealed faint to moderate cytoplasmic staining in the basal layer of the corneal epithelium in 8 specimens from 5 patients. None of the specimens with positive immunostaining showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: In line with previous studies , our study also reflects the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viral mRNA in corneal tissues of clinically asymptomatic deceased COVID-19 donors, thereby indicating a probable low risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the transplantation of corneas from donors who tested positive for, but were asymptomatic for COVID-19. In addition, further studies on the subject should include histopathological examination because of the false positive and negative rates of molecular tests.

AB  - Suprachoroidal hemorrhage (SCH) is a dreaded complication of intraocular surgery. We report a case of a 65-year-old male with left eye primary angle-closure glaucoma and idiopathic elevated episcleral venous pressure with neovascularization of the iris. Due to uncontrolled intraocular pressure even after maximum medical therapy, trabeculectomy with mitomycin C was planned. Preoperative intracameral bevacizumab was given to avoid intraoperative bleeding. Postinjection, localized SCH was noted, which settled spontaneously on conservative management. A combination of ocular and systemic risk factors, such as arteriosclerosis and idiopathic elevated episcleral venous pressure accentuated by intraoperative hypotony during intracameral injection, led to SCH. There are no previous reports of a localized SCH following intracameral bevacizumab.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Amidst the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) is mandatory for healthcare workers to remain protected against infection. The present study was undertaken to evaluate challenges faced by the healthcare workers while using level 3 PPE.
METHODS: This hospital-based study was conducted among resident doctors selected by convenience sampling method using a pretested, semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire after getting informed consent from the participants to collect data on the somatic, psychological, and technical problems faced while working in PPE. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was done between outcome variables and other independent variables to check for the association.
RESULTS: Of the total, 252 resident doctors completed the survey, their age ranged from 22 to 36 years with 140 (55.6%) males and 112 (44.4%) females. One-twenty-nine (51.2%) residents were trained to work in ICU, 73 (29%) participants used PPE ≤10 times and the rest 179 (71%) used PPE more than 10 times. The difficulties faced were as follows: visual impairment (n = 244, 96.8%), headache (n = 226, 89.6%), breathing difficulty (n = 216, 85.7%), hearing impairment (n = 201, 79.8%), sweating (n = 242, 96%), and fear of being infected (n = 156,61.9%). Two-thirty-six (93.6%) participants felt that overall work quality reduced due to PPE. Headache, hunger, urge to micturate, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and need to change the timing of medication or diet were higher with increased duration of work with PPE.
CONCLUSION: A longer duration of work is associated with headache, hunger, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. More research has to be done to improve the PPE to reduce problems like visual impairment, skin irritation, sweating, and breathing difficulty.

AB  - Ocular decompression retinopathy (ODR) is caused by a sudden lowering of high intraocular pressure. Trabeculectomy is the most common procedure preceding ODR. Various mechanical and vascular etiologies have been proposed to cause ODR, with autoregulation and hemodynamics playing a contributing role. Herein, we report a rare case of ODR occurring after bleb needling in a young child using ultrawide-field fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of patients with culture-positive Acremonium keratitis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study. Medical records of all patients treated in a tertiary eye hospital for culture positive infective keratitis from March 2016 to February 2021 were screened, of which those positive for Acremonium species on fungal culture were reviewed. Demographic details, clinical presentation, clinical course, treatment given, total follow-up duration, time taken for ulcer to heal, scar size, and final visual acuity in the last follow-up were recorded.
RESULTS: Fifty three cases of fungal keratitis caused by Acremonium species were identified, 22 females and 31 males, with average age of 46.39±18.64 years. The mean duration of symptoms being 54.47±50 days. Only five patients had a history of trauma with vegetative matter. Clinical presentation of patients showed a large number of variations, with 2 patients presenting as peripheral ulcerative keratitis and 1 with epithelial plaque. The mean visual acuity of patients at presentation was 2.43±0.46 logMAR units. Thirty-three of 53 patients presented with perforated corneal ulcer and underwent penetrating keratoplasty; 20 patients were medically managed on topical voriconazole 1%, natamycin 5%, and oral voriconazole. The mean duration of healing of epithelial defect was 95±60.62 days (range 60-165 days).
CONCLUSION: Acremonium keratitis has a long and indolent course. A prolonged combination therapy of natamycin and voriconazole seems to be effective in the management. A delay in the diagnosis of Acremonium keratitis often leads to clinical worsening requiring keratoplasty.

AU  - Gupta, Pooja
T2  - Current Drug Safety
AB  - BACKGROUND: Serious adverse reactions have been reported with the use of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in a clinical setting despite the success of these products in pre- clinical stages of development.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the quality of available pre-clinical safety data of CAR T-cell therapy products.
METHODS: A 21 items safety checklist was designed specifically for CAR T-cell. Literature was searched using search/MeSH terms in PubMed (October 2019 - February 2020). Studies were screened from title and abstract. Original pre-clinical researches related to CAR T-cell anti-cancer therapy were included.
RESULTS: Of the search results, 152 studies (3 in vivo, 39 in vitro, and 110 combined) were included. Only 7.9% of studies were specifically designed to evaluate/ improve product safety. Eleven studies included target antigen(s), and no study included co-stimulatory molecule(s) expressed exclusively by the tumor tissue and/or CAR T-cells. One study used CRISPR-Cas9 for CAR gene insertion. The use of switch-off mechanism and purity assessment of CAR T-cell products were reported in 13.2% and 8.6% studies, respectively. Of the 113 studies with in vivo components, immuno- competent animal models were used in 24.8%. Measurements of blood pressure, temperature, body weight, and serum cytokines were reported in 0, 2.7, 29.2, and 27.4% studies, respectively. The tissue distribution and CAR T-cells persistence were reported in 26.5% of studies. The surface expression level of CAR, functional characterization of the product, and use of control were reported in >90% of studies.
CONCLUSION: The majority of the checklist parameters were not reported in the pre-clinical publications to be adequately predictive of the safety of CAR T-cells in a clinical setting.

AB  - Distant metastasis from salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SC) is rare, with lung and pleura being the most frequent site. While cytological features of SC on fine needle aspirates are well documented, its morphology in serous effusions has not been described. We describe the cytomorphological features on effusion cytology of two patients with ETV6::NTRK3 fusion-positive SC, who subsequently developed pleural metastases. Cytospin preparations of pleural fluid showed tightly cohesive, irregularly shaped and ball-like clusters of large tumor cells with scant to abundant uni- and multi-vacuolated cytoplasm. Nuclei were eccentrically placed, round to oval, vesicular, with finely granular chromatin, irregular nuclear membranes and conspicuous to prominent nucleoli. With these features, the tumors resembled an adenocarcinoma, indistinguishable from a lung primary. Cell blocks from both cases showed tumor fragments, some of which had the hollow appearance of transversely sectioned cell spheres as seen in lung and breast adenocarcinomas. Immunohistochemistry on cell blocks revealed nuclear pan-TRK positivity in both cases. Case 1 also showed focal mammaglobin staining, and TTF1 negativity. Pleural metastases from SC may mimic other adenocarcinomas. As targeted therapy, that is, selective TRK inhibitors are available for treatment of metastatic disease, NTRK3 fusion status is not only diagnostic, but also required to plan treatment. Pan-TRK immunohistochemistry serves as a viable cost-effective, easy to apply surrogate marker for NTRK3 fusion, particularly in diagnostic laboratories lacking easy access to molecular testing on cytological material.

AB  - Monocytes are known to play a critical role in dengue pathophysiology. However, which monocyte subset expresses what inflammatory mediator(s) and what transcriptional features distinguish each of the monocyte subset in vivo remain poorly understood. In this study we provide a detailed transcriptional analysis of the three human monocyte subsets in healthy children and in children with dengue febrile illness. Notably, we found that the CD14+ CD16high intermediate monocyte subset from dengue patients highly upregulated key genes involved in mediating inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular permeability, tissue extravasation, and clot prevention compared to healthy children. The CD14+CD16low classical monocytes shared some of these features. These two subsets increased massively in patients with severe dengue. By contrast, the CD14-CD16high nonclassical monocyte subset upregulated key genes involved in vasoconstriction, endothelial barrier stability, and are involved in endothelial patrolling while showing a significant decline from circulation. These findings improve our understanding of monocyte responses in dengue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herniation of ovaries and Mullerian structures into inguinal canal is usually reported in infants and is rare among adults. We are presenting a rare case of Mullerian agenesis and Turner mosaic syndrome with tubo-ovarian inguinal hernia.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 17-year-old girl presented with complaints of primary amenorrhea, phenotypical features of Turner syndrome with left inguinal hernia and severe hypertension. Baseline hormonal analysis was normal. Karyotype revealed Turner mosaic with 46XX (85%); 45XO (15%). MRI showed Mullerian agenesis with normally located right ovary in pelvis and left ovary prolapsed through deep inguinal ring into the canal of Nuck. Anti-hypertensives were started and patient optimized for surgery. Laparoscopic hernia repair and repositioning of left ovary into the pelvis was done. Patient had uneventful post-operative course and was discharged in stable condition on anti-hypertensive medication. Future reproductive issues and need of passive vaginal dilatation or vaginoplasty before marriage were explained to the patient and family.
CONCLUSION: This is the first ever reported case with unusual association of atypical MRKH, Turner mosaic syndrome and tubo-ovarian hernia into the inguinal canal. The case emphasizes the need and importance of complete work up of these atypical cases as patients may have more than one cause of primary amenorrhea and complete evaluation is must before any medical or surgical intervention.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is a rare malignancy; however, it is still the most common primary bone tumor in adolescents and young adults. Chemotherapy improves survival indubitably in osteosarcoma; nevertheless, the concern is the stagnant progress since the last several decades. There are a handful of active agents and unresolved issues, especially in choosing the ideal chemotherapy regimen. The oncology community is in equipoise regarding the position of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), mandatory or adjunct. The choice of therapy becomes widely relevant, including in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where HDMTX administration brings additional complexities. Research into novel non-HDMTX-based protocols adapted to the available resources is pivotal in improving disease outcomes, especially in LMIC. The current review focuses on real-world challenges in decision-making and provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of treatment protocols in LMIC.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are subcellular messengers that aid in the formation and spread of cancer by enabling tumor-stroma communication. EVs develop from the very porous structure of late endosomes and hold information on both the intrinsic "status" of the cell and the extracellular signals absorbed by the cells from their surroundings. These EVs contain physiologically useful components, including as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which have been found to activate important signaling pathways in tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, aggravating tumor growth. We highlight critical cell biology mechanisms that link EVS formation to cargo sorting in cancer cells in this review.Sorting out the signals that control EVs creation, cargo, and delivery will aid our understanding of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we reviewed how cancer development and spreading behaviors are affected by coordinated communication between malignant and non-malignant cells. Herein, we studied the reciprocal exchanges via EVs in various cancer types. Further research into the pathophysiological functions of various EVs in tumor growth is likely to lead to the discovery of new biomarkers in liquid biopsy and the development of tumor-specific therapies.

AB  - The journey into the field of stem cell biology has been an endeavor of paramount advancement in biomedicine, establishing new horizons in the avenue of materiobiology. The creative drive of the scientific community focuses on ameliorating the utilization of stem cells, which is currently untapped on a large scale. With similar motivation, we present a nascent strategy of maneuvering biogenic carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to eclipse the toxic hurdles of chemical synthesis of carbon allotropes to serve as a biocompatible trident in stem cell biology employing a three-prong action of stem cell differentiation, imaging, and migration. The derivation of CQDs from garlic peels as a biogenic precursor abets in realizing the optophysical features of CQDs to image mesenchymal stem cells without hampering the biological systems with cytotoxicity. We report the versatility of biogenic CQDs to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to robustly influence stem cell migration and concomitantly chondrocyte differentiation from human Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells (hWJ-MSCs). This was orchestrated without the use of chondrogenic induction factors, which was confirmed from the expression of chondrogenic markers (Col II, Col X, ACAN). Even the collagen content of cells incubated with CQDs was quite comparable with that of chondrocyte-induced cells. Thus, we empirically propose garlic peel-derived CQDs as a tangible advancement in stem cell biology from a materiobiological frame of reference to hone significant development in this arena.

AB  - Nanoconfinement within flexible interfaces is a key step towards exploiting confinement effects in several biological and technological systems wherein flexible 2D materials are frequently utilized but are arduous to prepare. Hitherto unreported, the synthesis of 2D hydrogel nanosheets (HNSs) using a template- and catalyst-free process is developed representing a fertile ground for fundamental structure-property investigations. In due course of time, nucleating folds propagating along the edges trigger co-operative deformations of HNS generating regions of nanoconfinement within trapped water islands. These severely constricting surfaces force water molecules to pack within the nanoscale regime of HNS almost parallel to the surface bringing about phase transition into puckered rhombic ice with AA and AB Bernal stacking pattern, which was mostly restricted to molecular dynamics studies so far. Interestingly, under high lateral pressure and spatial inhomogeneity within nanoscale confinement, bilayer rhombic ice structures were formed with an in-plane lattice spacing of 0.31 nm. In this work, a systematic exploration of rhombic ice formation within HNS has been delineated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and its ultrathin morphology was examined using atomic force microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed high porosity while mechanical testing presented young's modulus of 155 kPa with ∼84% deformation, whereas contact angle suggested high hydrophilicity. The combinations of nanosheets, porosity, nanoconfinement, hydrophilicity, and mechanical strength, motivated us to explore their application as a scaffold for cartilage regeneration, by inducing chondrogenesis of human Wharton Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells. HNS promoted the formation of cell aggregates giving higher number of spheroid formation and a marked expression of chondrogenic markers (ColI, ColII, ColX, ACAN and S-100), thereby providing some cues for guiding chondrogenic differentiation.

AB  - Coeliac disease is a systemic disorder characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, which is caused by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical presentation of coeliac disease is highly variable and ranges from malabsorption through solely extra-intestinal manifestations to asymptomatic. As a result, the majority of patients with coeliac disease remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or experience a substantial delay in diagnosis. Coeliac disease is diagnosed by a combination of serological findings of disease-related antibodies and histological evidence of villous abnormalities in duodenal biopsy samples. However, variability in histological grading and in the diagnostic performance of some commercially available serological tests remains unacceptably high and confirmatory assays are not readily available in many parts of the world. Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong, strict, gluten-free diet. However, many barriers impede patients' adherence to this diet, including lack of widespread availability, high cost, cross-contamination and its overall restrictive nature. Routine follow-up is necessary to ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet but considerable variation is evident in follow-up protocols and the optimal disease management strategy is not clear. However, these challenges in the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease suggest opportunities for future research.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) could well be regarded as a sentinel complication given it is relatively common and associated with a substantial risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. On the aegis of 'prevention is better than cure', there has been a wide interest in evaluating haemodynamic predisposition to AKI so as to provide a favourable renoprotective haemodynamic milieu to the subset of patients presenting a significant risk of developing AKI. In this context, the last decade has witnessed a series of evaluation of the hypotension value and duration cut-offs associated with risk of AKI across diverse non-operative and operative settings. Nevertheless, a holistic comprehension of the haemodynamic predisposition to AKI has been a laggard with only few reports highlighting the potential of elevated central venous pressure, intra-abdominal hypertension and high mean airway pressures in considerably attenuating the effective renal perfusion, particularly in scenarios where kidneys are highly sensitive to any untoward elevation in the afterload. Despite the inherent autoregulatory mechanisms, the effective renal perfusion pressure (RPP) can be modulated by a number of haemodynamic factors in addition to mean arterial pressure (MAP) as the escalation of renal interstitial pressure, in particular hampers kidney perfusion which in itself is a dynamic interplay of a number of innate pressures. The present article aims to review the subject of haemodynamic predisposition to AKI centralising the focus on effective RPP (over and above the conventional 'tunnel-vision' for MAP) and discuss the relevant literature accumulating in this area of ever-growing clinical interest.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge (VD) in women of reproductive age group. It is marked by displacement of beneficial Lactobacillus sp. by polymicrobial flora. BV is becoming a major public health concern as it is associated with adverse birth outcomes and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Diagnosis of BV is currently done using clinical criteria (Amsel's) and the microbiological criteria (Nugent's scoring), the latter being the gold standard. Many out patient settings lack in microscopy facility and also skilled microbiologists, so reliance is placed on findings of clinical examination.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to correlate Amsel's criteria with low (7-8) versus high (9-10) positive Nugent's scores for better understanding on utility of clinical criteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with self-reported symptoms of vaginal discharge, genital itching were included and their pelvic examination was performed. Two swab samples were collected from lateral wall of vagina and posterior fornix and tested for BV infection using both Amsel's criteria and Nugent's score.
RESULTS: Of the total 125 women, 29 (23.2%) were positive for BV by Amsel's criteria, whereas 34 (27.2%) were positive by Nugent's scoring. Amsel's criteria showed a sensitivity of 100% with high Nugent's scores and 81% with low scores, thereby implying very few cases of diseased individuals being missed.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the continued utility of the Clinical criteria in outpatient setting as a screening test.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To implement an advanced spatial penalty-based reconstruction to constrain the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) model and investigate whether it provides a suitable alternative at 1.5 T to the traditional IVIM-DKI model at 3 T for clinical characterization of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with biopsy-proven PCa were recruited for MRI examination (n = 16 scanned at 1.5 T, n = 16 scanned at 3 T). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 13 b values (b = 0 to 2000 s/mm2 up to 3 averages, 1.5 T: TR = 5.774 s, TE = 81 ms and 3 T: TR = 4.899 s, TE = 100 ms), T2-weighted, and T1-weighted imaging were used on the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanner, respectively. The IVIM-DKI signal was modeled using the traditional IVIM-DKI model and a novel model in which the total variation (TV) penalty function was combined with the traditional model to optimize non-physiological variations. Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare intra-scanner and scanner group differences in IVIM-DKI parameters obtained using the novel and the traditional models. Analysis of variance with post hoc test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to assess the ability of parameters obtained using the novel model (at 1.5 T) and the traditional model (at 3 T) to characterize prostate lesions.
RESULTS: IVIM-DKI modeled using novel model with TV spatial penalty function at 1.5 T, produced parameter maps with 50-78% lower coefficient of variation (CV) than traditional model at 3 T. Novel model estimated higher D with lower D*, f and k values at both field strengths compared to traditional model. For scanner differences, the novel model at 1.5 T estimated lower D* and f values as compared to traditional model at 3 T. At 1.5 T, D and f values were significantly lower with k values significantly higher in tumor than BPH and healthy tissue. D (AUC: 0.98), f (AUC: 0.82), and k (AUC: 0.91) parameters estimated using novel model showed high diagnostic performance in cancer lesion detection at 1.5 T.
DISCUSSION: In comparison with the IVIM-DKI model at 3 T, IVIM-DKI signal modeled with the TV penalty function at 1.5 T showed lower estimation errors. The proposed novel model can be utilized for improved detection of prostate lesions.

AB  - Non-invasive characterization of pancreatic masses aids in the management of pancreatic lesions. Intravoxel incoherent motion-diffusion kurtosis imaging (IVIM-DKI) and machine learning-based texture analysis was used to differentiate pancreatic masses such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (pNET), solid pseudopapillary epithelial neoplasm (SPEN), and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (MFCP). A total of forty-eight biopsy-proven patients with pancreatic masses were recruited and classified into pNET (n = 13), MFCP (n = 6), SPEN (n = 4), and PDAC (n = 25) groups. All patients were scanned for IVIM-DKI sequences acquired with 14 b-values (0 to 2500 s/mm2) on a 1.5T MRI. An IVIM-DKI model with a 3D total variation (TV) penalty function was implemented to estimate the precise IVIM-DKI parametric maps. Texture analysis (TA) of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and IVIM-DKI parametric map was performed and reduced using the chi-square test. These features were fed to an artificial neural network (ANN) for characterization of pancreatic mass subtypes and validated by 5-fold cross-validation. Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to compute the area under curve (AUC). Perfusion fraction (f) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in pNET than PDAC. The f showed better diagnostic performance for PDAC vs. MFCP with AUC:0.77. Both pseudo-diffusion coefficient (D*) and f for PDAC vs. pNET showed an AUC of 0.73. ADC and diffusion coefficient (D) showed good diagnostic performance for pNET vs. MFCP with AUC: 0.79 and 0.76, respectively. In the TA of PDAC vs. non-PDAC, f and combined IVIM-DKI parameters showed high accuracy ≥ 84.3% and AUC ≥ 0.84. Mean f and combined IVIM-DKI parameters estimated that the IVIM-DKI model with TV texture features has the potential to be helpful in characterizing pancreatic masses.

AB  - Weight retention and weight gain during the postpartum and midlife period subsequently increase the risk of chronic health conditions, thereby deteriorating the overall health. Dietary intervention is the pivotal component of sustainable weight management. However, in resource restricted settings, where dietitians may not be present, other healthcare professionals such as physicians, obstetricians, and paediatricians should play a vital role in providing timely weight management advice to these women. Therefore, this article provides dietary advice including the setting of realistic weight loss goals, identifying an individual's calorie needs, distribution of macronutrients and consideration of important micronutrients. Healthcare professionals can follow the stepwise approach to prescribe dietary advice to postpartum and midlife women for their weight management. Various dietary principles such as cultural and regional preferences of an individual, portion size, hypocaloric diets, nutrient-dense meals, eating habits, cultural beliefs and myths along with co-morbid conditions should be taken into consideration by healthcare professionals while providing the dietary prescription.

AB  - The mutant p53Y220C (mutp53Y220C) is frequently observed in numerous tumors, including pancreatic cancer. The mutation creates a crevice in the DNA binding core domain and makes p53 a thermally unstable non-functional protein that assists tumor progression and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoring mutp53 function to its wild type by selectively targeting this crevice with small molecules is a pivotal strategy to promote apoptosis. In this study, we have shown through different biophysical and cell-based studies that curcumin binds and rescues mutp53Y220C to an active wild-type conformation and restores its apoptotic transcription function in BxPC-3-pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the curcumin-rescued-p53Y220C (CRp53) showed significant hyperphosphorylation at Ser15, Ser20, and acetylation at Lys382 with an 8-fold increase in transcription activity in the BxPC-3 cell lines. We also observed that the active CRp53 escapes Mdm2-mediated proteasomal degradation and the majority of the proteins were localized inside the nucleus with an increased half-life and transcription restoration compared to untreated BxPC-3 cells. By label-free proteomics analysis, we observed that upon curcumin treatment almost 227 proteins were dysregulated with the majority of them being transcriptional targets of p53. Based on our studies, it reflects that apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by curcumin-rescued mutant p53Y220C.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the knowledge, attitude, and intentions towards fertility preservation (FP) in cancer patients among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Northern India.
METHODS: The survey discussed in this study was a 23-item structured questionnaire on oncofertility designed based on previous studies on the topic. A link to the questionnaire was sent through WhatsApp to healthcare workers involved in the care of cancer patients. Their responses were analyzed subsequently.
RESULTS: More than a third (37.7%) of the 750 HCWs contacted answered the questionnaire. The group included gynecologists, surgeons, and oncologists. Although 90% of the respondents were aware of the harmful effects of cancer therapy on ovarian function, 76% claimed they had only partial knowledge about fertility preservation (FP). Only a fourth of the respondents were aware of the time needed for oocyte cryopreservation and a third had knowledge of the number of semen samples required for FP. Among HCWs involved in the care of young cancer patients, only 50% reported that they had referred patients for FP. The most common reason for not referring patients for FP was lack of knowledge about FP (43%). More than 90% claimed they wanted to improve their knowledge about oncofertility through continued medical education programs and seminars.
CONCLUSIONS: The study emphasizes the need for establishing well-structured networks to improve knowledge about FP among HCWs, so that cancer patients are offered the chance of using their gametes to have children after they have been cured from cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young age in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) demands bone-preserving, short-stem arthroplasty. Several designs including neck-preserving stems and neck-resecting, shortened, standard stems are classified as short stems. There is a paucity of literature investigating risk factors and outcomes of intraoperative complications of neck preserving, short-stem arthroplasty in ONFH.
METHODS: A total of 107 hips operated with METHA short-stem arthroplasty for ONFH were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age of patients was 43.7 years (range, 27-60 years). Nine patients had an intraoperative fracture. Seven hips received prophylactic cerclage wiring for poor bone quality. Patients were invited for clinical and radiological evaluation at the latest follow-up.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up of patients was 47.2 months. Significant association with intraoperative fractures and the need for prophylactic cerclage wiring were found in steroids-, alcohol-, and chronic renal failure-induced ONFH. However, patient sex, body mass index, traumatic/idiopathic ONFH, previous implant in situ, prosthesis size, and single-sitting bilateral total hip replacement (THA) were not the risk factors. All hips showed signs of osteointegration at final follow-up. No revision was done during the study period for any cause.
CONCLUSIONS: METHA short-stem THA offers excellent functional and radiological outcomes in ONFH. However, precaution must be exercised in patients with steroids-, alcohol-, and renal disorders-induced ONFN due to poor bone quality and higher chances of intraoperative fractures. Also, additional measures such as the use of a high-speed burr and prophylactic cerclage wiring in ONFH may allow predictable and safe use of short stems.

TI  - The Trend and Prediction of Cervical Cancer Incidence in Delhi, India: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis
AU  - Malhotra, Rajeev Kumar
AU  - Manoharan, N.
AU  - Deo, Sv Suryanarayana
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention: APJCP
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to assess the trend of age-standardised incidence rate (ASIRs) of cervical cancer, standardised median age at diagnosis, and projection of cervical cancer incidence rate and the number of new cases up to 2030. The projections help in making strategies for resource allocation to circumvent the future burden.
METHODS: The data were extracted from the Delhi population-based cancer registry from 1990 to 2014. Joinpoint regression analysis was applied to ASIRs to assess the trend. The natural cubic splines age-period-cohort (APC) model was fitted to project the incidence rate and incidence cases. The trend of standardised median age at diagnosis and percentage of cervical cancer to total women cancer was also assessed using regression analysis. Projections of new cases are decomposed into three components aging, the structure of the population, and age-specific incidence rate.
RESULTS: The age-standardised incidence rate of cervical cancer decreased with an annual decline at a rate of 2.98% (95% CI -3.48 to -2.47) from 1990 to 2014. The standardised median age at diagnosis showed an upward trend with an average annual increase of 0.167 per year and the median age increased by 4.18 years during 25-years period, this change was due to the shifting of the peak from 40-44 in 1990 to 60-64 in 2014. The APC model revealed ASIRs would decline by 43.8% in 2030 compared to average ASIRs 2010-2014, albeit a net 12% increase in the incidence cases. An increase in incidence cases is primarily attributed to the aging of the population and population  growth by 38.87% and 33.84% respectively.  The trend analysis of  cervical cancer ASIRs in pre (< 50 years) and post menopause (≥ 50 years) showed a decreasing trend. However, the ratio of cervical to total women increased over time from 1:1 in 1990 to 2:3 in 2014.
CONCLUSION: The declining trend in ASIRs was observed in Delhi and will continue to decrease up to 2030.  The burden of the number of new cases of cervical cancer showed an upward trend primarily due to the aging of the population and shifting of population structure. To counter this big challenge a cost-effective vaccination for vulnerable populations, community-based screening programs, and awareness about cervical cancer prevention might help in eliminating this preventable cancer.

AB  - Extensive research over past few decades has highlighted the challenges of chemotherapy and prompted the need for multimodality therapy because chemotherapy alone cannot fully eradicate the tumor due to physiological barriers in its effective delivery and systemic side effects. It can be mitigated by adopting nanoparticles as more effective delivery method, but none of them completely prevents drug toxicities. Utilizing multiple therapeutic modes such as phototherapy that can act synergistically with chemotherapy in controlling tumor growth, while reducing the overall dosage, could become a preferred route for cancer management. Careful selection of nanoparticle system, which can simultaneously deliver both drug and photosensitizer, can significantly enhance the therapeutic outcome. Therefore, in this paper, we report development and potential of immune-compatible and long circulating nanoerythrosomes for enhancing the therapeutic potential of camptothecin and indocyanine green against murine cancer model. The RBCs membrane simultaneously loaded the nonpolar drug and amphiphilic photosensitizer in its lipid bilayer, which self-assembled to form stable nanoparticles. These nano constructs absorbed light in the near-infrared region and hence are suitable for targeting deep seated tissues. The dual chemo-phototherapy had great effect on cell viability and had therapeutic value.

TI  - Selection of DNA Aptamers Against Neisseria gonorrhoeae Causing Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI)
AU  - Malhotra, Shilpi

T2  - Molecular Biotechnology
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Gonorrhoea is a very serious infection because if untreated, it can lead to significant ramifications to reproductive, maternal, & newborn health and increase transmission of HIV. Infections are very often asymptomatic and symptoms when present manifest differently in men and women. The cornerstone of gonorrhoea control is to assure rapid diagnosis and prompt treatment of patients to prevent the onward spread of infection. The resource-rich settings are utilizing nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for diagnosis, whereas resource-limited settings like ours where laboratory infrastructure is lacking, reliance is placed on syndromic approach. In view of the limitations of each, there is a compelling need for development of a point of care test (POCT). Aptamers offer such potential. These are short oligonucleotides that bind to its target with high affinity and specificity and therefore can be maneuvred for use in diagnostics. In this study, we performed live cell-SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) to select 12 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) aptamers that bind strongly to a cocktail of Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, with Kd values ranging from 8.58 to 596 nM. Gold nanoparticle (GNP) assay revealed that one of the aptamers, E8 19 was highly specific for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Kd = 24.5 nM). More importantly, it did not demonstrate any binding to Neisseria meningitidis and commensal Neisseria sp. The identified aptamer holds much promise for the development of a rapid test for diagnosis of gonorrhoea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Surge of SARS CoV-2 infections ascribed to omicron variant began in December 2021 in New Delhi. We determined the infection and reinfection density in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) along with vaccine effectiveness (VE) against symptomatic infection within omicron transmission period (considered from December 01, 2021 to February 25, 2022.
METHODS: This is an observational study from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Data were collected telephonically. Person-time at risk was counted from November 30, 2021 till date of infection/ reinfection, or date of interview. Comparison of clinical features and severity was done with previous pandemic periods. VE was estimated using test-negative case-control design [matched pairs (for age and sex)]. Vaccination status was compared and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were computed by conditional logistic regression. VE was estimated as (1-adjusted OR)X100-.
FINDINGS: 11474 HCWs participated in this study. The mean age was 36⋅2 (±10⋅7) years. Complete vaccination with two doses were reported by 9522 (83%) HCWs [8394 (88%) Covaxin and 1072 Covishield (11%)]. The incidence density of all infections and reinfection during the omicron transmission period was 34⋅8 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 33⋅5-36⋅2] and 45⋅6 [95% CI: 42⋅9-48⋅5] per 10000 person days respectively. The infection was milder as compared to previous periods. VE was 52⋅5% (95% CI: 3⋅9-76⋅5, p = 0⋅036) for those who were tested within 14-60 days of receiving second dose and beyond this period (61-180 days), modest effect was observed.
INTERPRETATION: Almost one-fifth of HCWs were infected with SARS CoV-2 during omicron transmission period, with predominant mild spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Waning effects of vaccine protection were noted with increase in time intervals since vaccination.
FUNDING: None.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes has serious health effects during pregnancy and childbirth. We estimated the occurrence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among pregnant women in a secondary care hospital in Haryana.
METHODS: It was a hospital-based cross-sectional study, done in an ante-natal clinic (ANC) at a sub-district hospital (SDH), Faridabad district of Haryana, India. Eligible pregnant women attending the ANC clinic were recruited. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with 75 g of glucose was done with a collection of blood for fasting blood sugar (FBS) and two-hour post-OGTT blood glucose. A pre-tested semi-structured interview schedule was administered. Both the modified International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria (IADPSGC) and the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group of India (DIPSI) criteria were used. Data were presented as percentages, means, standard deviation, and 95% confidence interval (CI). Bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regressions were done. The level of significance was set at 0.05.
RESULTS: Of the 623 eligible participants, 66.1% were within the 20-25 age group. The GDM was found in 14.1% (95%CI: 11.5-17.1) participants as per modified IADPSG criteria and 6.7% (95%CI: 4.9-9.0) participants as per DIPSI criteria, respectively. Increasing age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.24 (95% CI: 1.05-1.47), p=0.008] and increasing years of schooling [AOR: 1.19 (1.01-1.41), p=0.032] were significantly associated with GDM by DIPSI criteria. Family history of DM was also found to have an increased odds with GDM using modified IADPSG criteria [AOR 2.87 (95% CI: 1.09-7.54), p=0.032].  Conclusion: Considerable proportion of pregnant women were found to have GDM in a Sub-district hospital at Ballabgarh in north India. The study highlighted the need and generated evidence about the feasibility of GDM screening utilizing routine staff in a secondary care facility.

AB  - Screen-based media usage among young people is blooming rapidly due to technological and digital revolution. We conducted community-based cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of excess screen time and its association with sociodemographic and behavioral patterns in a rural block of Haryana, India. A semi-structured interview schedule was administered by trained physicians to ascertain screen time in a typical day and various socioeconomic and behavioral factors among a random sample of 860 young men aged 18-24 years. The prevalence of excess screen time was 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.4-65.1). It was significantly associated with education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6) and occupation (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) of the father and their sleep duration of ≤8 h (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3). Limiting the screen time as per international standards and behavioral interventions are needed for this young population.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: A surge of COVID-19 occurred from March to June 2021, in New Delhi, India, linked to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers (HCWs) starting in January 2021.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India.
EXPOSURES: Vaccination with 0, 1, or 2 doses of BBV152.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated (with 2 doses and ≥15 days after the second dose), partially vaccinated (with 1 dose or 2 doses with <15 days after the second dose), or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed, and events from March 3, 2020, to June 18, 2021, were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (1 - adjusted HR) was reported.
RESULTS: Among 15 244 HCWs who participated in the study, 4978 (32.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 36.6 (10.3) years, and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26 (95% CI: 6.09-8.66) per 100 person-years (124 HCWs [2.5%], total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk). Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]), symptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.24]), and asymptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.53]) compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly, among the 3 vaccine categories, reinfection was observed in 60 of 472 (12.7%) of unvaccinated (incidence density, 18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 14.02-23.25), 39 of 356 (11.0%) of partially vaccinated (incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 11.42-21.38), and 17 of 1089 (1.6%) fully vaccinated (incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.35-3.51) HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86% (95% CI, 77%-92%); symptomatic reinfection, 87% (95% CI, 76%-93%); and asymptomatic reinfection, 84% (95% CI, 47%-95%) among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule, when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Presbyopia is a major cause for near visual impairment among adults. Presbyopia induced visual impairment can be corrected easily by spectacles. We aimed to study the prevalence of presbyopia among adults aged ≥35 years and spectacles coverage among them. We also studied the unmet need for presbyopia along with the barriers to uptake of services.
METHODS: This is a population-based cross-sectional study conducted among adults aged ≥35 years in a rural district of Haryana. Near vision assessment and semistructured interview schedule were administered by a team of trained ophthalmic assistant, social worker and health assistant.
RESULTS: A total of 3832 adults aged ≥35 years were enumerated, from which 3246 (84.7%) were examined. Prevalence of presbyopia was found to be 42.9% (95% confidence interval 41.2-44.6). Participants with increasing age, literacy and women had higher prevalence, and those that were employed and belonged to below poverty line economic status had lower prevalence of presbyopia. Spectacles coverage among presbyopes was found to be 25.8%. There was an inverse association between unmet need for presbyopia and women, increasing education status and office work. Lack of felt need and personal reasons were the most common barriers for unmet need due to presbyopia.
CONCLUSIONS: There is high prevalence of presbyopia among adult population, with spectacles coverage being low. Awareness activities along with affordable, accessible and socially acceptable services for those affected with presbyopia would be one of the key components of management.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Different variant of GBM has been reported viz. Epithelioid Glioblastoma (GBM-E), Rhabdoid GBM (GBM-R), Small cell GBM (GBM-SC), Giant cell GBM (GBM-GC), GBM with neuro ectodermal differentiation (GBM-PNET) with unknown behavior.
MATERIALS: We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data analysis of these rare GBM variants. We searched PubMed, google search, and Cochrane library for eligible studies till July 1st 2016 published in English language and collected data regarding age, sex, subtype and treatment received, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS). Statistical Package for social sciences (SPSS) v16 software was used for all statistical analysis.
RESULTS: We retrieved data of 196 patients with rare GBM subtypes. Among these GBM-GC is commonest (51%), followed by GBM-R (19%), GBM-PNET (13%), GBM-SC (9%) and GBM-E (8%). Median age at diagnosis was 38, 40, 43.5, 69.5 and 18 years, respectively. Male: female ratio was 2:1 for GBM-E, and 1:3 for GBM-SC. Maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant local radiation was used for most of the patients. However, 6 patients with GBM-PNET, 3 each of GBM-E, GBM-SC received adjuvant craniospinal radiation. Out of 88 patients who received chemotherapy, 64 received Temozolomide alone or combination chemotherapy containing Temozolomide. Median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 9 and 16 months. In univariate analysis, patient with a Gross Total Resection had significantly better PFS and OS compared to those with a Sub Total Resection [23 vs. 13 months (p-0.01)]. Median OS for GBM PNET, GBM-GC, GBM-SC, GBM-R and GBM-E were 32, 18.3, 11, 12 and 7.7 months, respectively (P = 0.001). Interestingly, 31.3%, 37.8% of patients with GBM-E, GBM-R had CSF dissemination.
CONCLUSION: Overall cohort of rarer GBM variant has equivalent survival compared to GBM not otherwise specified. However, epithelioid and Rhabdoid GBM has worst survival and one third shows CSF dissemination.

AB  - Monkeypox is a contagious disease that manifests as a smallpox-like skin rash. The disease has shown a sudden surge worldwide across several countries. These patients may present for emergency surgery. Anesthetic management of these cases in an emergency setting is challenging. There is not much literature on the anesthetic management of monkeypox patients. We aimed to discuss the anesthetic management of monkeypox in this review.

AB  - Background The analgesic efficacy of preemptive administration of caudal morphine for spine surgeries in adults is not well studied. In a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, safety and analgesic efficacy of preemptive, single-shot caudal morphine and bupivacaine was compared with caudal bupivacaine alone in lumbosacral spine surgeries. Methods After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, 40 patients aged 18-60 yrs planned for lumbosacral spine surgery were randomized to groups of 20 patients each. After induction and prone positioning, an ultrasound-guided caudal block was performed with morphine 50 µg/kg with 20 ml 0.25% bupivacaine in the study group (LM) and only bupivacaine in the control group (LA). Postoperatively, both groups received intravenous morphine via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump (No basal, 1 mg/bolus, 10 minutes lockout interval). Intraoperative fentanyl use, postoperative 24-h morphine consumption, visual analogue pain scores (VAS) and adverse effects of morphine were noted. Results Demographics and baseline data were comparable. Postoperative 24-hour morphine requirement was more in LA group (34.3 ± 10.7 mg vs 19.65 ± 11.8 mg, p=0.0001). Total intraoperative supplemental fentanyl requirement was similar (79.25 ± 67.60 µg in LA vs 54 ± 50.20 µg in LM group, p=0.28). VAS scores at 2/4/6/12-hour in group-LM were significantly less than group-LA (p=0.005, 0.002, 0.001 and 0.047) but were comparable at 18 and 24 hours (p=0.25, 0.42). Postoperative incidence of adverse effects of morphine was comparable. Conclusions Ultrasound-guided, single-shot preemptive administration of caudal morphine with bupivacaine is a safe and effective modality of analgesia for patients undergoing lumbosacral spine surgeries.

AB  - Oxidative stress has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and it is potentially driven by the depletion of primary antioxidant, glutathione, as well as elevation of the pro-oxidant, iron. Present study evaluates glutathione level by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, iron deposition by quantitative susceptibility mapping in left hippocampus, as well as the neuropsychological scores of healthy old participants (N = 25), mild cognitive impairment (N = 16) and Alzheimer's disease patients (N = 31). Glutathione was found to be significantly depleted in mild cognitive impaired (P < 0.05) and Alzheimer's disease patients (P < 0.001) as compared with healthy old participants. A significant higher level of iron was observed in left hippocampus region for Alzheimer's disease patients as compared with healthy old (P < 0.05) and mild cognitive impairment (P < 0.05). Multivariate receiver-operating curve analysis for combined glutathione and iron in left hippocampus region provided diagnostic accuracy of 82.1%, with 81.8% sensitivity and 82.4% specificity for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease patients from healthy old participants. We conclude that tandem glutathione and iron provides novel avenue to investigate further research in Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - A young man in his first decade of life presented with insidious onset, gradually progressive diminution of vision in right eye since 2 months associated with foreign body sensation. Slit-lamp examination revealed superior arcuate band of corneal stromal thinning extending from 9-3 o' clock. There was associated corneal vascularisation and presence of lipid deposition at the leading edge of the furrow formation with intact epithelium without any apparent signs of inflammation. There was no previous history of ocular or systemic disease, trauma, ocular surgery, collagen vascular disease or contact lens wear. Serological tests for rheumatic diseases did not show any abnormalities. Scheimpflug imaging showed high against the rule astigmatism with a 'reverse crab claw' pattern. A provisional diagnosis of right eye Terrien's marginal corneal degeneration was made. On a 1-month follow-up visit, there was significant symptomatic relief with lubricants alone and with spectacles the visual acuity improved to 20/60 in the right eye.

AB  - The vascular subtype of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by spontaneous arterial, bowel or organ rupture. The diagnosis of vEDS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the alpha-1 gene of type III collagen (COL3A1) by molecular analysis. In this report, we present a case of vEDS with life threatening, spontaneous arterial dissections in association with an uncharacterized rare variant of COL3A1, exon19:c.1340G > A. Primary culture of patient skin fibroblasts followed by immunofluorescence revealed a complete absence of COL3A1 protein expression as well as altered morphology. Electron microscopy of the cultured fibroblasts showed abnormal vacuoles in the cytoplasm suggestive of a secretory defect. In this study, we have performed functional characterization of the COL3A1 exon19:c.1340G > A variant for the first time and this may now be classified as likely pathogenic in vEDS. *Both JM and LRL contributed equally in the manuscript and should both be considered as the first author.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to estimate centiles by using improved statistical smoothing procedure, the Box-Cox power-exponential (BCPE) method, in urban northern Indian adolescents aged 11-17 years.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected cross-sectionally by measuring specific anthropometric features such as height, weight, and mid-upper arm circumference in school-based adolescents aged 11-17 years including both boys (n = 838) and girls (n = 788) enrolled in government educational institutions in urban Delhi. We used a state-of-the-art statistical methodology (BCPE method) to establish centile curves.
RESULTS: The model fitted before smoothing revealed that weight, height, and BMI did not follow a normal distribution; both skewness and kurtosis were observed in all three variables. After correcting both skewness and kurtosis, estimated empirical percentile values showed a gradual increase in weight, height, and BMI in both boys and girls. Girls had higher weight and height than boys in initial ages and observed a steep increase in boys in both weight and height in later ages. BMI was higher in girls than boys and visibly higher during 14-16 years of age. The 50th percentile value of BMI was smaller in all the ages in our study than that in other studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoothened percentile values derived for BMI by using the state-of-the-art statistical methodology may help policymakers to promote better growth in urban adolescents.

AB  - Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a very rare head-neck malignancy. Because the symptoms of parathyroid carcinoma are similar to those of benign causes of hyperparathyroidism, it may be not easy to detect it before surgery. The management of PC after initial surgery will be perplexing because of the adequacy of surgery. We wish to describe the difficulties encountered throughout treatment using a literature review. We conducted a retrospective analysis of individuals with parathyroid carcinoma who had treatment at our department between 2017 and 2022. We gathered data on the clinical profile, investigations, management of hypercalcemia, surgical techniques, histopathological features, adjuvant therapy, and outcomes. We treated three patients with parathyroid carcinoma: Two patients with inferior parathyroid carcinoma and one with superior parathyroid carcinoma. Generalized weakness and bony pain are the predominant symptoms. In all cases, the tumor was located using 99Tc MIBI / SPECT scintigraphy and Ultrasonography. Hemithyroidectomy and tumor excision were done as the surgery of choice. All are disease-free at the 12th-month follow-up. We suggested that parathyroid hormone testing be performed in all bony fibrous lesions to rule out hyperparathyroidism. PC is a likely diagnosis when there is noticeable throat swelling, elevated PTH levels greater than 400 IU/L, and serum calcium levels greater than 15 mg/dL.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory markers have been found to be of value in predicting the prognosis in renal cell and gastrointestinal cancers. Recent studies in gliomas correlating with Systemic inflammatory markers (SIMS) have shown promise in predicting survival.
OBJECTIVE: Meningiomas are the commonest intracranial primary brain tumors in adults. There is a need to distinguish low and high grade meningiomas preoperatively as they have crucial implications for the radicality of surgical excision and prognostication.
METHODS: A retrospective search was conducted, and the newly diagnosed meningioma cases were studied. The preoperative hematological parameters of the patients and pathological tumor grades were noted. The grade 1 meningioma was defined as low-grade meningioma while grade 2 and 3 meningiomas were defined as high-grade meningioma. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between the hematological parameters and tumor grade.
RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty meningioma cases with a mean age of 43.5 years were included. The ANC, NLR, and dNLR were found to be significantly elevated in high-grade meningioma (P = 0.03). Other inflammatory parameters including TLC failed to show a statistically significant difference when compared between the grades of meningioma. ROC analysis further showed limited value of these markers in predicting meningioma grade. However, an elevated ANC (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.14), male sex (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.13-2.58), and tumor origin from sites other than the skull base or thecal sac (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.93-6.12) were predictive of high-grade meningioma in regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: Preoperative hematological inflammatory parameters have limited value in predicting the grade of tumor in meningiomas. An elevated preoperative ANC, NLR, and dNLR were found to be more frequently associated with high grade of meningiomas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family physicians (FPs) encounter numerous patients who need eye care services. For providing eye care services at the primary level, they need to be abreast with the common disorders, their management and appropriate referral.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the socio-demographic and ocular morbidity profile of the beneficiaries, seasonal pattern of few ocular disorders and to find the proportion of blindness that is avoidable at the primary level.
METHODOLOGY: Study was conducted in 25 vision centers across Delhi. Chart review was done in each center and retrospective data of previous 4 years was analyzed. Socio-demographic, ocular morbidity profile and trend of selected diseases was deducted and causes of blindness were determined.
RESULTS: Around 62.76% of patients were women and 78.26% were new patients. A seasonal peak of conjunctivitis was observed during the spring season. The common conditions detected by optometrists were refractive errors (34.68%), presbyopia (14.15%), cataract (14.02%), conjunctivitis (9.84%) and diseases of ocular adnexa (1.35%). In the age group ≥50 years, the proportion of patients who were blind was 2.5%, 39.0% had VI. The proportion of VI patients in all the categories was higher in women as compared to men. In patients ages ≥50 years, 81.4% of the blindness was avoidable.
CONCLUSIONS: Women outnumbered men in availing services at the center and the proportion of visual impairment was also higher in them. The major causes of blindness in the older population were cataract and corneal-opacity, and it is avoidable by strengthening primary eye care services by FPs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With the advent of endovascular technique and the emergence of vascular surgery as a separate branch distinct from general surgery, there is a decrease in exposure of open vascular technique to general surgery resident. Vascular access surgery is a vascular subspecialty area and not all residents get similar exposure during training, and this has implications if one becomes a vascular consultant in the future and have to undertake access surgery. There is no established protocol or duration, following which a surgical resident can be named as "trained" in vascular anastomosis. Our study tries to address the aforementioned problems; in particular the actual training that a general surgery resident needs in vascular access.
OBJECTIVE: To study and compare the outcomes of AV Fistula surgeries, created by "trained" general surgical residents and consultant.
METHOD: A single-institution retrospective cohort study comparing two groups of cohorts: trained residents (group A) and consultant (group B). Study has been done in accordance with the standards of ICMJE and registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India. (CTRI/2021/12/038581).
RESULT: Out of 238 patients recruited, 157 underwent surgery in group 'A' (the trained residents performing arteriovenous fistula surgery) and 81 underwent surgery in group 'B' (by consultant of general surgery). Clinical maturation noted after 8 weeks was 83.4% (131/157) in group A and 90.1% (73/81) in group 'B'; (p = 0.113). The mean duration of surgery in group 'A' was 99.8 ± 18.2 min and group 'B' was 56.2 ± 10.4 min; (p value < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: A structured training in vascular anastomosis provided to the newly recruited residents in general surgery for 6 months lead to outcomes that were comparable with the consultants.

AB  - Radiopharmaceuticals based on the highly potent FAP inhibitor (FAPi) UAMC-1110 have shown great potential in molecular imaging, but the short tumor retention time of the monomers do not match the physical half-lives of the important therapeutic radionuclides 177Lu and 225Ac. This was improved with the dimer DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2, but pharmacological and radiolabeling properties still need optimization. Therefore, the novel FAPi homodimers DO3A.Glu.(FAPi)2 and DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2. were synthesized and quantitatively radiolabeled with 68Ga, 90Y, 177Lu and 225Ac. The radiolabeled complexes showed high hydrophilicity and were generally stable in human serum (HS) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C over two half-lives, except for [225Ac]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 in PBS. In vitro affinity studies resulted in subnanomolar IC50 values for FAP and high selectivity for FAP over the related proteases PREP and DPP4 for both compounds as well as for [natLu]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2. In a first proof-of-principle patient study (medullary thyroid cancer), [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 was compared to [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2. High uptake and long tumor retention was observed in both cases, but [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 significantly reduces uptake in non-target and critical organs (liver, colon). Overall, the novel FAPi homodimer DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 showed improved radiolabeling in vitro and pharmacological properties in vivo compared to DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)2. [177Lu]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 and [225Ac]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)2 appear promising for translational application in patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A weak implant-soft tissue interface may lead to bacterial ingression, breakdown of underlying tissues, and eventually implant failure. This study proposes a surface modification technique of titanium alloy (Ti), using a nano-biopolymer scaffold to enhance soft tissue attachment in dental implants.
METHODS: Gelatin (20% w/v) embedded with 10 ± 2 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was electrospun to form a gelatin electrospun mat (GEM) scaffold, bonded to Ti alloy surface using chemical surface functionalization. Antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was tested against representative Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) at 4, 24, and 48 hours and after embedding in scaffold at 48 hours. Cytotoxicity analysis (MTT assay) was performed using the 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line at 24 and 72 hours for two groups: control (unmodified Ti disc) and experimental (GEM embedded with AgNPs); and further validated by scanning electron microscopy.
RESULTS: The AgNPs-embedded GEM showed good antimicrobial activity at 48 hours, with the AgNPs showing complete (99.99%) inhibition of bacterial colony counts at 24 and 48 hours. Cell viability and proliferation over the GEM modified Ti discs were seen to be significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) at 72 hours as compared with control. SEM images revealed intimate spreading of fibroblasts, with differentiated cell morphology and pseudopodial processes, indicative of enhanced fibroblastic adhesion, growth, and differentiation over the scaffold.
CONCLUSION: Results show good antifouling properties and biocompatibility of the fabricated coating, making it a promising strategy to reduce postoperative infections and peri-implant diseases in Ti dental implants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-care-associated infections (HAIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, including in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Networks of hospitals implementing standardised HAI surveillance can provide valuable data on HAI burden, and identify and monitor HAI prevention gaps. Hospitals in many LMICs use HAI case definitions developed for higher-resourced settings, which require human resources and laboratory and imaging tests that are often not available.
METHODS: A network of 26 tertiary-level hospitals in India was created to implement HAI surveillance and prevention activities. Existing HAI case definitions were modified to facilitate standardised, resource-appropriate surveillance across hospitals. Hospitals identified health-care-associated bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and reported clinical and microbiological data to the network for analysis.
FINDINGS: 26 network hospitals reported 2622 health-care-associated bloodstream infections and 737 health-care-associated UTIs from 89 intensive care units (ICUs) between May 1, 2017, and Oct 31, 2018. Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates were highest in neonatal ICUs (>20 per 1000 central line days). Catheter-associated UTI rates were highest in paediatric medical ICUs (4·5 per 1000 urinary catheter days). Klebsiella spp (24·8%) were the most frequent organism in bloodstream infections and Candida spp (29·4%) in UTIs. Carbapenem resistance was common in Gram-negative infections, occurring in 72% of bloodstream infections and 76% of UTIs caused by Klebsiella spp, 77% of bloodstream infections and 76% of UTIs caused by Acinetobacter spp, and 64% of bloodstream infections and 72% of UTIs caused by Pseudomonas spp.
INTERPRETATION: The first standardised HAI surveillance network in India has succeeded in implementing locally adapted and context-appropriate protocols consistently across hospitals and has been able to identify a large number of HAIs. Network data show high HAI and antimicrobial resistance rates in tertiary hospitals, showing the importance of implementing multimodal HAI prevention and antimicrobial resistance containment strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are one of the most common, causing substantial morbidity, mortality and are highly cost-effective means of reducing healthcare associated infections rates in health care set-ups. In India, there is no existing system for systematic surveillance of SSIs, encompassing post-discharge period.
METHODS: An indigenous SSI e-surveillance software was developed. Patients developing SSI as per standard definitions were included in the study. A denominator form and a case report form were filled for each case of SSI detected. The microbiological diagnosis was done as per standard methods. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for association of SSI and risk factors and determining the prevalence odds ratios.
RESULTS: Of the total of 850 patients enrolled in the SSI surveillance, 47 (5.5%) developed SSI. Most patients (490/850, 58%) underwent the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and also developed an SSI (33/490, 6.7%). Clean contaminated wound class and Dressing were found to be associated with increased risk of SSI significantly, Also increase in the length of stay was found to be associated with increased risk of SSI significantly. High antimicrobial resistance was observed in the microbial isolates recovered from SSIs. Patients who developed SSI had longer hospital stays.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study has been the first systematic surveillance effort in India, where patients were followed up till six months post surgeries. This pilot study was later expanded to other Indian hospitals. This network of SSI-Surveillance will lay the foundation for initiation of SSI-surveillance across the country.

AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are important components of the innate immune system which provide the first line of defense against invading microbes. There are four members in the family of PGRPs in animals of which PGRP-S is a common domain. It is responsible for the binding to microbial cell wall molecules. In order to understand the mode of binding of PGRP-S to the components of the bacterial cell wall, the structure of the complex of camel PGRP-S (CPGRP-S) with heptanoic acid has been determined at 2.15 Å resolution. The structure determination showed the presence of four crystallographically independent protein molecules which are designated as A, B, C, and D. These four protein molecules associate in the form of two homodimers which are represented as A-B and C-D dimers. The association between molecules A and B gives rise to a shallow cleft on the surface at one end of the dimeric interface. One molecule of heptanoic acid is observed at this binding site in the A-B dimer. The association of C and D molecules results in the formation of a long zig-zag tunnel along with the C-D interface. In the cleft at the C-D interface, three molecules of hydrogen peroxide along with other non-water solvent molecules have been observed. The analysis of the several complexes of CPGRP-S with fatty acids and non-fatty acids such as peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, and lipoteichoic acid shows that the fatty acids bind at the A-B site while non-fatty acids interact through C-D interface.

AB  - The short peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-S) of the innate immune system recognizes the invading microbes through binding to their cell wall molecules. In order to understand the mode of binding of PGRP-S to bacterial cell wall molecules, the structure of the complex of camel PGRP-S (CPGRP-S) with hexanoic acid has been determined at 2.07 Å resolution. Previously, we had reported the structures of CPGRP-S in the native unbound state as well as in the complexed forms with the components of various bacterial cell wall molecules such as peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acid (LTA), mycolic acid (MA) and other fatty acids. These structures revealed that CPGRP-S formed two homodimers which were designated as A-B and CD dimers. It also showed that the fatty acids bind to CPGRP-S in the binding site at the A-B dimer while the non-fatty acids were shown to bind at the interfaces of both A-B and CD dimers. The present structure of the complex of CPGRP-S with hexanoic acid (HA) showed that HA binds to CPGRP-S at the interface of CD dimer. HA was located in the same groove at the CD interface which was occupied by non-fatty acids such as PGN, LPS and LTA and interacts with residues from both C and D molecules. HA is firmly held in the groove with several hydrogen bonds and a number of van der Waals contacts. This is the first structure which reports the binding of a fatty acid in the cleft at the interface of CD dimer.

AB  - Timely HIV testing and diagnosis are necessary to prevent the development of AIDS and interrupt its transmission in society. We collected the data on HIV testing and diagnosis in 2020 and compared it with preceding years to examine how COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions impacted HIV services. The number of people who underwent HIV testing at the apex tertiary referral hospital of India in 2020 reduced by 57% compared to 2019 or the average/year during 2019-2016. Hence, the diagnosis of new HIV infections decreased by 52% compared to 2019 and 54% compared to the average/year during 2019-2016. Provider-initiated testing and diagnosis were more affected than client-initiated. There was a non-significant change in the rate of HIV detection among tested individuals. The male testing saw a more notable drop than female testing. HIV testing between ≥50 years and ≤14 years was more affected than other age groups. The transmission via regular partner/spouse increased, whereas it decreased via heterosexual commercial sex workers.

AB  - AIMS: To explore the impact of incorporating a faster cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging protocol in a low-middle-income country (LMIC) and using the result to guide chelation in transfusion-dependent patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective UK-India collaborative cohort study was conducted in two cities in India. Two visits 13 months apart included clinical assessment and chelation therapy recommendations based on rapid CMR results. Participants were recruited by the local patient advocate charity, who organized the patient medical camps. The average scanning time was 11.3 ± 2.5 min at the baseline and 9.8 ± 2.4 min (P < 0.001) at follow-up. The baseline visit was attended by 103 patients (mean age 25 years) and 83% attended the second assessment. At baseline, 29% had a cardiac T2* < 20 ms, which represents significant iron loading, and 12% had left ventricular ejection fraction <60%, the accepted lower limit in this population. Only 3% were free of liver iron (T2* ≥ 17 ms). At 13 months, more patients were taking intensified dual chelation therapy (43% vs. 55%, P = 0.002). In those with cardiac siderosis (baseline T2* < 20 ms), there was an improvement in T2*-10.9 ± 5.9 to 13.5 ± 8.7 ms, P = 0.005-and fewer were classified as having clinically important cardiac iron loading (T2* < 20 ms, 24% vs. 16%, P < 0.001). This is the first illustration in an LMIC that incorporating CMR results into patient management plans can improve cardiac iron loading.
CONCLUSION: For thalassaemia patients in an LMIC, a simplified CMR protocol linked to therapeutic recommendation via the patient camp model led to enhanced chelation therapy and a reduction in cardiac iron in 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The conventional modality for management of advanced invasive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (AJCC grade T4 and T3 with fornicial involvement) is surgical excision which is not only challenging in terms of ability to achieve tumor free margins and tissue reconstruction but also has high morbidity. We describe the use of systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in cases of advanced invasive OSSN.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This is a retrospective case series. Five cases of histopathologically proven advanced OSSN that were challenging to manage with surgical excision or required exenteration were treated with NAC. Demographic details, previous treatment history, location and extent of tumor, imaging findings, number of cycles and duration of NAC, response to treatment, and final outcome on follow-up were noted.
RESULTS: A remarkable response to NAC was seen in 4/5(80%) cases. Complete regression was seen in 2/5, partial regression in 2/5, and no response in 1/5 cases. In 75% (3/4) cases who showed response to NAC, minimal or no surgery was required. Exenteration was avoided in 2/3 cases with orbital extension.
CONCLUSION: NAC appears to be an exciting option for management of surgically challenging cases of invasive OSSN and may be helpful in avoiding orbital exenteration. However, more studies are required to explore this treatment option.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic stress is co-morbid with alcohol use disorder that feedback on one another, thus impeding recovery from both disorders. Stress and the stress hormone corticosterone aggravate alcohol-induced intestinal permeability and liver damage. However, the mechanisms involved in compounding tissue injury by stress/corticosterone and alcohol are poorly defined. Here we explored the involvement of the TRPV6 channel in stress (or corticosterone) 3and alcohol-induced intestinal epithelial permeability, microbiota dysbiosis, and systemic inflammation.
METHODS: Chronic alcohol feeding was performed on adult wild-type and Trpv6-/- mice with or without corticosterone treatment or chronic restraint stress (CRS). The barrier function was determined by evaluating inulin permeability in vivo and assessing tight junction (TJ) and adherens junction (AJ) integrity by immunofluorescence microscopy. The gut microbiota composition was evaluated by 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic analyses. Systemic responses were assessed by evaluating endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and liver damage.
RESULTS: Corticosterone and CRS disrupted TJ and AJ, increased intestinal mucosal permeability, and caused endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and liver damage in wild-type but not Trpv6-/- mice. Corticosterone and CRS synergistically potentiated the alcohol-induced breakdown of intestinal epithelial junctions, mucosal barrier impairment, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and liver damage in wild-type but not Trpv6-/- mice. TRPV6 deficiency also blocked the effects of CRS and CRS-mediated potentiation of alcohol-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate an essential role of TRPV6 in stress, corticosterone, and alcohol-induced intestinal permeability, microbiota dysbiosis, endotoxemia, systemic inflammation, and liver injury. This study identifies TRPV6 as a potential therapeutic target for developing treatment strategies for stress and alcohol-associated comorbidity.

AB  - Background and objective The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the health, social, and economic sectors all over the world. With a view to assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), we conducted a study to find out the incidence and severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among HCWs. Material and methods This was an observational cross-sectional study conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology in collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry at AIIMS, New Delhi from March 2021 to June 2021. One hundred HCWs working in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology were surveyed using a set of semi-structured interview schedules and structured questionnaires distributed via email or manually. The structured questionnaire included the demographic profile; other baseline information; the 42-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-42); and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical package STATA version 14.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX). Results A total of 100 HCWs participated in the study, out of which 39 (39%), 45 (45%), and 16 (16%) were doctors, nursing staff, and supporting staff, respectively. Overall, 92 (92%) of the participants were women, and the mean age of the participants was 29.87 ±4.85 years. Out of the 100 participants, 17 (17%), 25 (25%), 13 (13%), and two (2%) participants had depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD, respectively. Occupation-wise, among the nursing staff, doctors, and supporting staff, the incidence of depression was 24.4%, 15.4%, 0.0%, respectively; the anxiety rate was 33.3%, 25.6%, and 0.0%, respectively; and the rate of stress was 17.8%, 12.8%, and 0.0%, respectively. The IES-R score was significantly higher among unmarried as compared to married participants (2.70 ±7.935 vs. 1.60 ±3.583, p=0.000). Participants living in joint families had a higher DASS-42 score (DASS-D: 4.00 ±5.299 vs. 3.77 ±7.727, p=0.889; DASS-A: 4.31 ±4.398 vs. 4.12 ±7.496, p=0.905; DASS-S: 4.08 ±4.816 vs. 3.88 ±7.567, p=0.016) and lower IES-R score (1.31 ±4.922 vs. 2.66 ±9.947, p=0.752) as compared to those living in nuclear families. Depression (4.86 ±8.165 vs. 2.00 ±4.388, p=0.054), anxiety (5.31 ±7.538 vs. 2.14 ±4.704, p=0.024), stress (5.20 ±7.651 vs. 1.67 ±4.733, p=0.014) and PTSD (3.61 ±10.900 vs. 1.44 ±2.634, p=0.245) were all higher among HCWs having exposure to COVID-19 more than 10 hours per week compared to participants with an exposure of less than 10 hours per week. The participants having psychiatric illness in the family showed significantly higher mean values for DASS-42 (DASS-D: 20.00 ±26.870 vs. 3.50 ±6.264, p=0.001; DASS-A: 18.50 ±20.506 vs. 3.88 ±6.215, p=0.002; DASS-S: 18.00 ±21.213 vs. 3.64 ±6.346, p=0.003) as compared to those without any psychiatric illness in the family. Conclusion Based on our findings, occupational and environmental factors at the workplace play a key role in mental health outcomes, and COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the mental health of HCWs. Furthermore, we have also observed that effective planning can significantly reduce mental stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Severe edema in children with nephrotic syndrome is often refractory to conventional diuretics. Tolvaptan has been used satisfactorily for managing edema in patients with heart failure and cirrhosis. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with oral tolvaptan and intravenous (IV) furosemide was assessed in patients with furosemide refractory edema.
METHODS: Patients, aged 5-18 y with nephrotic syndrome and severe edema, were screened for eligibility. After excluding hypovolemia, patients received IV furosemide (3-4 mg/kg/d) for 48 h. Those refractory to IV furosemide (weight loss < 3%) received tolvaptan (0.5-1 mg/kg once daily) and IV furosemide for the next 48 h. Parameters were compared between 48 h of furosemide alone and combination therapy.
RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (18 boys) with mean age of 8.0 ± 3.0 y were enrolled. Urine volume significantly increased with combination therapy as compared to furosemide therapy (mean difference: 1.2 mL/kg/h; 95% CI: 0.8-1.65 mL/kg/h) (p < 0.001). Compared to therapy with furosemide alone, combination therapy resulted in significant reduction in body weight from 26.9 ± 10.3 kg to 24.8 ± 9.7 kg (p < 0.001). Estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change (p = 0.81) but serum sodium increased from 135.7 ± 3.3 mEq/L to 140.4 ± 4.8 mEq/L (p < 0.001) with combination therapy; 2 patients showed asymptomatic hypernatremia.
CONCLUSION: The combination of oral tolvaptan and IV furosemide is effective in augmenting diuresis and reducing weight in patients with furosemide refractory edema but requires monitoring of electrolytes and volume status.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The objectives of this study were to investigate the cyto-molecular profile and survival of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
METHODS: This prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital from October 2018 to December 2020. Karyotype and cytogenetics analyses were done to identify chromosomal aberrations in pediatric AML. The targeted molecular panel utilized the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and fragment analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients of AML with aged ≤18 years were enrolled in this study. The cytogenetic analyses revealed abnormal/recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities (CA) in 64.3% of patients and normal cytogenetics (CN) in 35.7% of patients. FAB M2 subtype showed frequent aberrant expression of the CD19 marker. CD7, CD11b, and CD36a were significantly present in the absence of molecular markers. Common chromosomal abnormalities were t(translocation) (8;21) (55%), monosomy/deletion 7 (13%), monosomal karyotype (5%) and complex karyotype (3%). The fusion transcripts RUNX1-RUNX1T1 [t(8;21)] (41%) and CBFB-MYH11 [t(16;16)] (3%) were detected by RT-PCR and FLT3-TKD D835 mutation (1.5%) by allele-specific oligo PCR. Fragment analysis revealed NPM1 (8%) mutation and FLT-ITD (9.5%) mutations. Complete remission was achieved in all evaluable patients. The median follow-up period of our patients was 225 days (IQR 28; 426 days). The median event-free survival (EFS) in all patients was 11.9 months (95% CI, 5-12.6 months). The forty months overall survival probability (pOS) was 58% in all patients.
CONCLUSION: The majority of patients had abnormal/recurrent cytogenetics abnormalities. FAB M2 subtype showed frequent aberrant expression of the CD19. The absence of molecular markers may suggest the presence of CD7, CD11b, and CD36a expression. The overall survival has increased considerably in LMIC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatty acid binding protein-2 (FABP-2) is involved in the metabolism of lipids in the intestine. FABP-2 Ala54Thr polymorphism involves a transition of G to A at codon 54 of FABP-2, resulting in an amino acid substitution Ala54 to Thr54 and is associated with elevated fasting triglycerides in some hyperlipidemic populations. In current genome builds and gene databases the variant of the Ala54Thr FABP-2 (rs 1 799 883) is annotated as c.163A>G (p. Thr55Ala).
AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The status of this polymorphism in hyperlipidemic Asian Indians from North India has not been investigated. This study was aimed to evaluate the distribution of the polymorphic variants of the Ala54Thr FABP-2 and their association with lipids in hyperlipidemic subjects.
METHODS: Ala54Thr FABP-2 polymorphism in both hyperlipidemic (n = 210) and normolipidemic (n = 342) subjects was assessed by PCR-RFLP.
RESULTS: Ala54Thr genotypes and alleles distribution did not differ between the hyperlipidemic and normolipidemic groups. The heterozygous genotype FABP-2 Ala/Thr was significantly associated with higher levels of triglycerides and very low-density lipoproteins as compared to the homozygous variant (Thr/Thr) genotype and the wild type homozygous (Ala/Ala) genotype.
CONCLUSIONS: The heterozygous genotype FABP-2 Ala54Thr is a risk factor for the development of hypertriglyceridemia and increased levels of VLDL-c in Asian Indians from North India.

Although most arachnoid cysts remain static with advancing age, occasionally they can become symptomatic due to cyst enlargement or hemorrhage. Hemorrhage into the arachnoid cysts (intra-cystic hemorrhage) with or without associated subdural hematoma is of rare occurrence.
CASE DISCUSSION: A 23-year-old male presented with a history of sudden onset severe headache while sleeping. The patient also noticed double vision, especially when looking towards the left side. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the head showed left temporal pole hematoma with left Sylvian fissure bleed and bilateral fronto-temporoparietal (FTP) subacute SDH.
CONCLUSION: Every patient with incidentally detected AC, especially in the middle cranial fossa, should be counseled regarding the risk of possible complications including hemorrhage and regular follow-up.

AB  - Commercial dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural-1 (NS1) Ag detection immunoassays often perform poorly, particularly in secondary DENV infection. To develop a highly sensitive NS1 ELISA, we generated a large repertoire of anti-DENV NS1 mouse mAbs (n = 95) that falls into 36 mAb classes based on binding specificities. The identified mAb pair, capable of efficiently detecting NS1 from four DENV serotypes in an immunoassay, was selected based on multiparametric analysis. The selected mAbs have subnanomolar affinities for NS1 with recognition sites outside the immunodominant wing domain. The assay was converted to an ELISA kit, which showed higher analytical sensitivity (3-fold to 83-fold) for NS1 from four DENV serotypes than commercial Platelia NS1 ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Compared to RT-PCR, the developed NS1 ELISA showed 78.57% (66 of 84) sensitivity, whereas Platelia NS1 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 60.71% (51 of 84). In a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive secondary dengue samples, our ELISA showed a sensitivity of 70.18% (40 of 57), whereas Platelia ELISA detected only 47.37% (27 of 57) samples. Furthermore, unlike Platelia ELISA, our test equally detected NS1 from four serotypes; Platelia ELISA performed poorly for the DENV-2 serotype, in which only 8 of 21 (38.10%) samples were detected compared with 17 of 21 (80.95%) in our ELISA. Moreover, our ELISA showed 100% specificity in 342 challenging dengue-negative samples. The large and diverse mAb repertoire generated against DENV NS1 and the appropriate selection of mAbs allowed us to establish an ELISA that can efficiently detect NS1 Ag even in secondary dengue and without serotype level bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although epilepsy is a common neurological condition, there is paucity of nationwide data on treatment patterns and sociodemographic and clinical factors affecting treatment decisions in India.
OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical profiles, usage pattern of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and seizure control among patients with epilepsy in India.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study on adult patients with epilepsy who were on AEDs for at least six months before enrollment. Data were collected from patient interviews and medical records.
RESULTS: Out of 800 enrolled patients, a majority (69.0%) had generalized onset seizure in the six months before enrollment. The median age at epilepsy onset was 20.0 (1.0-64.0) years; 40.0% of the patients were females, 48.5% were married, 99.1% were literate, and 67.0% belonged to the lower or upper-middle socioeconomic class. Overall, 459 patients (57.4%) received AEDs as combination therapy. Most patients received levetiracetam (37.0%), sodium valproate (18.5%), carbamazepine (17.3%), or phenytoin (13.8%) as monotherapy, and clobazam (59.7%), levetiracetam (52.9%), carbamazepine (26.4%), sodium valproate (24.8%), or phenytoin (24.0%) in combination therapy. Quality of life was comparable for first- and third-generation AEDs. Adverse drug reactions were mostly attributed to dose modification or switching between drugs. No serious adverse drug reactions or new safety concerns were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this large, cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study indicate that first-generation AEDs sodium valproate and phenytoin continued to be used in a substantial number of patients on monotherapy and combination therapy in India, even though an increasing trend toward use of second-generation AEDs was noted in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemodialysis is the most common treatment modality for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Excessive daytime sleepiness and poor nighttime sleep is a common problem among these patients. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) are regularly exposed to impaired fluid balance, which may cause overhydration of varying degree. However, the role of hydration status in sleep quality has not been explored in Indian setting. Hence, this study was undertaken to assess the factors affecting sleep quality among patients on MHD in a tertiary care hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients (N = 55) were enrolled if they aged above18 years, on MHD for at least 3 months, and gave consent. The daytime sleep quality was assessed using Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and STATA software.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 40.4 ± 14.7 years. The prevalence rate of predialysis fluid overload was 85.4%. The median ESS score was 7 and ISI score was 3 indicating normal daytime sleep and not significant insomnia. Multivariate regression with variables adjustment showed that interdialytic weight gain (P = 0.33), tingling sensation (P = 0.36) and numbness (P = 0.35) were significant predictive factors for quality of sleep.
CONCLUSION: The major factors affecting sleep quality were numbness, tingling sensation, and interdialytic weight gain. Fluid overload did not play any role in sleep quality. Another study may be carried out on assessment of pattern, duration, quality of sleep in multiple dialysis sessions, and effect of optimizing fluid status on the sleep parameters.

AB  - Lipid-based vesicular nanoparticles, for instance liposomes, conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) have proven to be the closest to an ideal drug delivery vehicle, making way for several PEG-liposomes based nanomedicines in market. However, the synthetic nature of the nanomaterial poses a threat to stimulate immune system. Alternatively, nanovesicles derived from mammalian cells, such as RBCs, have gained interests as they may not elicit much immune response due to the presence of host specific self-recognition markers on their surface. While several reports demonstrating the superior efficacy of these naturally derived vesicles have come out in the last few years, a comparison with clinically established liposomes is still missing. Thus, we conducted an in-vitro and in-vivo comparative studies between PEG-Liposomes and nanovesicles (NVEs) derived from red blood cell (RBC) membrane with an aim to establish a biocompatible nanocarrier for efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and photothermal agents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of practice regarding the diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with celiac disease (CeD) varies between practice to practice.
METHODS: A web-based questionnaire based on review of literature, group discussions and expert group meetings was developed to understand the practice of CeD in India. The questionnaire was administered through social media (WhatsApp) to 18 Indian celiac support groups comprising 2980 patients with CeD.
RESULTS: Overall, 970 (32.5%) patients responded to the questionnaire (median age: 21 years; females 63.9%). While 679 (71.1%) patients were diagnosed based on a combination of serology and biopsy, 214 (22.4%) were diagnosed based on serology alone. After diagnosis, 875 (91%) patients were counselled initially by physician and only 585 (61%) were referred to a dietician for dietary counselling. In a majority of cases, the time spent by doctors and dietitians during first counselling was between 10 and 20 minutes only. After first counselling, 191 (20%) and 355 (37.3%) patients did not re-visit the physician and the dietitian, respectively. Among those who followed up, structured follow-up was conducted in only 515 (53.8%) patients. Overall, 232 (24.3%) patients were self-monitoring their serological parameters, while 495 (51.8%) patients did not receive a formal assessment of dietary adherence during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The practice of diagnosis, dietary counselling and follow-up of patients with CeD in India is not as per standard guidelines. Most of the patients are not referred to a dietitian. There is a need for reinforcement of guidelines for proper care and management of patients with CeD.

AB  - Cardiac hypertrophy is the enlargement of cardiomyocytes in response to persistent release of catecholamine which further leads to cardiac fibrosis. Chrysin, flavonoid from honey, is well known for its multifarious properties like antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic and anti-apoptotic. To investigate the cardioprotective potential of chrysin against isoproterenol (ISO), cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are induced in rats. Acclimatised male albino Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (n 6): normal (carboxymethyl cellulose at 0·5 % p.o.; as vehicle), hypertrophy control (ISO 3 mg/kg, s.c.), CHY15 + H, CHY30 + H & CHY60 + H (chrysin; p.o.15, 30 and 60 mg/kg respectively + ISO at 3 mg/kg, s.c.), CHY60 (chrysin 60 mg/kg in per se) and LST + H (losartan 10 mg/kg p.o. + ISO 3 mg/kg, s.c.) were treated for 28 d. After the dosing schedule on day 29, haemodynamic parameters were recorded, after that blood and heart were excised for biochemical, histological, ultra-structural and molecular evaluations. ISO administration significantly increases heart weight:body weight ratio, pro-oxidants, inflammatory and cardiac injury markers. Further, histopathological, ultra-structural and molecular studies confirmed deteriorative changes due to ISO administration. Pre-treatment with chrysin of 60 mg/kg reversed the ISO-induced damage to myocardium and prevent cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis through various anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and anti-fibrotic pathways. Data demonstrated that chrysin attenuated myocardial hypertrophy and prevented fibrosis via activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)/Smad signalling pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite decades of experience, aspects of the management of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (TOF) remain controversial. Practitioners must consider newer, evolving treatment strategies with limited data to guide decision making. Therefore, the TOF Clinical Practice Standards Committee was commissioned by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery to provide a framework on this topic, focused on timing and types of interventions, management of high-risk patients, technical considerations during interventions, and best practices for assessment of outcomes of the interventions. In addition, the group was tasked with identifying pertinent research questions for future investigations. It is recognized that variability in institutional experience could influence the application of this framework to clinical practice.
METHODS: The TOF Clinical Practice Standards Committee is a multinational, multidisciplinary group of cardiologists and surgeons with expertise in TOF. With the assistance of a medical librarian, a citation search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed using key words related to TOF and its management; the search was restricted to the English language and the year 2000 or later. Articles pertaining to pulmonary atresia, absent pulmonary valve, atrioventricular septal defects, and adult patients with TOF were excluded, as well as nonprimary sources such as review articles. This yielded nearly 20,000 results, of which 163 were included. Greater consideration was given to more recent studies, larger studies, and those using comparison groups with randomization or propensity score matching. Expert consensus statements with class of recommendation and level of evidence were developed using a modified Delphi method, requiring 80% of the member votes with 75% agreement on each statement.
RESULTS: In asymptomatic infants, complete surgical correction between age 3 and 6 months is reasonable to reduce the length of stay, rate of adverse events, and need for a transannular patch. In the majority of symptomatic neonates, both palliation and primary complete surgical correction are useful treatment options. It is reasonable to consider those with low birth weight or prematurity, small or discontinuous pulmonary arteries, chromosomal anomalies, other congenital anomalies, or other comorbidities such as intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, or other end-organ compromise as high-risk patients. In these high-risk patients, palliation may be preferred; and, in patients with amenable anatomy, catheter-based procedures may prove favorable over surgical palliation.
CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing research will provide further insight into the role of catheter-based interventions. For complete surgical correction, both transatrial and transventricular approaches are effective; however, the smallest possible ventriculotomy should be utilized. When possible, the pulmonary valve should be spared; and if unsalvageable, reconstruction can be considered. At the conclusion of the operation, adequate relief of the right ventricular outflow obstruction should be confirmed, and identification of a significant fixed anatomical obstruction should prompt further intervention. Given our current knowledge and the gaps identified, we propose several key questions to be answered by future research and potentially by a TOF registry: When to palliate or proceed with complete surgical correction, as well as the ideal type of palliation; the optimal surgical approach for complete repair for the best long-term preservation of right ventricular function; and the utility, efficacy, and durability of various pulmonary valve preservation and reconstruction techniques.

AB  - The recently diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in December 2019 commonly affects the respiratory system. The incidence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure varied among epidemiological studies with high percentage of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with a high mortality. Noninvasive ventilation is an alternative tool for ventilatory support instead of invasive mechanical ventilation, especially with scarce resources and intensive care beds. Initially, there were concerns by the national societies regarding utilization of noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure. Recent publications reflect the gained experience with the safe utilization of noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive ventilation has beneficiary role in treatment of acute hypoxic respiratory failure with proper indications, setting, monitoring, and timely escalation of therapy. Patients should be monitored frequently for signs of improvement or deterioration in the clinical status. Awareness of indications, contraindications, and parameters reflecting either success or failure of noninvasive ventilation in the management of acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 is essential for improvement of outcomes.

AB  - Amputation is the surgical removal of all or part of a body part. It demands an adjustment in almost every sphere of a person's life in addition to physical disability. An amputee faces problems in almost every psychosocial sphere.1, 2 Along with physical pain in the stump, patients may experience phantom sensations.3-5 Patients may also grieve, feel depressed, and anxious3, 6, 4, 7 or have posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.8, 9 They may be apprehensive about their future plans and inconclusive regarding life challenges. Grief is one of the most common reactions to amputation,10, 1, 7 but often gets neglected in intensive surgical units.1 Many times, grief reactions are not resolved, turning into complicated grief or prolonged grief, leading to conditions like depression, anxiety, or even suicide. This article is about an attempt to help a patient initiate the grieving process for healthy outcomes.

AB  - Nanotechnology advancements and applications have paved the way for new possibilities in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. It is a relatively new field that has the potential to improve stem cell differentiation and therapy greatly. Numerous studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials can function as a physiological niche for the formation and differentiation of stem cells. However, quantum dots (QDs), such as carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and graphene quantum dots (GQDs), have shown considerable promise in the field of regenerative medicine. To date, most research has focused on stem cell tracking and imaging using CQDs. However, their interaction with stem cells and the associated possibility for differentiation by selectively focusing chemical signals to a particular lineage has received scant attention. In this mini-review, we attempt to categorize a few pathways linked with the role of CQDs in stem cell differentiation.

AB  - Serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (SDAMs) have been approved as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressants in patients with inadequate response. These drugs have been proposed to have a beneficial effect on cognition, sleep-related problems, and other affective symptoms in patients with depression. Previous studies have shown inconsistent evidence and have not reported a pooled effect of the 2 drugs of this class: aripiprazole and brexpiprazole. This meta-analysis evaluated the effect of augmentation with SDAM drugs in patients with major depression. The meta-analysis protocol was made as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Trial registry, and EudraCT databases were searched with prespecified search terms. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using the meta package in R software. Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The random-effects model analysis observed a pooled effect of 1.55 (95%CI, 1.32-1.84; prediction interval, 0.95-2.55, z = 5.19 [P < .0001]) for remission between the SDAM and placebo groups. A pooled effect of 1.58 (95%CI, 1.37-1.83; prediction interval, 1.00-2.51, z = 6.34 [P < .0001]) for adverse events and 0.72 (95%CI, 0.48-1.08; prediction interval, 0.46-1.12; z = -1.58 [P = .113]) for serious adverse events was observed. No significant publication bias was noticed. The quality of the evidence was rated as high. Adjunct SDAM increased remission in patients and had no significant effect on serious adverse events compared to placebo. Therefore, we conclude that SDAM drugs can be an effective and safe antidepressant augmentation strategy in patients with major depressive disorder.

AU  - NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC)
T2  - Nature
AB  - Optimal growth and development in childhood and adolescence is crucial for lifelong health and well-being1-6. Here we used data from 2,325 population-based studies, with measurements of height and weight from 71 million participants, to report the height and body-mass index (BMI) of children and adolescents aged 5-19 years on the basis of rural and urban place of residence in 200 countries and territories from 1990 to 2020. In 1990, children and adolescents residing in cities were taller than their rural counterparts in all but a few high-income countries. By 2020, the urban height advantage became smaller in most countries, and in many high-income western countries it reversed into a small urban-based disadvantage. The exception was for boys in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in some countries in Oceania, south Asia and the region of central Asia, Middle East and north Africa. In these countries, successive cohorts of boys from rural places either did not gain height or possibly became shorter, and hence fell further behind their urban peers. The difference between the age-standardized mean BMI of children in urban and rural areas was <1.1 kg m-2 in the vast majority of countries. Within this small range, BMI increased slightly more in cities than in rural areas, except in south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in central and eastern Europe. Our results show that in much of the world, the growth and developmental advantages of living in cities have diminished in the twenty-first century, whereas in much of sub-Saharan Africa they have amplified.

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection targets host restriction factors that inhibit its replication and survival. Previous studies have shown that barriers to autointegration factor1 (BANF1) inhibited the replication of herpes simplex virus and vaccinia virus by binding to phosphate backbone of dsDNA. To date, no reports are available for the interplay between BANF1 and HBV. In this study, we elucidated the mechanisms by which HBV inhibit BANF1. First, the effect of HBV on BANF1 was observed in Huh-7, Hep G2, and Hep G2.2.15 cells. Huh-7 cells were transfected with pHBV1.3 or HBx plasmids. The results showed that there was a decreased expression of BANF1 in Hep G2.2.15 cells (P ≤ 0.005) or in HBV/HBx expressing Huh-7 cells (P ≤ 0.005), whereas BANF1 overexpression decreased viral replication (P ≤ 0.05). To study whether phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of BANF1 was responsible for antiviral activity, mutants were created, and it was found that inhibition due to mutants was less significant compared to BANF1 wild type. Previous studies have shown that HBV, at least in part, could regulate the expression of host miRNAs via HBx. It was found that miR-203 expression was high in Hep G2.2.15 cells (P ≤ 0.005) compared to Hep G2 cells. Next, the effect of HBx on miR-203 expression was studied and result showed that HBx upregulated miR-203 expression (P ≤ 0.005). Overexpression of miR-203 downregulated BANF1 expression (P ≤ 0.05) and viral titer was upregulated (P ≤ 0.05), while inhibition of miR-203, reversed these changes. In conclusion, BANF1 downregulated HBV, whereas HBV inhibited BANF1, at least in part, via HBx-mediated miR-203 upregulation in hepatic cells. IMPORTANCE In this study, for the first time, we found that BANF1 inhibited HBV replication and restricted the viral load. However, as previously reported for other viruses, the results in this study showed that BAF1 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is not involved in its antiviral activity against HBV. HBV infection inhibited the intracellular expression of BANF1, via HBx-mediated upregulation of miR-203 expression. Overexpression of miR-203 downregulated BANF1 and increased the viral titer, while inhibition of miR-203 reversed these changes. This study helped us to understand the molecular mechanisms by which HBV survives and replicates in the host cells.

AB  - HBV entry to the host cells and its successful infection depends on its ability to modulate the host restriction factors. DEAD box RNA helicase, DDX3, is shown to inhibit HBV replication. However, the exact mechanism of inhibition still remains unclear. DDX3 is involved in multitude or RNA metabolism processes including biogenesis of miRNAs. In this study, we sought to determine the mechanism involved in DDX3-mediated HBV inhibition. First, we observed that HBx protein of HBV downregulated DDX3 expression in HBV-infected cells. Overexpression of DDX3 inhibited HBx, HBsAg and total viral load, while its knockdown reversed the result in Hep G2.2.15 cells. Expression of miR-34 was downregulated in HBV-infected cells. Overexpression of pHBV1.3 further confirmed that HBV downregulates miR-34 expression. Consistent with the previous finding that DDX3 is involved in miRNA biogenesis, we observed that expression of miR-34 positively corelated with DDX3 expression. miRNA target prediction tools showed that miR-34 can target autophagy pathway which is hijacked by HBV for the benefit of its own replication. Indeed, transfection with miR-34 oligos downregulated the expression of autophagy marker proteins in HBV-expressing cells. Overexpression of DDX3 in HBV-expressing cells, downregulated expression of autophagy proteins while silencing of DDX3 reversed the results. These results led us to conclude that DDX3 upregulates miR-34 expression and thus inhibits autophagy in HBV-expressing cells while HBx helps HBV evade DDX3-mediated inhibition by downregulating DDX3 expression in HBV-infected cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unbiased and full disclosure of trial results is vital to evidence-based medicine. Non-publication and selective publication leads to publication bias and unrealistic risk-benefit ratio. In the present study, we aim to determine the publication rate of clinical trials related to neurology registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), compare the characteristics of published and unpublished trials, and evaluate the adherence of investigators to ethics-approved criteria and outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional search using the keyword "neurology" was carried out in CTRI registry. Two independent investigators searched Pubmed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar for published manuscripts. The final literature search occurred in November 2021.
RESULTS: Out of 325 trials, 102 trials were published (31.4%). Ninety-one trials were beyond 3 years of expected time of trial completion and were still unpublished. Randomized trials had a slightly higher publication rate than non-randomized ones (56% vs. 46%, p = .223); however the difference was not statistically significant. Majority of trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were not published, while majority of those sponsored by non-pharmaceutical institutions were published (34.5% vs. 69.3%, p < .001). Feedback to CTRI about trial status was particularly poor (31.5% - informed vs. 68.5% - not informed, p < .001). 52 (50.9%) and 65 (63.7%) of the 102 published trials had changed the registered inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively, in the CTRI registry compared to those in the published manuscript. In 29 (28.3%) of the 102 trials, the primary outcome did not match with that registered in the CTRI and in 73 (57.8%) trials, the secondary outcomes did not match.
CONCLUSION: A large proportion of neurology registered trials are still unpublished, with a majority of pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials not being published. There is scope for improving the provisions in CTRI for enlisting trial results, that may prevent publication bias and also ensure the investigators adhere to the pre-specified ethics approved trial procedures and outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carotid plaque morphology plays an important role in determining outcome of carotid artery stenting (CAS). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and its extension VH (Virtual Histology)-IVUS evaluate plaque characteristics in real time and guide decision making during stenting. To date, there is no consensus about indications of IVUS and its validated methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the clinical utility of IVUS in carotid artery interventions (CAS) and develop a future consensus for research and practice parameters.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of the English literature articles published till February 2021. Studies reporting on IVUS parameters and findings and also its performance compared with other imaging modalities were included in review. Pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. The statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2.
RESULTS: A total of 2015 patients from 29 studies were included. Proportional meta-analysis was performed on 1566 patients from 11 studies. In 9 studies, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) had a pooled prevalence of 4% (95% CI 3%-5%) while asymptomatic stroke had a pooled prevalence of 46% (95% CI 31%-62%) in 4 studies following IVUS. Two studies reported that IVUS detected more plaque protrusion compared with angiography (n=33/396 vs 11/396). IVUS led to stent type or size change in 8 of 48 cases which were missed on angiography in 3 other studies. Concordance between VH-IVUS and true histology was good at 80% to 85% reported in 2 studies.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed, though IVUS fared better to computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for better stent selection during CAS, with low to moderate risk of bias in the studies included. However, large scale, preferably randomized controlled studies are needed to predict its role in determining clinical outcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: Brain tumours have an incidence of 1.15 to 5.14 cases per 100,000 children and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radiosurgery has become a promising approach to manage these paediatric CNS tumours. The aim of the present study was to analyse the efficacy of radiosurgery in the treatment of a variety of paediatric tumours of CNS.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted from 1997 to 2012 at a single Neurosurgery centre. All paediatric patients (≤ 18 years of age) with CNS tumours who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had a minimum follow up of 6 months were included in the study. Patients with lesions other than tumours were excluded. Clinical, radiological and GKRS planning data was collected and analysed in all patients.
RESULTS: A total of 76 children with brain tumours had GKRS during the study period. Of these, 40 children (with 61 neoplasms) had follow-up available and were included in the study. The mean age was 16 years (6-18 years). Seventeen patients received primary GKRS, 20 patients received secondary, and 3 patients received both. The median tumour volume was 3.3 cm3 (0.14-38.9 cm3). The mean dose was 12.56 Gy at 50% isodose line. The majority of the tumours were meningioma (n = 20) followed by acoustic schwannoma (n = 17). The mean treatment time was 67.04 min. Thirty-three tumours responded favourably to GKRS, 24 showed a stable size, 3 had no response while 1 progressed, requiring surgery.
CONCLUSION: GKRS has the potential to become an indispensable tool in the management of paediatric brain neoplasms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal fluid management during neurosurgery is controversial. Evidences suggest that goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) can improve postoperative outcome. This study aimed to assess the intraoperative use of GDFT on the duration of hospital stay and postoperative complications in patients undergoing craniotomy for large supratentorial tumors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients of 18-65 years age undergoing large supratentorial tumor surgery were prospectively randomized into two groups. Control-group received fluid regimen based on routine hemodynamic monitoring, whereas patients belonging to GDFT group received fluid based on stroke volume variation (SVV)-guided therapy. A colloid bolus of 250 ml 6% hydroxyl ethyl starch was given, if the SVV was more than 12% in the GDFT group. Hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure and heart rate, and dynamic parameters, such as cardiac index, stroke volume index, and SVV, were recorded at different time intervals.
RESULTS: The total amount of fluid required was significantly lower in GDFT (P = 0.003) group as compared to the Control group. Intraoperative complications were significantly lower in GDFT group (P = 0.005), but the incidence of tight brain was significantly higher in the control group. The duration of hospital stay (P = 0.07) and incidence of postoperative complications (P = 0.32) were lower in GDFT group. Neurological outcomes at-discharge were similar in both the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study did not show any benefit of GDFT over conventional intraoperative fluid therapy in terms of incidence of postoperative complications, hospital and ICU stay, and Glasgow outcome scores at-discharge in patients undergoing craniotomy for excision of large supratentorial tumors. However, the use of GDFT leads to better perioperative fluid management and brain relaxation scores.

AB  - Yoga-based interventions can be effective in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We developed a Yoga programme for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) and conducted a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) among high-risk people in India. This qualitative study's objective was to identify and explore participants' trial- and intervention-related barriers and facilitators. The feasibility trial was conducted at two Yoga centres in New Delhi and Bengaluru, India. In this qualitative study, 25 trial participants (13 intervention group, 12 control group) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using deductive logic and an interpretative phenomenological approach. Amongst intervention and control participants, key barriers to trial participation were inadequate information about recruitment and randomisation processes and the negative influence of non-participants. Free blood tests to aid T2DM prevention, site staff's friendly behaviour and friends' positive influence facilitated trial participation. Amongst intervention participants, readability and understanding of the programme booklets, dislike of the Yoga diary, poor quality Yoga mats, difficulty in using the programme video, household commitment during home sessions, unplanned travel, difficulty in practising Yoga poses, hesitation in attending programme sessions with the YOGA-DP instructor of the opposite sex and mixed-sex group programme sessions were key barriers to intervention participation. Adequate information was provided on T2DM prevention and self-care, good venue and other support provided for programme sessions, YOGA-DP instructors' positive behaviour and improvements in physical and mental well-being facilitated intervention participation. In conclusion, we identified and explored participants' trial- and intervention-related barriers and facilitators. We identified an almost equal number of barriers (n = 12) and facilitators (n = 13); however, intervention-related barriers and facilitators were greater than for participating in the trial. These findings will inform the design of the planned definitive RCT design and intervention and can also be used to design other Yoga interventions and RCTs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Host biomarkers are needed to monitor the response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for ensuring effective therapy and preventing drug-resistant tuberculosis. We sought to find the correlation between the serum levels of SAA1 and IL-1beta in response to ATT in adult patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) or extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB).
METHODS: Blood samples of 32 patients with PTB and 28 patients with EPTB were analyzed. The blood samples were collected at baseline, two months and six months following treatment initiation. SAA1 and IL-1beta levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: In the PTB group, the mean levels of SAA1 decreased significantly (p <0.001) after the intensive phase (two months) and continuous phase (six months) of ATT in comparison with the baseline value. IL-1beta values also decreased significantly (p = 0.005) after the intensive phase (two months) compared with the baseline values. In the EPTB group, there was a significant reduction in the mean serum level of SAA1 (p <0.001) and IL-1beta (p = 0.001) after the intensive phase (two months) in comparison with the baseline value, whereas the reduction at six months was not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: SAA1 and IL-1beta may be useful potential treatment-monitoring biomarkers, especially in the intensive phase of therapy for both PTB and EPTB.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cancer patients and their caregivers are overwhelmed with features of uncertainty, fear, shock, worry, anxiety, sadness, and grief. To add on to their misery, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely afflicted the cancer care delivery. The study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers and to formulate strategies for oncological setups to overcome those challenges.
METHODS: After obtaining institutional ethical clearance, a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by patients and their caregivers at the level of various domains (physical, logistic, psychological, socioeconomic, and spiritual) who visited the outpatient and inpatient department of cancer pain and palliative care unit. The results were expressed in absolute numbers.
RESULTS: Major challenges encountered were suffering from physical symptoms like pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea (90%), postponement of cancer treatment (80%), fear of contracting COVID infection due to hospital visit (93.5%), lack of accommodation (70%), and lack of spiritual clarity and hope (50%).
CONCLUSIONS: Major challenges faced by patients were in physical and psychological domains, and those by caregivers were in socioeconomic domains and handling physical symptoms of their patients. It is imperative to recognize and be cognizant of the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers. Health care setups should formulate strategies to alleviate these challenges and provide holistic care to cancer patients. These strategies will hold in good stead for future pandemics also.

AB  - CONTEXT: Cavernous sinus haemangiomas (CSHs) are rare vascular malformations arising from the micro-circulation of the cavernous sinus. The current treatment options are micro-surgical excision of CSH, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and fractionated radiation therapy (FRT).
AIMS: We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the effect and complications of SRS in CSH and compared the pooled results after surgical excision of CSH. The aim of the study is to provide valuable insight into the role of SRS in the treatment of CSHs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature search revealed a total of 21 articles with 199 patients who met our inclusion criteria, and these were analyzed for this study.
RESULTS: There were 138 (69.3%) female and 61 (30.7%) male patients. The mean age at the time of radiosurgery was 48.4 ± 14.9 years. The mean tumor volume at the time of SRS was 17.4 cm3 (range 0.3-138 cm3). Fifty (25%) patients had undergone surgery before SRS, whereas 149 (75%) patients received standalone SRS. A total of 186 (93.5%) patients were treated by gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS), whereas 13 got treated by Cyberknife. The mean tumor volume in CK-F, GKRS, and GKRS-F groups was 36.6 ± 26.3, 15.4 ± 18.4, and 86.0 ± 19.5 cm3, respectively. The mean marginal dose was 21.8 ± 2.9 Gy, 14.0 ± 1.9 Gy, and 25 ± 0.0 Gy in CK-F, GKRS, and GKRS-F groups, respectively. The mean marginal dose of SRS was 14.6 ± 2.9 Gy. The mean follow-up period after SRS was 35.8 ± 31.6 months. Significant clinical improvement was seen in 106 patients out of 116 (91.4%) after SRS with remarkable shrinkage, 22 patients out of 27 (81.5%) with minimal shrinkage, and nine patients out of 13 (69.2%) with stationary tumor shrinkage. The sixth cranial nerve (CN6) was the most commonly involved nerve in 73 patients (36.7%). 30/65 (89%) experienced an improvement in the abducent nerve function following SRS. 115/120 (95.8%) patients primary treated with SRS experienced clinical improvement, whereas the rest of the five patients remained clinically stable.
CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery SRS is a safe and effective option in patients with CSHs and resulted in more than 50% decrease in tumor volume in 72.4% of the patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several methodological tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Tests are mostly used in the aid of diagnosis or for serological assessment. No tests are fully confirmatory and have variable level of diagnostic ability. We aimed at assessing agreement with three serological tests: quantitative anti receptor binding domain ELISA (Q-RBD), qualitative ELISA (WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 Ab) and qualitative chemiluminescence assay (CLIA).
METHODS: This study was a part of a large population based sero-epidemiological cohort study. Participants aged 1 year or older were included from 25 randomly selected clusters each in Delhi urban (urban resettlement colony of South Delhi district) and Delhi rural (villages in Faridabad district, Haryana). Three type of tests were applied to all the baseline blood samples. Result of the three tests were evaluated by estimating the total agreement and kappa value.
RESULTS: Total 3491 blood samples collected from March to September, 2021, out of which 1700 (48.7%) from urban and 1791 (51.3%) from rural. Overall 44.1% of participants were male. The proportion of sero-positivity were 78.1%, 75.2% and 31.8% by Wantai, QRBD and CLIA tests respectively. The total agreement between Wantai and QRBD was 94.5%, 53.1% between Wantai and CLIA, and 56.8% between QRBD and CLIA. The kappa value between these three tests were 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.87), 0.22 (95% CI 0.19-0.24) and 0.26 (95% CI 0.23-0.28).
CONCLUSIONS: There was strong concordance between Wantai and QRBD test. Agreement between CLIA with other two tests was low. Wantai and QRBD tests measuring the antibody to same S protein can be used with high agreement based on the relevant scenario.

AB  - Background: The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the gold standard to detect the neutralizing capacity of serum antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies confer protection against further infection. The present study measured the antibody level against SARS-CoV-2 among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and evaluated whether the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicates virus neutralizing capacity. Methods: One hundred COVID-19 confirmed cases were recruited. Their sociodemographic details and history of COVID-19 vaccination, contact with positive COVID-19 cases, and symptoms were ascertained using a self-developed semi-structured interview schedule. Serum samples of the participants were collected within three months from the date of the positive report of COVID-19. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies), receptor binding domain antibodies (anti-RBD), and neutralizing antibodies were measured. Findings: Almost all the participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM) (99%) and anti-RBD IgG antibodies (97%). However, only 69% had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-RBD antibody levels were significantly higher among participants having neutralizing antibodies compared with those who did not. Interpretation: The present study highlights that the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, or the presence of anti-RBD antibodies does not necessarily imply the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimating seroepidemiolgical prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody is an essential public health strategy. There is insufficient evidence of prevalence among those belonging to young age population in India.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate between children and adults in selected sites from India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a multicentric population-based seroepidemiological study conducted in selected urban and rural areas of five sites selected from four states (Delhi, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Tripura) of India. Participants aged ≥1 year were included from different clusters of each area. Total serum antibody against SARS-CoV-2 virus was assessed qualitatively by using a standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit.
RESULTS: Data collection period was from 15 March 2021 to 10 June 2021. Total available data was of 4509 participants, of whom 700 were <18 years of age and 3809 were ≥18 years of age. The site-wise number of available data among those aged 2-17 years was 92, 189, 165, 146 and 108 for the sites of Delhi urban, Delhi rural, Bhubaneswar rural, Gorakhpur rural and Agartala rural area, respectively. The seroprevalence was 55.7% in the <18 years age group and 63.5% in the ≥18 years age group. The prevalence among female children was 58% and among male children was 53%.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity rate among children was high and comparable to that of the adult population. Hence, it is unlikely that any future third wave by prevailing SARS-CoV-2 variant would disproportionately infect children 2 years or older.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSES: Recent developments in high-throughput proteomic approach have shown the potential to discover biomarkers for diagnosing acute stroke and to elucidate the pathomechanisms specific to different stroke subtypes. We aimed to determine blood-based protein biomarkers to diagnose total stroke (IS+ICH) from healthy controls, ischemic stroke (IS) from healthy controls, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from healthy control subjects within 24 h using a discovery-based SWATH-MS proteomic approach.
METHODS: In this discovery phase study, serum samples were collected within 24 h from acute stroke (IS & ICH) patients and healthy controls and were subjected to SWATH-MS-based untargeted proteomics. For protein identification, a high-pH fractionated peptide library for human serum proteins (obtained from SCIEX) comprising of 465 proteins was used. Significantly differentially expressed (SDE) proteins were selected using the following criteria: >1.5-fold change for upregulated, < 0.67 for downregulated, p-value < 0.05, and confirmed/tentative selection using Boruta random forest. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and the functional enrichment analysis were conducted using STRING 11 online tool, g:Profiler tool and Cytoscape 3.9.0 software. The statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2.
RESULTS: Our study included 40 stroke cases (20 IS, 20 ICH) within 24 h and 40 age-, sex-, hypertension-, and diabetes-matched healthy controls. We quantified 375 proteins between the stroke cases and control groups through SWATH-MS analysis. We observed 31 SDE proteins between total stroke and controls, 16 SDE proteins between IS and controls, and 41 SDE proteins between ICH and controls within 24 h. Four proteins [ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and coagulation factor XIII B chain (F13B)] commonly differentiated total stroke, IS, and ICH from healthy control subjects. The most common significant pathways in stroke cases involved complement and coagulation cascades, platelet degranulation, immune-related processes, acute phase response, lipid-related processes, and pathways related to extracellular space and matrix.
CONCLUSION: Our discovery phase study identified potential protein biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of acute stroke and highlighted significant pathways associated with different stroke subtypes. These potential biomarker candidates warrant further validation in future studies with a large cohort of stroke patients to investigate their diagnostic performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A Core Outcome Set (COS) is a standardised list of outcomes that should be reported as a minimum in all clinical trials. In epilepsy, the choice of outcomes varies widely among existing studies, particularly in clinical trials. This diminishes opportunities for informed decision-making, contributes to research waste and is a barrier to integrating findings in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Furthermore, the outcomes currently being measured may not reflect what is important to people with epilepsy. Therefore, we aim to develop a COS specific to clinical effectiveness research for adults with epilepsy using Delphi consensus methodology.
METHODS: The EPSET Study will comprise of three phases and follow the core methodological principles as outlined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. Phase 1 will include two focused literature reviews to identify candidate outcomes from the qualitative literature and current outcome measurement practice in phase III and phase IV clinical trials. Phase 2 aims to achieve international consensus to define which outcomes should be measured as a minimum in future trials, using a Delphi process including an online consensus meeting involving key stakeholders. Phase 3 will involve dissemination of the ratified COS to facilitate uptake in future trials and the planning of further research to identify the most appropriate measurement instruments to use to capture the COS in research practice.
DISCUSSION: Harmonising outcome measurement across future clinical trials should ensure that the outcomes measured are relevant to patients and health services, and allow for more meaningful results to be obtained.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spectrum and significance of Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) mutations in breast cancer predisposition genes is poorly defined in the Indian population.
METHODS: All new female breast cancer patients from 1 March 2019 to 28 February 2020 were screened. Those providing informed consent and without previous genetic testing were recruited. Multigene panel testing (107 genes) by next-generation sequencing was performed for all patients. Descriptive statistics was used to describe the spectrum of VUS mutations.
RESULTS: Out of 236 patients recruited in the study, a VUS was detected in 89 patients (37.71%). VUS pathogenic ratio was 2.02. A total of 121 different VUS mutations in 40 different genes were detected. Fourteen patients (15.7%) had a VUS in high penetrance genes and 36 VUS mutations (29.8%) were detected in one of the genes involved in homologous recombination repair pathway. No therapeutic interventions were done based on VUS.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective study of genetic determinants of breast cancer from India, a high prevalence of VUS (37.71%) was detected with 15.7% patients having a VUS in high penetrance genes. More evidence needs to be generated from larger multicentric studies to better understand the implications of these genetic variants and enable their reclassification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The burden of hereditary breast cancer in India is not well defined. Moreover, genetic testing criteria (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] and Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics [MCG] Plus) have never been validated in the Indian population.
METHODS: All new female breast cancer patients from 1st March 2019 to 28th February 2020 were screened. Those providing informed consent and without previous genetic testing were recruited. Multigene panel testing (107 genes) by next-generation sequencing was performed for all patients. The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations between patients qualifying and not qualifying the testing criteria was compared and their sensitivity was computed.
RESULTS: Overall, 275 breast cancer patients were screened and 236 patients were included (median age 45 years); 30 patients did not consent and 9 patients previously underwent genetic testing. Thirty-four (14%) women had a positive family history and 35% had triple-negative breast cancer. P/LP mutations were found in 44/236 (18.64%) women; mutations in BRCA1 (22/47, 46.8%) and BRCA2 (9/47, 19.1%) were the most common, with 34% of mutations present in non-BRCA genes. Patients qualifying the testing criteria had a higher risk of having a P/LP mutation (NCCN: 23.6% vs. 7.04%, p = 0.03; MCG plus: 24.8% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.01). The sensitivity of the NCCN criteria was 88.6% (75.4-96.2) and 86.36% (72.65-94.83) for MCG plus. More than 95% sensitivity was achieved if all women up to 60 years of age were tested. Cascade testing was performed in 31 previous (16/44 families), with 23 testing positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of P/LP mutations in India is high, with significant contribution of non-BRCA genes. Testing criteria need modification to expand access to testing.

AB  - Osteosarcoma (OGS) is the most common primary bone tumor in children and adolescents which requires a multidisciplinary approach to management. Although chemotherapy and surgery can cure more than half of localized OGS cases, the unique challenges faced by resource-limited countries like India make this outcome difficult to achieve. Various questions in the management of OGS including role of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) in neoadjuvant setting, triplet vs doublet chemotherapy, intensification of chemotherapy based on response in setting of doublet, and indigenous prosthesis in setting of limb salvage need to be defined. Similarly, in the metastatic and recurrent setting, questions regarding intent of treatment, indications of chemotherapy, timing of surgery, and role of targeted therapies need clarification. Lack of randomized trials from India makes definite conclusions difficult, but an attempt can be made to define the best approach in the Indian scenario from available evidence. Hence, a critical review of literature from India and the West was done to define possible management approaches and highlight the lacuna for future research.

T2  - Indian Journal of Orthopaedics
AB  - PURPOSE: The Judet's technique of quadricepsplasty for an extension contracture of the knee joint offers the benefit of a sequential and controlled release of the intrinsic and extrinsic soft tissue constituents restricting the knee flexion. The main principle of our study was to analyze the clinical as well as functional outcome and to assess an extension lag following Judet's quadricepsplasty for the knee extension contracture deformity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study comprises of thirty three patients, operated for extension contracture with Judet's quadricepsplasty with the mean follow-up was 30 months. Knee range of motion of the operated knee was recorded preoperatively and at 6, 12 and 24 month follow-up after the surgery. Judet's criteria were used to evaluate the outcomes following the procedure.
RESULTS: 92.42° (range, 60°-110°) of knee flexion was achieved after an average follow-up of 24 months compared to preoperative knee flexion was 14.09° (range 5°-25°), reflecting a 74.69° average improvement in knee flexion. Twelve patients had excellent results, nineteen had good results as per Judet's criteria but there were no patients with extension lag. The two patients with fair results had superficial wound infection which healed without any further surgical intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Judet's quadricepsplasty offers sequential release without extension lag of the knee joint. Patients with the knee extension contractures deformity can be successfully managed with the Judet's quadricepsplasty to gain useful knee motion and function.

TI  - Open wedge osteotomy of medial tibial condyle gives good results in management of neglected diagonal lesions of proximal tibia
AU  - Mittal, Ravi
AU  - Jain, Sidddharth
AU  - Gamanagatti, Shivanand
T2  - Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressed fractures of anteromedial tibial plateau are often underappreciated and treated inadequately. When these fractures are accompanied by injuries of posterior cruciate ligament and postero-lateral corner, they are called as diagonal lesions. There are very few publications on the management of such injuries in chronic stage. The purpose of our study is to describe our results in management of these neglected fractures using open wedge osteotomy of medial tibial condyle (OWOMTC).
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of ten patients. KOOS score and Tegner and Lysholm score were recorded preoperatively and at three, six, twelve and twenty four months after surgery to assess the functional outcome. Medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA) and tibial slope were recorded before and after surgery.
RESULTS: All cases had posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries. There was no anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. MPTA was corrected from mean 76.2° ± 3.7° to mean 86.4° ± 3.2°. Mean tibial slope was increased from -4° ± 3° to mean tibial slope of 7.6° ± 2.2°.Tegner and Lyshom score improved from mean of 38-88 (p < .05) at final follow-up. KOOS score improved from mean of 32-86 (p < .05) at final follow-up. Union was achieved in all the cases. None of the cases required ligament reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that OWOMTC is a useful method to manage neglected depressed fractures of anteromedial tibial plateau accompanied by PCL and PLC injury (diagonal injury). This procedure can restore limb alignment, congruency and stability of knee joint without any soft tissue reconstruction and change in the patellofemoral kinematics.

AB  - Cardiac sympathetic denervation (CSD) is a useful therapeutic option for patients with ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) refractory to anti-arrhythmic agents and/or catheter ablation. However, the experience is mostly limited to non-structural heart disease in paediatric patients. The advent of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with its reduced morbidity has encouraged the use of VATS CSD in patients with structural heart disease. In this series, we report the surgical and cardiac outcomes of VATS-guided CSD in four patients who presented with electrical storm in the setting of different structural cardiomyopathies. Four patients underwent VATS-guided CSD at our centre during the period 2019-2021 after failure of conventional medical and/or ablative treatment for the management of refractory VAs. All four patients presented with electrical storm with different cardiomyopathies including ischaemic (post-acute myocardial infarction) and non-ischaemic aetiologies (sarcoidosis, non-specific right ventricular cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy). A combined total of 349 implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) shocks were registered in the 4 weeks preceding the procedure with mean shocks of 87 per patient. All four patients successfully underwent CSD through the VATS approach with no operative mortality or any major surgical morbidity. All patients had resolution of electrical storms with 75% of patients remaining free of ICD shocks at a mean follow-up of 14.87 months. One patient who remained free of ICD shocks and recurrent VAs died at 23 months after the procedure due to progressive heart failure and complications. VATS CSD is a safe and effective complementary therapeutic modality in patients with life-threatening refractory VAs and electrical storms irrespective of the underlying substrate.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the functional, neurological, and radiological outcomes after anterior surgery in thoracolumbar burst fractures.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary care hospital.
PATIENTS: Thirty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2).
INTERVENTION: Anterior decompression, anterior column reconstruction with mesh cage, and instrumented stabilization.
OUTCOME: Functional (Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure), neurological (ASIA Impairment Scale), and radiological (kyphosis, anterior vertebral height loss, canal encroachment %) parameters.
RESULTS: Patients were prospectively followed for a mean duration of 5.9 ± 3.2 years (2.4-10 years). Statistically significant improvement was noted in functional outcomes from preop values (P-value < 0.001). 29 patients (80.5%) had improvement in neurology after surgery at the final follow-up with a positive correlation with % change in canal encroachment (r = 0.64, P -0.018). The mean preoperative kyphosis of 29.1 ± 11.9 degrees got corrected to 9.4 ± 3.8 degrees in immediate postop and 15.7 ± 11.8 at the final follow-up(P < 0.001). Preoperative mean canal encroachment of 58.5 ± 15.7% was reduced to 6.5 ± 3.2% postoperatively (P < 0.001). Two patients developed neurological complications (subacute progressive ascending myelopathy), and 5 patients developed pulmonary complications. No pseudarthrosis, implant loosening, or cage migration was noted in any patient.
CONCLUSION: Anterior surgery performed in 36 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in our study showed good outcomes. 80.5% of patients improved in neurology after surgery by at least one ASIA Impairment Scale grade. There was statistically significant improvement noted in radiological outcome (Kyphosis and Canal encroachment %) and functional outcome (Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure score) after surgery in immediate postop and at the final follow-up. Only 13.8% of patients developed pulmonary complications that were managed successfully with chest drain.

AB  - A 15-month-old child was brought to the ophthalmology outpatient department with his parents complaining of a large mass located on the nasal side of his right eye since birth. On examination, an irregular mass was seen to be located on the nasal side of his right orbit, obscuring the visual axis. On a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, a heterogenous lesion was seen to be located on the bridge of the nose and the medial aspect of the right orbit without any bony defect or communication with the brain or sinuses. In view of the possibility of developing amblyopia, the lesion was surgically removed. On histopathological examination, a diagnosis of extranasal glial heterotopia was made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest extranasal glial heterotopia in the orbit to be ever reported.

AB  - Organisational competitive procurement environment positively impacts prices while supply side factors also determine participation in bidding. With strong competition costs come down. Instances of low competition in equipment purchase in the apex tertiary care hospital led to this study aimed at determining procurement practices, competition in procurement and its determinants. Review of tender records for three financial years (2011-2014) was conducted to ascertain procurement practices and resulting competition. Sellers' perspective on factors determining participation was captured through a questionnaire. Although four bids per tender were received only two qualified technically emphasising need for broad based specifications. Both sellers and peer staff also feel that specifications are not broad based. Regression analysis showed that one unit increase in bid led to six per cent price reduction. Increase in number of equipment led to an increase in the number of bids received but no price decrease. Pre-bid meetings have no effect on the price offered. Quality of tender document and feasible demonstration are modifiable bidding factors. Procuring agencies need to be transparent to reflect an organisationally supported competitive environment. The future research directions are interventional studies on specifications, pre-bid meetings and increasing transparency.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is an unmet need for a more effective thrombolytic agent in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) management. Various studies and meta-analysis suggest tenecteplase (TNK) as non-inferior over alteplase (rTPA). The present single-center study compares biosimilar TNK and rTPA in a tertiary care setting.
METHODS: Data of patients who presented with AIS and underwent intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) were recruited retrospectively from January 2018 to July 2021. Primary efficacy outcome was a modified Rankin score (mRS) at 90 days dichotomized at < = 2. Qualitative and quantitative variables were assessed using Chi-square test and Student's t-test, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 160 patients, 103 in the rTPA and 57 in TNK group, were analyzed. The baseline characteristics were well matched apart from hypertension. Large artery atherosclerosis was the most frequent subtype of stroke among the two groups. Good functional outcome was seen in 47.92% of patients TNK and 64.77% of patients in rTPA group (p = 0.069). No difference was seen in the rates of any ICH (p = 0.29) and mortality at 3 months (p = 0.32) among the two groups.
CONCLUSION: This present study observed no difference in the efficacy and safety between biosimilar TNK and rTPA. Our findings are in concordance with published trials showing equivalence between the two molecules.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug which has in-vitro efficacy in reducing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load. Hence, Ivermectin is under investigation as a repurposed agent for treating COVID-19.
METHODS: In this pilot, double blind, randomized controlled trial, hospitalized patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 were assigned to a single oral administration of an elixir formulation of Ivermectin at either 24 mg or 12 mg dose, or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The co-primary outcomes were conversion of RT-PCR to negative result and the decline of viral load at day 5 of enrolment. Safety outcomes included total and serious adverse events. The primary outcomes were assessed in patients who had positive RT-PCR at enrolment (modified intention-to-treat population). Safety outcomes were assessed in all patients who received the intervention (intention-to-treat population).
RESULTS: Among the 157 patients randomized, 125 were included in modified intention-to-treat analysis. 40 patients each were assigned to Ivermectin 24 mg and 12 mg, and 45 patients to placebo. The RT-PCR negativity at day 5 was higher in the two Ivermectin arms but failed to attain statistical significance (Ivermectin 24 mg, 47.5%; 12 mg arm, 35.0%; and placebo arm, 31.1%; p-value = 0.30). The decline of viral load at day 5 was similar in each arm. No serious adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mild and moderate COVID-19, a single oral administration of Ivermectin did not significantly increase either the negativity of RT-PCR or decline in viral load at day 5 of enrolment compared with placebo.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the use of telemedicine to maintain continuity of care for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a nurse-led teleconsultation strategy for CVD management during the COVID-19 pandemic in India and evaluated the impact of nurse-led teleconsultations on patient treatment satisfaction.
DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a two-stage teleconsultation strategy and tested the feasibility of implementing a nurse-led teleconsultation strategy to manage CVD in a northern state (Punjab) in India. A multidisciplinary team of experts developed the treatment protocol used for teleconsultations to manage CVD. Nurses were trained to provide teleconsultation, triaging of patients and referrals to the physicians. Patients with CVD who had an outpatient visit or hospitalisation between September 2019 and March 2020 at the Dayanand Medical College Hospital, Ludhiana, India, were contacted by phone and offered teleconsultations. Telemedicine strategy comprised: stage 1 nurse-led teleconsultations and stage 2 physician-led teleconsultations. Descriptive analysis was performed to report the proportion of patients triaged by the two-stage telemedicine strategy, and patient's clinical characteristics, and treatment satisfaction between the nurse-led versus physician-led teleconsultations.
RESULTS: Overall, nurse-led stage 1 teleconsultations were provided to 12 042 patients with CVD. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 58.9 years (12.8), and men were 65.4%. A relatively small proportion of patients (6.3%) were referred for the stage-2 physician-led teleconsultations and of these only 8.4% required hospitalisations. During stage 1 nurse-led teleconsultations, patients were referred to the physicians due to uncontrolled diabetes (24.9%), uncontrolled hypertension (18.7%) and congestive heart failure (16.2%). The patient's treatment satisfaction was similar between the nurse-led versus physician-led teleconsultations (p=0.07).
CONCLUSION: This study showed that a nurse-led telemedicine strategy is feasible to implement in a resource-constraint setting for triaging patients with CVD and reduces physician's burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: India contributes 15% of the total global maternal mortality burden. An increasing proportion of these deaths are due to Pregnancy Induced Hypertension (PIH), Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), and anaemia. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a tablet-based electronic decision-support system (EDSS) to enhance routine antenatal care (ANC) and improve the screening and management of PIH, GDM, and anaemia in pregnancy in primary healthcare facilities of Telangana, India. The EDSS will work at two levels of primary health facilities and is customized for three cadres of healthcare providers - Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes (ANMs), staff nurses, and physicians (Medical Officers).
METHODS: This will be a cluster randomized controlled trial involving 66 clusters with a total of 1320 women in both the intervention and control arms. Each cluster will include three health facilities-one Primary Health Centre (PHC) and two linked sub-centers (SC). In the facilities under the intervention arm, ANMs, staff nurses, and Medical Officers will use the EDSS while providing ANC for all pregnant women. Facilities in the control arm will continue to provide ANC services using the existing standard of care in Telangana. The primary outcome is ANC quality, measured as provision of a composite of four selected ANC components (measurement of blood pressure, blood glucose, hemoglobin levels, and conducting a urinary dipstick test) by the healthcare providers per visit, observed over two visits. Trained field research staff will collect outcome data via an observation checklist.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first trial in India to evaluate an EDSS, targeted to enhance the quality of ANC and improve the screening and management of PIH, GDM, and anaemia, for multiple levels of health facilities and several cadres of healthcare providers. If effective, insights from the trial on the feasibility and cost of implementing the EDSS can inform potential national scale-up. Lessons learned from this trial will also inform recommendations for designing and upscaling similar mHealth interventions in other low and middle-income countries.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate mitochondrial genome alterations, cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity, and oxidative stress in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).
METHODOLOGY: Whole mitochondrial genome was screened in 75 POAG cases and 105 controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing. COX activity was measured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A protein modeling study was done to evaluate the impact of G222E variant on protein function. Levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), 8-isoprostane (8-IP), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were also measured.
RESULTS: A total of 156 and 79 mitochondrial nucleotide variations were found in the cohort of 75 POAG patients and 105 controls, respectively. Ninety-four (60.26%) variations spanned the coding region, and 62 (39.74%) variations spanned noncoding regions (D-loop, 12SrRNA, and 16SrRNA) of mitochondrial genome in POAG patients. Out of 94 nucleotide changes in coding region, 68 (72.34%) were synonymous changes, 23 (24.46%) non-synonymous, and three (3.19%) were found in the region coding for transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). Three changes (p.E192K in ND1, p.L128Q in ND2, and p.G222E in COX2) were found to be pathogenic. Twenty-four (32.0%) patients were positive for either of these pathogenic mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) nucleotide changes. Majority of cases (18.7%) had pathogenic mutation in COX2 gene. Patients who harbored pathogenic mtDNA change in COX2 gene had significantly lower levels of COX activity (p < 0.0001) and TAC (p = 0.004), and higher levels of 8-IP (p = 0.01) as compared to patients who did not harbor this mtDNA. G222E changed the electrostatic potential and adversely impacted protein function of COX2 by affecting nonpolar interactions with neighboring subunits.
CONCLUSION: Pathogenic mtDNA mutations were present in POAG patients, which were associated with reduced COX activity and increased levels of oxidative stress.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: POAG patients should be evaluated for mitochondrial mutations and oxidative stress and may be managed accordingly with antioxidant therapies.

AB  - Background. Neuroendocrine differentiation in the prostate gland ranges from clinically insignificant neuroendocrine differentiation detected with markers in an otherwise conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma to a lethal high-grade small/large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The concept of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostatic adenocarcinoma has gained considerable importance due to its prognostic and therapeutic ramifications and pathologists play a pivotal role in its recognition. However, its awareness, reporting, and resource utilization practice patterns among pathologists are largely unknown. Methods. Representative examples of different spectrums of neuroendocrine differentiation along with a detailed questionnaire were shared among 39 urologic pathologists using the survey monkey software. Participants were specifically questioned about the use and awareness of the 2016 WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, understanding of the clinical significance of each entity, and use of different immunohistochemical (IHC) markers. De-identified respondent data were analyzed. Results. A vast majority (90%) of the participants utilize IHC markers to confirm the diagnosis of small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. A majority (87%) of the respondents were in agreement regarding the utilization of type of IHC markers for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma for which 85% of the pathologists agreed that determination of the site of origin of a high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma is not critical, as these are treated similarly. In the setting of mixed carcinomas, 62% of respondents indicated that they provide quantification and grading of the acinar component. There were varied responses regarding the prognostic implication of focal neuroendocrine cells in an otherwise conventional acinar adenocarcinoma and for Paneth cell-like differentiation. The classification of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma was highly varied, with only 38% agreement in the illustrated case. Finally, despite the recommendation not to perform neuroendocrine markers in the absence of morphologic evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation, 62% would routinely utilize IHC in the work-up of a Gleason score 5 + 5 = 10 acinar adenocarcinoma and its differentiation from high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. Conclusion. There is a disparity in the practice utilization patterns among the urologic pathologists with regard to diagnosing high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma and in understanding the clinical significance of focal neuroendocrine cells in an otherwise conventional acinar adenocarcinoma and Paneth cell-like neuroendocrine differentiation. There seems to have a trend towards overutilization of IHC to determine neuroendocrine differentiation in the absence of neuroendocrine features on morphology. The survey results suggest a need for further refinement and development of standardized guidelines for the classification and reporting of neuroendocrine differentiation in the prostate gland.

AB  - Almost half of the patients with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) are refractory to primary induction chemotherapy or undergo reactivation. The ideal treatment modality for refractory/relapsed LCH is yet not evidenced. This review aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of vemurafenib (a BRAF pathway inhibitor) in LCH, particularly the refractory/relapsed cases. The literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, and abstracts published in the SIOP meetings. Studies that described the outcome of patients of LCH being treated with vemurafenib, alone or in combination, were included. A total of 416 studies were screened, and after applying exclusion criteria, 22 studies (n = 107) were included in the final analysis. The first-line therapy was prednisolone plus vinblastine for most patients (n = 92, 86%), and vemurafenib was started upfront in 3 patients (3%). The median time to first clinical response with vemurafenib was one week. The median time to best response was 5.25 months. Out of 107 patients, 62 patients (58%) had ultimately no active disease (NAD) while 39 (36%) had active disease better (ADB), making the overall response rate (ORR) of 101/107, ie, 94.4% (CI 0.88; 0.98). The main adverse effects of vemurafenib were rash or photosensitivity (47%) and other cutaneous adverse events (15%). Vemurafenib is highly efficacious and safe in the treatment of refractory LCH; however, the timing of its commencement and duration of therapy is yet to be established. Larger prospective collaborative trials are needed to answer the appropriate treatment duration and effective maintenance therapy approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indiscriminate and widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in emergence of many antibiotic-resistant organisms. Antibiotic administration during pregnancy is mostly avoided, unless there is compelling medical condition. We hypothesized that the uropathogens isolated from pregnant women would be more susceptible to antibiotics compared to those isolated from nonpregnant women, thus will be helpful in formulating separate empiric guideline for pregnant women based on the resistance pattern.
METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 2 years in which females with the clinical diagnosis of either cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy were included from the community settings. Uropathogen species and their antimicrobial resistance pattern were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. After accounting for centre-to-centre variation and adjusting for age and socio-economic status, the adjusted odds ratio for antibiotic resistance was calculated and compared between pregnant and nonpregnant women using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 1758 women (pregnant: 43.3%; nonpregnant: 56.6%) were screened in the study over a period of 2 years, out of which 9.3% (163/1758) were having significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two commonest uropathogen in both the groups; their prevalence being 83.6% in pregnant women and 85.2% in nonpregnant women, respectively. Resistance against ampicillin, cefixime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were found significantly lower in the pregnant women compared to nonpregnant. After adjusting the age and socio-economic status accounting for centre-to-centre variation, the odds of resistance for cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and co-trimoxazole were found lower and statistically significant among the pregnant women group.
CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial resistance was significantly higher among the community-dwelling nonpregnant women compared to pregnant women in case of few antibiotics. The study highlighted the need of building local antibiogram that could help to initiate the empirical treatment and thus prevent emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in improving muscle mass in cirrhosis is presently debatable.
AIMS: To evaluate the role of BCAA in improving muscle mass in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with Child-Pugh score < 10 and sarcopenia were randomized to receive either 12 g/day of BCAA orally or a placebo (1:1) for 6 months in addition to a home-based exercise program (30 min/day), dietary counselling and standard medical therapy. Sarcopenia was defined according to gender-specific axial skeletal muscle index (SMI) cut-offs. The primary endpoint was a change in muscle mass based on CT scan (SMI) after 6 months of supplementation.
RESULTS: Sixty patients [mean age 41.6 ± 9.9 years; males (66.6%) of predominantly viral (40%) and alcohol-related (31.7%) cirrhosis] were randomized. Baseline clinical and demographic characters were similar except MELD score (10.2 ± 2.8 vs. 12.2 ± 3.5, p = 0.02) and calorie intake (1838.1 kcal ± 631.5 vs. 2217.5 kcal ± 707.3, p = 0.03), both being higher in the placebo arm. After adjusting for both baseline confounders, baseline SMI and protein intake, the change in SMI at 6 months was similar in both groups [mean adjusted difference (MAD) + 0.84, CI - 2.9; + 1.2, p = 0.42] by intention-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes including change in handgrip strength (p = 0.65), 6-m gait speed (p = 0.20), 6-min walk distance (p = 0.39) were similar in both arms. Four patients had minor adverse events in each arm.
CONCLUSION: Addition of BCAA to exercise, dietary counselling and standard medical therapy did not improve muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. (CTRI/2019/05/019269).

AB  - We plan to evaluate the various variables associated with the complications of thyroidectomy performed at our department in the last 5 years. Medical records of the patients who underwent thyroidectomy during 2014-2018 were collected. Complications of hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy were analysed in terms of the demography, cytopathology and the extent of surgery. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, Fisher exact test and chi square test were applied to look for any significant associations. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. 123 patients were analysed (87 females, 38 males). Mean age was 38.3 years (range 11-71 years). Most common cytopathology was papillary carcinoma thyroid (Bethesda VI) - 43/123 (35%). 107 of these 123 patients underwent primary surgery, 10 underwent revision surgery while 6 underwent completion thyroidectomy. Seven patients incurred RLN palsy out of which 3 were temporary. RLN palsy was seen in only malignant cases (p < 0.05). Incidence was higher in T4a stage (p < 0.05). However, it had no association with a simultaneous central or lateral neck dissection. Hypocalcemia was seen in 22 patients (17.8%), out of whom 9 patients developed permanent hypocalcemia. It was seen significantly higher in patients undergoing central neck dissection (p < 0.05) and in malignant thyroid lesions (p < 0.05). Gender, age and the cytopathology had no bearing on RLN palsy and hypoparathyroidism. Malignant thyroid lesions had a significantly higher incidence of RLN palsy and hypoparathyroidism. A thorough anatomical knowledge can reduce the incidence of these complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of childhood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and brain is the preferred imaging modality to diagnose and define extent of disease as well as to assess response to therapy. Sometimes, it may be difficult to differentiate the presence of active residual disease from therapy-related changes based on posttreatment completion MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: RB patients who completed treatment between January 2017 and October 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. We evaluated the utility of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) to predict active disease in RB patients who continued to have residual disease on MRI at completion of treatment.
RESULTS: Out of the 89 patients who completed treatment, dilemma regarding remission status was present in 11 children. All 11 patients underwent FDG-PET-CT. None of them had evidence of metabolically active disease in the orbit, optic nerve, brain, or rest of the body. After a median follow-up of 24 months, no children developed any evidence of disease progression in the form of local or distant relapse.
CONCLUSION: Our results showed that in MRI doubtful cases, a nonavid FDG-PET is reassuring in avoiding further therapy as long as close follow-up can be ensured. FDG-PET-CT may emerge as a useful functional modality to predict disease activity in RB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of olanzapine in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, patients aged 3 to 18 years were randomly assigned to either the olanzapine group or the placebo group. All patients received intravenous ondansetron and dexamethasone 30 minutes before highly emetogenic chemotherapy, followed by oral ondansetron for 48 hours. Participants in the olanzapine group received olanzapine once daily on days 1 and 2, while those in the control group received a placebo in the same dosage and schedule. The primary objective was: (a) to compare the complete control rates of vomiting in the delayed phase and (b) to compare the complete control rates of vomiting in acute and overall phases. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of olanzapine and the need for rescue medications.
RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were randomly assigned either to the olanzapine group (n=63) or the control group (n=65). Complete control of vomiting between olanzapine and placebo group was 73% versus 48% ( P =0.005) in the delayed phase, 60% versus 54% ( P =0.46) in the acute phase, and 48% versus 34% ( P =0.117) in the overall phase, respectively. Grades 1 and 2 sedation was greater in the olanzapine group (46% vs. 14%; P <0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the placebo group required rescue medications for vomiting compared with in the olanzapine group ( P =0.025).
CONCLUSIONS: Olanzapine significantly improved complete control of vomiting in the delayed phase. A considerably lesser proportion of patients in the olanzapine group needed rescue medications.

AB  - Primary endobronchial presentation of anaplastic large cell lymphoma is rare in the paediatric age group. We present a 12-year-old boy with breathlessness, fever, cough and weight loss, who was misdiagnosed as a case of tuberculosis and started on antitubercular therapy, which showed no improvement. Chest X-ray showed a completely opacified left hemithorax and chest computed tomography revealed a mass encircling the left main bronchus with collapse- consolidation of the left lung. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy revealed a growth in the left main bronchus. Subsequently, fine-needle aspiration cytology and biopsy from the mass confirmed it to be a malignancy consistent with anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Metastatic work-up revealed no other sites of involvement. Chemotherapy resulted in rapid and complete regression of the tumour. No evidence of local or distant recurrence was reported after 18 months of follow-up. Clinicians and pathologists should be aware of this presentation as prompt diagnosis and treatment can give promising results. This case highlights the importance of timely tissue diagnosis in patients with non-resolving pyrexia and organ lesions on imaging.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In India about 95% of individuals who need treatment for common mental disorders like depression, stress and anxiety and substance use are unable to access care. Stigma associated with help seeking and lack of trained mental health professionals are important barriers in accessing mental healthcare. Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health integrates a community-level stigma reduction campaign and task sharing with the help of a mobile-enabled electronic decision support system (EDSS)-to reduce psychiatric morbidity due to stress, depression and self-harm in high-risk individuals. This paper presents and discusses the protocol for process evaluation of SMART Mental Health.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The process evaluation will use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate implementation fidelity and identify facilitators of and barriers to implementation of the intervention. Case studies of six intervention and two control clusters will be used. Quantitative data sources will include usage analytics extracted from the mHealth platform for the trial. Qualitative data sources will include focus group discussions and interviews with recruited participants, primary health centre doctors, community health workers (Accredited Social Health Activits) who participated in the project and local community leaders. The design and analysis will be guided by Medical Research Council framework for process evaluations, the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, and the normalisation process theory.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the ethics committee of the George Institute for Global Health, India and the Institutional Ethics Committee, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Findings of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, stakeholder meetings, digital and social media platforms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children below 5 years of age.
METHODS: This multisite prospective observational study was carried out in the Pediatrics' out-patient departments of 5 medical colleges across India with an objective to assess the feasibility of establishing Acute Respiratory Infection Treatment Unit (ATU) in urban medical college hospitals. ATU (staffed with a nurse and a medical officer) was established in the out-patient areas at study sites. Children, aged 2-59 months, with cough and/ breathing difficulty for < 14 days were screened by study nurse in the ATU for pneumonia, severe pneumonia or no pneumonia. Diagnosis was verified by study doctor. Children were managed as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The key outcomes were successful establishment of ATUs, antibiotic usage, treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: ATUs were successfully established at the 5 study sites. Of 18,159 under-five children screened, 7026 (39%) children were assessed to have ARI. Using the WHO criteria, 938 were diagnosed as pneumonia (13.4%) and of these, 347 (36.9%) had severe pneumonia. Ambulatory home-based management was done in 6341 (90%) children with ARI; of these, 16 (0.25%) required admission because of non-response or deterioration on follow-up. Case-fatality rate in severe pneumonia was 2%. Nearly 12% of children with 'no pneumonia' received antibiotics.
CONCLUSIONS: Setting up of ATUs dedicated to management of ARI in children was feasible in urban medical colleges. The observed case fatality, and rate of unnecessary use of antibiotics were lower than that reported in literature.

AB  - We present a case of a 45-year-old man with atypical chest pain who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography which incidentally revealed a conglomerate of nondilated tortuous vessels along the inferior half of the surface of the pulmonary trunk, resulting in a "ground-cherry" like ridged appearance. Tracing these vessels proximally and distally revealed it to be arising from the sinoatrial nodal branch of the right coronary artery and distally draining into the left anterolateral aspect of the pulmonary trunk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used indiscriminately as constituents in consumer products including food processing, and packaging, cosmetics, personal care and household items. Although, few studies have assessed the risk of breast cancer on exposure to phthalates, their association with breast cancer risk in Indian women have not yet been evaluated.
METHODS: We conducted a case-control study involving 171 participants. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate dieters; DMP (Dimethyl phthalate), DEP (Diethyl phthalate), DBP (Dibutyl phthalate), BBP (benzyl butyl phthalate), DEHP (Di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate), DINOP (Di-n-octyl phthalate) were estimated by GC-MS and geometric means were calculated. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess breast cancer risk on exposure to phthalates. Genes responsive to phthalates were identified through literature search and matched with NGS data, and gene-enrichment analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Significant associations were observed between urinary phthalate concentrations and increased risk of breast cancer for di-butyl phthalate (OR=1.5, 95% CI; 1.06, 2.11, p = 0.002) and di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate (>median vs ≤ median; OR=2.97, 95% CI; 1.18, 7.47, p = 0.005) in multivariable analyses. We also found several phthalate-responsive gene mutations in paired breast tumor tissues, which include PTPRD (76.19%), AR (42.86%), CYP1A1 (42.86%), CYP19A1 (23.81%), AHRR (19.05%), PIK3CA (19.05%), CYP1B1 (9.52%), RB1 (9.52%) and MMP9 (9.52%). Gene-enrichment analysis revealed that these genes form a major part of ER/PR, PPAR and HIF-1α-TGF-β signaling cascades involved in breast cancer CONCLUSION: Although the sample size is small, in this first case-control study from India, DBP and DEHP were found to be associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer and tumor tissues revealed mutations in several phthalate-responsive genes. It is, therefore suggested that human biomonitoring in India and larger studies evaluating the early life genetic and epigenetic alterations on phthalates exposure are required to establish their role in breast carcinogenesis.

AB  - The overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been associated with various human diseases. ROS exert a multitude of biological effects with both physiological and pathological consequences. Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a sodium salt of the natural amino acid glutamate, is a flavor-enhancing food additive, which is widely used in Asian cuisine and is an ingredient that brings out the "umami" meat flavor. MSG consumption in rats is associated with ROS generation. Owing to its consumption as part of the fast-food culture and concerns about its possible effects on pregnancy, we aimed to study the impact of MSG on placental trophoblast cells. MSG exposure influenced trophoblast invasion and differentiation, two of the most critical functions during placentation through enhanced production of ROS. Similar findings were also observed on MSG-treated placental explants, as confirmed by elevated Nrf2 levels. Ultrastructural studies revealed signs of subcellular injury by MSG exposure. Mechanistically, MSG-induced oxidative stress with endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways involving Xbp1s and IRE1α was observed. The effect of MSG through an increased ROS production indicates that its long-term exposure might have adverse health effect by compromising key trophoblast functions.

AB  - Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are one of the commonest maladies, affecting 5%-10% of pregnancies worldwide. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) identifies four categories of HDP, namely gestational hypertension (GH), Preeclampsia (PE), chronic hypertension (CH), and CH with superimposed PE. PE is a multisystem, heterogeneous disorder that encompasses 2%-8% of all pregnancy-related complications, contributing to about 9% to 26% of maternal deaths in low-income countries and 16% in high-income countries. These translate to 50 000 maternal deaths and over 500 000 fetal deaths worldwide, therefore demanding high priority in understanding clinical presentation, screening, diagnostic criteria, and effective management. PE is accompanied by uteroplacental insufficiency leading to vascular and metabolic changes, vasoconstriction, and end-organ ischemia. PE is diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women who were previously normotensive or hypertensive. Besides shallow trophoblast invasion and inadequate remodeling of uterine arteries, dysregulation of the nonimmune system has been the focal point in PE. This results from aberrant immune system activation and imbalanced differentiation of T cells. Further, a failure of tolerance toward the semi-allogenic fetus results due to altered distribution of Tregs such as CD4+FoxP3+ or CD4+CD25+CD127(low) FoxP3+ cells, thereby creating a cytotoxic environment by suboptimal production of immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13. Also, intracellular production of complement protein C5a may result in decreased FoxP3+ regulatory T cells. With immune system dysfunction as a major driver in PE pathogenesis, it is logical that therapeutic targeting of components of the immune system with pharmacologic agents like anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating molecules are either being used or under clinical trial. Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors like Pravastatin may improve placental perfusion in PE, while Eculizumab (monoclonal antibody inhibiting C5) and small molecular inhibitor of C5a, Zilucoplan are under investigation. Monoclonal antibody against IL-17(Secukinumab) has been proposed to alter the Th imbalance in PE. Autologous Treg therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-CTLA-4 are emerging as new candidates in immune horizons for PE management in the future.

AB  - A 34-year-old male visited our hospital with complaints of recurrent episodes of altered behavior since past 6 months along with difficulty in walking since past 3 months. He was diagnosed of chronic liver disease in the past. Examination revealed spasticity and brisk deep tendon reflexes in both the lower limbs. His blood investigations and spinal cord imaging was normal. Based on his clinical features, a possibility of portosystemic shunting leading to portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE) and shunt myelopathy was suspected. A computed tomography portography showed a recanalized paraumblical vein draining portal blood into external iliac veins. Patient underwent shunt occlusion (Figure- 2). One month after the procedure, while there was no recurrence of symptoms of PSE, those of myelopathy remained unchanged. Shunt myelopathy is a rare complication of spontaneous or iatrogenic portosystemic shunts. Unlike PSE, the management of shunt myelopathy is uncertain due to limited evidence. Limited evidence suggests reversal of myelopathy after early shunt occlusion, highlighting the irreversible changes that may set in spinal cord due to delayed diagnosis. Our case highlights an important but a rare complication of portosystemic shunting in chronic liver disease which should be kept in mind if these patients develop symptoms attributable to spinal cord disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dystrophic cervical kyphosis secondary to neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is rarely reported. The primary objective is to highlight the clinical presentation and surgical outcomes based on clinical and biomechanical parameters. The secondary objective is to highlight the early and late complications of these surgeries.
METHODS: The hospital records of six patients operated between 2008 and 2018 were retrospectively reviewed with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Besides demographics information, radiological findings and operative details, the outcome measures reported were neurological (MJOA score, Nurick scale), pain (VAS score) and operative complications.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 15.1 years (8-32 years). The average kyphotic vertebra involved-3.6 bodies (range 2-5 bodies) with four patients showing intraspinal anomaly-neurofibromas, dural ectasia. Clinically, patients improved postoperatively with-VAS (pre vs. post-: 6.6 vs. 2.6, p - < 0.05), MJOA score (pre vs. post: 10.3 vs. 13.3, p - < 0.05), Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.5 vs. 2.1, p - < 0.05). There was significant deformity correction from 66.8° to 20.7° (p value < 0.031), mean T1 Slope (pre vs. post - 1.8 ± 20.4 to 0.6 ± 12.8, p value - < 0.43). Mean blood loss encountered was 1800 ± 434.6 cc; however, patients with paraspinal neurofibromas reported greater blood loss. Late complications included pseudoarthrosis (1), C5 palsy (1) and junctional kyphosis (1). Vertebral dysplasia and erosions continued in all patients post-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Antero-posterior approach provides circumferential decompression and better sagittal balance correction. Cervical spine must be screened in all NF-1 patients and followed up regularly to assess for dystrophic changes.

AB  - COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM) remains an underdiagnosed entity. Using a modified Delphi method, we have formulated a consensus statement for the diagnosis and management of CAPM. We selected 26 experts from various disciplines who are involved in managing CAPM. Three rounds of the Delphi process were held to reach consensus (≥70% agreement or disagreement) or dissensus. A consensus was achieved for 84 of the 89 statements. Pulmonary mucormycosis occurring within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis was labelled CAPM and classified further as proven, probable, and possible. We recommend flexible bronchoscopy to enable early diagnosis. The experts proposed definitions to categorise dual infections with aspergillosis and mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. We recommend liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg per day) and early surgery as central to the management of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. We recommend response assessment at 4-6 weeks using clinical and imaging parameters. Posaconazole or isavuconazole was recommended as maintenance therapy following initial response, but no consensus was reached for the duration of treatment. In patients with stable or progressive disease, the experts recommended salvage therapy with posaconazole or isavuconazole. CAPM is a rare but under-reported complication of COVID-19. Although we have proposed recommendations for defining, diagnosing, and managing CAPM, more extensive research is required.

TI  - Immunohistochemical features of cells in peripheral microcystoid retinal degeneration
AU  - Nag, Tapas C.
T2  - Acta Histochemica
AB  - Peripheral microcystoid retinal degeneration (PMD) is an age-related, benign condition in which the peripheral retina develops small holes and undergoes cystic degeneration. This paper demonstrates neuronal alterations in PMD, as studied by immunohistochemistry in postmortem donor eyes (age: 76-89 years; N = 6 donors). In all cases, the degeneration was located in the inferior temporal quadrant, creating holes in the far peripheral retina. There was thinning of the inner retinal layers and the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was patchy or inconspicuous. As a response, Müller cell processes showed increased vimentin immunoreactivity. None of the retinas examined expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. Cone photoreceptor cells were significantly altered: compared to the adjoining cones that were short, those located in the cystoid retina underwent significant elongation of their inner segments, evident from calbindin immunolabeling, to maintain synaptic contacts with the remnant OPL. The latter consisted of small photoreceptor terminals and scanty processes from shrunken bipolar cells. Besides, cones and ganglion cells undergo oxidative stress, they showed immunoreactivity to 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal and nitrotyrosine. The level of superoxide dismutase-2 was relatively low in the PMD region than in adjacent area, suggesting that the former suffers from oxidative stress.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate visual field changes in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness on optical coherence tomography.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, observational study, consecutive PCG children who underwent combined trabeculotomy with trabeculectomy and on regular follow-up were enrolled. All patients were aged over four years and co-operative for RNFL OCT and visual field examination. Perimetry was done on Humphrey visual field (HVF) analyzer using 30-2 and 10-2 SITA standard algorithms as appropriate. If a reliable automated perimetry was not feasible, kinetic perimetry was done. The following were noted at baseline and every follow-up: age, sex, visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), cup-disc ratio (CDR), corneal diameters, refraction, any topical antiglaucoma medications, surgeries underwent, age at surgery and duration between surgery and final examination.
RESULTS: Forty-eight eyes of 34 children operated for PCG and 19 eyes of 17 controls were analyzed. A statistically significant thinner average RNFL thickness of 87.2 ± 28 μm was noted in PCG eyes as compared to controls with 100.6 ± 7.2 μm (P = 0.04). The mean cup-disc area ratio on OCT in PCG eyes was 0.43 ± 0.2 (0.02-0.93) and in control eyes was 0.23 ± 0.07 (0.1-0.4) (P < 0.001). On RNFL OCT, there was significant focal RNFL loss in temporal superior (P = 0.003), nasal inferior (P = 0.037) and temporal inferior (P < 0.001) quadrants compared to controls. Among PCG eyes, 20/48 eyes (41.7%), had definitive, reproducible glaucomatous VF defects. Mean baseline IOP in PCG eyes with VF defect was 28.7 ± 5.7 mmHg and in eyes with normal VF was 24.6 ± 5.9 mmHg (P = 0.03). On univariate regression analysis, higher baseline IOP was significantly associated with both RNFL loss (odds ratio (OR): -2.17) and VF defects (OR: 3.35). Fluctuation in follow-up IOP (OR: 3.33) was also significantly associated with the presence of VF defects. On multivariable regression analysis maximum, IOP was significantly associated with RNFL loss and VF defects.
CONCLUSION: Peripapillary RNFL thickness could be used to identify PCG eyes having visual field loss and possibly poor visual function from PCG eyes without visual field defects. Baseline and follow-up IOP, significantly correlated with RNFL thickness in PCG eyes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipids play a central role in the virus life cycle and are a crucial target to develop antiviral therapeutics. Importantly, among the other lipoproteins, the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been widely studied for its role in not only cardiovascular but several infectious diseases as well. Studies have suggested a role of serum lipids and lipoproteins including HDL, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in several viral infections including COVID-19. This disease is currently a major public health problem and there is a need to explore the role of these host lipids/lipoproteins in virus pathogenesis.
METHODOLOGY: A total of 75 retrospective COVID-19 positive serum samples and 10 COVID-19 negative controls were studied for their lipid profiles including TC, HDL, LDL, and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and TG.
RESULTS: Systematic literature search on dyslipidemia status in India shows that low HDL is the most common dyslipidemia. In this cohort, 65% (49) of COVID-19 patients had severely low HDL levels whereas 35% (26) had moderately low HDL and none had normal HDL levels. On the other hand, ~ 96% of samples had normal TC (72) and LDL (72) levels. VLDL and TG levels were also variable. In the controls, 100% of samples had moderately low HDL but none severely low HDL levels.
CONCLUSION: HDL likely plays a crucial role in COVID-19 infection and outcomes. The causal relationships between HDL levels and COVID-19 need to be studied extensively for an understanding of disease pathogenesis and management.

AB  - Renal vascular injuries are more devastating than parenchymal injuries alone, thus account for higher injury grade and require prompt recognition. Revised AAST organ injury scale (OIS) for renal trauma has incorporated CT-diagnosed vascular injuries into renal injury grading which includes pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula, along with addition of some new descriptors of renovascular injury. Dual-phase contrast-enhanced CT (with both arterial and venous phase) can easily pick up renovascular injuries and is the modality of choice for imaging renovascular trauma. Radiologist should be well versed with the imaging findings of renovascular injuries so that accurate injury grading can be done and further management can be planned at the earliest.

AB  - Although caesarean delivery is a safe procedure, however, with rising numbers being performed every year globally, increasing number of complications are being encountered by clinicians and radiologists. These complications can be early, occurring over first few days to weeks, or late, which can present months to years later. Also, it must be kept in mind that the normal variations of physiological involution occurring in early postpartum period can mimic pathology in many cases. Clinical history, laboratory parameters, and radiological investigations go hand in hand in identifying acute complications at the earliest, enabling early initiation of treatment. Among radiological investigations, ultrasound is the first line investigation of choice, followed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in certain conditions which will be described and illustrated further in this article.

T2  - Emergency Radiology
AB  - Stridor is one of the most important signs of partial or complete upper airway obstruction. Subglottic hemangioma (SGH) is a well-recognized however infrequent cause of infantile stridor. It is a potentially life-threatening condition. Thus, early diagnosis and management are crucial. Diagnostic evaluation includes ultrasound, cross-sectional imaging such as contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, and tracheobronchoscopy. Ultrasound (US), although not a widely used modality for the diagnosis, provides good assessment of its presence, extent, and degree of subglottic airway narrowing. Moreover, color Doppler helps to establish the vascular nature of the lesion. There are many advantages of US over tracheobronchoscopy and CT in an emergency setting which include its easy availability, non-invasive nature, and can be done quickly as a bedside procedure, enabling early initiation of treatment. However, there are some disadvantages as well, which include limited field of view and operator dependency. Also, extension into the thoracic cavity and more deeply located soft tissue locations can be missed. We present a case of subglottic hemangioma in which US solved the diagnostic dilemma and provided a definite diagnosis when CT and tracheobronchoscopy failed to do so in a 6-month-old infant presenting with stridor to the ER.

AB  - We quantified and investigated multimodal brain MRI measures in the LoCARPoN Study due to lack of normative data among Indians. A total of 401 participants (aged 50-88 years) without stroke or dementia completed MRI investigation. We assessed 31 brain measures in total using four brain MRI modalities, including macrostructural (global & lobar volumes, white matter hyperintensities [WMHs]), microstructural (global and tract-specific white matter fractional anisotropy [WM-FA] and mean diffusivity [MD]) and perfusion measures (global and lobar cerebral blood flow [CBF]). The absolute brain volumes of males were significantly larger than those of females, but such differences were relatively small (<1.2% of intracranial volume). With increasing age, lower macrostructural brain volumes, lower WM-FA, greater WMHs, higher WM-MD were found (P = 0.00018, Bonferroni threshold). Perfusion measures did not show significant differences with increasing age. Hippocampal volume showed the greatest association with age, with a reduction of approximately 0.48%/year. This preliminary study augments and provides insight into multimodal brain measures during the nascent stages of aging among the Indian population (South Asian ethnicity). Our findings establish the groundwork for future hypothetical testing studies.

AB  - SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma is a recently described molecularly defined entity among the subset of aggressive undifferentiated uterine tumors. Mutation in the SMARCA4 gene is a key driver alteration, as also seen in small cell carcinoma of ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) and thoracic undifferentiated carcinoma. Limited number of cases of SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma has been reported in literature. We hereby describe a case of this distinct entity in a 52-year-old woman. Histomorphological examination showed sheets of monomorphic epithelioid cells with a variable proportion of cells displaying rhabdoid features, brisk mitotic activity, and lymphovascular invasion. A panel of immunohistochemical markers was required to exclude the differential diagnoses. The tumor was microsatellite stable. Loss of SMARCA4 expression and intact expression of INI1 in tumor cells by immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirmed the diagnosis of SMARCA4- deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma. The patient had a rapidly progressive clinical course.

AB  - The presence of emulsified silicone oil in the eye can lead to many complications, glaucoma being one of the most common. Adequate IOP control is difficult to achieve with medical management alone; surgical intervention is often required. Glaucoma drainage device implantation is often the preferred line of surgical intervention in such cases due to trabeculectomy failure from emulsified silicone oil droplets and associated conjunctival scarring. However, the silicone tube of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) may attract the silicone oil droplets, causing blockade of the tube with persistent raised IOP postoperatively. We report one such case where post-AGV silicone oil tube occlusion was treated with semi-conservative surgical management instead of revising the entire surgery or implantation of another drainage device. Our surgical technique of intracameral "vent and flush" offers rapid and effective IOP control in such cases. Postoperatively, normal IOP was achieved. Patency of tube continued to be maintained along with normalization of IOP on subsequent follow-ups.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated neurological, mental health disorders, and neurocognitive issues. However, there is a lack of inexpensive and efficient brain evaluation and screening systems. As a result, a considerable fraction of patients with neurocognitive or psychobehavioral predicaments either do not get timely diagnosed or fail to receive personalized treatment plans. This is especially true in the elderly populations, wherein only 16% of seniors say they receive regular cognitive evaluations. Therefore, there is a great need for development of an optimized clinical brain screening workflow methodology like what is already in existence for prostate and breast exams. Such a methodology should be designed to facilitate objective early detection and cost-effective treatment of such disorders. In this paper we have reviewed the existing clinical protocols, recent technological advances and suggested reliable clinical workflows for brain screening. Such protocols range from questionnaires and smartphone apps to multi-modality brain mapping and advanced imaging where applicable. To that end, the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) proposes the Brain, Spine and Mental Health Screening (NEUROSCREEN) as a multi-faceted approach. Beside other assessment tools, NEUROSCREEN employs smartphone guided cognitive assessments and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as well as potential genetic testing for cognitive decline risk as inexpensive and effective screening tools to facilitate objective diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and guide personalized treatment interventions. Operationalizing NEUROSCREEN is expected to result in reduced healthcare costs and improving quality of life at national and later, global scales.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The etiopathogenesis of pelviureteric junction obstruction (PUJO) has been debated. Recently, the role of interstitial cells of Cajal-like cells (ICC-LC)has been studied and reported to be the cause of this functional obstruction. We studied the histopathology and ICC-LC density at PUJ and compared it with that of PUJ of the control group and distal ureteric margin of the study group.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted which included PUJO patients in the study group and the renal tumor patients in the control group. Histopathological examination (muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis) and immunohistochemistry (ICC-LC density) were done. The muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis, and ICC-LC density at the PUJ in both the groups were compared. A similar comparison was performed between the findings at the PUJ and the distal margin in the study group.
RESULTS: The study and control groups included 37 PUJO patients and 13 Wilms tumor patients. The ICC-LC density at PUJ in the study group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P < 0.001) and that at the distal resected margin of the study group (P < 0.001). Significantly increased muscle hypertrophy (P < 0.001) and fibrosis (P = 0.002) were seen at PUJ in the study group compared to the control group. No significant association was noted between the ICC-LC density and muscle hypertrophy at PUJ and the distal resected margin in the study group.
CONCLUSION: A significant decrease in the density of ICC-LC and increased fibrosis and muscle hypertrophy at PUJ in children with PUJO play a role in the etiopathogenesis of the disease.

Intravenous lignocaine is also used for postoperative analgesia, and combined use of opioids plus lignocaine can reduce the doses and adverse effects of the individual drugs. This study therefore compared the analgesic efficacy of intravenous lignocaine-fentanyl (IV) to epidural ropivacaine-fentanyl (EPI) after major abdominal oncosurgery.
METHODS: Sixty patients were randomised to IV and EPI groups. Patients in the IV group received preoperative intravenous bolus injections of lignocaine 1.5 mg kg-1 and fentanyl 0.5 μg kg-1, intraoperative infusions of lignocaine 1 mg kg-1 h-1 and fentanyl 0.5 μg kg-1 h-1, and postoperative infusions of lignocaine 0.5 mg kg-1 h-1 and fentanyl 0.25 μg kg-1 h-1. In the EPI group, patients received a 6-ml epidural bolus injection of ropivacaine 0.2% plus fentanyl 2 μg mL-1, intraoperative infusion of 5 mL·h-1 fentanyl and postoperative ropivacaine 0.1% plus fentanyl 1 μg mL-1 infusion at 5 mL h-1. All patients also received postoperative patient-controlled IV fentanyl as rescue analgesia. Patient-controlled fentanyl consumption was documented as the primary outcome for postoperative analgesic efficacy. Results were compared by Mann-Whitney U-test and Student's t-test using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software.
RESULTS: Median (min-max) rescue fentanyl requirement in the first 24 h postsurgery was comparable between IV and EPI groups [780 (340-2520) μg vs. 820 (140-2260) μg; p=0.6], as was postoperative pain score (p>0.05). The incidence of intraoperative hypotension requiring bolus mephenteramine injection was significantly higher in the EPI group than the IV group (36% vs. 17%; p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: Intravenous lignocaine-fentanyl and epidural ropivacaine-fentanyl have comparable postoperative analgesic efficacies after major open abdominal oncosurgery.

T2  - Dental Traumatology: Official Publication of International Association for Dental Traumatology
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Tooth avulsion (TA) is a severe form of traumatic dental injury. The tooth's prognosis depends on the immediate measures taken. First responders are often laypeople, and the Internet is a favored platform to access health-related information. The aim of this descriptive study was to evaluate the accuracy, quality, readability, and popularity of patient-oriented web information regarding the emergency management of TA.
METHODS: Three search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo.com) were browsed with six VPNs using "knocked out tooth," "fallen out tooth," and "tooth avulsion" as keywords. The top 20 results for each were evaluated. Webpages were included if they had information oriented to caregivers. They were analyzed for accuracy (cutoff ≥95%). Quality of web pages was assessed using DISCERN and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark. Readability was evaluated using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog (FOG), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG). Popularity was assessed by Alexa Popularity Rank (APR). Accurate and inaccurate webpages were compared using chi-square analysis and the Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's correlation between the studied metrics was established. A p < .05 was considered significant.
RESULTS: Seventy-two webpages were included, of which 23 (32%) were accurate. The median DISCERN ratings for accurate and inaccurate webpages were 3.0 [2.5-3.0] and 3.0 [2.0-3.0], respectively (p = .331). Ten (44%) accurate and 12 (24.5%) inaccurate webpages had high-quality JAMA (p = .089). The median readability scores for accurate webpages were FKGL (8 [6.75-9.2]), FOG (10.6 [9.55-12.3]), CLI (7 [6-7]), SMOG (6.7 [6.15-7.5]), while scores for the inaccurate webpages were FKGL (7.85 [6.275-8.525]), FOG (10.55 [8.875-11.425]), CLI (7 [7-8.25]), and SMOG (7 [6.2-7.925]), with a higher CLI score for inaccurate webpages (p = .0035). The median APRs for accurate and inaccurate webpages were 1,02,538 [26,852-14,43,755] and 7,63,190 [2,19,799-29,92,067], respectively (p = .163). Accuracy had a positive correlation with quality (DISCERN: rho = .293, p = .013; JAMA: rho = .249, p = .036), while popularity (APR) was negatively correlated with quality (DISCERN: rho = -.330, p = .013; JAMA: rho = -.287, p = .032).
CONCLUSION: Relevant webpages were limited and had low accuracy. This can impact the emergency management by laypeople and adversely affect the prognosis following avulsion.

AB  - Aggressive angiomyxoma (AA) is a rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin. It most commonly occurs in young women, predominantly in the pelvi-perineal region. We describe a case of AA arising from the lesser curvature of the stomach in a young woman who presented with a lump in the abdomen for 6 months. The patient subsequently underwent en bloc resection of the tumour and the diagnosis was confirmed on histology. This is the first reported case of gastric origin of AA to the best of our knowledge.

AB  - Different sleep stages exert differential effects on interictal discharges, neural synchrony and seizure threshold. We sought to assess the relationship between localization of the epileptogenic focus and seizure distribution in sleep versus wakefulness among patients with refractory epilepsy. We conducted a retrospective chart review-based study. Video-electroencephalography of patients with refractory epilepsy, planned for resective surgery, were reviewed for seizure localisation and occurrence relative to stage of sleep/wakefulness. Demographic/clinical data, including details of surgery, were also recorded. Bivariate analysis was conducted using the chi-square test for proportions and unpaired t-test/ANOVA to compare the means within groups. We enrolled 175 patients (107 males) with a mean age of 26.1 + 9.8 years (range: 4-53 years). We analysed 1,282 seizures, of which 916 (71.5%) were temporal, 95 (7.4%) frontal, 144 (11.2 %) central/ parietal and 19 (1.5%) arose from the occipital lobe. Temporal lobe onset seizures were more frequent during wakefulness (77.7%) compared to extra-temporal localization (65%) (p<0.0001). Amongst temporal lobe onset seizures, those during wakefulness arose more frequently from the lateral temporal (88.6%) compared to the mesial temporal lobe (75.5%) (p=0.0003). A higher proportion of seizures evolved into secondary generalisation during sleep (23.5%) versus 8.7% during wakefulness (p<0.0001). Our study demonstrates that lobar location of epileptogenic foci is associated with a predilection of seizures to occur, as well as secondarily generalise, during sleep/wakefulness. Seizures with lateral temporal lobe as well as extratemporal lobe onset were more likely to occur during wakefulness. Overall, sleep related seizures were more likely to be of extratemporal lobe onset, though.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected treatment services for people with substance use disorders (SUDs). Based on the perspectives of service providers from eight countries, we discuss the impact of the pandemic on SUD treatment services. Although many countries quickly adapted in provision of harm reduction services by changes in policy and service delivery, some went into a forced abstinence-based strategy. Similarly, disruption of abstinence-based approaches such as therapeutic communities has been reported. Global awareness is crucial for responsible management of SUDs during the pandemic, and the development of international health policy guidelines is an urgent need in this area.

AB  - Tattoos with blue/black ink show good lightening of pigment after treatment with 1064 nm Q-switched (QS) neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. In this randomized trial, we compared the efficacy of a novel three pass, one session procedure (R15 method) with a conventional method for treating blue/black tattoos in darker skin types. Tattoos were treated with 1064 nm QS Nd:YAG Laser with a spot size of 4 mm, fluence of 5 J/cm2 and frequency of 5 Hz. The tattoo pigment lightening was comparable with both methods. Thread-like tattoos had significantly better pigment lightening with fewer side effects than the broad band-like tattoos. We would like to recommend the R15 method of the QS Nd:YAG laser for thread-like tattoos, which can save patients' time, cut short the frequency of their hospital visits and, more importantly, decrease the cost involved in it.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in bladder carcinoma (BC) invasiveness and metastasis. Studies have shown that muscle-invasive BC (MIBC) and non-MIBC (NMIBC) are different at the molecular level owing to different EMT-related programming. Recent studies suggest that dysregulation of specific miRNAs is linked to EMT in BC. With this background, we aimed to study the immunoexpression of EMT-markers and its correlation with miRNA-200c expression in a series of MIBCs and NMIBCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction for the quantification of miR-200c expression was performed on 50 cases of urinary BC obtained from transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), cystectomy specimens, and ten peritumoral bladder tissue. Immunohistochemistry for ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST, E-cadherin, and β-catenin was performed on tumor and peritumoral bladder tissue.
RESULTS: Thirty-five TURBT and 15 cystectomy specimens were assessed. Among MIBC, loss of expression of E-cadherin (72.3%), β-catenin (66.7%), and ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST2 immunoreactivity was noted in 53.3%, 86.7%, and 73.3% of cases, respectively. Among NMIBC, loss of expression of E-cadherin (22.5%), β-catenin (17.1%) and ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST immunoreactivity was noted in 11.5%, 51.4%, and 91.4% of cases, respectively. Upregulation of miRNA-200c was noted in cases with retained E-cadherin and negative TWIST expression. Downregulation of miRNA-200c expression was noted in all the cases showing loss of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and in cases immunoreactive for ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST in MIBC. Downregulation of miRNA-200c expression was also noted in cases of MIBC with retained β-catenin and those immunonegative for ZEB1 and ZEB2. A similar trend was noted in NMIBC. Median miRNA-200c expression was low in both high-grade and low-grade NMIBC compared to peritumoral bladder tissue and was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: This study for the first time explores the relation of miR200C with E-cadherin, b-catenin, and its direct transcriptional regulators, namely Zeb1, Zeb2, and Twist in the same cohort of BC. We observed that miRNA-200c is downregulated in both MIBC and NMIBC. We identified novel expression of TWIST in cases of BC showing downregulation of miR200Cs suggesting that it is one of the protein targets of altered miRNA-200c expression contributing to EMT and can serve as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target. Loss of E-cadherin and ZEB1 immunoexpression in high-grade NMIBC suggests an aggressive clinical behavior. However, ZEB2 heterogeneous expression in BC limits its diagnostic and prognostic utility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Screen positive women need to be triaged by colposcopy which is a major challenge in low-middle income countries. Portable colposcopes may overcome many challenges, reduce referrals and enable a single visit approach. This study assessed the performance of portable colposcopes and potential to reduce referral.
METHOD: This crossover randomised study enrolled women aged 25 to 65 years with abnormal screening result or cervical symptoms. All women underwent visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), HPV test, colposcopy with two portable colposcopes (Gynocular®, Gynius, Sweden, and Pocket® transvaginal colposcope, Duke University, NC, USA) and a standard video colposcope, and biopsy. Colposcopic Swede score agreement between portable and video colposcopes, as well as agreement of Swede score with histology were calculated for each device. The potential impact of portable colposcopes in a single visit approach was assessed based on the final diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among 250 subjects, 27(10.80%) had high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) lesions. Swede scores for Pocket and Gynocular colposcopes were similar to video colposcope in 248 (99.20%) and 247 (98.80%) subjects, respectively (agreement scores 0.9969 and 0.9954, respectively). At a Swede score cut-off of ≥5, all three devices had identical sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 96.30%, 92.30%, 60.50% and 99.50,. Ablative treatment offered at field setting would result in optimal treatment in 52.0% and 85.1% cases when screened with VIA and HPV test respectively; using Pocket colposcope could improve this to 94.0% and 95.9%, respectively. Overtreatment and referral rates reduced from 46.8% and 12.4% to 4.8% and 6.0%, respectively, when VIA test is followed by triage with pocket colposcope. These outcomes were comparable to screening with HPV followed by colposcopy triage.
CONCLUSIONS: Pocket colposcope performed comparably to the video colposcope. Used by healthcare providers in the field setting, they can augment the results of VIA significantly.

AB  - A library of non-immersive Virtual Reality (VR) tasks were developed for post-stroke rehabilitation of distal upper extremities. The objective was to evaluate the rehabilitation impact of the developed VR-tasks on a patient with chronic stroke. The study involved a 50-year-old male patient with chronic (13 month) stroke. Twenty VR therapy sessions of 45 min each were given. Clinical scales, cortical-excitability measures, functional MRI (fMRI), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired pre-and post-therapy to evaluate the motor recovery. Increase in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (wrist/hand) by 2 units, Barthel Index by 5 units, Brunnstrom Stage by 1 unit, Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination by 3 units, Wrist Active Range of Motion by 5° and decrease in Modified Ashworth Scale by 1 unit were observed. Ipsilesional Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) amplitude (obtained using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) was increased by 60.9µV with a decrease in Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) by 7%, and contralesional MEP amplitude was increased by 56.2µV with a decrease in RMT by 7%. The fMRI-derived Laterality Index of Sensorimotor Cortex increased in precentral-gyrus (from 0.28 to 0.33) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.07 to 0.3). The DTI-derived FA-asymmetry decreased in precentral-gyrus (from 0.029 to 0.024) and in postcentral-gyrus (from 0.027 to 0.017). Relative reduction in task-specific performance metrics, i.e., time taken to complete the task (31.6%), smoothness of trajectory (76.7%), and relative percentage error (80.7%), were observed from day 1 to day 20 of the VR therapy. VR therapy resulted in improvement in clinical outcomes in a patient with chronic stroke. The research also gives insights to further improve the overall system of rehabilitation.

AB  - Stroke, affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, has long been a global cause of death and disability. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown its potential as an assistive tool for post-stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this pilot study was to define the task-specific performance metrics of VR tasks to assess the performance level of healthy subjects and patients quantitatively and to obtain their feedback for improving the developed framework. A pilot prospective study was designed. We tested the designed VR tasks on forty healthy right-handed subjects to evaluate its potential. Qualitative trajectory plots and three quantitative performance metrics-time taken to complete the task, percentage relative error, and trajectory smoothness-were computed from the recorded data of forty healthy subjects. Two patients with stroke were also enrolled to compare their performance with healthy subjects. Each participant received one VR session of 90 min. No adverse effects were noticed throughout the study. Performance metrics obtained from healthy subjects were used as a reference for patients. Relatively higher values of task completion time and trajectory smoothness and lower values of relative % error was observed for the affected hands w.r.t the unaffected hands of both the patients. For the unaffected hands of both the patients, the performance levels were found objectively closer to that of healthy subjects. A library of VR tasks for wrist and fingers were designed, and task-specific performance metrics were defined in this study. The evaluation of the VR exercises using these performance metrics will help the clinicians to assess the patient's progress quantitatively and to design the rehabilitation framework for a future clinical study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ischaemic stroke (IS) is associated with various modifiable risk factors but the association of these risk factors based on TOAST classification, which characterises IS into five subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small vessel occlusion (SVO), cardioembolic disease (CE), other determined aetiology (ODE) and undetermined aetiology (UDE), is unknown. We aimed to summarise the published evidence for the association of modifiable risk factors with IS subtypes based on TOAST classification, specifically focussing on the Asian versus Caucasian population.
METHOD: A comprehensive search for all the published articles was performed in electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 01st January 1950 to 10th April 2022 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) along with random-effect models was used to calculate summary estimates.
RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, 32 studies with a total of 23,404 IS (14,364 in Asian vs. 9040 in Caucasian population), 7121 LAA (5219 in Asian vs. 1902 in Caucasian), 5532 SVO (3604 in Asian vs. 1928 in Caucasian), 3498 CE (1634 in Asian vs. 1864 in Caucasian), 1131 ODE (546 in Asian vs. 585 in Caucasian) and 4519 UDE (2076 in Asian vs. 2443 in Caucasian) were included. Our findings suggest a significant association between LAA and hypertension (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12), smoking (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.17), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.06-1.21), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11-1.25) and atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40-0.75). Significantly strong association of hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation was observed with SVO and CE stroke subtypes. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed a significant association for dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation in LAA for both Asians and Caucasians. Hypertension was significantly associated with SVO and ODE subtypes in both Asians and Caucasians; however, only Asian population showed significant association of hypertension in LAA and CE subtypes. The other risk factors did not show any statistical difference between the ethnic groups for the different stroke subtypes. The majority of the risk factors depicted positive association with LAA and SVO, negative with CE and neutral with ODE and UDE.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest strong association of smoking, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus with LAA and SVO subtypes in the Caucasian population. However, only diabetes mellitus showed significant association with both LAA and SVO subtypes in Asian population as well. Thus, a majority of the traditional modifiable risk factors had a positive association in LAA and SVO, while a negative protective association was observed in CE subtype, among both the Asian and the Caucasian subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been used to provide analgesia in renal transplant surgery with varying results. This study was designed to assess if the addition of clonidine in TAP block would decrease 24-h postoperative morphine consumption in adult renal transplant recipients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty adult patients undergoing renal transplantation under general anesthesia in a tertiary care hospital were randomized into either group RC (TAP block with 20 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine plus 2 μg.kg-1 clonidine) or group R (TAP block with 20 mL 0.5% ropivacaine) after induction of anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia was provided using patient-controlled morphine. The primary outcome was 24-h patient-controlled morphine consumption. The secondary outcomes were a) intraoperative hemodynamics, b) fentanyl and ephedrine requirement, c) postoperative pain using the Visual Analog Scale at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours, d) time to first postoperative analgesia, e) postoperative hemodynamics, and f) side effects.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in postoperative morphine consumption between the groups (25 mg in group RC vs. 28.5 mg in group R) (median interquartile range) (P = 0.439). Postoperative pain scores were comparable between the groups. Intraoperatively, fewer patients required rescue fentanyl in group RC (7 patients) as compared to group R (17 patients) (P = 0.003). Significantly more patients in group RC required ephedrine boluses as compared to group R (9 patients in group RC vs. 2 in group R, P = 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of 2 μg.kg-1 clonidine to ropivacaine in TAP block did not reduce 24-h postoperative morphine consumption after renal transplantation. It reduced the need for intraoperative analgesics but increased the need for intraoperative ephedrine administration.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Bone marrow stem cells (BM-SCs) and their progeny play a central role in tissue repair and regeneration. In patients with chronic liver failure, bone marrow (BM) reserve is severally compromised and they showed marked defects in the resolution of injury and infection, leading to liver failure and the onset of decompensation. Whether BM failure is the cause or consequence of liver failure during cirrhosis is not known. In this study, we aimed to determine the underlying relationship between BM failure and regeneration failure in cirrhosis.
METHODOLOGY: C57Bl/6(J) mice were used to develop chronic liver injury through intra-peritoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 15 weeks (0.1-0.5 ml/kg). Animals were sacrificed to study the transition of cirrhosis and BM defects. To restore the BM-SC reserve; healthy BM cells were infused via intra-BM infusion and assessed for changes in liver injury, regeneration, and BM-SC reserve.
RESULTS: Using a CCl4-induced animal - model of cirrhosis, we showed the loss of BM-SCs reserve occurred before regeneration failure and the onset of non-acute decompensation. Intra-BM infusion of healthy BM cells induced the repopulation of native hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in cirrhotic BM. Restoring BM-HSCs reserve augments liver macrophage-mediated clearance of infection and inflammation dampens neutrophil-mediated inflammation, accelerates fibrosis regression, enhances hepatocyte proliferation, and delays the onset of non-acute decompensation.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that loss of BM-HSCs reserve underlies the compromised innate immune function of the liver, drives regeneration failure, and the onset of non-acute decompensation. We further provide the proof-of-concept that rejuvenating BM-HSC reserve can serve as a potential therapeutic approach for preventing regeneration failure and transition to decompensated cirrhosis.

AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with underlying circulatory cellular and metabolic abnormalities associated with higher mortality rates. However, a detailed understanding of sepsis is still limited. The present study reports the differences in the metabolic profile of serum samples of patients with sepsis compared to healthy controls using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The study also compares the NMR metabolomics on day zero of admission among sepsis survivors (those who survived till day seven) and sepsis non-survivors (those who succumbed on day zero). Furthermore, the different metabolites in serum were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis, ROC analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. Metabolites with VIP score (>1·0) were considered as potential biomarker/s to discriminate sepsis survivors from non- survivors at day zero. Data showed that phenylalanine was significantly higher in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls, whereas isoleucine, valine and histidine were significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. Also, non-survivors had higher serum levels of creatine, phosphocreatine, choline, betaine, tyrosine, histidine and phenylalanine concentrations than survivors. These findings suggest that the metabolic alterations at day zero may predict the survival of patients with sepsis. The significant differences seen in metabolites concentration of amino acids, phospholipids and creatine may be used as early prognostic markers to discriminate non-survivors from survivors of sepsis patients at day zero. Our findings indicate that the metabolite alterations are associated with the progression of the disease.

AB  - Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD) is an uncommon autosomal recessive (AR) spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SED) and its clinical course and phenotype are yet to be properly described. The phenotypic presentation is quite varied with involvement of the renal, skeletal, vascular, immune, and hematopoietic systems being the most common presentation. We describe a 19-year-old female who presented with adolescent-onset brain and skeletal involvement without renal manifestations. Based on imaging and clinical features, she was diagnosed with a case of SIOD. There is no definitive treatment yet for this disorder, however, clinicians should be aware of this disorder so that adequate counseling and symptomatic management, especially in controlling hypertension and dyslipidemia, can be provided to the affected patients.

AB  - Renal tumors in young population are relatively rare. We reviewed our experience with renal masses in patients below 45 years of age. Our objective was to analyze clinico-pathological and survival characteristics of renal malignancy in young adults in contemporary era. The medical records of patients below 45 years of age who underwent surgery for renal mass at our tertiary care center between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Pertinent clinical information was compiled, including age, gender, year and type of surgery, histopathology and survival data. A total of 194 patients who underwent nephrectomy for suspicious renal masses were included. Mean age was 35.5 (14-45) years and males were 125 (64.4%). A total of 29/198 (14.6%) specimens had benign disease. In addition, 155 (91.7%) out of 169 malignant tumors were renal cell carcinomas, clear cell variant being the most common type (51%). Compared to RCC, non-RCC tumors were more common in females (27.7 vs 78.6%, p < 0.0001), had an early age of diagnosis (27.2 vs 36.9 year, p < 0.00001) and poorer progression-free (58.3 vs 72.0%, p = 0.03) and overall survival (63.6 vs 84.2%, p = 0.02) at 6 years of follow-up. Renal masses in young adults are most commonly RCC but can also include other diverse types. RCC in young adults is usually organ confined and has good prognosis. As compared to RCC, non-RCC malignant tumors occur in young age, are more in females, and have worse prognosis.

T2  - Indian journal of urology: IJU: journal of the Urological Society of India
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic use during endourological procedures is often discordant from the reported guidelines, despite the potential risks of antibiotic resistance, adverse effects, and health-care costs. A nationwide audit was conducted, with the support of the Urological Society of India, to ascertain the current antibiotic prescription practices for the endourological procedures and the reasons associated with them.
METHODS: A multi-institutional, national-level, cross-sectional audit analyzing elective endourological procedures was performed. The data regarding the disease profile; risk factors for infectious complications; urine culture; pre-, per-, and post-operative antibiotic use; additional antibiotic use; and patient demographics were collected in a standardized pro forma. Reasons for prescribing antibiotics divergent from the guideline recommendations were also noted. Any infectious complication that necessitated the antibiotic use was also noted prospectively up to 1 month. All the data were entered into a single centralized and customized online portal on a real-time basis.
RESULTS: One thousand five hundred and thirty-eight cases were recruited from 20 hospitals. A single-dose prophylaxis was prescribed in only 319 (20.7%) of the cases, and the majority received a multi-day prophylaxis. A combination of two or more antibiotics was prescribed as the prophylaxis in 51% of the cases. One thousand three hundred and fifty-six (88.2%) cases were continued on a long-duration prophylaxis after the discharge, with 1191 (77.4%) receiving it for > 3 days. One thousand one hundred and sixty (75.4%) cases received a guideline-discordant prophylaxis solely on the basis of the surgeon's or institution's protocol, rather than any specific case based need. Ninety eight (6.4%) cases developed postoperative urinary tract infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-dose, combination and post-discharge antibiotic prophylaxis for endourological surgeries is highly prevalent in India. This audit highlights the huge potential to reduce such guideline-discordant overuse of antibiotics during the endourological procedures.

AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon primary cancer in the adrenal gland. Its incidence of showing metastasis in the head and neck region is very rare. Herein, we present a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with complaints of pain and numbness on the left side of the lower face for 4 months. Radiographic examination revealed an osteolytic lesion with an ill-defined border in the left body region of the mandible. Histopathologic examination revealed a tumor composed of sheets of oval to polygon-shaped tumor cells predominantly displaying abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. These tumor cells showed features of a high degree of anaplasia. On immunohistochemical examination, tumor cells were focally positive for synaptophysin, inhibin, vimentin, pancytokeratin (pan-CK), cytokeratin (CK)5/6, CD68, and CK8/18 and immunonegative for CK7, chromogranin, melan-A, S100, SMA, and SATB2. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 20%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic oncocytic ACC to the oral cavity region.

AB  - Salmonella Typhi is emerging as a drug-resistant pathogen, particularly in developing countries. Hence, the progressive development of new antibiotics against novel drug targets is essential to prevent the spread of infections and mortality. The cell division protein FtsZ is an ideal drug target as the cell wall synthesis in bacteria is driven by the dynamic treadmilling nature of the FtsZ. The polymerization of the FtsZ provides the essential mechanical constricting force and flexibility to modulate the cell wall synthesis. Any alteration in FtsZ polymerization leads to the bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect. In this study, we have evaluated the secondary metabolites of natural compounds berberine chloride, cinnamaldehyde, scopoletin, quercetin and eugenol as potential inhibitors of FtsZ from Salmonella Typhi (stFtsZ) using computational, biochemical, and in vivo cell-based assays. Out of these five compounds, berberine chloride and cinnamaldehyde exhibited the best binding affinity of Kd = 7 μM and 10 μM, respectively and inhibit stFtsZ GTPase activity and polymerization by 70 %. The compound berberine chloride showed the best MIC of 500 μg/mL and 175 μg/mL against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains. The findings support that these natural compounds can be used as a backbone structure to develop a broad spectrum of antibacterial agents.

AB  - Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not frequent yet the incidence rate of it is increasing globally owing to the slow emergence of drift variants that pose a perpetual threat to vaccination strategies and have a greater propensity for disease reoccurrence. Long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection relies on the induction of the innate as well as the adaptive immune response endowed with immune memory. However, a multitude of factors including the selection pressure, the waning immunity against SARS-CoV-2 over the first year after infection possibly favors evolution of more infectious immune escape variants, amplifying the risk of reinfection. Additionally, the correlates of immune protection, the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), the durability of the adaptive and mucosal immunity remain major challenges for the development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is another important target organ for SARS-CoV-2 besides the respiratory system, potentially increasing the likelihood of reinfection by impacting the microbiome and the immune response via the gut-lung axis. In this review, we summarized the latest development in SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and explored the untapped potential of trained immunity. We also highlighted the immune memory kinetics of the humoral and cell-mediated immune response, genetic drift of the emerging viral variants, and discussed the current challenges in vaccine development. Understanding the dynamics and the quality of immune response by unlocking the power of the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity during SARS-CoV-2 reinfection would open newer avenues for drug discovery and vaccine designs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition that impacts the physical and psychological functioning of the patients. The physical and cognitive changes come with social stigma and threats to roles previously associated with their identities.
OBJECTIVES: The current paper attempts to study the influence of the disease on the personal identity of the patients.
METHODS: A systematic review was done on PD and personal identity following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist was used to assess the quality of the papers. The selected papers were synthesized to understand the relationship between PD and personal identity.
RESULTS: The emerging themes were: (1) dissociation of old personal identity: (1.1) Influence of physical symptoms, (1.2) influence of society and stigma, and (1.3) threats to roles associated with identity and (2) changing family dynamics. A Model of Personal, Family, and Disease Dynamics was also developed based on clinical first-hand experience with the patients and the review.
CONCLUSION: The personal identity of the PD patients shifts drastically as a result of their physical and psychosocial experiences. This also results in changed family dynamics, with the patient feeling sidelined due to loss of control and responsibilities in the family.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health systems responsiveness is the key to addressing infectious disease threats such as pandemics. The paper outlines an assessment of health systems resilience by exploring the association of health systems and Global Health Security (GHS) parameters with case load and mortality resulting from COVID-19 across 203 countries using an ecological design.
METHODOLOGY: Correlation analysis was performed to assess the relationship of each of the indicators with COVID 19 cases and deaths per million population. Stepwise multiple regression models were developed to determine the predictors of COVID-19 cumulative cases and deaths per million population separately.
RESULTS: Global health security indicators seemed to have a strong association when analyzed individually but those did not necessarily translate into less burden of cases or deaths in the multivariable analysis. The predictors of cumulative deaths per million population included general government expenditure on health as a proportion of general government expenditure, responsiveness of the system to prevent the emergence and release of pathogens and governance related voice and accountability.
CONCLUSION: To conclude, health financing parameters and preventive activities with regard to emergence of pathogens were better predictors of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths per million population compared to other health systems and global health security indicators.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 infection and venous thromboembolism after surgery: an international prospective cohort study
AU  - COVIDSurg Collaborative
AU  - GlobalSurg Collaborative
T2  - Anaesthesia
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with an increased rate of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020. Patients from all surgical specialties were included. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) within 30 days of surgery. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was defined as peri-operative (7 days before to 30 days after surgery); recent (1-6 weeks before surgery); previous (≥7 weeks before surgery); or none. Information on prophylaxis regimens or pre-operative anti-coagulation for baseline comorbidities was not available. Postoperative venous thromboembolism rate was 0.5% (666/123,591) in patients without SARS-CoV-2; 2.2% (50/2317) in patients with peri-operative SARS-CoV-2; 1.6% (15/953) in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2; and 1.0% (11/1148) in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with peri-operative (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0)) and recent SARS-CoV-2 (1.9 (95%CI 1.2-3.3)) remained at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, with a borderline finding in previous SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 (95%CI 0.9-3.0)). Overall, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with 30-day mortality (5.4 (95%CI 4.3-6.7)). In patients with SARS-CoV-2, mortality without venous thromboembolism was 7.4% (319/4342) and with venous thromboembolism was 40.8% (31/76). Patients undergoing surgery with peri-operative or recent SARS-CoV-2 appear to be at increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism compared with patients with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Optimal venous thromboembolism prophylaxis and treatment are unknown in this cohort of patients, and these data should be interpreted accordingly.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether simulation based education (SBE) improves the practices and knowledge of junior residents for stabilization of a preterm neonate in delivery room as compared to conventional education (CE).
METHODS: This trial randomized 24 pediatric residents to either SBE (n=12) or CE (n=12) groups. One-time SBE was imparted to the SBE group. Both the groups had similar facilitator participant ratio and equally timed sessions. The individual skills scores and performance by preterm stabilization performance evaluation (PSPE) score in real time were recorded using a validated tool within 8 weeks of the training. Knowledge gain was evaluated using pre and post-test scores.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) skill and PSPE scores were comparable between the two groups (skill score 51.1 (8.1), 46.5 (7.8), respectively mean difference 4.6; 95% CI -2.1 to 11.3; PSPE-score 80.2 (14.2) vs. 82.9 (10.3); mean difference -2.68; 95% CI -8.35 to 13.71). The mean (SD) knowledge gain was similar in the groups [4.4 (1.9), 5.3 (4.1); mean difference 0.91; 95% CI, -1.81 to 3.64.
CONCLUSION: In junior residents, a one-time SBE session, when compared to conventional task training, did not lead to improvement in the performance of the initial steps of neonatal resuscitation.

AB  - Exploring the barriers and facilitators of cervical cancer screening (CCS) is essential to reduce the incidence and mortality, particularly in low and middle-income countries. The present study investigates the direct, indirect, and total effects of the barriers and facilitators on CCS in India through the generalized structural equation modeling using data from women files of the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). Generalized structural equation models were used to quantify the hypothetical pathway via fitting a series of regression equations. Age, body mass index, religion, years of schooling, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, contraception use, lifetime number of sex partners, number of children, and wealth index were shown to have significant direct effects on the CCS. Older women had 1.16 times the odds of getting screened for cervical cancer as compared to their younger counterpart. The odds of CCS among the women in richest wealth quintile is 2.50 times compared to the poorest. Those who are aware of STIs have 1.39 times the odds of getting screened for cervical cancer. Wealth index, years of schooling, and religion have a substantial indirect and total impact on the CCS. The findings will aid in policy formulations for enhancing the CCS in India.

AB  - PURPOSE: Inter-clinician variation could cause uncertainty in disease management. This is reported to be high in Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), a potentially blinding retinal disease affecting premature infants. Machine learning has the potential to quantify the differences in decision-making between ROP specialists and trainees and may improve the accuracy of diagnosis.
METHODS: An anonymized survey of ROP images was administered to the expert(s) and the trainee(s) using a study-designed user interface. The results were analyzed for repeatability as well as to identify the level of agreement in the classification. "Ground truth" was prepared for each individual and a unique classifier was built for each individual using the same. The classifier allowed the identification of the most important features used by each individual.
RESULTS: Correlation and disagreement between the expert and the trainees were visualized using the Dipstick™ diagram. Intra-clinician repeatability and reclassification statistics were assessed for all. The repeatability was 88.4% and 86.2% for two trainees and 92.1% for the expert, respectively. Commonly used features differed for the expert and the trainees and accounted for the variability.
CONCLUSION: This novel, automated algorithm quantifies the differences using machine learning techniques. This will help audit the training process by objectively measuring differences between experts and trainees.
TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Training for image-based ROP diagnosis can be more objectively performed using this novel, machine learning-based automated image analyzer and classifier.

AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the international chronic ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) diagnostic criteria (ICCGVHD) compared to the National Institute of Health diagnostic criteria 2014 (NIH2014) for chronic ocular GVHD.
METHODS: Between 2013 and 2019, the study enrolled 233 patients with or without chronic ocular GVHD combined with the presence or absence of systemic chronic GVHD in an internationally prospective multicenter and observational cohort from 9 institutions. All patients were evaluated for four clinical parameters of ICCGVHD.
RESULTS: The relation between the ICCGVHD score (0-11) and NIH2014 eye score (0-4) was relatively high (r = 0.708, 95% CI: 0.637-0.767, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of ICCGVHD for NIH 2014 for 233 patients were 94.3% (95% CI: 89.6%-98.1%) and 71.7% (95% CI: 63.0-79.5%), respectively (cutoff value of the ICCGVHD score = 6). The positive predictive value was 77.1% (95% CI: 71.1%-82.1%), and the negative predictive value was 87.0% (95% CI:81.6-92.5%). For the patients with systemic GVHD (n = 171), the sensitivity and specificity were 94.2% and 67.2%, respectively (ICCGVHD-score cutoff value = 6). By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.903 (95% CI: 0.859-0.948). For patients without systemic GVHD (n = 62), the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 76.7%, respectively (ICCGVHD-score cutoff value = 6). The AUC was 0.891 (95% CI 0.673-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Good sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and correlation were found between ICCGVHD and NIH2014. ICCGVHD scores ≥6 can be useful to diagnose ocular GVHD with or without systemic GVHD for clinical research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a less common but devastating complication of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the most common CT imaging features of AMI in COVID-19 and also provide an updated review of the literature on symptoms, treatment, histopathological and operative findings, and follow-up of these patients.
METHODS: A systematic literature search of four databases: Pubmed, EMBASE, WHO database, and Google Scholar, was performed to identify all the articles which described abdominal CT imaging findings of AMI in COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 47 studies comprising 75 patients were included in the final review. Small bowel ischemia (46.67%) was the most prevalent abdominal CT finding, followed by ischemic colitis (37.3%). Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI; 67.9%) indicating microvascular involvement was the most common pattern of bowel involvement. Bowel wall thickening/edema (50.9%) was more common than bowel hypoperfusion (20.7%). While ileum and colon both were equally involved bowel segments (32.07% each), SMA (24.9%), SMV (14.3%), and the spleen (12.5%) were the most commonly involved artery, vein, and solid organ, respectively. 50% of the patients receiving conservative/medical management died, highlighting high mortality without surgery. Findings on laparotomy and histopathology corroborated strikingly with CT imaging findings.
CONCLUSION: In COVID-19 patients with AMI, small bowel ischemia is the most prevalent imaging diagnosis and NOMI is the most common pattern of bowel involvement. Contrast-enhanced CT is a powerful decision-making tool for prompt diagnosis of AMI in COVID-19, thereby potentially improving time to treat as well as clinical outcomes.

AB  - AIM: To study the imaging characteristics and the associations of left atrioventricular valve atresia with patent aortic root and lateralized atrial chambers on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated all the CT angiography studies performed for the evaluation of various congenital heart diseases at our center from January 2014 to December 2021. Cases with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with lateralized atrial chambers were identified. The types of cardiovascular involvement as identifiable on CT angiography were studied and compiled.
RESULTS: A total of 38 patients with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root were included (median age: 5 months, males: 31). A total of 89.5% had usual atrial arrangement and 10.5% had mirror imagery of atria. Normal drainage of right and left superior caval veins and inferior caval vein into systemic venous atrium was seen in 77.8%, 61.5%, and 86.6%, respectively. Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was seen in 3 (7.9%) patients. Atrial and ventricular septal defects were the most common associations. Imperforate left atrioventricular membrane was seen in 9 (23.7%) patients and absent left atrioventricular connection in 27 (71.1%). Discordant right atrioventricular connection was seen in 5 (13.1%) patients. While a double outlet right ventricle (76.3%) was the most common ventriculoarterial connection, discordant ventriculo-arterial connection (transposition) in 4 (10.5%). Most patients had good sized pulmonary arteries. Patent arterial duct and right aortic arch were seen in 29% and 21%, respectively. Aberrant right subclavian artery was the most common arch vessel anomaly. Coronary anomalies were seen in 7 patients (19%); single coronary artery being the most common.
CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the patients with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with lateralized atrial chambers have usual atrial arrangement, normal right atrioventricular connections and a double outlet configuration of the right ventricle. Absent left atrioventricular connection is a more common than imperforate left atrioventricular valve membrane. Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common associations. Comprehensive CT based evaluation of vascular and nonvascular thoracic structures is imperative before surgery or interventions in patients with mitral atresia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive and disabling disorder, so the cost of illness may change with time. We aimed this study to know the annual cost of care of PD in India.
METHODS: After ethics approval, a prospective cohort study was conducted at the movement disorder clinic of tertiary care hospital for 2 years (2014-2016). The outcomes were a description of the total annual direct cost of Parkinson's disease including health care as well as non-health care cost. We also did correlation analysis to know the determinants of the total cost.
RESULTS: A total of 200 consecutive patients of PD with 141 (70.50%) males and 59 (29.50%) females with a mean age of 56.84 ± 10.51 years were enrolled. The annual Median Direct cost of care was INR 27,315.0 (IQR 13636.6-44908.4), whereas the Indirect cost was INR 21,400 (IQR 9800 - 96800). Cost on drugs (Direct health care) formed 68.50% (Median) of the total Direct cost. Total direct cost formed 11.38% of the Median total yearly income of our patients. Of the direct cost, the Median expenditure on drugs was INR 18,712.8 (8064.0 -30696.0). Only 5% of patients had health care insurance. The total direct cost was determined by the stage of Parkinson's disease and duration of disease (P = < 0.01) but not predicted by age, gender, age at onset, and the yearly income of patients.
CONCLUSION: Annual cost of care of Parkinson's disease is high and increases with the duration of the disease as well as the progression of the disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children with developmental disabilities are associated with a high risk of poor school enrollment and educational attainment without timely and appropriate support. Epidemiological data on cerebral palsy and associated comorbidities required for policy intervention in global health are lacking. This paper set out to report the best available evidence on the global and regional prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental intellectual disability and the associated "years lived with disability" (YLDs) among children under 5 years of age in 2019.
METHODS: We analyzed the collaborative 2019 Rehabilitation Database of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study and World Health Organization for neurological and mental disorders available for 204 countries and territories. Point prevalence and YLDs with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) are presented.
RESULTS: Globally, 8.1 million (7.1-9.2) or 1.2% of children under 5 years are estimated to have CP with 16.1 million (11.5-21.0) or 2.4% having intellectual disability. Over 98% resided in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). CP and intellectual disability accounted for 6.5% and 4.5% of the aggregate YLDs from all causes of adverse health outcomes respectively. African Region recorded the highest prevalence of CP (1.6%) while South-East Asia Region had the highest prevalence of intellectual disability. The top 10 countries accounted for 57.2% of the global prevalence of CP and 62.0% of the global prevalence of intellectual disability.
CONCLUSION: Based on this Database, CP and intellectual disability are highly prevalent and associated with substantial YLDs among children under 5 years worldwide. Universal early detection and support services are warranted, particularly in LMICs to optimize school readiness for these children toward inclusive education as envisioned by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Despite persistent inequalities in access to eye care services globally, guidance on a set of recommended, evidence-based eye care interventions to support country health care planning has not been available. To overcome this barrier, the World Health Organization (WHO) Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI) has been developed.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the key outcomes of the PECI development.
EVIDENCE REVIEW: A standardized stepwise approach that included the following stages: (1) selection of priority eye conditions by an expert panel after reviewing epidemiological evidence and health facility data; (2) identification of interventions and related evidence for the selected eye conditions from a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs); stage 2 included a systematic literature search, screening of title and abstracts (excluding articles that were not relevant CPGs), full-text review to assess disclosure of conflicts of interest and affiliations, quality appraisal, and data extraction; (3) expert review of the evidence extracted in stage 2, identification of missed interventions, and agreement on the inclusion of essential interventions suitable for implementation in low- and middle-income resource settings; and (4) peer review.
FINDINGS: Fifteen priority eye conditions were chosen. The literature search identified 3601 articles. Of these, 469 passed title and abstract screening, 151 passed full-text screening, 98 passed quality appraisal, and 87 were selected for data extraction. Little evidence (≤1 CPG identified) was available for pterygium, keratoconus, congenital eyelid disorders, vision rehabilitation, myopic macular degeneration, ptosis, entropion, and ectropion. In stage 3, domain-specific expert groups voted to include 135 interventions (57%) of a potential 235 interventions collated from stage 2. After synthesis across all interventions and eye conditions, 64 interventions (13 health promotion and education, 6 screening and prevention, 38 treatment, and 7 rehabilitation) were included in the PECI.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review of CPGs for priority eye conditions, followed by an expert consensus procedure, identified 64 essential, evidence-based, eye care interventions that are required to achieve universal eye health coverage. The review identified some important gaps, including a paucity of high-quality, English-language CPGs, for several eye diseases and a dearth of evidence-based recommendations on eye health promotion and prevention within existing CPGs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metformin, by reducing intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, can be considered an adjunctive therapy to anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). We determined whether metformin with standard ATT reduces time to sputum culture conversion and tissue inflammation in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).
METHODS: In a randomized, 8-week, clinical trial, newly diagnosed, culture-positive PTB patients were randomized to standard ATT (HREZ = control arm) or standard ATT plus daily 1000 mg metformin (MET-HREZ = Metformin with Rifampicin [METRIF] arm) for 8 weeks during 2018-2020 at 5 sites in India. The primary end point was time to sputum culture conversion by liquid culture during 8 weeks of ATT. Plasma inflammatory markers were estimated in a subset. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate time and predictors of culture conversion.
RESULTS: Of the 322 patients randomized, 239 (74%) were male, and 212 (66%) had bilateral disease on chest radiograph with 54 (18%) showing cavitation. The median time to sputum culture conversion by liquid culture was 42 days in the METRIF arm and 41 days in the control arm (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], .624-1.019). After 8 weeks of ATT, cavitary lesions on X-ray (7, 5.3% vs 18, 12.9%; relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, .18-.96; P = .041) and inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the METRIF arm. Higher body mass index and lower sputum smear grading were associated with faster sputum culture conversion.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of metformin to standard ATT did not hasten sputum culture conversion but diminished excess inflammation, thus reducing lung tissue damage as seen by faster clearance on X-ray and reduced inflammatory markers.

TI  - Role of novel policy implementation for Gamma Knife (GK) procedures in improving access to neurosurgical care in lower middle income countries (LMICs) GK in LMICs
AU  - Pahwa, Bhavya
AU  - Agrawal, Deepak
T2  - World Neurosurgery: X
AB  - BACKGROUND: The high cost of GK machines with resultant scarcity of GK centers, coupled to additional cost of contrast MRI brain makes it nearly impossible for the vast majority of the population without health insurance in LMICs to have access to this advancement in management.
METHODS: AIIMS, Delhi is the premier public funded hospital in India with the largest Neurosurgical department in the country. We implemented a single payment policy which would cover the treatment and all subsequent GK treatments as well as Follow-up MRIs of the patient. The program was named 'Gamma Knife for life' and implemented in 2015. To check the efficacy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the Neurosurgery cases managed before and after the implementation of this scheme in the last 12 years.
RESULTS: Prior to implementation of the 'Gamma Knife for life' program, a total of 24,703 patients underwent Neurosurgical procedures in the years 2009-2015. Of these, only 2017 (8.16%) were GK procedures. In the years following the introduction of the program, the total number of neurosurgical procedures was 23,030 with 2947 (12.8%) being the GK procedures This difference in the number of GK procedures before and after the application of 'Gamma Knife for Life' was statistically significant (p = 0.026). The highest number of GK procedures (n = 789) reported so far were in 2020-21.
CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring holistic care by providing for not only the initial GK procedure but all subsequent procedures, as well as follow-up MRI's can improve the quality and consistency of care, especially in LMICs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the factors that affect decision-making when choosing a specific subspecialty while exploring gender and geographic variables.
METHODS: A cross-sectional, 13-item, nonrandomized online survey was created and shared over various social media platforms of the Neurosurgery Cocktail. Data were collected between January and April 2022. The survey focused on the amount of exposure to subspecialties during training, along with factors affecting the decision in choosing a specific subspecialty.
RESULTS: A total of 207 respondents, predominantly from Asian and European countries, with an 83.6% dominance of male respondents, completed the survey. The most common subspecialties with maximum exposure were neurosurgical oncology, spine, and neurocritical care and trauma, whereas peripheral nerve surgery and stereotactic and functional neurosurgery were the least exposed. In total, 70% of the respondents had no training or degree in a subspecialty, which was the greatest in Asian and African countries (P = 0.0205). Respondents found the prestige and lifestyle of a skull base neurosurgeon very attractive (P = 0.027, 0.034 respectively), whereas the lifestyle and salary of spine neurosurgeons made it a popular subspecialty (P < 0.001, 0.008, respectively). Personal interest in neurosurgical oncology established its popularity among the respondents (P = 0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic and functional neurosurgery and peripheral nerve surgery are the emerging subspecialties and hence their exposure and access are highly limited to the developed world whereas spine and neurosurgical oncology branches had a homogenous geographic presence. Pediatric neurosurgery had the most female representation, thereby necessitating the need to uplift women in other subspecialties.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence and pattern of autofluorescence and its related cytological changes in pterygium.
METHODS: Eighty-six patients with unilateral pterygium and 76 controls were recruited. We graded pterygium, looked for autofluorescence, performed cytology of the nasal conjunctiva, repeated evaluation after 6 months, compared findings with controls, and assessed the progression of pterygium from photographs with the help of ImageJ software.
RESULTS: Autofluorescence was present in 51% of cases with pterygium. Autofluorescence at the leading edge (65.9%) was the predominant pattern seen. In total, 83.3% of grade 3 pterygia, 64.7% of grade 2 pterygia, and 28.9% of grade 1 pterygia (P value <0.0005) had autofluorescence. Impression cytology showed conjunctival epithelial cells in 60% of cases, significant squamous metaplasia in grade 3 pterygia (45%) compared with grade 2 pterygia (11.8%), and normal conjunctival epithelial cells in grade 1 pterygia (P value < 0.0005).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence and pattern of conjunctival autofluorescence and cytological changes, especially squamous metaplasia, are linked to the severity or grade of pterygium.

T2  - Journal of the Egyptian National Cancer Institute
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas are one of the most common hematological malignancies with a divergent clinical presentation, phenotype, and course of disease regulated by underlying genetic mechanism.
MAIN BODY: Genetic and molecular alterations are not only critical for lymphomagenesis but also largely responsible for differing therapeutic response in these neoplasms. In recent years, advanced molecular tools have provided a deeper understanding regarding these oncogenic drives for predicting progression as well as refractory behavior in these diseases. The prognostic models based on gene expression profiling have also been proved effective in various clinical scenarios. However, considerable overlap does exist between the genotypes of individual lymphomas and at the same time where additional molecular lesions may be associated with each entity apart from the key genetic event. Therefore, genomics is one of the cornerstones in the multimodality approach essential for classification and risk stratification of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
CONCLUSION: We hereby in this review discuss the wide range of genetic aberrancies associated with tumorigenesis, immune escape, and chemoresistance in major B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

AB  - Early identification and treatment of active tuberculosis disease among high risk household contacts could limit new transmission and better clinical outcome, thus decreasing TB burden. Host iron homeostasis is an important yet underevaluated factor in pathophysiology of tuberculosis (TB). One such protein is hepcidin which internalizes ferroportin (membrane iron transporter), thus inhibiting iron export from macrophages which is utilised by bacteria leading to disease severity. Iron homeostasis markers were evaluated in 50 pulmonary tuberculosis patients (PTB) and their household contacts to assess their utility as biomarkers for TB development. Altered iron homeostasis with significantly lower haemoglobin levels despite optimum serum iron levels was observed in PTB compared to household contacts and healthy controls pointing towards anaemia of inflammation. Higher serum hepcidin with lower ferroportin expression and hence higher ferritin levels was seen in PTB compared to both household contacts and healthy controls due to IL-6 induced hepcidin production in TB. Transferrin levels were found to be significantly lower in PTB and household contacts as compared to healthy controls owing to higher ferritin levels in PTB group. Upon infection, regulation of iron absorption is disturbed via increased hepcidin levels leading to ferroportin internalization and thus inhibition of iron export from macrophages which may lead to favourable M.tb. survival and multiplication leading to tuberculosis. Some of these markers could be assessed for early identification and treatment of active tuberculosis among high risk household contacts limiting new transmission and better clinical outcome, thus decreasing TB burden.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty in the treatment options for resectable hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings databases and trial registries were searched until November 2020 for randomized controlled trials performed on resectable hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Two systematic review authors independently identified studies and extracted data. The primary outcomes evaluated were overall survival, disease-free survival, any recurrence, local recurrence, loco-regional recurrence, distal recurrence and laryngectomy-free survival. The secondary outcomes were response rates following neoadjuvant treatment and comparison of treatment-related toxicity. Assessment of risk of bias was performed for the selected studies using Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. The studies were evaluated for the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations). Risk ratios (RR), rate ratios, and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.
RESULTS: Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review. The risk of bias was unclear or high for the trials. Non-organ preservation(n = 140) versus organ preservation (n = 144) (two trials): no statistically significant difference could be identified for any of the primary outcomes. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 37) versus sequential chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 34) (one trial): no statistically significant difference was noted between the two treatment arms for overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional recurrence. Laryngectomy-free survival was found to be superior in concurrent chemoradiotherapy arm (HR:0.28, 95% CI 0.13, 0.57). Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 53) versus induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 60) (one trial): no statistically significant difference was noted between the treatment arms for overall survival, disease-free survival and laryngectomy-free survival. Preoperative radiotherapy (n = 24) versus postoperative radiotherapy (n = 23) (one trial): overall survival was found to be better in the postoperative radiotherapy arm (HR:2.44, 95% CI1.18, 5.03). No statistically significant difference was noted in terms of treatment-related toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS: There are considerable uncertainties in the management of resectable hypopharyngeal cancer.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) alters immune responses and given the rising prevalence of DM in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries; hyperglycemia can be a potential risk factor for active TB development. However, the impact of hyperglycemia on TB-specific innate immune response in terms of macrophage functions remains poorly addressed. We assessed macrophage effector functions in uncontrolled DM patients with or without TB infection (PTB+DM and DM), non-diabetic TB patients (PTB), and non-diabetic-uninfected controls. Phagocytic capacity against BCG and surface expression of different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (CD11b, CD14, CD206, MARCO, and TLR-2) were measured via flow cytometry. Effector molecules (ROS and NO) required for bacterial killing were assessed via DCFDA and Griess reaction respectively. A systematic dysregulation in phagocytic capacity with concurrent alterations in the expression pattern of key PRRs (CD11b, MARCO, and CD206) was observed in PTB+DM. These altered PRR expressions were associated with decreased phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Similarly, ROS was aberrantly higher while NO was lower in PTB+DM. These altered macrophage functions were positively correlated with increasing disease severity. Our results highlight several key patterns of immune dysregulation against TB infection under hyperglycemic conditions and highlight a negative impact of hyperglycemia with etiology and progression of TB.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop a Personal Computer (PC) based tool to estimate the center of rotation (COR) offsets from COR projection datasets using methods mentioned in IAEA-TECDOC-602.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four COR studies were acquired on Discovery NM 630 Dual head gamma camera fitted with parallel hole collimator, and COR offsets were estimated with the software available at the terminal for processing a COR study. These COR projection images were exported in DICOM. A MATLAB script (software program) was written to estimate COR offset using Method A (using opposite pair of projections) and Method B (using curve fitting method) as mentioned in IAEA-TECDOC-602. Our program read the COR study (in DICOM) and estimated COR offsets using Method A and Method B. The accuracy of the program was verified using simulated projection dataset of a point source object acquired at 6° interval in the range of 0°-360° angle. Bland Altman plot was used for analyzing the agreement between the COR offsets estimated using (1) Method A and Method B mentioned in IAEA-TECDOC-602, and (2) Our program and vendor program available at Discovery NM 630 acquisition terminal.
RESULTS: On simulated data, offset from center of gravity (COG) in X direction (COGX) and COG in Y direction (COGY) estimated using Method A was constant (same) at each pair of angles while using Method B, it was found to be in the range (-2 × 10-10, 1 × 10-10) which is negligible. Most of the differences (23 out of 24) between the result of Method A and Method B, and between the results of our program and vendor program was found to be within 95% confidence interval (mean ± 1.96 standard deviation).
CONCLUSIONS: Our PC-based tool to estimate COR offsets from COR projection datasets using methods mentioned in IAEA-TECDOC-602 was found to be accurate and provides results in agreement with vendor's program. It can be used as an independent tool to estimate COR offset for standardization and calibration purposes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Wavelet transforms of an image result in set of wavelet coefficients. Thresholding eliminates insigniﬁcant coefficients while retaining the significant ones (resulting in matrix having few nonzero elements that need to be stored). The compressed image is reconstructed by applying inverse wavelet transform. The quality of compressed image deteriorates with increase in compression. Hence, finding optimum value of scale and threshold is a challenging task. The objective of the study was to find the optimum value of scale and threshold for compressing 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99 mTc-MDP) bone scan images using Haar wavelet transform.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Haar wavelet transform at scale 1-8 was applied on 106 99 mTc-MDP whole-body bone scan images, and wavelet coefficients were threshold at 90, 95, 97, and 99 percentiles, followed by inverse wavelet transform to get 3392 compressed images. Nuclear medicine physician (NMP) compared compressed image with its corresponding input to label it as acceptable or unacceptable. The values of scale and threshold that resulted in majority of acceptable images were considered to be optimum. The quality of compressed image was also evaluated using perception image quality evaluator (PIQE) image quality metrics. Compression ratio was calculated by dividing the number of nonzero elements after thresholding wavelet coefficients by the number of nonzero elements in Haar decomposed matrix.
RESULTS: NMP found quality of compressed images (obtained at scale 2 and 90 percentile threshold) identical to the quality of the corresponding input images. As per PIQE score, quality of compressed images was perceptually better than that of the corresponding input images.
CONCLUSIONS: The optimum values of scale and threshold were determined to be 2 and 90 percentiles, respectively.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this pilot study, we have proposed and evaluated pipelined application of the dynamic stochastic resonance (DSR) algorithm and block-matching 3D (BM3D) filter for the enhancement of nuclear medicine images. The enhanced images out of the pipeline were compared with the corresponding enhanced images obtained using individual applications of DSR and BM3D algorithm.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty 99m-Tc MDP bone scan images acquired on SymbiaT6 SPECT/CT gamma camera system fitted with low-energy high-resolution collimators were exported in DICOM format to a personal computer and converted into PNG format. These PNG images were processed using the proposed algorithm in MATLAB. Two nuclear medicine physicians visually compared each input and its corresponding three enhanced images to select the best-enhanced image. The image quality metrics (Brightness, Global Contrast Factor (GCF), Contrast per pixel (CPP), and Blur) were used to assess the image quality objectively. The Wilcoxon signed test was applied to find a statistically significant difference in Brightness, GCF, CPP, and Blur of enhanced and its input images at a level of significance.
RESULTS: Images enhanced using the pipelined application of SR and BM3D were selected as the best images by both nuclear medicine physicians. Based on Brightness, Global Contrast Factor (GCF), CPP, and Blur, the image quality of our proposed pipeline was significantly better than enhanced images obtained using individual applications of DSR and BM3D algorithm. The proposed method was found to be very successful in enhancing details in the low count region of input images. The enhanced images were bright, smooth, and had better target-to-background ratio compared to input images.
CONCLUSION: The pipelined application of DSR and BM3D algorithm produced enhancement in nuclear medicine images having following characteristics: bright, smooth, better target-to-background ratio, and improved visibility of details in the low count regions of the input image, as compared to individual enhancements by application of DSR or BM3D algorithm.

AB  - Objective  In the present study, we have used machine learning algorithm to accomplish the task of automated detection of poor-quality scintigraphic images. We have validated the accuracy of our machine learning algorithm on 99m Tc-methyl diphosphonate ( 99m Tc-MDP) bone scan images. Materials and Methods  Ninety-nine patients underwent 99mTC-MDP bone scan acquisition twice at two different acquisition speeds, one at low speed and another at double the speed of the first scan, with patient lying in the same position on the scan table. The low-speed acquisition resulted in good-quality images and the high-speed acquisition resulted in poor-quality images. The principal component analysis (PCA) of all the images was performed and the first 32 principal components (PCs) were retained as feature vectors of the image. These 32 feature vectors of each image were used for the classification of images into poor or good quality using machine learning algorithm (multivariate adaptive regression splines [MARS]). The data were split into two sets, that is, training set and test set in the ratio of 60:40. Hyperparameter tuning of the model was done in which five-fold cross-validation was performed. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to select the optimal model using the largest value of area under the ROC curve. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the classification of poor- and good-quality images were taken as metrics for the performance of the algorithm. Result  Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model in classifying poor-quality and good-quality images were 93.22, 93.22, and 93.22%, respectively, for the training dataset and 86.88, 80, and 93.7%, respectively, for the test dataset. Conclusion  Machine learning algorithms can be used to classify poor- and good-quality images with good accuracy (86.88%) using 32 PCs as the feature vector and MARS as the classification model.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In this study, the optimal input parameters point spread function (PSF) and the number of iterations of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm were experimentally determined to restore Tc-99 m methyl diphosphonate (MDP) whole-body bone scan images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experiment was performed on 60 anonymized Tc-99 m MDP whole-body bone scan images. Ten images were used for estimating the optimum value of PSF and the number of iterations to restore scintigraphic images. The remaining 50 images were used for validation of estimated parameters. The image quality of observed and restored images was assessed objectively using blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE), mean brightness (MB), discrete entropy (DE), and edge-based contrast measure (EBCM) image quality metrics. Image quality was subjectively assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) by comparing the restored image quality with observed image quality and assigning a score to each image on the scale of 0-5.
RESULTS: Based on BRISQUE, MB, DE, and EBCM scores, the restored images were significantly sharper, less bright, had more detailed information, and had less contrast around edges compared to the input images. The restored images had improved resolution based on visual assessment as well; NMPs assigned an average image quality score of 4.00 to restored images. Maximum resolution enhancement was noticed at PSF (size: 11 pixels, sigma: 1.75 pixels) and the number of iterations = 10. With the increase in the number of iterations, noise also gets amplified along with resolution enhancement and affects the detectability of small lesions; in the case of relatively low noisy input images, the number of iterations = 5 gave better results.
CONCLUSION: Tc-99 m MDP bone scan images were restored to improve image quality using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The optimum value of the PSF parameter was found to be of size = 11 pixels and sigma = 1.75 pixels.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to find the optimum value of threshold for compression of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan images using discrete cosine transformation (DCT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCT was applied to 51 99mTc-MDP bone scan images and then the image of logarithmic value of DCT coefficients was inspected to determine the threshold. After inspecting the number of images of DCT coefficients, we estimated the appropriate value of the threshold to be 10. After the application of threshold = 10, compressed image was reconstructed by applying the inverse DCT. Compression factor was calculated by dividing the nonzero element after thresholding to the nonzero element before thresholding DCT coefficients. Nuclear medicine physicians compared the compressed images with its input images and labeled them as acceptable or unacceptable. During comparison of input and compressed images, we considered points such as smoothening, blocking artifacts, body contour, gap between closely placed lesions, and detectability of lesion.
RESULTS: Forty-four compressed images (out of 51 images) obtained at threshold 10 were acceptable to Nuclear Medicine Physician (NMP). Compressed images were less noisy compared to its input image. Compression factor was found to be 13.03 ± (minimum = 2.71, maximum = 42.92).
CONCLUSION: The optimum value of threshold for compression of 99mTc-MDP bone scan images was found to be 10, and the average compression factor achieved was equal to 13.03 (92.30%).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Estimation of residual risk (RR) is necessary to understand status of blood safety with current testing strategies and need to improve it further. These estimates from India are lacking till date. Present study was aimed to estimate RR and incident rate (IR) of transfusion transmitted infectious disease (TTIDs) in Indian setting.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood donor demographic data, serological testing results and nucleic acid testing (NAT) screening results were collected retrospectively from January 2015 to June 2017. Mathematical modelling using NAT yield/window period model was done to estimate IR and RR of TTIDs. Data was compared between different groups based on age-group, gender, donation repeatability and type of donor.
RESULTS: A total 106 119 blood donors donated 109 441 units with overall TTID reactivity of 2.22%. HBV was most prevalent TTID (1.26%) with RR of 16.1 per million followed by HCV and HIV with RR of 4.4 and 3.1 per million donations, respectively. NAT testing variably reduced RR ranging from 69.4% to 96.1% depending on TTID. Younger, repeat and voluntary donors had significantly lower prevalence of TTIDs compared to older, first time and replacement donors.
DISCUSSION: Gaps in the blood safety could be bridged significantly by implementing NAT testing and using quality serological assays. Comparatively high RR despite using quality serological assays and ID-NAT testing highlights need to develop long term strategies to improve blood safety by focusing on improving donor pool by recruiting regular voluntary donors among youth and imparting knowledge of healthy practices.

AB  - The question of how lung cancer progresses in never-smokers remains largely unanswered. In our analysis of data from 1727 lung cancer patients, we observed a difference of only 47 days in the overall survival between lung adenocarcinoma patients who were smokers vis-a-vis never-smokers - the disease has a poor prognosis irrespective of the smoking status, or gender. We have investigated the possible collaboration between the nAChR and hypoxia signaling pathway to explicate a mechanism of disease progression in never-smokers using patient-derived tumor cells. We found a previously unidentified increase in both acetylcholine and nAChR-α7 levels in non-small cell lung cancer cells in hypoxia. A similar increase in ubiquitously expressed nAChR-α7 transcripts was also observed in other cancer lines and primary tumor tissues. A direct binding of HIF-1α with the hypoxia-response element (HRE) present at -48 position preceding the transcriptional start site in nAChR-α7 promoter region was established. Crucially, the increased acetylcholine levels in hypoxia drove a feedback loop via modulation of PI3K/AKT pathway to stabilize HIF-1α in hypoxia. Further, hypoxia-mediated metastasis and induction of HIF-1α in these cells was significantly reversed by bungarotoxin, an antagonist of nAChR-α7. The nAChR-AKT-HIF network needs to be further investigated to conclusively prove its mechanism and to explore its therapeutic potential. Our study gives a plausible explanation for the equally worse prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma in never-smokers wherein the nAChR signaling is enhanced in hypoxia by acetylcholine in the absence of nicotine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy is a common dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel. To date, there is no effective strategy to prevent paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. A recent small phase II study demonstrated the potential role of oral gabapentin in this setting. This phase III study is aimed to assess the efficacy of oral gabapentin in preventing paclitaxel-induced neuropathy.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of oral gabapentin with placebo in preventing clinically significant peripheral neuropathy (NCI CTCAEv5.0 grade 2 or higher) in patients receiving paclitaxel.
METHODS: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial. The primary outcome is the development of grade 2 or higher chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Secondary outcomes include any grade neuropathy, the percentage change in sensory nerve conduction velocities in peripheral nerves, time to development of any grade neuropathy, paclitaxel dose reductions and delays due to peripheral neuropathy, patient-reported outcomes, adverse events, and adherence to oral therapy. A total of 136 patients receiving paclitaxel will be randomly allocated (stratified by weekly vs. non-weekly administration) to receive either oral gabapentin or placebo till three weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy or occurrence of the primary outcome.
CONCLUSION: This study aims to find if oral gabapentin reduces the incidence of grade 2 or higher chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients receiving paclitaxel.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered prospectively with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2022/02/040030) on April 4, 2022.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Airway management in children is always challenging and becomes a concern if required in the lateral position. We evaluated the efficacy of orotracheal intubation using the Air-Q intubating laryngeal Airway (Air-Q ILA) in supine and lateral positions in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study included 100 children weighing 7-30 kg, scheduled for elective surgeries under general anesthesia. They were randomized into the supine (S) group or lateral (L) group. After anesthesia induction, the child was placed in a standard sniffing position for conventional laryngoscopy in the S group, and the child was turned into the lateral position in the L group. Both Air-Q ILA and endotracheal tube were placed blindly in the supine position in the S group and lateral position in group L. The grading of glottic view, success rate, insertion time of the Air-Q ILA, and endotracheal intubation were noted in both the groups.
RESULTS: The Air-Q ILA was successfully placed at the first attempt in 47 children in group S and 48 in group L. The overall blind orotracheal intubations, including first and second attempts, were successful in 45 children in the S group and 47 in the L group (P = 0.715). Eighty percent of patients in group L and 70% in group S had glottis grade 1 or 2 compared to grade 3, 4,5 (P = 0.249). The mean time of Air-Q ILA placement in groups S and L was 15.73 ± 5.64 s and 14.42 ± 4.16 s (P = 0.195). The mean duration of blind endotracheal intubation through the Air-Q ILA was 24.88 ± 14.75 s in group S and 17.57 ± 5.35 s in group L (P = 0.002). In both the groups, none of the children had bronchospasm, laryngospasm, desaturation, or aspiration. The airway trauma evident by blood staining on the Air-Q ILA on removal was revealed in 2 cases in group S, and 3 cases in group L. None of the children in group S and 4 children in group L had postoperative stridor. Postoperative hoarseness was reported in 3 children in group S and none in group L within 24 hours.
CONCLUSION: The Air-Q ILA can be used as a conduit for blind orotracheal intubation in children in both supine and lateral positions while maintaining an effective airway seal.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether the rigid fixation at one site and functional fixation at other site is enough in double mandibular fractures (DMF). The specific aim of the study was assessment of masticatory function on the basis of bite force and other clinical parameters.
METHODS: A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted on patients having DMF. The patients were randomized into 3 groups. Group-1, managed with 2-miniplates at anterior and 1-miniplate at posterior site, group-2 patients managed with one 2.4 mm reconstruction plate at anterior and 1-miniplate at posterior site and in group-3, both fractures were managed with 1-reconstruction plate. Primary outcome variable was bite force. Secondary outcome variables were type of fracture, pain, swelling, mobility between fracture segments, occlusal discrepancy, paresthesia, implant exposure/fracture.
RESULTS: The study sample included 60 (20 in each group) patients with mean age of 29.28 ± 12.35 years. Statistically significant difference was seen in bite force from preoperative to follow-up (p = 0.0) in all the groups. Difference in bite force was statistically significant between group 1 and 2 (p = 0.0) and group 1 and 3 (p = 0.0) at follow-up but the difference was statistically insignificant between group 2 and 3.
CONCLUSION: The present study concludes that treatment of DMF with rigid fixation at one site and functional fixation at other fracture site provides enough fixation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is currently poorly understood. This exploratory study aimed to identify potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in IIH cases compared to controls using SWATH-MS proteomics approach.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CSF samples were collected prospectively from IIH cases and control subjects which were subjected to SWATH-MS based untargeted proteomics. Proteins with fold change > 1.5 or < 0.67 and p-value < 0.05 were considered significantly differentially expressed. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027751. Statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2.
RESULTS: We included CSF samples from 33 subjects, consisting of 13 IIH cases and 20 controls. A total of 262 proteins were identified in Proteinpilot search. Through SWATH analysis, we quantified 232 proteins. We observed 37 differentially expressed proteins between the two groups with 24 upregulated and 13 downregulated proteins. There were two differential proteins among overweight versus non-overweight IIH cases. Network for 23 proteins was highly connected in the interaction analysis.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Neurosecretory, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory proteins were predominantly involved in causing IIH. This exploratory study served as a platform to identify 37 differentially expressed proteins in IIH and also showed significant differences between overweight and non-overweight IIH patients.

AB  - Sildenafil is the first internationally approved drug for erectile dysfunction. Unsupervised and non-prescribed use of sildenafil among young Indian population has increased in last few years. Sildenafil helps in erection of penis by inhibiting the action of Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) enzyme, present in the vasculature of corpus cavernosum muscle and lengthens the duration of erection. Documented adverse effects of sildenafil are headache, flushing, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, and slight decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. We present a rare case of sudden death due to cerebrovascular hemorrhage after sildenafil use and concomitant alcohol intake. The history is that a 41-year-old male with no significant past medical and surgical history was staying at a hotel room with a female friend; he had consumed 2 tablets of sildenafil (50 mg each) and alcohol at night. Next morning, he developed uneasiness following which he was taken to the Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival. The important autopsy findings include edematous brain with about 300 g of clotted blood in the right basal ganglia extending to bilateral ventricles, and in pons region. Other significant findings on microscopic examination were hypertrophic ventricular wall of heart, fatty changes in liver and acute tubular necrosis and hypertensive changes in the kidney. The findings are discussed in the light of the literature about the lethal complications of combined use of sildenafil and alcohol including cerebrovascular accidents. As a forensic pathologist it is the duty of the doctor to execute meticulous autopsy along with ancillary investigations including toxicological analysis and to correlate all these findings to determine the possible effects of drugs when present, so as to gather knowledge about potentially fatal drugs and further create public awareness regarding the same.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the clinical characteristics of uveitis in patients presenting to a tertiary care institute in the northern part of India, predominantly serving the population of Himalayan belt.
METHODS: In this retrospective descriptive case series, data of 141 eyes of 102 patients diagnosed between January 2019 and January 2021 were analyzed. Patients were diagnosed, named, and meshed as per the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature. A panel of investigations (systemic and ocular ancillary investigations) were done, which was individualized according to the clinical picture.
RESULTS: The mean age of presentation was 39.1 ± 14.62 years. A male predominance (62.7%) was noted. Unilateral presentation was seen in 61.8% of patients. Specific etiological diagnosis was not reached in 56.7% of cases. The incidence of infectious and noninfectious uveitis was 23.4% and 19.9%, respectively. The frequency of anterior, intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis was 23.4%, 11.3%, 46.8%, and 18.5%, respectively. Posterior uveitis was the most frequent anatomical location (46.8%). Tuberculous uveitis was the most common definitive etiology irrespective of location (18.5%). Anterior, intermediate, and posterior uveitis were more frequently idiopathic in origin. Sympathetic ophthalmitis was the most common cause for panuveitis.
CONCLUSION: Uveitis significantly affected the working age group population. Despite the evolution of diagnostic investigations, etiology remained unknown in many cases of uveitis. Infectious etiology was more common. Posterior uveitis as the most frequent anatomical location in our study may be attributed to the tertiary care referral bias.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Picture-naming tests (PNTs) evaluate linguistic impairment in dementia due to semantic memory impairment, impaired lexical retrieval or perceptual deficits. They also assess the decline in naming impairment at various stages of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that occurs due to progressive cognitive impairment. With the increasing numbers of people with dementia globally, it is necessary to have validated naming tests and norms that are culturally and linguistically appropriate.
AIMS: In this cross-sectional study we harmonized a set of 30 images applicable to the Indian context across five languages and investigated the picture-naming performance in patients with MCI and dementia.
METHODS & PROCEDURES: A multidisciplinary expert group formed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) collaborated towards developing and adapting a picture naming test (PNT) known as the ICMR-PNT in five Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Based on cross-cultural adaptation guidelines and item-wise factor analysis and correlations established separately across five languages, the final version of the ICMR-PNT test was developed. A total of 368 controls, 123 dementia and 128 MCI patients were recruited for the study. Psychometric properties of the adapted version of the ICMR-PNT were examined, and sensitivity and specificity were examined.
OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The ICMR-PNT scores in all languages combined were higher in controls compared with patients with dementia and MCI (F2, 615 = 139.85; p < 0.001). Furthermore, PNT scores for MCI was higher in comparison with patients with dementia in all languages combined (p < 0.001). The area under the curve across the five languages ranged from 0.81 to 1.00 for detecting dementia. There was a negative correlation between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and ICMR-PNT scores and a positive correlation between Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) and ICMR-PNT scores in control and patient groups.
CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: The ICMR-PNT was developed by following cross-cultural adaptation guidelines and establishing correlations using item-wise factor analysis across five languages. This adapted PNT was found to be a reliable tool when assessing naming abilities effectively in mild to moderate dementia in a linguistically diverse context.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on this subject Picture-naming evaluates language impairment linked to naming difficulties due to semantic memory, lexical retrieval or perceptual disturbances. As a result, picture naming tests (PNTs) play an important role in the diagnosis of dementia. In a heterogeneous population such as India, there is a need for a common PNT that can be used across the wide range of languages. What this study adds to existing knowledge PNTs such as the Boston Naming Test (BNT) were developed for the educated, mostly English-speaking, Western populations and are not appropriate for use in an Indian context. To overcome this challenge, a PNT was harmonized in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam) and we report the patterns of naming difficulty in patients with MCI and dementia. The ICMR-PNT demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy when distinguishing patients with mild to moderate dementia from cognitively normal individuals. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? With the growing number of persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia around the world, its critical to have culturally and linguistically relevant naming tests and diagnosis. This validated ICMR-PNT can be used widely as a clinical tool to diagnose dementia and harmonize research efforts across diverse populations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe a case of presumed bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) associated with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and provide an updated review of literature.
OBSERVATIONS: A 58-year-old man, with a history of radical nephrectomy for RCC 8 years ago, presented with gradual diminution of vision. Based on multimodal imaging and detailed systemic evaluation, a diagnosis of presumed BDUMP and metastatic RCC was made. He was started on sunitinib malate as palliative chemotherapy. However, he refused plasmapheresis for BDUMP. The patient rapidly developed bilateral exudative retinal detachment. Subsequently, he progressed to bilateral neovascular glaucoma secondary to closed funnel retinal detachment. Eventually, he was lost to follow up after 13 months.
CONCLUSIONS & IMPORTANCE: BDUMP portends an underlying advanced systemic malignancy. Studies have not conclusively proven any definite treatment for BDUMP and survival is generally poor. Ocular side effects of palliative targeted chemotherapy for the primary malignancy, such as sunitinib, should be borne in mind.

AB  - PURPOSE: Brain imaging is needed when investigating epilepsy. Imaging options available include MRI and CT scan which may be non-contrast (NCCT) or contrast-enhanced (CECT). The specific clinical question and probable epilepsy substrate in the epidemiological context and socioeconomic milieu are important in determining the choice of imaging. In patients with well-controlled focal or unknown epilepsy who are unlikely to be surgical candidates, is CECT essential or can NCCT be an acceptable choice?
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in India. Consecutive patients with focal or unknown epilepsy who were relatively well-controlled on medical treatment underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Three neuroradiologists independently reported the images. Proportion of abnormalities missed on NCCT and picked only on CECT were determined. How often abnormalities picked on CECT changed patient management was also analysed.
RESULTS: Two hundred and nineteen patients with focal (87 %) or unknown (13 %) epilepsy underwent NCCT followed by CECT brain. Most had epilepsy for >3 months and an annual seizure frequency of 2-10 seizures. There was a nearly perfect inter-observer agreement between 3 neuroradiologists in reporting the NCCT and CECT as 'normal' or 'abnormal' with kappa (κ) values of 0.9 and 1.0 respectively. The sensitivity of NCCT compared to CECT in detecting an abnormality was 97 % (CI 92.6 - 99.5 %) and the specificity was 99 % (CI 94.9 - 99.9 %). There was no significant difference in the proportion of NCCTs and CECTs found abnormal (50.22 % vs 51.14 %, p = 0.91). A solitary calcified granuloma was the most common abnormality reported on NCCT as well as CECT, 21.0 % and 19.1 % respectively. New findings picked on CECT alone, did not change management in any patient.
CONCLUSION: When imaging focal or unknown epilepsy, an NCCT performs as well as a CECT, especially in regions where calcified lesions contribute a significant etiological burden. The role of imaging in epilepsy varies between patients and a universal recommendation of an MRI or a CECT in all patients is neither cost-efficient nor evidence-based. In drug responsive focal or unknown epilepsy of longstanding duration, CT scans are either normal or have calcified lesions that are easily picked on NCCT.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adolescent girls face challenges in menstrual hygiene in routine patterns which impacts their education and health. A qualitative study was undertaken to assess the knowledge and practices regarding menstruation in a rural community of Haryana and to identify the barriers to menstrual hygiene.
METHODOLOGY: The study was conducted in the month of September 2019 among various stakeholders i.e. adolescent females, adolescent males, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, Anganwadi workers, school teachers and Medical Officers. The stakeholders were mapped with the help of a Multi-Purpose Health Worker and ASHA of the village. Interview guides for focus group discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview (IDI) were prepared from previous literature to understand menstrual health management among the stakeholders.
RESULTS: After IDI and FGD, we found that there is a barrier to accessibility of regular sanitary pads, a lack of education on menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls. School absenteeism was a concern due to the unavailability of mechanisms for the disposal of sanitary pads in school and poor maintenance of toilets.
CONCLUSION: Proper implementation of the Adolescent Reproductive Sexual Health program and Menstrual health education can improve the use and reduce stigma and ignorance. Free uninterrupted supply of sanitary pads through school and Anganwadi will help improving accessibility and separate toilets for girls would lead to a reduction in absenteeism.

AB  - Immune check point inhibitors such as nivolumab are changing the treatment paradigm of relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (r/rHL). Data from single arm studies have shown nivolumab to be an effective and safe therapy. Real world data from resource constrained settings are limited. Our study is a retrospective single center analysis of nivolumab in r/rHL from India. Data regarding baseline and pretreatment characteristics were collected for 20 patients treated with nivolumab from January 2016 to March 2021. Of 20, 15 patients received nivolumab in modified protocol, because of financial limitations. Postnivolumab therapy, the overall response rate was 90%, with 40% in complete remission. The median progression free survival was 13.1 month (95% confidence interval 8.33 mo, not reached) and median overall survival not reached, at a follow up of 24.3 months. No patients discontinued nivolumab because of side effects. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed no effect of dose reduction or increased duration of administration. Most common adverse effect seen was autoimmune hypothyroidism. Possible delayed immune-related side effects were seen in 3 out 5 patients in peritransplant period, in those who received nivolumab as salvage regimen before autologous stem cell transplant. In conclusion, nivolumab shows comparable efficacy and safety even with compromised dosing and schedule of administration of the drug in real world setting.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Carboplatin increases the pathological complete remission (pCR) rate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) when added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, evidence on its effect on survival outcomes is controversial.
METHODS: The study was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021228386). We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and conference proceedings from January 1, 2004 to January 30, 2022 for relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients, with carboplatin in the intervention arm and standard anthracycline taxane (AT) in the control arm. PRISMA guidelines were used for this review. Data were pooled using fixed and random effects models as appropriate on extracted hazard ratios (HR). Individual patient data (IPD)for disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted from published survival curves of included RCTs; DFS and OS curves for each trial and the combined population were reconstructed, and HR estimated. The primary outcome was DFS; OS, pCR, and toxicity were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Eight trials with 2425 patients were included. Carboplatin improved DFS (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78; I2 45%, p < 0.001) compared with AT at trial level and IPD level (HR 0.66; 95%CI, 0.55 to 0.80, p < 0.001) analysis. The OS also improved with carboplatin at both trial level (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.95, I2 41%, p = 0.02) and IPD level (HR 0.68; 95%CI, 0.54 to 0.87, p = 0.002) analysis. The pCR as expected, was better in the carboplatin arm (OR 2.11; 95% CI = 1.44-3.08; I2 67%, p = 0.009). Anaemia and thrombocytopaenia were higher in the carboplatin arm.
CONCLUSION: and relevance: Carboplatin added to (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC improves survival, as shown in both trial level and IPD analysis.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate if the use of a quality improvement (QI) initiative improves initiation and acceptability of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in critically ill children with respiratory distress.
METHODS: The study was carried out in 3 phases over a period of 6 mo in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in children aged 2 mo to 14 y of age. In phase 1, data were collected for 1 mo and reasons for NIV failure were identified. In phase 2, process changes like adherence to checklist, monitoring, and one-day orientation program were instituted. The plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle was carried out in each phase. In phase 3, which was for 2 mo, the acceptance of NIV was measured and results were compared with phase 1.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included, 12 in phase 1 and 25 in phase 3. NIV failure was recorded in 5 (42%) and 2 (8%) patients in phase 1 and phase 3 (p = 0.025), respectively. The cause of NIV failure was intolerance to the interface in both phases. Sedation was used in 18 (72%) patients in phase 3, as compared to 2 patients in phase 1.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a quality improvement initiative in the form of a protocol, checklist, and training of the treating team resulted in improved tolerance to NIV, and thereby, its success. Use of sedation may help improve tolerance to the interface and contribute to its success.

AB  - Patients with early breast cancer are affected by metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Metastasis to these nodes is crucial for staging and quality of surgery. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy that is currently used to assess lymph node metastasis is not effective. This necessitates identification of biomarkers that can flag metastasis. Early stage breast cancer patients were recruited. Surgical resection of breast was followed by identification of sentinel lymph nodes. Fresh frozen section biopsy was used to assign metastatic and non-metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. Discovery phase included iTRAQ proteomics coupled with mass spectrometric analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027668. Validation was done by bioinformatic analysis and ELISA. There were 2398 unique protein groups and 109 differentially expressed proteins comparing metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. Forty nine proteins were up-regulated, and sixty proteins that were down regulated in metastatic group. Bioinformatic analysis showed ECM-receptor interaction pathways to be implicated in lymph node metastasis. ELISA confirmed up-regulation of ECM proteins in metastatic lymph nodes. ECM proteins have requisite parameters to be developed as a diagnostic tool to assess status of sentinel lymph nodes to guide surgical intervention in early breast cancer.

AU  - Patra, Bichitra Nanda
AU  - Patil, Vaibhav
AU  - Balhara, Yatan Pal Singh
AU  - Khandelwal, Sudhir K.
T2  - The International Journal of Social Psychiatry
AB  - BACKGROUND: One of the barriers to effective care in patients with depression is stigma associated with having a mental disorder, which also acts as a barrier to recovery and increases the disability.
AIMS: To study the stigma and disabilities experienced by the patients with depressive disorders seeking treatment in a tertiary care hospital.
METHODOLOGY: Fifty patients diagnosed to have depressive disorder as per ICD-10 were recruited by convenient sampling. To measure the stigma, the Discrimination and Stigma Scale -12 was applied. The severity of depression was determined by applying Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). The disability was calculated by using WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0.
RESULTS: Fifty percentages of the participants reported unfair treatment and they experienced discrimination in at least one life domain. There was significant positive correlation between unfair treatment subscale of stigma and disability. Around one fourth of the participants reported to be treated unfairly by their own families. Seventy percent reported to have concealed their mental health problems, 54% have stopped themselves from having a close personal relationship and 32% didn't apply for work in anticipating discrimination. Experienced and anticipated discrimination were significantly associated with concealing the mental health problem.
CONCLUSION: Stigma due to having depression acts as a barrier to vocational & social integration and functional recovery. Concealment of the diagnosis of depression is itself barrier for help seeking and to receiving appropriate treatment. Small sample size and adopting the purposive sampling method are the limitations of the study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The reported incidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is 3-8% in patients with solid tumours. More commonly, it has been described in the setting of advanced cancers of the lung, breast and malignant melanoma.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old diabetic patient with recurrent unresectable squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right retromolar trigone (rT4bN0M0) presented with severe low backache and weakness in bilateral lower limbs 20 days after the completion of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the spine showed multiple nodular enhancing leptomeningeal lesions at the lumbar level and an intramedullary T2/FLAIR-hyperintense longitudinal lesion involving the central cord from C2 to C7 vertebral levels, suggestive of leptomeningeal metastases. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed pleocytosis, elevated protein and markedly decreased glucose. The CSF cytology revealed scattered large atypical cells, suspicious for metastasis. Non-contrast MRI of the brain showed a T2/FLAIR-hyperintense lesion involving the right caudate nucleus suggestive of either an acute infarct with haemorrhagic transformation or a haemorrhagic brain metastasis. During assessment, he had high-grade fever and was started on empirical intravenous antibiotics (ceftriaxone, vancomycin and subsequently meropenem) in line with the management for acute bacterial meningitis. Gram staining of CSF did not demonstrate the presence of any bacteria and the specimen was sterile on culture. He did not respond to empirical antibiotics, had a progressive downhill course and eventually died due to aspiration pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: This brief report highlights the importance of awareness of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis as a possible cause of backache with sensorimotor deficit and autonomic dysfunction in a previously treated case of head and neck SCC.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This is a diagnostic test research study to evaluate the various existing methods of thyroid examination and their comparison with the novel modified Rose method. It also aims to measure inter-examiner variation in clinical findings based on the level of education and training, as compared to ultrasonography.
METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital with 83 patients presenting to surgery OPD with neck swelling. Each patient was examined by one trained Junior Resident and a Surgery Consultant with all the four methods and with ultrasonography. Data was analysed by Stata-14, agreement between the two categorical variables was assessed by Kappa. In case of continuous variable agreement was assessed by Intra class correlation and Bland-Altman plot.
RESULTS: Modified Rose method by the consultant has the highest sensitivity (98%) and diagnostic odds (210) as compared to others but its specificity ranges from 46.7-91.1% to diagnose retro-sternal extension of a goiter. It has 93.98% agreement for identification of nodules. It has a high specificity (Consultant - 100%, Resident - 95.5%) with relatively lower sensitivity (Consultant - 94%, Resident - 86.8%) to diagnose solitary thyroid nodule (STN) but the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing a multinodular goitre (MNG) was high. However, the highest sensitivity to diagnose STN was highest with Crile's method, but specificity was low. Lahey's method was a better clinical method to palpate lymph nodes compared to the other three.
CONCLUSION: Examination in modified Rose's position is a better method of clinical examination of thyroid especially in patients with occult substernal extension. Lahey's method is a better method to examine cervical lymph nodes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergency physicians are acutely aware of the consequences of missing fatal diagnoses for acute non-traumatic chest pain and subjecting patients to over-testing. In the large arsenal of tests that are available to us, a triple rule-out computed tomography (TRO-CT) Angiography is often less pursued, due to concerns about their efficacy and safety or because of nescience. We aim to find the yield of the test in an Indian emergency setting and impart some knowledge about it along the way.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six patients who presented to the emergency department of our institute with acute chest pain, with non-specific electrocardiogram (ECG) findings and negative serial troponin I, underwent TRO-CT. HEART scores of all patients, calculated at their presentation, were correlated with TRO-CT findings.
RESULTS: Triple rule-out computed tomography angiography was positive in 5 patients (20%), of which 4 cases (16%) were diagnosed to have significant coronary artery disease and one had an acute pulmonary embolism. All 4 patients who had significant coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosed by TRO-CT had a HEART score of intermediate risk. The mean effective radiation dose of the entire TRO study was 19.024 ± 3.319 mSv (range = 13.89-25.95 mSv).
CONCLUSION: Triple rule-out CT angiography is a useful tool in the evaluation of patients presenting with acute chest pain in the emergency and can be an important adjunct in ruling out significant CAD in intermediate-risk patients. Emergency physicians and young residents need to know about this tool in their armamentarium to tackle doubtful cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is an underdiagnosed and life-threatening condition. Histopathological diagnosis is difficult due to the risks and variable diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy.
OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical profile and compare the diagnostic criteria of CS in a cohort of sarcoidosis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of the Sarcoidosis database (375 patients) was performed to identify patients with CS. Demographic and clinical details were retrieved. We applied the available diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of CS: The World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Diseases (WASOG), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), and Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) criteria.
RESULTS: Out of the 375 patients, 15 (4%) were identified with CS. The median age was 41 years, and 53% were female. The most common symptoms were breathlessness, palpitation, and fatigue in 80%, 53.3%, and 46.6% of patients, respectively. Tuberculin positivity (≥ 10mm induration) was seen in 26.6%. 80% and 53.3% of the patients had abnormal ECG and 2D echocardiography findings, respectively. Six patients had a history of Ventricular tachycardia (40%). LV Ejection fraction was reduced in 12 subjects (80%). Cardiac-MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in 53.3%. A definitive histopathological diagnosis for sarcoidosis was established in 86.6% (13/15) patients. Of the 15, all satisfied JMHW criteria and WASOG criteria (12 (80%) at least probable category, 3 (20%) possible CS), and 13 (86.6%) met HRS criteria for a diagnosis of CS.
CONCLUSION: In a cohort of 375 patients with sarcoidosis in a tuberculosis endemic setting, 4% were diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis. Histopathological diagnosis may be obtained by sampling from extracardiac sites. JMHW and WASOG criteria perform equally well in TB endemic settings.

AB  - Aim of the study: Activating Transforming factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress induced gene and closely associated with neuro-inflammation while Transforming growth Factor Beta (TGFβ) signalling is also reported to be involved in neuro-inflammation and hyper-excitability associated with drug resistant epilepsy. Animal model studies indicate the involvement of ATF3 and TGFβ receptors to promote epileptogenesis. Human studies also show that TGFβ signalling is activated in MTLE-HS. However, lack of studies on ATF3 and TGFβRI expression in MTLE-HS patients exists. We hypothesize that ATF3 and TGFβRI might be expressed in hippocampi of patients with MTLE-HS and playing role in epileptogenesis. Materials & methods: Protein expression of ATF3 and TGFβRI was performed by western blotting. Localisation of ATF3 was performed by immunohistochemistry and immunoflorescence. Results: Protein expression of ATF3 and TGFβRI was significantly up-regulated in hippocampi of patients as compared to controls. Also ATF3 IR was significantly expressed in hippocampi of patients and ATF3 was expressed predominantly in cytoplasm as compared to nucleus. No correlation was found between ATF3 expression and epilepsy duration and seizure frequency. Conclusions: ATF3 and TGFβRI are both important players in neuro-inflammation and might potentiate epileptogenesis in these patients.

AU  - Pegu, Baby

T2  - Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia
AB  - The patient with Long QT syndrome (LQTS) presents a unique challenge to the anesthesiologist. The anesthetic management of such patients requires a good knowledge of the pathophysiology of this rare disease. General anesthesia (GA) or combined spinal epidural anesthesia (CSEA) are the most preferred anesthetic techniques among anesthesiologists for such patients posted for the lower segment cesarean section delivery. In this report, we would like to share our experience of anesthetic management of a young primigravida, a case of symptomatic LQTS with a permanent pacemaker in situ. Anesthetic technique used for the lower segment cesarean section delivery was single-shot spinal anesthesia using a combination of a local anesthetic and strong opioid in the lumber subarachnoid space. Until recently, only one report in the literature has described this single-shot spinal technique for such cases. The advantages of single shot spinal over GA and CSEA can be utilized in a select group of these patients, which include fast onset, dense, reliable block with low local anesthetic toxicity, reduced catecholamine release, and relatively prolonged analgesia when combined with an opioid.

AB  - Background Studies from high income countries suggest improved survival for females as compared to males following trauma. However, data regarding differences in trauma outcomes between females and males is severely lacking from low- and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to determine the association between sex and clinical outcomes amongst Indian trauma patients using the Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration database. Methods A prospective multicentre cohort study was performed across four urban public hospitals in India April 2016 through February 2018. Bivariate analyses compared admission physiological parameters and mechanism of injury. Logistic regression assessed association of sex with the primary outcomes of 30-day and 24-hour in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, ICU length of stay, ventilator requirement, and time on a ventilator. Results Of 8,605 patients, 1,574 (18.3%) were females. The most common mechanism of injury was falls for females (52.0%) and road traffic injury for males (49.5%). On unadjusted analysis, there was no difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality between females (11.6%) and males (12.6%, p = 0.323). However, females demonstrated a lower mortality at 24-hours (1.1% vs males 2.1%, p = 0.011) on unadjusted analysis. Females were also less likely to require a ventilator (17.3% vs 21.0% males, p = 0.001) or ICU admission (34.4% vs 37.5%, p = 0.028). Stratification by age or by ISS demonstrated no difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality for males vs females across age and ISS categories. On multivariable regression analysis, sex was not associated significantly with 30-day or 24-hour in-hospital mortality. Conclusion This study did not demonstrate a significant difference in the 30-day trauma mortality or 24-hour trauma mortality between female and male trauma patients in India on adjusted analyses. A more granular data is needed to understand the interplay of injury severity, immediate post-traumatic hormonal and immunological alterations, and the impact of gender-based disparities in acute care settings.

AB  - While considerable information exists on the ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutational landscape in AML, the information on TET2 expression is limiting. So, we aimed to study the TET2 expression at mRNA and protein levels in AML patients compared to healthy controls. To achieve this, we recruited 70 non-M3, de novo AML patients and 20 healthy controls. The expression of TET2 was checked at mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and ELISA respectively and the TET activity was checked by the 5-hmC assay. TET2 mRNA expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. We found a significant downregulation of TET2 mRNA and protein and significantly lower DNA 5-hmC levels in AML patients compared to controls. TET2 downregulation was more in patients with high blast counts and patients of the adverse-risk ELN category. We also found a significant upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3a suggesting a hypermethylation phenotype in de novo AML.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various therapies ranging from plaque brachytherapy to enucleation have been applied in uveal melanomas (UM). A gamma knife (GK) is the gold standard modality for head and neck radiation therapy with enhanced precision owing to the paucity of moving parts. The literature on GK usage in UM is rich with the methodology and nuances of GK applications undergoing constant change.
OBJECTIVES: This article reports on the authors' experience in using GK for tackling UM followed by a thematic review of the evolution of GK therapy for UM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and radiological data of patients with UM treated with GK at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from March 2019 to August 2020 was analyzed. A systematic search for comparative studies and case series evaluating GK usage in UM was performed.
RESULTS: Seven UM patients underwent GK, with the median dose being 28 Gy at 50%. All patients underwent clinical follow-up and 3 patients had a radiological follow-up. Six (85.7%) eyes were preserved at follow-up, and 1 (14.28%) patient developed radiation-induced cataract. There was a reduction in tumor volume in all patients with radiological follow-up with the minimum being a 33.06% reduction in size compared to the presenting volume and the maximum being the complete disappearance of tumor at follow-up. A total of 36 articles presenting various facets of GK usage in UM have been thematically reviewed.
CONCLUSION: GK can be a viable and effective eye-preserving option for UM with catastrophic side effects becoming rare owing to progressive reduction in radiation dose.

AB  - The pleomorphic adenoma arising in the parotid gland is a benign neoplasm that is aptly named because of its histomorphological diversity. The stromal component can contain chondromyxoid material, amyloid, and elastic fibers, along with a few rare reports of crystalline structures present in this tumor. Especially, the crystalline components are rarely encountered or appreciated in routine pathology reporting. Here, we report a case of pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, in which tyrosine-rich crystalloids were identified in abundance and were confirmed with special stains and electron microscopy. Though their exact source is not yet known, crystallization of the stromal or myoepithelial cell secretion has been hypothesized. This comprehensive report is to make the histopathologists aware of this rare morphological observation in pleomorphic adenomas so that more cases are identified and followed-up to reveal the impact of their presence in a subset of pleomorphic adenomas.

AB  - Castleman disease (CD) is a rare benign disorder presents as a lymph nodal mass in mediastinum, cervical, axillary or abdomen. Due to the presence of dysplastic dendritic cell in a background mature lymphocyte and plasma cell, it mimics Hodgkin disease (HD). Synchronous and metachronous occurrence in HD and CD can also occur. An 11-year-old male presented with cervical lymphadenopathy (3.5 × 3.5 cm). Fine needle aspiration shows atypical binucleate cell in a background of small lymphocytes, a diagnosis of Hodgkin disease is suggested. Excisional biopsy showed classical features of Hyaline vascular Castleman disease. Careful cytological evaluation and clinical correlation is required for definitive diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few data on the management of acute phase of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) in patients suffering polytrauma are available. As the therapeutic choices in the first hours may have a deep impact on outcome of tSCI patients, we conducted an international survey investigating this topic.
METHODS: The survey was composed of 29 items. The main endpoints of the survey were to examine: (1) the hemodynamic and respiratory management, (2) the coagulation management, (3) the timing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spinal surgery, (4) the use of corticosteroid therapy, (5) the role of intraspinal pressure (ISP)/spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) monitoring and (6) the utilization of therapeutic hypothermia.
RESULTS: There were 171 respondents from 139 centers worldwide. A target mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of 80-90 mmHg was chosen in almost half of the cases [n = 84 (49.1%)]. A temporary reduction in the target MAP, for the time strictly necessary to achieve bleeding control in polytrauma, was accepted by most respondents [n = 100 (58.5%)]. Sixty-one respondents (35.7%) considered acceptable a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7 g/dl in tSCI polytraumatized patients. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 80-100 mmHg [n = 94 (55%)] and an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35-40 mmHg [n = 130 (76%)] were chosen in most cases. A little more than half of respondents considered safe a platelet (PLT) count > 100.000/mm3 [n = 99 (57.9%)] and prothrombin time (PT)/activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) < 1.5 times the normal control [n = 85 (49.7%)] in patients needing spinal surgery. MRI [n = 160 (93.6%)] and spinal surgery [n = 158 (92.4%)] should be performed after intracranial, hemodynamic, and respiratory stabilization by most respondents. Corticosteroids [n = 103 (60.2%)], ISP/SCPP monitoring [n = 148 (86.5%)], and therapeutic hypothermia [n = 137 (80%)] were not utilized by most respondents.
CONCLUSIONS: Our survey has shown a great worldwide variability in clinical practices for acute phase management of tSCI patients with polytrauma. These findings can be helpful to define future research in order to optimize the care of patients suffering tSCI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: and objective: Tremor is a disabling symptom of PD that usually responds poorly to available standard pharmacological agents. This study aimed to assess the effect of Zonisamide 25 mg on tremor in tremor-dominant PD patients as compared to placebo.
METHODS: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Parkinson's disease patients were allocated either to the intervention group (standard treatment along with Zonisamide 25 mg add-on) or the placebo group (standard treatment along with placebo). Baseline Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Scale (TETRAS) scores, as well as accelerometric tremor analysis were done and follow-up assessments of the same were done after 12 weeks of intervention. Percentage change from baseline in the UPDRS tremor score was the primary outcome whereas percentage change from baseline of total UPDRS score, UPDRS rigidity and bradykinesia scores, TETRAS score, and accelerometric tremor analysis values were the secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the percentage change from baseline UPDRS tremor scores between the two groups (placebo: 8.33 [-19.89-23.86] vs drug: 26.14 [-35.58 to -16.07], p-value: 0.164, CI: 0.157-0.171). Best-case analysis for missing values showed a significant improvement in the drug group, compared to the placebo group (p-value: < 0.001, CI: <0.001 - <0.001).
CONCLUSION: Zonisamide at a dose of 25 mg per day did not improve tremor in tremor-dominant PD patients, however, a positive trend was seen as compared to Placebo in the UPDRS tremor score. Larger studies are required to confirm this finding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurological emergencies saw a paradigm shift in approach during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with the challenge to manage patients with and without COVID-19. We aimed to compare the various neurological disorders and 3 months outcome in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: In an ambispective cohort study design, we enrolled patients with and without SARS CoV-2 infection coming to a medical emergency with neurological disorders between April 2020 and September 2020. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and treatment details of these patients were collected and compared. Their outcomes, both in-hospital and at 3 months were assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).
RESULTS: Two thirty-five patients (235) were enrolled from emergency services with neurological disorders. Of them, 81 (34.5%) were COVID-19 positive. The mean (SD) age was 49.5 (17.3) years, and the majority of the patients were male (63.0%). The commonest neurological diagnosis was acute ischemic stroke (AIS) (43.0%). The in-hospital mortality was higher in the patients who were COVID-19 positive (COVID-19 positive: 29 (35.8%) versus COVID-19 negative: 12 (7.8%), P value: <0.001). The 3 months telephonic follow-up could be completed in 73.2% of the patients (142/194). Four (12.1%) deaths occurred on follow-up in the COVID-19 positive versus fifteen (13.8%) in the COVID-19 negative patients (P value: 1.00). The 3-month mRS was worse in the COVID-19 positive group (P value <0.001). However, this was driven by higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 positive patients.
CONCLUSION: Patients with neurological disorders presenting with COVID-19 infection had worse outcomes, including in-hospital and 3 months disability.

AB  - Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like (MASTL) regulates mitotic progression and is an attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. In this study, novel inhibitory molecules were screened against MASTL kinase, a protein involved in cell proliferation in breast cancer. Natural source-derived drugs Enzastaurin and Palbociclib were selected to identify their role as MASTL kinase inhibitors. Cytotoxic activity, kinase activity, and other cell-based assays of Enzastaurin and Palbociclib were evaluated on human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The potential natural compounds caused cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further analysis by Annexin V and PI staining indicated that both drugs are potent inducers of apoptosis. Enzastaurin induced G2/M phase arrest, while Palbociclib caused G1 arrest. MASTL kinase activity was significantly abrogated with both the compounds showing EC50 values of 17.13 µM and 10.51 µM, respectively. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Enzastaurin and Palbociclib possess the ability to inhibit MASTL kinase activity and induce cell death in breast cancer cells, thus exhibiting significant therapeutic potential.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) typically arises in the background of cirrhosis. The epidemiology of HCC has changed in recent years due to availability of newer antivirals, changing life-styles and greater possibility for early detection. We undertook a multicentric national sentinel surveillance for liver cirrhosis and HCC to assess the attributable risk factors for the development of HCC, both with and without a background of cirrhosis.
METHODS: Data from January 2017 till August 2022 from hospital-based records of eleven participating centers were included. Diagnosed cases of cirrhosis [radiological (multiphase and/or histopathological] and HCC [as per AASLD 2018] were included. History of significant alcohol intake was elicited by AUDIT-C questionnaire.
RESULTS: Altogether 5798 enrolled patients were assessed, of which 2664 patients had HCC. The mean age was 58.2 ± 11.7 years and 84.3% (n = 2247) were males. Diabetes was found in over a third of those with HCC (n = 1032;39.5%). The most common etiology of HCC was NAFLD (n = 927;35.5%) followed by viral hepatitis B and C and harmful levels of alcohol. Among those with HCC, 27.9% (n = 744) had no cirrhosis. Higher proportion of cirrhotic HCC patients had alcohol as an etiological factor as compared to non-cirrhotic (17.5 vs. 4.7%, p ≤ 0.001). NAFLD was an etiological factor for a higher proportion of non-cirrhotic HCC patients as compared to cirrhotic HCC (48.2 vs. 30.6%, p ≤0.001). Diabetics more commonly had non-cirrhotic HCC (50.5 vs. 35.2%). The following factors were associated with an occurrence of cirrhotic HCC: male gender (OR 1.372 and 95% CI 1.070-1.759), age above 60 years (OR 1.409 and 95% CI 1.176-1.689), HBV (OR 1.164 and 95% CI 0.928-1.460), HCV (OR 1.228 and 95 CI 0.964-1.565) and harmful consumption of alcohol (OR 3.472 and 95% CI 2.388-5.047). The adjusted odds of non-cirrhotic patients having NAFLD was 1.553 (95% CI 1.290-1.869).
CONCLUSION: This large multi-centric study demonstrates that NAFLD is the most important risk factor for development of both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCC in India and has overtaken viral hepatitis. Awareness campaigns and large-scale screening are required to reduce the high burden of NAFLD-related HCC in India.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: There is a higher prevalence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in more recent times, owing to increased awareness, clinical diagnostic skills, and advancements in neuroimaging modalities. This study aimed to identify and characterize the geographical, clinical, and etiological profiles of patients with CVST that may be relevant to planning appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve functional recovery.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective observational study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital between March 2014 and October 2018. The demographics and clinical profile of the hospitalized patients were extracted from the Medical Record Division. Choropleth maps were created to present the geographic distribution of the patients with CVST admitted to our hospital. A total of 145 patients with CVST were included in the study. Etiological factors revealed striking abnormalities in red blood cells counts and serum homocysteine. Analyzing the geographical distribution of the patients with CVST showed most of the patients hailed from Central Karnataka Plateau 106 (73%). Polycythemia was most commonly seen in patients residing in the Central Karnataka Plateau 21 (62%).
CONCLUSION: It is inferred that large scale community-based studies to identify a genetic abnormality like a mutant erythropoietin gene should be undertaken to plan effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an accelerating neurodegenerative disorder. Dysfunction of mitochondria and oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Sirtuins play a role in this pathway and can be a potential marker to study neurodegenerative changes. This study evaluated serum levels of all seven sirtuin (SIRT1-SIRT7) proteins in three study groups: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and geriatric control (GC) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Further, it was validated by the Western blot experiment. ROC analysis was performed to differentiate the study group based on the concentration of serum SIRT proteins. Out of seven sirtuins, serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 levels (mean ± SD) were significantly decreased in AD (1.65 ± 0.56, 3.15 ± 0.28, 3.36 ± 0.32 ng/µl), compared to MCI (2.17 ± 0.39, 3.60 ± 0.51, 3.73 ± 0.48 ng/µl) and GC (2.84 ± 0.47, 4.55 ± 0.48, 4.65 ± 0.55 ng/µl). ROC analysis showed the cut-off value with high sensitivity and specificity for cognitive impairment (AD and MCI). The concentration declined significantly with the disease progression. No specific difference was observed in the case of other SIRTs between the study groups. This study reveals an inverse relation of serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 concentration with AD. ROC analysis showed that these serum proteins have greater accuracy in diagnosing of AD. This is the first report of estimation of all seven serum sirtuins and the clinical relevance of SIRT3 and SIRT6 as serum protein markers for AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by autonomic and inflammatory features. There is paucity of data regarding sustained benefits of any treatment modality. We aimed to document the effect of steroids in CRPS on long-term basis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We came across five patients of CRPS in Out Patient clinics of super-speciality Institutes in North India. All five cases fulfilled the Budapest criteria for the diagnosis of CRPS. All of them received prednisolone and were prospectively followed up for 2 years. Treatment outcome was carefully recorded in all affected modalities.
RESULTS: All five cases were found to have excruciating neuropathic pain in defined regions along with cutaneous manifestations. Osseous changes in the form of surface erosion of underlying bones in four cases and marked marrow edema leading to considerable increase in bone thickness in one case were noted. All these features improved considerably following steroid therapy. Bone marrow edema and bone resorption showed improvement on serial imaging.
CONCLUSION: Apart from pain relief, steroids therapy is capable of reversing the osteo-cutaneous autonomic changes of CRPS type I.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The second wave of coronavirus epidemic affected India severely. We reviewed the in-hospital deaths during the second wave at a dedicated COVID hospital to better understand the clinical characteristics of patients who died during this period.
METHODS: Clinical charts of all patients who were admitted and died in-hospital due to COVID-19 between 1 April 2021 and 15 May 2021 were reviewed and clinical data were analysed.
RESULTS: The total number of patients admitted to hospital and the intensive care unit was 1438 and 306, respectively. The in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality was 9.3% (134 out of 1438 patients) and 37.6% (115 out of 306 patients), respectively. Septic shock with multiorgan failure was the cause of death in 56.6% of the deceased patients (n = 73) and acute respiratory distress syndrome in 35.3% (n = 47) patients. Of the deceased, 1 patient was less than 12 years old, 56.8% were between 13 and 64 years of age and 42.5% were geriatric, that is, 65 years of age or older. There were no comorbidities in 35.1% of the deceased patients. The cause of death did not vary with the age group.
CONCLUSION: The in-hospital and intensive care unit mortality during the second wave was 9.3% and 37.6%, respectively. There was no major age group shift in the second wave as compared to the first wave. However, a significant number of patients (35.1%) did not have any comorbidity. Septic shock with multiorgan failure was the most common cause of death followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome.

AB  - We report the case of a woman in her early 20s with a history of recurrent infection, atopic dermatitis, filariasis and bilateral purulent ear discharge since childhood with tonsillar enlargement on examination. She was started on supportive care and evaluated for primary immunodeficiency disease. Blood investigations revealed increased IgM levels with reduced IgG, IgA and IgE levels. Radiological imaging of the chest revealed bilateral bronchiectasis. Otoscopic examination showed features suggestive of chronic suppurative otitis media. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous single base pair deletion in exon 2 of the activation-induced cytidine deaminase gene. Thus, a diagnosis of hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 was confirmed. The patient was started on monthly intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy and is currently symptomatically better, and she remains under regular follow-up.

AB  - We describe the case of a 54-year-old woman with triple-negative breast cancer whose baseline F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) showed hypermetabolic left breast primary, ipsilateral axillary lymphadenopathy, lung nodules, and mediastinal lymph nodes. Histopathological examination of tissue from mediastinal lymph nodes confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoid-like reaction. Chemotherapy may induce or cause a flare-up of malignancy-associated sarcoid-like reaction. However, in our patient's post-chemotherapy F-18 FDG PET/CT, there was reduction in size and uptake of the mediastinal lymph nodes along with partial response shown by the other lesions. We aim to describe this rare course of malignancy-associated sarcoid-like reaction and highlight the role of F-18 FDG PET-CT in such cases.

AB  - A 48-year-old male with known tubercular osteomyelitis of the left elbow and chronic renal failure presented with PTH independent hypercalcemia and underwent F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to look for any underlying malignancy that might be causing his hypercalcemia. The PET/CT did not reveal any malignancy, but extensive metastatic calcification of small- and medium-sized arteries was noted throughout the body with relative sparing of large vessels. Alkaline tissue such as lungs, gastric mucosa, and kidneys that are usually involved in metastatic calcification were also spared. The underlying pathology for this kind of metastatic calcification was most likely chronic granulomatous disease, which was tubercular osteomyelitis in this patient. We present the PET/CT scan images of this unusual case of metastatic vascular calcification.

AB  - We present the case of a 60-year-old man who was being evaluated for 2 intra-abdominal masses. The masses were tracer avid on 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT and were suggestive of neuroendocrine tumor. Histopathology, however, confirmed the masses to be hemangiopericytoma. Hemangiopericytoma comes under the umbrella of solitary fibrous tumors, a rare tumor group arising from the mesenchymal cells. Solitary fibrous tumors commonly arise from the pleura but can occur anywhere in the body. Intra-abdominal hemangiopericytoma are extremely rare and should be kept in mind as one of the differential diagnoses for 68 Ga-DOTA peptide-avid tumors.

AB  - Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare tumor of mesenchymal origin that most commonly involves the pleura but can be found anywhere in the body. SFT can range from indolent benign tumors to aggressive malignant tumors, and pre-operative diagnosis is based mainly on imaging. In this case report, we describe an extremely rare case of SFT of left maxilla on F-18 FDG PET-CT and Ga-68 DOTANOC PET-CT. Very few cases of PET-CT findings in SFT are reported in literature; and to our knowledge, none involving the maxilla. By highlighting the findings on F-18 FDG and GA-68 DOTANOC PET-CT, we aim to further add on to the role of both the tracers in the diagnosis and management of this tumor group.

AB  - Aim Healthcare infrastructure projects are a requirement for the progress of the country. The aim of this study was to identify major completed healthcare infrastructure projects in a tertiary teaching hospital in Northern India and to find out the various factors that influenced the success or failures and the cost and time overrun during the project implementation. Materials and methods Periodical review meetings were conducted, right from the planning to the execution and commissioning of these projects. All these had been documented as minutes of the meetings, and the records of the same had been maintained. The study comprised of studying all these documents in detail and finding an answer to the research questions. Results Four major completed projects of a tertiary medical institute of India, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India, were studied. These were the new Outpatient Department (OPD) Block, Burns and Plastic Surgery Block (BPS), Maternal and Child Health Block (MCH), and National Cancer Institute (NCI). Our study revealed that there was no dearth of funds, and hence, there was no cost overrun in any of the projects. Whenever the funds had to be reworked, the funds that were asked for were released. However, there was a considerable time overrun in all the projects ranging from about one to four years. The various reasons that could be attributed to this are the delay in obtaining statutory clearances, political interference, communication hurdles, improper planning, introducing a project officer late into the project, safety concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions This study focuses mainly on the very important hurdles that were faced during the implementation of the projects and tries to suggest an average time frame for various activities for project implementation in a healthcare project in the Indian scenario. This can be taken as blueprints while planning newer healthcare projects of this magnitude.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common malignant tumor of the nasopharynx. Although NPC is not endemic in India, higher incidences were observed in its North-Eastern regions particularly Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram. Early detection of NPC is difficult because the nasopharynx is not readily amenable to clinical examination and symptoms of NPC are nonspecific. The development of suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis of NPC as well as accurate monitoring of treatment response is needed urgently. In this exploratory pilot study, we have investigated the clinical significance of assessing plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load at diagnosis and during treatment. We found that EBV DNA is detectable at diagnosis in the majority of patients with nonendemic NPC and the absolute copy number of circulating EBV DNA per milliliter increases progressively with the stage of the disease. The viral load declined significantly with induction chemotherapy and definitive chemoradiation but showed a sharp rise at relapse. Patients with EBV DNA levels ≥1500 copies/ml had a higher risk of disease progression or relapse when compared with patients who had EBV DNA <1500 copies/ml at baseline. Estimation of plasma EBV DNA may serve as an excellent noninvasive tool to monitor disease extent, response to therapy, and for better prediction of future relapse or progression-free survival in a nonendemic NPC patient population.

AB  - Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We describe cytomorphological and immunophenotypic features of BPDCN in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a 66-year-old patient who presented with delayed central nervous system relapse. Morphological examination showed dense infiltration by monotonous population of intermediate-sized cells, resembling blasts. Nuclei had irregular contour with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The cells had scant, pale blue, agranular cytoplasm. In some cells, intracytoplasmic vacuoles were also seen. No lymphoglandular bodies were seen. No mitosis or karyorrhexis were observed. On immunophenotyping, these cells were positive for CD45dim, CD123dim, HLA-DR, CD56, CD36bright, TCL1, CD4, CD117, CD38dim and negative for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD14, CD64 and CD16. The relevance of clinical suspicion, cytological recognition, and inclusion of BPDCN specific immunophenotypic markers is emphasized.

AB  - There is a dearth of evidence on the epidemiology of multimorbidity in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of multimorbidity in India and its variation among states and population groups. We analyzed data from a nationally representative household survey conducted in 2015-2016 among individuals aged 15 to 49 years. Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more conditions out of five common chronic morbidities in India: anemia, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. We disaggregated multimorbidity prevalence by condition, state, rural versus urban areas, district-level wealth, and individual-level sociodemographic characteristics. 712,822 individuals were included in the analysis. The prevalence of multimorbidity was 7·2% (95% CI, 7·1% - 7·4%), and was higher in urban (9·7% [95% CI, 9·4% - 10·1%]) than in rural (5·8% [95% CI, 5·7% - 6·0%]) areas. The three most prevalent morbidity combinations were hypertension with obesity (2·9% [95% CI, 2·8% - 3·1%]), hypertension with anemia (2·2% [95% CI, 2·1%- 2·3%]), and obesity with anemia (1·2% [95% CI, 1·1%- 1·2%]). The age-standardized multimorbidity prevalence varied from 3·4% (95% CI: 3·0% - 3·8%) in Chhattisgarh to 16·9% (95% CI: 13·2% - 21·5%) in Puducherry. Being a woman, being married, not currently smoking, greater household wealth, and living in urban areas were all associated with a higher risk of multimorbidity. Multimorbidity is common among young and middle-aged adults in India. This study can inform screening guidelines for chronic conditions and the targeting of relevant policies and interventions to those most in need.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the emergence of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, globally the use of tobacco has decreased notably, although, it still requires efforts at individual, organizational, community level to decrease the rate further. Dental professionals are at an excellent position to provide tobacco cessation counselling and interventions, however, it is not practiced much due to lack of training and lack of knowledge. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to assess the global status of knowledge, attitude and practice on tobacco cessation interventions among dental professionals.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: A systematic search of 6 databases with no language restriction since 2000 was undertaken. Studies were included if they assessed knowledge, attitude and practice on tobacco cessation interventions among dental professionals using a validated or prevalidated tool. The data obtained for assessment of knowledge, attitude, practice, curriculum and barriers were represented through heatmaps. Quality assessment of the studies was done using Newcastle Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Fifty six studies were included in this systematic review. Majority of the studies were found to be of moderate quality. Knowledge regarding the tobacco cessation interventions was more theoretical than practical. All the studies showed a favorable attitude among dental professionals towards tobacco cessation intervention.
CONCLUSION: The included studies lack homogeneity in assessing knowledge, attitude and practice on tobacco cessation interventions. The development and validation of a standardized questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitude and practice on tobacco cessation interventions could be a potentially effective way to uniformly gather data on the subject.

AB  - Background Nursing and allied health professionals are helping hands for healthcare and are important in the training cascade. We aimed to develop and validate the effectiveness of a web-based learning module on oral health promotion among nursing and allied health professionals. Methods We developed and validated an oral health module focused on prevention and promotion for a web-based intervention among nurses and allied health professionals. Pre- and post-test assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme. Results Of a total of 347 participants, 170 (48.9%) had a good knowledge score in the pre-test, and after attending the oral health module their number increased to 267 (76.9%). The mean difference between the pre-test and post-test scores was statistically significant (p<0.005). Conclusions Training of nurses and allied health professionals on oral health through a web-based module showed improvement in oral health literacy.

AU  - Priyadarshi, Mayank
AU  - Balachander, Bharathi
AU  - Gupta, Shuchita
AU  - Sankar, Mari Jeeva
T2  - Journal of Global Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review of intervention trials and observational studies assessed the effect of delaying the first bath for at least 24 hours after birth, compared to conducting it within the first 24 hours, in term healthy newborns.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, CINAHL (updated till November 2021), and clinical trials databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, systemic infections, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates. Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesized effect estimates using relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: We included 16 studies (two trials and 14 observational studies) involving 39 020 term or near-term healthy newborns. Delayed and early baths were defined variably in the studies, most commonly as >24 hours (six studies) and as ≤6 hours (12 studies), respectively. We performed a post-hoc analysis for studies that defined early bath as ≤6 hours. Low certainty evidence suggested that bathing the newborn 24 hours after birth might reduce the risk of infant mortality (OR = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.28 to 0.77; one study, 789 participants) and neonatal hypothermia (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.28-0.88; one study, 660 newborns), compared to bathing within first 24 hours. The evidence on the effect on EBF at discharge was very uncertain. Delayed bath beyond 6 hours (at or after nine, 12, or 24 hours) after birth compared to that within 6 hours might reduce the risk of hypothermia (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.36-0.61; four studies, 2711 newborns) and hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.23-0.66; three studies, 2775 newborns) and improve the incidence of EBF at discharge (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.08-1.34; six studies, 6768 newborns); the evidence of the effect on neonatal mortality was very uncertain.
CONCLUSION: Delayed first bath for at least 24 hours may reduce infant mortality and hypothermia. Delayed bath for at least 6 hours may prevent hypothermia and hypoglycaemia and improve EBF rates at discharge. However, most of these conclusions are limited by low certainty evidence.

AU  - Balachander, Bharathi

T2  - Journal of Global Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Though recommended by numerous guidelines, adherence to supine sleep position during the first year of life is variable across the globe.
METHODS: This systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies assessed the effect of the supine compared to non-supine (prone or side) sleep position on healthy newborns. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), acute life-threatening event (ALTE), neurodevelopment, and positional plagiocephaly. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL (updated till November 2021). Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: We included 54 studies (43 observational studies and 11 intervention trials) involving 474 672 participants. A single study meeting the inclusion criteria suggested that the supine sleep position might reduce the risk of SUDI (0-1 year; OR = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.65; 384 infants), compared to non-supine position. Supine sleep position might reduce the risk of SIDS (0-1 year; OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.42-0.61; 26 studies, 59332 infants) and unexplained SIDS/severe ALTE (neonatal period; OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03-0.82; 1 study, 119 newborns), but the evidence was very uncertain. Supine sleep position probably increased the odds of being 0.5 standard deviation (SD) below mean on Gross Motor Scale at 6 months (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.22-2.27; 1 study, 2097 participants), but might have little to no effect at 18 months of age (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.96, 1.43; 1 study, 1919 participants). An increase in positional plagiocephaly at 2-7 months of age with supine sleep position is possible (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 2.06-3.72; 6 studies, 1774 participants).
CONCLUSIONS: Low- to very low-certainty evidence suggests that supine sleep position may reduce the risk of SUDI (0-1 year) and SIDS (0-1 year). Limited evidence suggests that supine sleeping probably delays short-term 'gross motor' development at 6 months, but the effect on long-term neurodevelopment at 18 months may be negligible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infant massage is commonly practiced in many parts of the world. However, the effectiveness of this intervention has not been reviewed for term, healthy newborns.
METHODS: This systematic review of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessed the effect of whole-body massage with or without oil, compared to no massage in term healthy newborns. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, systemic infections, growth, behaviour (crying or fussing time, sleep duration), and neurodevelopment. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL (updated till November 2021), and clinical trials databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesized effect estimates using mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD). The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
RESULTS: We included 31 randomized and quasi-randomized trials involving 3860 participants. Infant massage was performed by different care providers starting in the neonatal period and continuing for 1-2 months in most studies. Thirteen studies reported the use of oil with body massage. No study reported neonatal mortality or systemic infections. Meta-analyses suggested that whole-body massage may increase infant length at the end of the intervention period (median assessment age 6 weeks; mean difference (MD) = 1.6 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4 to 1.7 cm; low certainty evidence), but the effect on weight (MD = 340 g, 95% CI = 240 to 441 g), head circumference (MD = 0.8 cm, 95% CI = 0.6 to 1.1 cm), sleep duration (MD = 0.62 hours/d, 95% CI = 0.12 to 1.12 hours/d) and bilirubin levels (MD = -31.8 mmol/L or -1.8 mg/dL, 95% CI = -23.5 to -40.0 mmol/L) was uncertain. The effect on crying/fussing time at median 3 months of age, sleep duration at 6 months of age, weight, length, and head circumference at 6-12 months follow-up, and neurodevelopment outcomes, both at the end of the intervention period and follow-up was uncertain.
CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body massage may improve the infant length at the end of the intervention period (median age 6 weeks, range 1-6 months) but the effect on other short- or long-term outcomes is uncertain. There is a need for further well-designed trials in future.

AB  - A 67-year-old man presented with a low-grade fever for 2 months, weakness of all four limbs for five days and altered sensorium for two days. He was recently diagnosed with AIDS and was treatment-naive. Investigations revealed a CD4 count of 27cells/mm3 MRI brain and spine exhibited bilateral cerebellar lesions with diffusion restriction, and severe arachnoiditis at the level of the lumbar spine. High suspicion of central nervous system tuberculosis in an endemic country like ours, led us to start antitubercular therapy and steroids. Repeated lumbar punctures resulted in a dry tap leading to a delay in diagnosis. Serum cryptococcal antigen detection came positive, following which antifungal treatment was initiated. Later a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid sample was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. However, the patient worsened and succumbed to the illness. This case highlighted the rare presentation of cryptococcal cerebellar stroke and spinal arachnoiditis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe novel Y splitting procedure of inferior oblique muscle to mitigate the anti-elevation syndrome.
METHODS: A pilot, prospective interventional study was undertaken to assess the effect of inferior oblique muscle Y-splitting in patients with unilateral 3+ or more overaction. To correct primary gaze hypertropia and the excyclotorsion, a Y-splitting procedure was performed (along with routine horizontal muscle surgery as per the deviation) in 14 subjects. The effect of surgery was assessed at baseline and at 6 months post-intervention.
RESULTS: The mean age of 14 subjects was 25.14±7.70 years. The mean pre-operative hypertropia, excyclotorsion and inferior oblique muscle over-action was 18.42±3.50 PD, 14.14±2.65 degrees, and +3.21±0.42 respectively. Following surgery, this was reduced to 1.57±1.74 PD of residual hypertropia (a net correction of 16.85±2.31 PD, p = 0.005), 3.85±1.46 degrees of residual excyclotorsion (a net correction of 10.28±1.72 degrees, p < 0.05), and +0.28±0.46 of residual inferior oblique over-action (a net correction ~+3) at the end of 6 months. Amongst fourteen patients, three patients still experienced residual/variable anti-elevation effect, and during the study period none of them experienced any adverse event and none of them required any additional surgeries.
CONCLUSION: While anteriorizing the inferior oblique muscle to correct primary gaze hypertropia and the excyclotorsion, a novel "Y splitting" procedure can be followed to achieve the desired results with mitigated anti-elevation effect.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the clinical role of swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography in extraocular muscle imaging in various strabismic conditions.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1104 extraocular muscles of 150 subjects were imaged. Normal eyes (640 muscles), eyes undergoing re-operation (240 muscles), paralytic strabismic eyes (16 muscles), non-paralytic strabismic eyes (20 muscles), post-traumatic strabismic eyes (64 muscles), eyes with thyroid disease (64 muscles), and other atypical cases (60 muscles) were imaged. In all cases, up to four recti muscles were evaluated in a given eye depending on the need.
RESULTS: The mean age was 38.15 ± 16.25 years. Overall, muscle insertion was identified in over 90% of the subjects. Apart from normal muscles (n = 860, 93.68%), the location was identified in previously operated eyes (n = 54, 90%), in traumatic muscle slippage (n = 2, 11.11%), in ocular coat ectasia (n = 11, 91.66%), in thyroid muscle hypertrophy, in operated scleral fixated intraocular lens with strabismus, and other challenging cases. In all circumstances, clinically useful information was obtained from the anterior 4-14 millimetres of the rectus muscle, which in turn helped in active surgical planning and overall management.
CONCLUSION: The SS-ASOCT with its wider and deeper scanning abilities was able to locate the extraocular muscle insertion in a variety of strabismic conditions. Therefore, this tool can be used in the preoperative periods for optimal surgical planning and management.

AB  - PRCIS: Human corneoscleral rims provide a low cost model and resource to enhance angle based glaucoma surgical training skills.
PURPOSE: To understand the feasibility, utility, and efficacy of a low-cost model for performing anterior chamber angle gonioscopy and micro-surgery on human corneoscleral tissues in wet lab on resident skill enhancement.
METHODS: Post-keratoplasty residual corneoscleral rims and/or the expired donor corneoscleral buttons were included for the purpose of this study. Initially, inverted rims were used to demonstrate the basic angle anatomy on a slit lamp bio-microscope. Central hazy cornea was then replaced with an artificial cornea and an artificial anterior chamber to simulate indirect gonioscopy, direct gonioscopy, goniotomy, and other angle-based surgeries. Direct gonioscopy and goniotomy exercises (as a means to simulate intraoperative gonioscopy and other angle-based surgeries respectively) were evaluated quantitatively, and the rest qualitatively.
RESULTS: A total of 65 residents were included in the exercise. The mean age was 26.69±1.74 years. Amongst these, 55 ophthalmology residents performed the basic examination, that is, slit lamp mounted angle anatomy examination (n=55) and artificial chamber mounted indirect gonioscopic examination through artificial cornea (n=55). In the second exercise, 10 glaucoma fellows performed the direct gonioscopic and the goniotomy exercises on artificial chamber. The fellows demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in interpretation and surgical skill enhancement concurrent with reduction in time taken with increasing number of attempts ( P <0.05). In the third simulation exercise, micro-stent placement within the Schlemm's canal, subconjunctival space, and the suprachoroidal space was re-produced successfully on multiple occasions.
CONCLUSIONS: The residual human corneoscleral rims proved to be an important resource for teaching both the basic examination skills and those required for transitioning to advanced intraoperative gonioscopy and goniotomy skills. These low cost, easy to adapt models can be incorporated within the curriculum for improved glaucoma training of both the residents and the glaucoma fellows.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the possibility of complex strabismus surgical simulation on goat eyes.
METHODS: The goat eyes were procured from local slaughterhouse with retained extra ocular muscle tissues. The obtained eyes were inspected for globe integrity, muscle quality, muscle length, and the surrounding teno-conjunctival layers. The included eyes were then segregated for surgical simulation based on their insertion and orientation (as oblique or recti), and they were mounted on a mannequin head, with a fixation suture at free end to simulate the resting tension. Additionally, as per necessary, extra muscles were also transplanted along desired sites to simulate human extra ocular muscle anatomy.
RESULTS: The inferior oblique, superior oblique, and all other four recti were successfully simulated in varying proportions in more than 50 eyes. Primarily, by simulating the lateral rectus, inferior rectus, and the inferior oblique muscle, staged weakening procedures of inferior oblique were successfully practiced (Fink's recession, Park's recession, Elliot and Nankin procedure, total anterior positioning, and antero-nasal trans-position or Stager's procedure). Similarly, by simulating superior rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and the medial rectus muscles, half width transposition, full width transposition, and other complex procedures were practiced (Knapp's procedure, augmented Knapp's, Nishida's procedure, Faden operation, and Y splitting procedure). Furthermore, by simulating superior oblique and the superior rectus muscles, superior oblique tuck, posterior tenectomy, loop tenotomy, and Harada Ito procedures were successfully practiced.
CONCLUSIONS: On goat eyes, the complex strabismus surgical procedures can be successfully simulated and practiced after re-organizing the existing muscles in different patterns.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive tool to assess the retino-choroidal vasculature in vivo. It tracks the red blood cell movement and maps the vasculature in quick succession. In routine, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, and others are commonly being studied to unveil its clinic role. On the other hand, amblyopia is a condition where the visual acuity is subnormal due to non-organic causes in the eye. But the OCTA studies till now have shown variable changes along retino-choroidal vasculature. Hence, to comprehend the existing literature knowledge, a systematic literature search was carried out and the original works describing novel findings in amblyopic eyes on OCTA were included. Upon detailed assessment, firstly, the disturbed vasculature along superficial retinal plexus, deeper retinal plexus, and choroidal plexus were evident in most untreated amblyopic eyes. However, such changes were not uniform, which is due to noted heterogenic patient profile, small sample size, biometric biases, non-uniform algorithms, and other factors. And to note, even in presence of such diverse changes, almost all the authors stated a plausible explanation for their notable changes. Secondly, the utility of OCTA in identifying vascular changes with standard treatments and segregation of visual beneficiaries from non-beneficiaries were possible. Hence, to conclude, OCTA is a valuable tool which can provide valuable useful insights into the amblyopic eyes during pre and post treatment periods. However, to gather more concrete evidence for clinical benefits, systematic, homogenous, and better structured clinical studies are mandated.

AB  - To compare features of clinically defined subtypes of breast cancer on mammography (MG) and ultrasonography (USG). After obtaining approval from the institute ethics committee, a retrospective observational study was performed on biopsy-proven breast cancer patients who underwent baseline MG from 2016 to 2020. MG and USG features were evaluated and the patients were classified based on immunohistochemistry profile into luminal like (LL)-oestrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) + , Her2neu-; basal like (BL)-ER/PR-, Her2neu-; Her2 like (HL)-Her2neu + . A total of 479 patients (mean age, 51.4 ± 11.7 years; all females) were included: LL-198 (41.3%), BL-121 (25.2%) and HL-160 (33.3%). On MG, round shape (21/115, 18.3%, p < 0.001); circumscribed (16/115, 13.9%, p < 0.001) and microlobulated margins (28/115, 24.4%) were associated with BL tumours. Associated suspicious calcifications (96/160, 60%, p < 0.001) and skin thickening or retraction (75/149, 50.3%, p < 0.001) were more common in HL. On USG, round shape (12/95, 12.8%, p = 0.005); circumscribed (8/94, 8.5%) and microlobulated margins (44/94, 46.8%) and posterior acoustic enhancement (7/95, 7.5%, p = 0.012) were associated with BL. The logistic regression analysis revealed that spiculated margins on MG favoured LL (OR: 8.5, p = 0.001); round shape (OR: 6.8), circumscribed (OR: 10.8) or microlobulated margins (OR: 3.5) (p < 0.001 for each) favoured BL; whereas associated features of calcifications (OR: 3.3) (p = 0.019) and skin retraction or thickening (OR: 1.8) (p < 0.001) favoured HL. On USG, circumscribed (OR: 5.9, p = 0.005) or microlobulated margins (OR: 3, p < 0.001) and posterior acoustic enhancement (OR: 9.5, p = 0.006) favoured BL. Clinically defined subtypes of breast cancer show significant differences in the imaging appearances on mammography and USG. BL tumours may not show the typical imaging features of malignancy, necessitating clinicopathological correlation for accurate diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) of suspicious axillary lymph nodes and its combination with B-mode USG in predicting nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients.
METHODS: Prospective observational study was performed from June 2018 to August 2020 on breast cancer patients with suspicious axillary nodes on USG. B-mode features (cortical thickness, effacement of fatty hilum, non-hilar blood flow and round shape) and SWE parameters (Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD) of the node with the thickest cortex were evaluated. Diagnostic performances of USG, SWE and their combination were estimated using pathological status of the node on biopsy as the gold standard.
RESULTS: Of the 54 patients evaluated, optimal elasticity maps were obtained in 49 nodes of 49 patients (mean age, 46.3 ± 12.1 years; 48/49 (98%) females). On biopsy, 38 nodes (77.6%) had metastasis, while 11 (22.4%) had reactive hyperplasia. Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD of both cortex and hilum were significantly higher in metastatic than reactive nodes. Emax (cortex) ≥14.9 kPa had the best diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 73.7%; specificity, 81.8%). Cortical thickness ≥6.7 mm had the best diagnostic performance among B-mode features (sensitivity, 89.5%; specificity, 72.7%). Combining cortical thickness with effacement of fatty hilum and/or non-hilar blood flow yielded sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 90.9%. Addition of Emax (cortex) to cortical thickness and combination of ≥2 B-mode features increased their specificities to 90.9 and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Metastatic axillary nodes are stiffer than reactive nodes on SWE in breast cancer patients. Emax (cortex) has the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between reactive hyperplasia and nodal metastasis. Combination of Emax (cortex) and cortical thickness increases the specificity for diagnosing metastasis, especially in nodes showing only cortical thickening.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Combination of SWE and B-mode USG is highly specific for differentiating metastasis from reactive hyperplasia in suspicious nodes of breast carcinoma patients, especially in nodes with only cortical thickening.

AB  - Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) remains an important cause of urinary tract infection during pregnancy. Multiple molecular virulence determinants and antibiotic resistant genes facilitate its pathogenesis and virulence phenotype. Hence it is hypothesized that there will be considerable variation in genes among the isolates from symptomatic as well as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to decipher the genetic variation among the two phenotypes. Six different UPEC isolates collected from urine specimens of consecutive pregnant females (five, symptomatic bacteriuria and one, ABU) were tested for their growth kinetics, and biofilm formation. A total of 87 virulence determinants and 56 antibiotic resistance genes were investigated using whole-genome sequencing, to identify putative drives of virulence phenotype. In this analysis, we identified eight different types of fully functional toxin antitoxin (TA) systems [HipAB, YefM-YoeB, YeeU-YeeV (CbtA), YhaV-PrlF, ChpBS, HigAB, YgiUT and HicAB] in the isolates from symptomatic bacteriuria; whereas partially functional TA system with mutations were observed in the asymptomatic one. Isolates of both the groups showed equivalent growth characteristics and biofilm-formation ability. Genes for an iron transport system (Efe UOB system, Fhu system except FhuA) were observed functional among all symptomatic and asymptomatic isolates, however functional mutations were observed in the latter group. Gene YidE was observed predominantly associated with the biofilm formation along with few other genes (BssR, BssS, YjgK, etc.). This study outlines putative critical relevance of specific variations in the genes for the TA system, biofilm formation, cell adhesion and colonization among UPEC isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women. Further functional genomic study in the same cohort is warranted to establish the pathogenic role of these genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mobile phone (MP) contamination of health personnels (HPs) in hospitals is a potential health hazard to the patients and the HP themselves. However, transfer of microbes from MPs of HP to their hands has not been demonstrated before, which would make potential threat into an actual peril. The primary objective was to determine aerobic and anerobic bacterial contamination of MP and hands of HP. The secondary objective was to determine probable transfer of bacterial microbes from MP to hands of tested HP.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three swabs each were taken from 374 HP first from their MP, second from their dominant hand and third from their dominant hand after cleaning with disinfectant followed by a mock phone call of one minute (DHM). Aerobic and anerobic bacterial microbes were identified with standard methods.
RESULTS: Three hundred twenty-two HPs were recruited. Bacterial contamination was seen in 92% MP, 85% dominant hands, and 68% DHM of tested HP. Of these, contamination with potentially pathogenic bacterias (PPB) was 50% in MP, 25.6% in hands, and 31% in DHM. Anerobic contamination (1.6%) was present on MP but not in hands or DHM. In 54.7% HP, there was presence of similar bacterial microbes in MP and DHM of which 30% were PPB. When disinfectant was used in non-protocolized way in DHM, decrease in aerobic spore forming bacteria (ASB) was seen but not of gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial microbes.
CONCLUSION: There is significant aerobic bacterial contamination, including PPB, seen in MP, hands, and DHM of HP in a tertiary care hospital of India; however, anerobic bacterias are found only in MP. Similar bacterial microbes in MP and DHM point to probable transfer of aerobic bacterias from MP to hands of HP which does not decrease when hand disinfectants are used in non-protocolized way, which is a point of concern.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sympathetic blocks are invaluable to prevent morbidity from Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). RP may occur in children with rheumatological disorders and causes severe pain, discoloration of digits, gangrene, and auto-amputation. We describe the planning and execution of sympathectomy blocks in children with rheumatological disorders presenting with RP.
METHODS: With upper-limb involvement, ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block (USGB) was given with ropivacaine and clonidine. When all four limbs were involved, intrathecal block with bupivacaine and clonidine was also given.
RESULTS: A total of 68 sympathectomy blocks were performed: 28 bilateral USGBs, two unilateral USGBs, and 10 intrathecal injections. Multiple interventions in a single day were frequently required. For safety, all USGBs were performed with an ultrasound with strict adherence to local anaesthetic volume was maintained, with periprocedure monitoring of 2-3 hours. All blocks were performed by an experienced specialist. All children reported immediate pain relief with prevention of major amputation.
CONCLUSION: With meticulous planning, monitoring, and precautions, sympathectomy of limbs in pediatric rheumatological disorders with RP can be safely undertaken. Bilateral stellate ganglion block with ultrasound is safe in children, and clonidine is a useful adjunct for vasodilation and prolongation of the effect of sympathectomies in children.

AB  - AIM: To compare the pregnancy outcomes in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) based on the timing of diagnosis.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 2011 and September 2017 amongst 2638 Asian Indian pregnant women. The inclusion criteria included; singleton pregnancies having HbA1c <48 mmols/mol (6.5%) in the first trimester, GDM screening by 75 g OGTT using IADPSG criteria and delivery at our centre. The cohort was divided into 3 groups: Early GDM (E-GDM)-diagnosis <24 gestational weeks (Gw), Standard GDM (S-GDM)-diagnosis ≥24Gw, Non-GDM- No GDM ≥24 Gw. Multivariable logistic regression models compared the pregnancy outcomes between Non-GDM, S-GDM and E-GDM groups. A sub-group multivariable analysis was done amongst GDM women using gestational age at diagnosis both as a categorical and continuous variable.
RESULTS: Compared to Non-GDM women, the odds were higher for premature birth, large for gestational age (LGA) babies, macrosomia, Neonatal ICU(NICU) admission and lower for normal vaginal delivery in the E-GDM group, but for the S-GDM group, the risk was higher for premature birth, LGA babies, NICU admission and induction of labour. Compared to GDM women in the 24-28 Gw category significantly higher odds for premature birth and LGA babies were observed in the <14 Gw category. A continuous increase of 19% odds for premature birth with every 4 weeks decrease in gestational age at GDM diagnosis was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Asian Indian women having a GDM diagnosis before 24Gw are at higher risk for adverse pregnancy events than those having diagnosis ≥24Gw or not having GDM.

T2  - Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics
AB  - Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a highly aggressive hematologic neoplasm and classified under acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of three cases of BPDCN: two with classical and one uncommon immunophenotype. A-35-year-old female (case 1) presented with complaint of nasal mass and generalized lymphadenopathy. Biopsy from axillary lymph node showed infiltration by cells with scant cytoplasm which were immunopositive for LCA, CD4, CD43, and ALK1. Flowcytometry showed positivity for CD45, CD4, CD33, and CD123 while negative for rest all markers. The other two cases have classical immunophenotype. In clinical practice, nasal mass with lymphadenopathy suggests natural killer T-cell/peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Again immunohistochemical positivity for CD4, CD43, and ALK while negativity for CD3 suggests anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In this case, morphology and extensive bone marrow involvement raise the suspicion. Fowcytometry positivity for HLADR, CD123, and CD33 helps in making diagnosis.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pathology & Microbiology
AB  - Low-grade gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in the pediatric age group. The majority of these tumors are circumscribed, while diffuse low-grade gliomas are relatively rare. The pediatric type diffuse low-grade gliomas (pDLGG) have a distinctly different biological behavior, molecular profile, and clinical outcome as compared to their adult counterpart. In the 5th edition of World Health Organization (WHO) CNS classification, pDLGGs are subclassified into four distinct histomolecular entities, namely, (i) diffuse astrocytoma, MYB- or MYBL1-altered, (ii) angiocentric glioma, (iii) polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), and (iv) diffuse low-grade glioma, MAPK pathway-altered. Although the molecular profile, to a great extent, aligns with the morphological features, it is not specific. Many of the molecular alterations described in pDLGG have therapeutic implications with the availability of newer targeted therapies. A wide range of testing platforms are available for routine assessment of these molecular alterations in clinical laboratories, though WHO does not recommend any particular method.

AB  - Full-thickness deficiency of eyelid tissues can result in coloboma or retraction or both. Here we report our initial experience on the use of auricular skin-cartilage sandwich graft technique for full-thickness eyelid deformities. Five patients (4-32 years) underwent the procedure. Patients with full-thickness eyelid deformity were included. Three patients were operated for large-sized coloboma and two for eyelid retraction. One patient had congenital, and four patients had acquired etiology. The following parameters were specifically assessed: correction of deformity, ocular surface problems, graft status, and epithelization of skin-cartilage graft. All the patients had a good correction of eyelid position, except one patient who had severe eyelid retraction (8 mm) at presentation. None of our patients had corneal erosion/defect, persistent ocular surface redness, or graft loss. The auricular skin-cartilage sandwich graft technique produces optimal results with no graft loss. Advancement of orbicularis muscle in between the auricular skin and cartilage grafts (sandwich technique) is an imperative step that leads to the survival of both grafts.

AB  - The POTE family comprises 14 paralogues and is primarily expressed in Prostrate, Placenta, Ovary, Testis, Embryo (POTE), and cancerous cells. The prospective function of the POTE protein family under physiological conditions is less understood. We systematically analyzed their cellular localization and molecular docking analysis to elucidate POTE proteins' structure, function, and Adaptive Divergence. Our results suggest that group three POTE paralogs (POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, POTEJ, and POTEKP (a pseudogene)) exhibits significant variation among other members could be because of their Adaptive Divergence. Furthermore, our molecular docking studies on POTE protein revealed the highest binding affinity with NCI-approved anticancer compounds. Additionally, POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, and POTEJ were subject to an explicit molecular dynamic simulation for 50ns. MM-GBSA and other essential electrostatics were calculated that showcased that only POTEE and POTEF have absolute binding affinities with minimum energy exploitation. Thus, this study's outcomes are expected to drive cancer research to successful utilization of POTE genes family as a new biomarker, which could pave the way for the discovery of new therapies.

AB  - This study explored the profile of HIV positive patients seeking treatment at a tertiary care addiction treatment facility. A retrospective study was done to collet detailed information on clinical characteristics: drug use (type, age of initiation, duration), general medical condition and past treatment history. The study included 138 patients with mean (SD) age 30.2 (8.3) years. Opioid dependence with injecting drug use (IDU) was diagnosed in 97% of the patients. The median age of injecting onset was 24.5 years (IQR 20-31 years). The most frequently injected substances were pheniramine (60.1%) and buprenorphine (59.4%). Past treatment seeking was reported by 57% patients and interestingly they were less likely to present any medical condition (2 =69.611, p < 0.001). Variability in the age of onset of drug use indicates the need for broad based approach to prevent IDU and motivation to seek treatment may lead to better health conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid-dependent patients undergoing opioid substitution therapy (OST) consume alcohol in a hazardous pattern which adversely affects their treatment outcome. This study aims to measure alcohol biomarkers to screen for secondary alcohol use in OST patients.
METHODS: A pilot study was planned to measure alcohol biomarkers (AST, ALT, GGT, and CDT) to assess alcohol use in OST patients from three community clinics. The biomarkers were categorized based on the reported frequency of alcohol use. The association of the biomarkers with the frequency of alcohol consumption was determined using the post hoc (Mann-Whitney) test.
RESULTS: Forty-five patients with a mean (SD) age of 37.04 (10.7) years were included in the study. Alcohol intake was reported in daily, weekly, and monthly patterns by 22, 63, and 16% of the patients, respectively. High levels of ALT, GGT, and CDT were measured in patients with daily use of alcohol. Serum CDT levels significantly differentiate daily and weekly use from monthly consumption of alcohol.
CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol biomarkers significantly predict the pattern of alcohol use among OST patients. These results can be prudent in low-resource community clinics to improve the overall outcomes of OST in India.

AB  - Visual impairment from corneal stromal disease affects millions worldwide. We describe a cell-free engineered corneal tissue, bioengineered porcine construct, double crosslinked (BPCDX) and a minimally invasive surgical method for its implantation. In a pilot feasibility study in India and Iran (clinicaltrials.gov no. NCT04653922 ), we implanted BPCDX in 20 advanced keratoconus subjects to reshape the native corneal stroma without removing existing tissue or using sutures. During 24 months of follow-up, no adverse event was observed. We document improvements in corneal thickness (mean increase of 209 ± 18 µm in India, 285 ± 99 µm in Iran), maximum keratometry (mean decrease of 13.9 ± 7.9 D in India and 11.2 ± 8.9 D in Iran) and visual acuity (to a mean contact-lens-corrected acuity of 20/26 in India and spectacle-corrected acuity of 20/58 in Iran). Fourteen of 14 initially blind subjects had a final mean best-corrected vision (spectacle or contact lens) of 20/36 and restored tolerance to contact lens wear. This work demonstrates restoration of vision using an approach that is potentially equally effective, safer, simpler and more broadly available than donor cornea transplantation.

AB  - Cancer is the utmost common disease-causing death worldwide, characterized by uncontrollable cell division with the potential of metastasis. Overexpression of the Inhibitors of Apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and autophagy correlates with tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance, and reoccurrence after anticancer therapies. This study illuminates the role and efficacy of smac mimetic compound BV6 alone and in co-treatment with death ligands such as TRAIL and TNFα in the regulation of cell death mechanisms, i.e., apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, MTT assays, wound healing assays, and cellular and nuclear morphological studies were done. DAPI staining, AO/EtBr staining and AnnexinV/PI FACS was done to study the apoptosis. The expression of IAPs and autophagy biomarkers was analyzed using Real time-PCR and western blotting. Meanwhile, TEM demonstrated autophagy and cellular autophagic vacuoles in response to the BV6. The result shows a promising anti-cancer effect of BV6 alone as well as in combinational treatment with TRAIL and TNFα, compared to the lone treatment of TRAIL and TNFα in both breast cancer cell lines. The smac mimetic compound might provide an alternative combinational therapy with conventional anticancer therapies to tackle their inefficiency at the advanced stage of cancer, cancer resistance, and reoccurrence. Also, IAPs and autophagic proteins could act as potent target molecules for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs in pathogenesis and the betterment of regimens for cancer.

One hundred and ninety-one patients of B-NHL from 10 centers diagnosed between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. B/T lymphoblastic lymphoma and patients with inadequate data were excluded. The median age was 88 months (IQR: 56, 144) with an M:F ratio of 5.6:1. Undernourishment and stunting were seen in 36.5% and 22%. Primary site was abdomen in 66.5%. Hypoalbuminemia was noted in 82/170 (48.2%). Histological subtypes: Burkitt lymphoma (BL): 69.6%, Burkitt-like: 10.4%, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL): 13.6%, unclassified and others (6.4%). Stage distribution: I/II, 33 (17.3%), III, 114 (59.7%), and IV, 44 (23%). One-eighty-six patients took treatment. Protocols used were LMB and BFM in 160/186 (86%). At a median follow-up of 21.34 (IQR: 4.34, 36.57) months, the disease-free-survival (DFS) was 74.4% and event-free-survival (EFS) was 60.7%. Treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse/progression and abandonment were 14.3%, 14.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. Bone marrow positivity, stage IV disease, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 2,000 U/l predicted inferior EFS. Stage IV disease, LDH > 2,000 U/l, bone marrow positivity, tumor lysis syndrome and low albumin predicted TRM; LDH retained significance on multivariate analysis for EFS and TRM [OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.14-20, p 0.03; OR 20, 95%CI: 1.69-250, p 0.017]. BL was the main histological subtype. High TRM and relapse/progression are hampering survival. An LDH > 2,000 U/l was adversely prognostic. These data demonstrate a need to develop a national protocol that balances toxicity and potential for cure.

AB  - The succedaneous permanent teeth develop in close proximity to primary teeth. They can get accidentally luxated or avulsed during the extraction of primary teeth. The purpose of this paper was to describe a case of a 14-year-old boy with an "iatrogenic avulsion" of an immature mandibular second premolar during the extraction of a primary mandibular second molar. The case was managed successfully with replantation technique within 30 minutes of extra oral period and followed up for 5 years. The replanted tooth remained clinically asymptomatic, showed continued root development and eruption and remained vital. This paper had also discussed about the modifications in extraction technique to avoid the iatrogenic avulsion of permanent tooth bud during extraction of primary teeth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The scaffolds used in regenerative endodontic therapy (RET) provide structural support for cells so that they can adhere to the scaffolds and also are crucial for cellular proliferation and differentiation. The objective of this network meta-analysis was to compare effects of different intracanal scaffolds on success outcomes of RET.
METHODS: PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies evaluating and/or comparing clinical and/or radiographic success of RET using different scaffolds with a minimum of 12 months follow-up were included. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias (ROB) tool and appropriate tools from Joanna Briggs Institute were used for the assessment of ROB. A network meta-analysis was performed to compare the primary outcome (clinical success) and other success outcomes (root maturation, and pulpal sensibility) using different scaffolds.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the desired inclusion criteria of which 25 had a low ROB whereas 2 had a moderate ROB. Clinical success of RET using platelet-rich plasma (PRP), blood clot (BC), and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) scaffolds ranged between 91.66%-100%, 84.61%-100%, and 77%-100% respectively. The different scaffolds did not show any statistically significant difference in clinical success (PRF vs BC [P = 1.000], PRP vs BC [P = 1.000], and PRF vs PRP [P = .999]), apical root closure (PRF vs BC [P = 1.000], PRP vs BC [P = .835], PRF vs PRP [P = .956]), and pulp sensibility (PRF vs BC [P = .980], PRP versus BC [P = .520], and PRF vs PRP [P = .990]).
CONCLUSION: The intracanal scaffolds used during RET did not result in significant differences in regard to clinical success, root maturation, and pulpal sensibility.

AB  - This systematic review aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity of intracanal medicaments used for root canal disinfection and assess their effect on the proliferation and differentiation potential of stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP). The PubMed/Medline, Cochrane, Scopus, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science databases were searched. Studies evaluating the effect of intracanal medicament on human SCAP (in-vitro primary cell culture experiment) were included in this systematic review. The risk of bias analysis of included studies was carried out using the Toxicological data Reliability Assessment tool. The data was analysed for qualitative characteristics. A meta-analysis was not carried out considering the heterogeneity of selected studies in terms of cell culture experiments, methods of analysis and the interpretation of results. Four studies fulfilled the desired inclusion criteria. The different antibiotic pastes and their intracanal concentrations lead to reduction in the SCAP survival compared to calcium hydroxide medicament. The findings were insufficient to make a clear distinction between different antibiotic pastes regarding their cytotoxicity. Within the limitations of the present systematic review, it can be concluded that calcium hydroxide is a relatively better intracanal medicament than antibiotic paste mixtures in terms of their cytotoxicity and effect on proliferation of SCAP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Quantitation of microRNAs secreted by lung cells can provide valuable information regarding lung health. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) offers a non-invasive way to sample the secreted microRNAs, and could be used as diagnostic tools for lung cancer.
MATERIALS & METHODS: EBC samples from twenty treatment-naïve patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer and twenty healthy subjects were profiled for miRNAs expression. Selected microRNAs were further validated, using quantitative-PCR, in an independent set of 10 subjects from both groups.
RESULTS: A total of 78 miRNAs were found to be significantly upregulated in the EBC of lung cancer patients compared to the control group. Six of these 78 miRNAs were shortlisted for validation. Of these, miR-31-3p, let7i, and miR-449c were significantly upregulated, exhibited good discriminatory power.
DISCUSSION: Differential expression of miRNAs secreted by lung cells could be quantitated in EBC samples, and could be used as a potential non-invasive tool for early diagnosis of lung cancer.

AB  - A person suspected of having Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clinically diagnosed for the presence of principal biomarkers, especially misfolded amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau proteins in the brain regions. Existing radiotracer diagnostic tools, such as PET imaging, are expensive and have limited availability for primary patient screening and pre-clinical animal studies. To change the status quo, small-molecular near-infrared (NIR) probes have been rapidly developed, which may serve as an inexpensive, handy imaging tool to comprehend the dynamics of pathogenic progression in AD and assess therapeutic efficacy in vivo. This Perspective summarizes the biochemistry of Aβ and tau proteins and then focuses on structurally diverse NIR probes with coverages of their spectroscopic properties, binding affinity toward Aβ and tau species, and theranostic effectiveness. With the summarized information and perspective discussions, we hope that this paper may serve as a guiding tool for designing novel in vivo imaging fluoroprobes with theranostic capabilities in the future.

AB  - Meningiomas are benign intracranial neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap cells. High grade meningiomas are uncommon and metastasis from these is an extremely rare event. Commonest sites of metastasis from high grade meningiomas include lung, liver, lymph nodes and bone. It is unusual for meningiomas to recur in the surgical track following excision. More so, it is even the rarest phenomenon for a meningioma to implant in subgaleal location. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the scalp implantation vis-à-vis CSF dissemination, direct surgical implantation etc., It may apply to all histological grades of meningiomas. Even the benign tumors have been shown to seed at postoperative scar. This seems to have provoked our interest to review the literature regarding this scalp implantation. We have reviewed all the cases where surgical excision of intracranial meningiomas has led to seeding of surgical track as well as scalp. We have discussed the various genetic aberrations that can guide us regarding the progression of the tumor and prognosis. We also report a case of surgical track and scalp implantation of an atypical intraventricular meningioma following excision.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection. Timely identification is important for risk reduction and better outcomes in critically ill patients. Nucleosomes and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase1 (TIMP1) are the biomarkers whose validity and utility in predicting organ dysfunction and mortality in sepsis have been proven. However, which biomarker among these two has better predictive value in elucidating disease severity, organ dysfunction, and mortality in sepsis is yet to be answered, and further studies are needed.
METHODS: Eighty patients with sepsis/septic shock, aged between 18 and 75 years admitted in intensive care unit (ICU) were recruited in this prospective observational trial. Quantification of serum nucleosomes and TIMP1 was done using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) within 24 hours of diagnosis of sepsis/septic shock. The primary outcome was to compare the predictability of nucleosomes and TIMP1 in estimating sepsis mortality.
RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for TIMP1 and nucleosomes to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors were 0.70 [95% Confidence interval (CI), 0.58-0.81] and 0.68 (0.56-0.80), respectively. Although independent, TIMP1 and nucleosomes have statistically significant capacity to discriminate between survivors and non-survivors (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004, respectively), superiority of one biomarker over the other in discriminating between survivors and non-survivors was not observed.
CONCLUSION: The median values of each biomarker showed statistically significant differences between survivors and non-survivors, superiority of one biomarker over other in predicting mortality was not observed. However, this was an observational study and larger studies are needed in the future to validate the findings of this study.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: CD229 has been found to be a useful plasma cell (PC) gating marker in multiple myeloma (MM). This study analyses the expression profile of CD229 on various bone marrow compartments namely, PC, non-PC and hematogones (HGs) using Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC). Furthermore, it evaluates the ability of CD229 to delineate normal PC (NPC) from aberrant PC (APC) in measurable residual disease assessment (MRD) in MM.
METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates from patients diagnosed with MM (per standard IMWG criteria) were collected in EDTA and processed for MFC using a single tube 14-color antibody panel as per standard operating procedure.
RESULTS: A total of 74 patients with a diagnosis of MM (26 treatment naïve and 48 on therapy) were evaluated. The expression of CD229 was homogenous on both the PC and HG compartments as compared to CD138 and CD38. On comparing the expression of individual markers, it was found to be statistically significant between PC, HGs and non-PC for all three markers (p < 0.001). APC showed lower median expression of CD38 and higher median expression of CD138 and CD229 as compared to NPC and was found to be statistically significant for all markers (p < 0.001). In terms of differential expression on NPC and APC; CD38 was found to be the most aberrantly expressed (70%; 52/74) followed by CD229 (7%; 5/74) and CD138 (5%; 4/74).
CONCLUSIONS: CD229 can be used for the identification of PC and due to relatively homogenous expression; it can be used as a suitable marker for targeted therapies. However, precise discrimination of NPC from APC cannot be reliably achieved with CD229, limiting its utility as a useful marker of diagnostic relevance and MRD assessment in MM.

AB  - The overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases and low extracellular pH are two key physiological parameters involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. These have been the targets for several cancer detection and imaging modalities. Here, dual-sensitive nanoprobes have been fabricated from carbon nanoparticles decorated with a MMP-9 sensitive peptide sequence. Carbon nanoparticles are known for their intrinsic fluorescence properties and hence used as a pH-sensing moiety in the nanoprobes. In addition to this, selective-cleavage of the peptide sequence by MMP-9 results in the generation of a fluorescence signal due to separation of the quencher molecule from the fluorophore attached onto the MMP-9 sensitive peptide sequence, resulting in its detection. This protease-specific activation of the nanoprobes helps in precise tumor environment detection and imaging. The nanoprobes were thoroughly characterized for their chemical, physical and biological activities. The potential of these dual-sensitive nanoprobes to distinguish tumor-like microenvironments (low pH and elevated MMP-9 levels) from non-cancerous ones was evaluated in vitro in 2D cell culture as well as in 3D microscaffolds. The fluorescence microscopy images obtained in both in vitro systems revealed that low pH and high MMP-9 levels could be successfully visualised using these dual-sensitive nanoprobes. Therefore, these nanoprobes would find potential applications as a non-invasive imaging tool for visualising tumor margins in real-time.

AB  - Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is defined as the unexpected death of an individual, not due to any extracardiac cause, occurring within one hour of symptom onset or within 24 hours of last being seen in good health if the death is unwitnessed. Forensic pathologists routinely encounter several SCD cases in their practice. The presentation of such cases can be of two types; firstly, with typical signs and symptoms suggestive of cardiac pathology, and secondly, devoid of any presentation history. This history helps forensic pathologists look for relevant findings during the autopsy examination. The authors intend to explore the feasibility of using advanced radiological techniques like post-mortem CT (PMCT) in determining the cause of death through a minimally invasive approach. In the present case, a 65-year-old male was found unresponsive at his residence on the morning of his death. He had a history of dull chest pain for the past two days, which had resolved after he self-prescribed a few medications. The presenting complaint of chest pain had started the intervening night prior to his death. The deceased was a known case of hypertension and was not compliant with treatment, as stated by the relatives. He was declared as brought dead by the treating emergency medicine physician at the Fortis Flt. Lt. Rajan Dhall Hospital and the body was sent by the authorities to the mortuary of the Department of Forensic Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi for autopsy examination since an autopsy should be conducted by a government hospital or institute by law. PMCT depicted an alternate hyperdense and hypodense region circumferentially surrounding the heart, indicating hemopericardium. It was followed by a traditional autopsy and histopathology examination, which confirmed the presence of hemopericardium and left ventricular rupture associated with acute coronary insufficiency. Such cases with an indicative history, circumstantial evidence, and PMCT findings can be considered for minimal invasive autopsy. If the external findings indicate the application of physical force, then an explorative dissection could be done. Therefore, we conclude that PMCT can be used as a reliable tool for determining the cause of death in SCDs on a case-to-case basis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulnar nerve is frequently involved in mononeuropathies of the upper limb. Ulnar neuropathies have been diagnosed conventionally using clinical and electrophysiological findings. Physicians opt for nerve imaging in patients with ambiguous electrophysiological tests to gain additional information, identify etiology and plan management.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the electrophysiological and the magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) findings in patients with nontraumatic ulnar neuropathy.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with suspected nontraumatic ulnar mononeuropathy were recruited; clinical assessment and electrophysiological studies (EPSs) were done in all. After EPS, patients with localization of lesion along the ulnar nerve underwent MRN.
RESULTS: All 39 patients recruited had clinical findings suggestive of ulnar neuropathy; Electrophysiological confirmation was possible in 36/39 (92.30%) patients. Localization of ulnar nerve lesion to elbow and wrist was possible in 27 (75%) and 9 (25%) patients, respectively. MRN was done in 22 patients; a lesion was identified in 19 of 22 (86.36%) ulnar nerves studied. Thickening and hyperintensity in T2 W/short TI inversion recovery images of ulnar nerve at the level of olecranon, suggesting ulnar neuropathy at elbow, was the commonest (8/22) imaging finding.
CONCLUSIONS: MRN acts as a complimentary tool to EPS for evaluating nontraumatic ulnar neuropathy. By identifying the etiology, MRN is likely to modify the management decision.

AB  - A man in his 30s, with a history of two operated penetrating keratoplasty (PK), primarily for viral keratitis, presented with pain, redness and diminution of vision in his left eye of 4 days duration. Postoperatively, he was prescribed oral antivirals, topical steroid eyedrops, lubricants and antiglaucoma medications. Eight months after transplantation, an epithelial defect with heaped up margins was noted on anterior segment evaluation on a routine follow-up visit. On checking his medications, it was found that the patient was unknowingly using bromfenac drops in place of brimonidine tartrate for the past month. A diagnosis of neurotrophic keratitis was made in the setting of PK performed for viral keratitis, incited by use of topical bromfenac. The patient was prescribed preservative-free lubricants with immediate discontinuation of bromfenac drops. Topical steroid drops were withheld till the epithelial defect healed. Complete healing of the defect was noted after 4 weeks of therapy.

AB  - Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is a hypermucoviscous phenotype of classical Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKp) that causes serious infections in the community. The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant hvKp isolates (producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases) along with other virulence factors in health care settings has become a clinical crisis. Here, we aimed to compare the distribution of virulence determinants and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in relation to various sequence types (STs) among the clinical hvKp isolates from both settings, to reinforce our understanding of their epidemiology and pathogenic potential. A total of 120 K. pneumoniae isolates confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry were selected. hvKp was phenotypically identified by string test and genotypically confirmed by the presence of the iucA gene using PCR. Molecular characterization of hvKp isolates was done by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 11.6% (14/120) isolates were confirmed as hvKp by PCR (9.1% [11/120] string positive and 3.3% [4/120] positive by both methods); these were predominantly isolated from bloodstream infection (50%, 7/14), urinary tract infection (29%, 4/14), and respiratory tract infection (21%, 3/14). For all 14 hvKp infections, for 14.2% the source was in the community and for 85.7% the source was a health care setting. Two virulent plasmids were identified by WGS among the hvKp isolates from both settings. K64 was found to be the commonest capsular serotype (28.5%, 4/14), and ST2096 was the most common ST (28.5%, 4/14) by WGS. Two new STs were revealed: ST231 (reported to cause outbreaks) and ST43. The genome of one isolate was determined to be carrying AMR genes (blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-5, blaOXA-181, blaOXA-232, etc.) in addition to virulence genes, highlighting the clonal spread of hvKp in both community and health care settings. IMPORTANCE To date, studies comparing the genomic characteristics of hospital- and community-acquired hvKp were very few in India. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genomic characteristics of hvKp isolates from hospital and community settings. ST2096 was found as the most common ST along with novel STs ST231 and ST43. Our study also revealed the genome is simultaneously carrying AMR as well as virulence genes in isolates from both settings, highlighting the emergence of MDR hvKp STs integrated with virulence genes in both community and health care settings. Thus, hvKp may present a serious global threat, and essential steps are needed to prevent its further dissemination.

AB  - Systems genetics is key for integrating a large number of variants associated with diseases. Vitamin K (VK) is one of the scarcely studied disease conditions. In this work, we ascertained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and variants associated with individual subpopulations of VK disease phenotypes, viz., myocardial infarction, renal failure and prostate cancer. We sought to ask whether or not any DEGs harbor pathogenic variants common in these conditions, attempt to bridge the gap in finding characteristic biomarkers and discuss the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the biogenesis of VK deficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early evidence suggests good response to pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in DYT-KMT2B.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess outcomes and identify predictors of good outcome following GPi-DBS in DYT-KMT2B.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane and MDS-abstracts databases using the MeSH terms "KMT2B and DYT28". We included studies that reported objective outcomes following GPi-DBS in DYT-KMT2B. The BFMDRS-M (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale- Movement) total scores pre- and post-surgery were used to quantify outcomes. We calculated pooled effects using a random effects meta-analysis and used meta-regression to identify potential effect modifiers. Multiple linear regression using individual patient data was used to identify predictors of good outcome (>50% improvement from baseline on BFMDRS-M).
RESULTS: Initial searches screened 132 abstracts of which 34 full-text articles were identified to be of potential interest. Ten studies reporting 42 individual patients, met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the final review. The mean age at onset was 6.4 ± 5.7 years and 40% were male. The median follow-up was 12 months (range: 1-264 months). GPi-DBS resulted in median BFMDRS-M improvement of 42.7% (range: -103.5% to 95.9%) postoperatively. Pooled proportion of patients experiencing clinical improvement >50% on BFMDRS-M was 41% (95% CI: 27%-57%). Male gender [β: 22.6, 95% CI: 8.0-37.3, P = 0.004), and higher pre-operative BFMDRS-M score [β: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.36-0.87, P < 0.001) were independently associated with better outcome.
CONCLUSION: KMT2B-associated dystonia responds effectively to pallidal stimulation. The outcome is better in males and those with more severe dystonia at baseline.

T2  - Movement Disorders: Official Journal of the Movement Disorder Society
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device-assisted and neuromodulatory therapies are the standard of care for Parkinson's disease (PD) with disabling motor complications. We aimed to compare and rank the currently available advanced therapies for PD on patient relevant outcomes.
METHODS: We searched various databases for randomized controlled trials that studied subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS, pallidotomy, subthalamotomy, continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI), or intrajejunal levodopa infusion (IJLI), in patients with PD and motor complications. Primary outcome was the quality of life (QOL) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III and II, ON time, OFF time, levodopa equivalent daily doses, and adverse events (AE). Data were pooled using a Bayesian network meta-analysis, summarized as mean difference (MD) with 95% credibility intervals (CrI) and visualized in forest plots/league tables. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve plots determined the ranking probability.
RESULTS: We identified 6745 citations and included 26 trials. STN-DBS (MD, -8.0; 95% CrI, -11, -5.8), GPi-DBS (MD, -7.1; 95% CrI, -11, -2.9), and IJLI (MD, -7.0; 95% CrI, -12, -1.8) led to better QOL than medical therapy alone, without significant differences among them. STN-DBS had the highest probability of being ranked the best treatment for QOL (79.6%), followed by IJLI (63.5%) and GPi-DBS (62.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: In advanced PD, STN-DBS alleviates more patient and clinician relevant outcomes, followed by GPi-DBS and IJLI. In resource limited settings, unilateral pallidotomy may improve motor symptoms and activities of daily living, although overall QOL may not be improved. © 2022 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

AB  - Sarcoma pathology discrepancy is well known owing to the extremely heterogenous and rare nature of this tumour. Through this case, we want to highlight the difficulty that a patient has to undergo in a case of misdiagnosis. A 20-year-old male presented with swelling in the right foot for 4 months, which was initially diagnosed as alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, subsequently as synovial sarcoma and finally as Ewing's sarcoma (based upon positive Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 (EWSR1) by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and he underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical excision with grafting before he presented to our institute, where the pathologists reviewed the biopsy slides, which were positive for HMB45 and negative for Melan-A suggestive of clear cell sarcoma. The next-generation sequencing suggested EWSR1-ATF1 fusion, which again reinforced the diagnosis. This case throws light on the importance of expert pathology and interpreting molecular results in the right context.

AB  - X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is a rare, recently characterized type of autophagic vacuolar myopathy caused by mutations in the VMA21 gene. It is characterized by slowly progressive weakness restricted to proximal limb muscles and generally has a favorable outcome. The characteristic histological and ultrastructural features distinguish this entity from other mimics, notably Danon disease. XMEA is an under recognized disease and should be considered in the differentials of slowly progressive myopathy in children. Awareness of this rare entity is also important for the pathologists in order to distinguish it from other causes of vacuolar myopathy in view of its favourable prognosis. We report the first genetically confirmed case of XMEA from India in an 8-year-old boy which was diagnosed based on the characteristic light microscopic and ultrastructural findings on muscle biopsy and subsequently confirmed by mutation analysis. The differential diagnostic considerations are also discussed.

AB  - Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive hematolymphoid malignancy that arises from non Langerhans histiocytes and usually involves the skin, lymph nodes, and intestine. The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare occurrence with around 30 cases being reported in English literature. Morphological and immunohistochemical evidence of histiocytic differentiation is essential for diagnosis. Prognosis is very poor and consensus on treatment is not available mainly due to its rarity. We report two cases of HS with varied clinical presentation and pathological findings and elucidate the diagnostic challenges of this rare entity.

AB  - GRP78 overexpression in myeloma cells has been associated with bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, serum GRP78 as a maker of bortezomib-based treatment response remains unexplored. The objective of the study was to evaluate serum GRP78 levels in MM patients who underwent a bortezomib-based induction regimen. This cross-sectional study included adult MM patients (n=30) who completed at least four cycles of bortezomib-based induction therapy. Healthy volunteers (n=30) and newly diagnosed MM patients (n=19) were also recruited to identify the disease-associated change in GRP78 levels. Serum GRP78 was estimated by ELISA. Surface and intracellular expression of GRP78 in bone marrow plasma cells was evaluated in ten MM patients by flow cytometry. Among 30 MM patients [median (range): 52 (38-68) years; 20 males] who completed at least four cycles of bortezomib-based induction therapy, 20 were responders and 10 were non-responders. Serum GRP78 levels were not significantly different between responders [median (IQR): 5.2 (3.1, 8.0) μg/ml] and non-responders [median (IQR): 4.3 (0.1, 7.1) μg/ml] (p=0.4). Although non-significant (p=0.3), median serum GRP78 was higher in newly diagnosed patients when compared to healthy volunteers. Bone marrow plasma cells ranged from 0.2 to 57.8% in the analyzed samples. Intracellular GRP78 expression in bone marrow plasma cells was higher (1.6 to 5 times) when compared to surface expression. To conclude, serum GRP78 levels vary widely in different MM patient groups but did not correlate with response to a bortezomib-based induction regimen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in India. To clarify rates of actionable mutations, and thereby identify opportunities to improve the delivery of best available care for a large volume of patients, a comprehensive review of available data is warranted.
METHODS: Studies that reported prevalence of any actionable gene variant among adult Indian patients with advanced NSCLC were selected from three databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library). Ranges in actionable variant prevalence were reported. Meta-analysis of proportions was completed among studies specifically evaluating mutational prevalence within ALK or EGFR. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken among populations sharing high heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were selected. Ranges in actionable mutational prevalence among NSCLC patients were as follows: ALK: 4.1-21.4%, BRAF: 1.5-3.5%, EGFR: 11.9-51.8%, HER2: 0-1.5%, KRAS: 4.5-6.4%, NTRK: 0-.7%, and ROS-1: 3.5-4.1%. Following sensitivity analysis, pooled ALK mutational prevalence rates were 8.3% (95% CIs: 6.6-10.4%) and 4.01% (95% CIs: 2.3-7.0) for adenocarcinoma and NSCLC patients, respectively. Pooled EGFR mutational prevalence rates were 28.7% (95% CIs: 23.5-34.6%) and 24.2% (95% CIs: 19.9-29.1%) for adenocarcinoma and NSCLC patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 40% of Indian patients with advanced adenocarcinoma and 30% with NSCLC share an actionable mutation in ALK or EGFR. Approximately one-half of adenocarcinoma patients have an actionable variant. Efforts should be directed toward efficiently identifying candidates for targeted agents and delivering such treatments.

AB  - Digital hemoglobinometers have been used as point-of-care tests (POCT) to estimate the burden of anemia in community-based studies and national-level surveys in India. As the accuracy of hemoglobin estimated in POCT varies, there is a need for adjustments to the POCT-hemoglobin to ensure they are closer to reality and are comparable. We used data (collected between 2016 and 2020) (N = 1145) from four studies from India: three among pregnant women and 6-59-month-old children from Haryana and the fourth from a national nutritional survey among 1-19-year-old children. We compared the same individuals' POCT-hemoglobin (capillary blood) and automated hematology analyzers (AHA) hemoglobin (venous blood) and developed a predictive linear regression model to obtain the correction equation for POCT-hemoglobin. We analyzed paired data from 1145 participants. The correction equation for obtaining the true hemoglobin value = 3.35 + 0.71 × POCT-hemoglobin using capillary blood (adjusted R2-64.4% and mean squared error -0.841 g/dL). In comparison with the AHA-hemoglobin, the mean difference of POCT-hemoglobin was 0.2 g/dL, while with the predicted Hb obtained from the correction equation it was 0.01 g/dL. The correction equation was the first attempt at deriving the true hemoglobin values from the POCTs. There is a need for multi-country collaborative studies to improve the correction equation by adjusting for factors affecting hemoglobin estimation.

AB  - Fortification of staple food items with iron is a potential strategy to address anemia for a larger population. We reviewed studies to assess the impact of iron-fortified rice (IFR) on hemoglobin levels of individuals more than six months of age. We included studies assessing the effectiveness of IFR (with or without other micronutrients) conducted in any part of the world available in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, clinicaltrials.gov, International database of prospectively registered systematic reviews in health and social care (PROSPERO), unicef.org, and who.int databases and published from January 1, 1990 to April 1, 2019 (PROSPERO registration number: RD42020139895). We extracted the changes in hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum transferrin levels among the participants. Finally, data from 15 trials and their 21 subsets were analyzed. Mean difference in hemoglobin was 0.53 g/dl (95% CI: 0.26, 0.80, P < 0.001, I2 = 84%) in the IFR group compared to the control group. In the subgroup analysis after removing studies with small sample size and high risk for bias, a mean difference of 0.44 g/dl (95% CI: 0.20, 0.69, P < 0.001, I2 = 82%) was observed. No significant effect on serum ferritin or transferrin levels was observed. From this review it can be concluded that fortification of rice with iron can be adopted as an intervention to improve hemoglobin levels, especially in countries where rice is the major part food of staple diet. Research is needed on an optimal iron compound for fortification and the acceptance of IFR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in exclusively breast-fed infants in the absence of appropriate vitamin D supplementation.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of two doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D levels of mother-infant pairs and to assess its effect on growth parameters (weight, length and head circumference) and bone mass of infants.
STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
PARTICIPANTS: Lactating mother-infant pairs (n=220).
INTERVENTION: Maternal oral vitamin D supplementation in two doses (group 1: 1,20,000 IU/month and group 2: 12,000 IU/month) for 12 months.
MAIN OUTCOMES: Main outcomes: Maternal and infant serum 25OHD levels, and infants' growth and bone mass.
RESULTS: There was high prevalence of VDD at baseline in mothers (94%) as well as infants (98.5%), which was reduced to 43.1% in (mothers) and 46.5% in infants after 12 months. Significantly higher median (IQR) serum 25OHD levels (ng/mL) were observed among mothers in group 1 compared to group 2 [46 (17-159) vs 18 (6-64); P<0.01] and in infants [36.5 (15-160) vs 17 (7-32); P<0.01]. No significant association was observed between growth parameters or bone mass and serum 25OHD levels of mother or infant between the two groups. Four mothers (3.6%) and two infants (1.8%) in group I had serum 25OHD>100 ng/mL, but without hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia.
CONCLUSION: Bolus vitamin D supplementation in the dose of 1,20,000 IU/month was more efficacious in improving maternal and infant vitamin D status at 12 months, as compared to 12,000 IU/month.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish communication with relatives of obstetrical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to an isolation ward by systematic use of quality improvement tools during the COVID-19 pandemic as there were many challenges in communicating with relatives.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary-care teaching hospital based on four systematic steps of Point of Care Improvement methodology. After identifying the problem, a quality improvement team was constituted, which formed a specific aim. After root-cause analysis with fishbone tool, three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles with various interventions were planned.
RESULTS: The outcome was measured as percentage of relatives of obstetrical patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 who were counseled about vital patient-related information. The baseline percentage of counseling of relatives of COVID-19-positive obstetrical patients admitted to the hospital was 14% per day. After three PDSA cycles, the target of 66.5% was achieved.
CONCLUSION: Communication with the relatives of COVID-19-positive obstetrical patients admitted to isolation wards in the hospital could be easily streamlined without any additional resources using the principles of quality improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) and its correlates among apparently healthy children and adolescents.
METHODS: We carried out a secondary analysis of data of Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18 to analyze the pre-valence and predictors of VDD among Indian children and adolescents.
RESULTS: The over-all prevalence of VDD in preschool children (1-4 years), school age (5-9 years) children, and adolescents (10-19 years) was 13.7%, 18.2%, and 23.9%, respectively. Age, living in urban area, and winter season were significantly associated with VDD. Vegetarian diet and high-income households were the main risk factors observed in 5-19 years age category. Female sex and less than three hour of physical activity/week were independent risk factors among adolescents.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence and determinants of VDD across different age-groups are reported, and these should be interpreted and addressed to decrease the burden of VDD in India.

AB  - Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs) have a role in the management of portal hypertension. They are currently advocated in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (CSPH) based on Baveno-VII consensus. Current survey aimed to evaluate the practice and perceptions of prescribing NSBBs in portal hypertension by gastroenterologists and hepatologists in Asia-Pacific region in patients with compensated cirrhosis. Out of 1500 gastroenterologists approached in the region, 328 gastroenterologists responded and completed the survey. 75% of the respondents were found not to be following practice of evaluating CSPH as they prescribed NSBBs in patients of compensated cirrhosis with high-risk varices only. Major concerns raised were non-availability of hepatic venous pressure gradient and reliable non-invasive tests as surrogate of CSPH to adapt PREDESCI methodology. While 56.7% used carvedilol as the preferred NSBB to treat patients with compensated cirrhosis, 43.3% used propranolol. This survey assessed the real-world scenario of prescribing NSBBs among practicing gastroenterologists/hepatologists in patients with compensated cirrhosis.

AB  - While detection of malignancies on mammography has received a boost with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), detection of cancers of very small size remains challenging. This is however clinically significant as the purpose of mammography is early detection of cancer, making it imperative to pick them up when they are still very small. Mammography has the highest spatial resolution (image sizes as high as 3328 × 4096 pixels) out of all imaging modalities, a requirement that stems from the need to detect fine features of the smallest cancers on screening. However due to computational constraints, most state of the art CNNs work on reduced resolution images. Those that work on higher resolutions, compromise on global context and work at single scale. In this work, we show that resolution, scale and image-context are all important independent factors in detection of small masses. We thereby use a fully convolutional network, with the ability to take any input size. In addition, we incorporate a systematic multi-scale, multi-resolution approach, and encode image context, which we show are critical factors to detection of small masses. We show that this approach improves the detection of cancer, particularly for small masses in comparison to the baseline model. We perform a single institution multicentre study, and show the performance of the model on a diagnostic mammography dataset, a screening mammography dataset, as well as a curated dataset of small cancers < 1 cm in size. We show that our approach improves the sensitivity from 61.53 to 87.18% at 0.3 False Positives per Image (FPI) on this small cancer dataset. Model and code are available from  https://github.com/amangupt01/Small_Cancer_Detection.

AB  - AIMS: The conventional Seldinger and trocar techniques of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) have inherent limitations in infants and younger children. We studied the role of a novel coaxial technique of PCN in children under the age of 5 years in comparison to the conventional techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center feasibility trial based on 24 consecutive patients (n = 24 kidneys) under the age of 5 years, conducted over 12 months, substratified into Group I (n = 10): PCN with conventional Seldinger (n = 2) and trocar (n = 8) techniques and Group II (n = 14): PCN with proposed coaxial technique. In the proposed technique, catheter was inserted through the bore of a 14-G needle. The observation parameters included successful placement of PCN into the renal pelvis with free drainage of urine, number of needle punctures, duration of procedure, need for fluoroscopy, and procedural complications.
RESULTS: Proposed technique was successful in all cases with single-needle puncture, while conventional techniques were successful in 8/10 (80%) cases with multiple needle punctures required in 3/10 (33.3%) cases (P = 0.163 and 0.059, respectively). Proposed technique was associated with lower median procedure time (6 min vs. 10.5 min; P < 0.001) and lower incidence of fluoroscopy use (0/14, 0% vs. 5/10, 50%; P = 0.006) than the conventional techniques. No complications were seen with either technique.
CONCLUSION: The proposed coaxial technique is a feasible alternative to the conventional techniques of PCN in young children. It reduces the procedure time and the need for fluoroscopy in these patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The WHO defines giant cell tumor as a benign locally aggressive neoplasm with metastasizing capacity and aggressive behavior. Very rarely, these tumors are seen fungating, mostly when neglected. But when they do, the treatment option commonly conferred is amputation of the limb which is disabling and traumatizing.
CASE REPORT: We report three cases of fungating limb masses (proximal tibia, distal fibula, and distal radius) diagnosed with giant cell tumor histologically, undergoing limb saving surgeries with various reconstruction techniques to endorse a good quality of life and functioning limb.
CONCLUSION: Our study is one of the earliest to report medium-term follow-up after such limb salvage procedure. We recommend that salvage procedures should be considered in giant cell tumors even in the presence of fungation if there is no neurovascular encasement.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) gene Rv1515c encodes a conserved hypothetical protein exclusively present within organisms of MTB complex and absent in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. In silico analysis revealed that Rv1515c contain S-adenosylmethionine binding site and methyltransferase domain. The DNA binding and DNA methyltransferase activity of Rv1515c was confirmed in vitro. Knock-in of Rv1515c in a model mycobacteria M. smegmatis (M. s_Rv1515c) resulted in remarkable physiological and morphological changes and conferred the recombinant strain with an ability to adapt to various stress conditions, including resistance to TB drugs. M. s_Rv1515c was phagocytosed at a greater rate and displayed extended intra-macrophage survival in vitro. Recombinant M. s_Rv1515c contributed to enhanced virulence by suppressing the host defense mechanisms including RNS and ROS production, and apoptotic clearance. M. s_Rv1515c, while suppressing the phagolysosomal maturation, modulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and also inhibited antigen presentation by downregulating the expression of MHC-I/MHC-II and co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86. Mice infected with M. s_Rv1515c produced more Treg cells than vector control (M. s_Vc) and exhibited reduced effector T cell responses, along-with reduced expression of macrophage activation markers in the chronic phase of infection. M. s_Rv1515c was able to survive in the major organs of mice up to 7 weeks post-infection. These results indicate a crucial role of Rv1515c in M. tb pathogenesis.

AB  - Autonomic modulation is critical during various physiological activities, including orthostatic stimuli and primarily evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV). Orthostatic stress affects people differently suggesting the possibility of identification of predisposed groups to autonomic dysfunction-related disorders in a healthy state. One way to understand this kind of variability is by using Ayurvedic approach that classifies healthy individuals into Prakriti types based on clinical phenotypes. To this end, we explored the differential response to orthostatic stress in different Prakriti types using HRV. HRV was measured in 379 subjects(Vata = 97, Pitta = 68, Kapha = 68, and Mixed Prakriti = 146) from two geographical regions(Vadu and Delhi NCR) for 5 min supine (baseline), 3 min head-up-tilt (HUT) at 60°, and 5 min resupine. We observed that Kapha group had lower baseline HRV than other two groups, although not statistically significant. The relative change (%Δ1&2 ) in various HRV parameters in response to HUT was although minimal in Kapha group. Kapha also had significantly lower change in HR, LF (nu), HF (nu), and LF/HF than Pitta in response to HUT. The relative change (%Δ1 ) in HR and parasympathetic parameters (RMSSD, HF, SD1) was significantly greater in the Vata than in the Kapha. Thus, the low baseline and lower response to HUT in Kapha and the maximum drop in parasympathetic activity of Vata may indicate a predisposition to early autonomic dysfunction and associated conditions. It emphasizes the critical role of Prakriti-based phenotyping in stratifying the differential responses of cardiac autonomic modulation in various postures among healthy individuals across different populations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thiopurines are widely used to maintain remission in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Reported effectiveness and tolerability rates have been variable across studies. There are only sparse data in Asian population regarding the long-term efficacy and safety of thiopurines.
METHODS: Records of 5351 patients followed up at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinic, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from 2004 to 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Safety was evaluated in terms of long-term adverse events and development of malignancy.
RESULTS: Of 5351 patients with IBD, 1093 who received thiopurine for > 3 months (UC = 788 [proctitis-1.9%, left-sided colitis-44.9%, & pancolitis-53.1%] & CD = 305 [inflammatory-42.6%, stricturing-46.9%, & fistulizing-10.5%]) were included (60.8%-male patients). Follow up and treatment duration on thiopurine were 7 (4-12) years and 39.4 ± 40.3 months, respectively, with 254 (23.2%) patients receiving thiopurines for more than 5 and 68 (6.2%) receiving for more than 10 years. Three hundred and fifty-nine (UC: 249 [31.6%]; CD: 110 [36.1%]; P = 0.1) patients developed adverse events; commonest was myelosuppression (23.4%) followed by gastrointestinal intolerance (3%), flu-like illness (1.7%), and arthralgia/myalgia (1.4%). Myelosuppression was the commonest cause of thiopurine withdrawal. No patient (including 254 patients on thiopurine for ≥ 5 years) developed lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. The cumulative probability of staying free from adverse events in overall IBD cohort at 1, 2, and 5 years was 78.6%, 71.9%, and 68.4%, respectively, and this was comparable between UC and CD (P = 0.09).
CONCLUSION: Long-term follow up of patients with IBD from northern India on thiopurine monotherapy demonstrated minimal risk of development of lymphoma as well as non-melanoma skin cancer.

AB  - This narrative review is aimed to practically review and evaluate the existing evidence and illuminate the effectiveness of physical activity, yoga, and exercise for postpartum and midlife weight management. A comprehensive review was conducted using electronic databases such as PubMed and google scholar using search terms physical activity, exercise, yoga, postpartum, midlife, weight loss, weight reduction, and all the probable terms. This helped in generating evidence-based information and formulating practical physical activity prescriptions to be used by obstetricians, general clinicians, nutritionists, and other allied healthcare personnel. Overweight and obesity in postpartum and midlife women present long-term health risks and complications. Indulging in optimum physical activity comprising exercise and yoga will help in weight management, increasing muscular strength, and endurance thus improving overall health and well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study explored the association between BMI and COVID-19 positive status in a tertiary care hospital from New Delhi.
METHODS: Three hundred and seventy nine adult patients who presented to COVID-19 screening outpatient department of the hospital were interviewed over the phone regarding their body weight and height. The COVID-19 RT-PCR report of the patients was extracted from the hospital information system.
RESULTS: The mean BMI and the prevalence of obesity was observed to be higher in individuals who were detected to be COVID-19 RT-PCR positive as compared to those who were negative. With every one-unit increment in BMI above 23 kg/m2, the odds of being COVID-19 positive increased by 1.8 times among these patients.
CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a dose-response association between BMI and the odds of COVID-19 infection in individuals with excess weight.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Postpartum obesity is a public health concern. There is a need to counsel women about their postpartum weight management, accounting for various barriers they face. Limited literature in the Indian context underscored the need to develop the clinical practice guideline to be used by healthcare providers in Indian healthcare settings.
METHODS: The guideline was formulated by following the standardised methodology proposed by the National Health and Medical Research Council. Various steps such as identification of the patient population, assembly of the guideline development groups, identification of the key clinical questions, guideline development methods, grading the quality of evidence and recommendations and guideline translation were carried out to develop and validate the clinical practice recommendations.
RESULTS: The evidence and consensus-based clinical practice guideline has been developed, providing recommendations for key topics of interest for first-line treatment of obesity (lifestyle-related management). Recommendations focus on screening and initiating discussion with overweight and obese postpartum women as well as those who had normal pre-pregnancy body mass index but have retained excessive weight in the postpartum period. Recommendations highlight the evaluation and management of dietary, physical activity and breastfeeding behaviour. Recommendations also account for behavioural modification techniques to improve adherence to the prescribed weight management advice. Duration and frequency of follow-ups as well as the advice to be disseminated have also been discussed in the recommendations.
CONCLUSION: The guideline provides clinical practice points that can be used by healthcare providers, postpartum women and policymakers for opportunistic screening and management of postpartum obesity.

AB  - Anemia is a significant public health problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The co-existence of other micronutrient deficiencies and iron deficiency among pregnant women may be the reason for the inability to control anemia through iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation. Multiple micronutrient supplementation (MMS) in pregnancy may help to overcome this problem. However, the recent World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on MMS supplementation in pregnancy raised concerns regarding the adequacy of a 30mg iron dose in the MMS supplements in LMICs. The review summarized the literature to answer this question. Though most studies showed a comparable effect of MMS with 30mg iron and IFA with 60mg iron on maternal anemia outcomes, anemia persisted in the third trimester in both groups. There is a need to consider the use of a higher iron dose in MMS, especially in LMICs, to combat the problem of anemia, alongside correcting other micronutrient deficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca or dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disorder underpinned by a complex inflammatory cycle. Introduction of topical cyclosporine has been a significant advance in the management of DED. In recent years advancements in formulation technology have led to development of micellar nano-particulate (MNP) cyclosporine formulations that promise better penetration into ocular target tissues and potential for reduced ocular surface irritation.
METHODS: We compared two dosing regimes of a proprietary MNP cyclosporine emulsion with the widely marketed topical cyclosporine formulation Restasis™ in a multicenter parallel-group randomised trial in patients with DED. Patients were randomised to one of 3 treatment groups with 90 patients eligible for the per protocol analysis: 30 in the higher dose test arm A; 32 in the lower dose test arm B; and 28 in the Restasis™ control arm C. All scored efficacy endpoints were tested for significance by comparing the mean change in scores from baseline in the test groups with that in the control group at 12 weeks, using the Student's t test. Wilcoxon's rank sum test was used to test individual symptom scores and clinician's global evaluation of treatment grades.
RESULTS: Corneal fluorescein staining score, the primary efficacy endpoint, decreased by 6.8 ± 4.0, 5.7 ± 3.9, and 4.6 ± 3.6 points in the 3 groups respectively, indicating superior efficacy in test arm A in comparison to control arm C (p = 0.0026). Schirmer's tear test, conjunctival lissamine staining score, ocular surface disease index, and individual dry eye symptom scores also favoured higher dose MNP cyclosporine over Restasis™. The study failed to differentiate the treatment arms in terms of clinician's global evaluation of treatment, use of tear substitutes, best corrected visual acuity or safety and toleration.
CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the dose of 1 drop of a 0.05% w/v ophthalmic emulsion of MNP cyclosporine administered topically twice daily yields better outcomes at 12 weeks than the lower dose tested in the study, and is more efficacious than an equivalent dose of Restasis™, the active control used in the study.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India on 29/03/2019, and was assigned registration number CTRI/2019/03/018319.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many factors have been proposed to be associated with the severity of disease and mortality in COVID-19. Vitamin D had recently been reviewed as one of these factors.
AIM AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between Vitamin D and the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After approval from Institutional Ethics Committee, this prospective cohort study was carried out in selected tertiary care teaching medical institutes of Central India. Participants were COVID-19 patients of the age group of 18 years and above admitted during the study period. They were categorized into four groups as asymptomatic (Group A), mild (Group B), moderate (Group C), and severe (Group D) based on clinical symptoms, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and chest imaging. Serum level of Vitamin 25(OH) D was measured using chemiluminescent immunoassay. The outcome of the disease was classified as recovery and death during hospitalization. The association of sociodemographic and medical characteristics with treatment outcome was studied using an appropriate statistical test. A full logistic regression model was built for the assessment of the relationship between treatment outcomes with Vitamin D level. Further, one receiver operating characteristic curve was developed to examine the prognostic significance of Vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients.
RESULTS: Out of 748 enrolled patients, 44 (5.88%), had severe disease (Group D). A total of 721 cases (96.39%) recovered and were discharged, whereas 27 (3.61%) died during hospitalization. Mean Vitamin D level was found to be significantly different in discharged patients compared to those who were deceased. Increasing age-adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.07 [1.02-1.12]), known hypertension AOR (95%CI) = 3.38 (1.13-10.08), and diabetes mellitus AOR (95%CI) =28.5 (6.04-134.13) were found to be significant predictors of death among COVID-19 patients. Increasing Vitamin D level was found to be protective against COVID-19-related death (AOR (95% CI = 0.87 [0.80-0.94]).
CONCLUSION: Vitamin D was significantly associated with the disease severity and mortality in COVID-19.

AB  - Air pollution has emerged as a serious threat to human health due to close association with spectrum of chronic ailments including cardiovascular disorders, respiratory diseases, nervous system dysfunctions, diabetes and cancer. Exposure to air-borne pollutants along with poor eating behaviours and inferior dietary quality irreversibly impacts epigenomic landscape, leading to aberrant transcriptional control of gene expression which is central to patho-physiology of non-communicable diseases. It is assumed that nutriepigenomic interventions such as vitamins can control such adverse effects through their immediate action on mitochondrial epigenomic-axis. Importantly, the exhaustive clinical utility of vitamins-interceded epigenetic synchronization is not well characterized. Therefore, improving the current limitations linked to stability and bioavailability issues in vitamin formulations is highly warranted. The present review not only sums up the available data on the role of vitamins as potential epigenetic modifiers but also discusses the importance of nano-engineered vitamins as potential epidrugs for dietary and pharmacological intervention to mitigate the long-term effects of air pollution toxicity.

AB  - Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are carbonaceous nanodots that are natural crystalline semiconductors and range from 1 to 20 nm. The broad range of applications for GQDs is based on their unique physical and chemical properties. Compared to inorganic quantum dots, GQDs possess numerous advantages, including formidable biocompatibility, low intrinsic toxicity, excellent dispensability, hydrophilicity, and surface grating, thus making them promising materials for nanophotonic applications. Owing to their unique photonic compliant properties, such as superb solubility, robust chemical inertness, large specific surface area, superabundant surface conjugation sites, superior photostability, resistance to photobleaching, and nonblinking, GQDs have emerged as a novel class of probes for the detection of biomolecules and study of their molecular interactions. Here, we present a brief overview of GQDs, their advantages over quantum dots (QDs), various synthesis procedures, and different surface conjugation chemistries for detecting cell-free circulating nucleic acids (CNAs). With the prominent rise of liquid biopsy-based approaches for real-time detection of CNAs, GQDs-based strategies might be a step toward early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment monitoring, and outcome prediction of various non-communicable diseases, including cancers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Uncertainties remain about the safety and efficacy of therapies for managing intracranial hypertension in acute brain injured (ABI) patients. This study aims to describe the therapeutical approaches used in ABI, with/without intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, among different pathologies and across different countries, and their association with six months mortality and neurological outcome.
METHODS: A preplanned subanalysis of the SYNAPSE-ICU study, a multicentre, prospective, international, observational cohort study, describing the ICP treatment, graded according to Therapy Intensity Level (TIL) scale, in patients with ABI during the first week of intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
RESULTS: 2320 patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 55 (I-III quartiles = 39-69) years, and 800 (34.5%) were female. During the first week from ICU admission, no-basic TIL was used in 382 (16.5%) patients, mild-moderate in 1643 (70.8%), and extreme in 295 cases (eTIL, 12.7%). Patients who received eTIL were younger (median age 49 (I-III quartiles = 35-62) vs 56 (40-69) years, p < 0.001), with less cardiovascular pre-injury comorbidities (859 (44%) vs 90 (31.4%), p < 0.001), with more episodes of neuroworsening (160 (56.1%) vs 653 (33.3%), p < 0.001), and were more frequently monitored with an ICP device (221 (74.9%) vs 1037 (51.2%), p < 0.001). Considerable variability in the frequency of use and type of eTIL adopted was observed between centres and countries. At six months, patients who received no-basic TIL had an increased risk of mortality (Hazard ratio, HR = 1.612, 95% Confidence Interval, CI = 1.243-2.091, p < 0.001) compared to patients who received eTIL. No difference was observed when comparing mild-moderate TIL with eTIL (HR = 1.017, 95% CI = 0.823-1.257, p = 0.873). No significant association between the use of TIL and neurological outcome was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: During the first week of ICU admission, therapies to control high ICP are frequently used, especially mild-moderate TIL. In selected patients, the use of aggressive strategies can have a beneficial effect on six months mortality but not on neurological outcome.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare a smartphone-based dichoptic video game with occlusion therapy in children with anisometropic amblyopia.
METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, interventional study, 55 children aged 5 to 15 years with anisometropic amblyopia were randomized into two groups: the video game group (n = 27) played a dichoptic video game with adjusted contrast for 2 hours/day and the patching group (n = 28) received occlusion therapy of the non-amblyopic eye for 6 hours/day. All patients were evaluated for best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), near vision, contrast sensitivity, and near and distance stereoacuity at baseline and 1, 2, and 3 months.
RESULTS: Mean distance BCVA improved from 0.74 ± 0.19 and 0.70 ± 0.18 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline to 0.53 ± 0.19 and 0.49 ± 0.19 logMAR, respectively, at 3 months (P < .001 for both). Mean near vision was 0.82 ± 0.19 and 0.81 ± 0.17 logMAR in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline and improved to 0.60 ± 0.16 and 0.63 ± 0.17 logMAR at 3 months (P < .001 for both). There was no significant difference in distance and near vision between the two groups at baseline and final follow-up visit. Contrast sensitivity was 1.41 ± 0.20 and 1.38 ± 0.20 in the video game and patching groups, respectively, at baseline and 1.74 ± 0.18 and 1.61 ± 0.21 at 3 months (P < .001 for both). At the final follow-up visit, contrast sensitivity was significantly better in the video game group compared to the patching group (P = .01). Near stereoacuity significantly improved only in the video game group (P = .006), whereas distance stereoacuity did not improve in either group.
CONCLUSIONS: Dichoptic video game therapy showed better results in terms of improvement in contrast sensitivity and near stereoacuity and similar outcomes for distance and near vision when compared to patching in children with anisometropic amblyopia. However, the availability of interesting games is essential to maintain children's interest. [J Pediatr Ophthalmol Strabismus. 2023;60(3):210-217.].

AB  - PURPOSE: Assistive technology (AT) has recently received considerable attention around the world. Studies have shown poor access to assistive technology for visual impairment (ATVI) in schools for the blind in India. The present article aimed at designing a school-based model to improve AT access in schools and provide hands-on training, and identify types of ocular morbidities present among students.
METHODS: The vision rehabilitation (VR) team of a tertiary eye-care center visited schools for the blind as a part of community-based VR services. The team conducted a basic eye examination and assessed best-corrected vision acuity (BCVA) and provided VR services. Furthermore, two schools were selected to establish an ATVI learning center as a pilot model.
RESULTS: In total, 1887 students were registered for VR and obtained their disability certificates in 2019-20. Retina problems (25.7%), globe abnormalities (25.5%), optic nerve atrophy (13.6%), and squint (12.0%) were common ocular problems identified in students. Around 50.3% of students had BCVA3 1/60 in the better eye who would be benefited from visual-based AT, and the remaining students with visual substitution AT. Further, 20.8% of them who had near vision between N18 to N24 would be benefitted from large print books. Two schools were provided ATVI with support from the WHO. Familiarization, demonstration, and initial training for ATVI were carried out.
CONCLUSION: A sizable number of the students would be benefitted from visual-based AT apart from visual substitutions AT. Students were interested to have such ATVI centers in the school for academic and non-academic skills development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the proportion of patients who received empirical treatment with antitubercular therapy (ATT) prior to the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the first multicentric, prospective study on HL from India, and to assess its impact on extent of disease at diagnosis and outcomes.
METHODS: Children < 18 y with biopsy proven HL were enrolled in InPOG-HL-15-01. Along with other clinical and epidemiological data, history of prior treatment with ATT was documented. All patients received treatment as per a risk-stratified, response-adapted strategy.
RESULTS: Out of 396, 115 (29%) children had received ATT prior to establishing a definitive diagnosis of HL. This cohort presented with advanced-stage disease (p = 0.001) and B symptoms (p = 0.001) in a higher proportion of cases. Consequently, those children were more likely to receive 6 rather than 4 cycles of chemotherapy (p = 0.001). They were more likely to have infradiaphragmatic involvement (p = 0.001). Overall survival and event-free survival were not different.
CONCLUSION: Empirical treatment with ATT in children presenting with lymphadenopathy continues to be practiced widely in India. The delay in diagnosis may contribute to children presenting with advanced-stage disease warranting more intensive treatment for successful outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adding adjuvant drugs to intrathecal local anesthetics improves the quality and duration of the sensory blockade and prolongs postoperative analgesia. Intrathecal opioids are synergistic with local anesthetics, thereby intensifying the sensory block without increasing the sympathetic block. This study was designed to comparatively evaluate the two different dosages of nalbuphine as intrathecal adjuvants on subarachnoid block (SAB) characteristics of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine.
METHODS: A randomized, triple arm study was conducted on 60 adult female patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, aged 30-60 years, scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy under SAB. Patients were randomized into three groups: group I received 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, group II received 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 1.6 mg of nalbuphine, and group III received 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 2.4 mg of nalbuphine. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia, while secondary outcomes included onset, duration of sensory and motor block, maximum cephalic extension, and two dermatome segment regressions.
RESULTS: The onset time of the sensory block was 3.2 ± 1.0 minutes, 3.5 ± 1.6 minutes, and 3.1 ± 1.1 minutes in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The onset time of the motor block was 8.5 ± 1.0 minutes, 8.5 ± 1.1 minutes, and 8.2 ± 1.1 minutes in groups I, II, and III, respectively. The onset of sensory and motor blocks was comparable among the three groups with no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). The total duration of analgesia was 117.8 ± 23.3 minutes, 166.8 ± 27.8 minutes, and 181.8 ± 25.9 minutes in groups I, II, and III, respectively, with a statistically significant difference. Few incidences of manageable hypotension, but no incidences of bradycardia or respiratory insufficiency, occurred. Five patients of the control group shivered, which was managed well by tramadol 50 mg and ondansetron 4 mg. No patient suffered from pruritus, sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, and vomiting.
CONCLUSION: The study concluded that intrathecal nalbuphine in a 1.6 mg dose is an effective adjuvant to 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine for SAB. It potentiated the SAB characteristics and enhanced the duration of analgesia with no effect on respiration. Nalbuphine in a dose of 2.4 mg did not offer any added advantage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the impact of yoga as an adjunct to standard therapy versus standard therapy alone on the symptomatic burden in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (VVS).
BACKGROUND: There is a significant reduction in the quality of life (QoL) of patients with recurrent VVS. Existing management therapies have been largely ineffective. Recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of yoga in diseases with autonomic imbalance, suggesting its possible utility in VVS.
METHODS: Patients with recurrent VVS were randomized to receive either a specialized yoga training program in addition to current guideline-based therapy (intervention arm, group 1) or current guideline-based therapy alone (control arm, group 2). The primary outcome was a composite of the number of episodes of syncope and presyncope at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included QoL assessment by World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Field questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF) scores and Syncope Functional Status Questionnaire scores at 12 months, head up tilt test, and heart rate variability at 6 weeks.
RESULTS: A total of 55 patients underwent randomization. The mean number of syncopal or presyncopal events at 12 months was 0.7 ± 0.7 in the intervention arm compared to 2.52 ± 1.93 in the control arm (P < 0.01). In the intervention arm, 13 (43.3%) patients remained free of events versus 4 (16.0%) patients in the control arm (P = 0.02). QoL at 12 months showed significant improvement of all Syncope Functional Status Questionnaire scores and 2 domains of WHOQoL-BREF scores (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Yoga as adjunctive therapy is superior to standard therapy alone in reducing the symptomatic burden and improving QoL in patients with recurrent VVS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutaneous adnexal tumours (CATs) are one of the commonest clinical presentations in dermatology outpatients. They constitute a subset of skin tumours with a common clinical presentation and variable histological findings. Almost all of them clinically present as a subcutaneous nodule. Depending upon the site and distribution, the clinician can suspect the diagnosis. However, histopathological examination is the gold standard for the definitive diagnosis and proper subtyping of CATs.
AIMS: The present study is conducted to see the overall spectrum, incidence and distribution of CATs in a large cohort at the tertiary care centre with their clinical profile.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study in which all the CATs diagnosed over a period of 5 years (2015 to 2019) in a tertiary care hospital were studied. Clinical data were recorded from the histopathology requisition forms.
RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety-five cases of CATs were retrieved. Approximately 90% of cases were benign and 10% were malignant. The age of presentation ranged from 8 months to 81 years with male preponderance in all the histological subtypes. The most common site was the head and neck followed by the extremities. Morphologically, the maximum cases showed a differentiation towards sweat glands (44%), followed by sebaceous (29%), follicular (26.5%) and apocrine differentiation (5.3%). Malignant tumours were common in the elderly age group with sebaceous carcinoma being the commonest.
CONCLUSION: CATs comprise of a wide spectrum of tumours occurring in all age groups. Malignant CATs are rare and common in older age groups. Histopathological examination is the gold standard in distinguishing between the different subtypes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The longer learning curve and smaller margin of error make nontraditional, or "out of operating room" simulation training, essential in neurosurgery. In this study, the authors propose an evaluation system for residents combining both task-based and procedure-based exercises and also present the perception of residents regarding its utility.
METHODS: Residents were evaluated using a combination of task-based and virtual reality (VR)-based exercises. The results were analyzed in terms of the seniority of the residents as well as their laboratory credits. Questionnaire-based feedback was sought from the residents regarding the utility of this evaluation system incorporating the VR-based exercises.
RESULTS: A total of 35 residents were included in this study and were divided into 3 groups according to seniority. There were 11 residents in groups 1 and 3 and 13 residents in group 2. On the overall assessment of microsuturing skills including both 4-0 and 10-0 microsuturing, the suturing skills of groups 2 and 3 were observed to be better than those of group 1 (p = 0.0014). Additionally, it was found that microsuturing scores improved significantly with the increasing laboratory credits (R2 = 0.72, p < 0.001), and this was found to be the most significant for group 1 residents (R2 = 0.85, p < 0.001). Group 3 residents performed significantly better than the other two groups in both straight (p = 0.02) and diagonal (p = 0.042) ring transfer tasks, but there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 residents (p = 0.35). Endoscopic evaluation points were also found to be positively correlated with previous laboratory training (p = 0.002); however, for the individual seniority groups, the correlation failed to reach statistical significance. The 3 seniority groups performed similarly in the cranial and spinal VR modules. Group 3 residents showed significant disagreement with the utility of the VR platform for improving surgical dexterity (p = 0.027) and improving the understanding of surgical procedures (p = 0.034). Similarly, there was greater disagreement for VR-based evaluation to identify target areas of improvement among the senior residents (groups 2 and 3), but it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.194).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of task- and procedure-based assessment of trainees using physical and VR simulation models can supplement the existing neurosurgery curriculum. The currently available VR-based simulations are useful in the early years of training, but they need significant improvement to offer beneficial learning opportunities to senior trainees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited data from India regarding medical management of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI).
OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular diagnosis, medical management and outcomes of children with CHI.
STUDY DESIGN: Ambispective.
PARTICIPANTS: Children with CHI admitted in from December, 2011 till March, 2020 at a tertiary care referral hospital.
OUTCOMES: Clinical and genetic profile, treatment, and response.
RESULTS: 42 children with a median age of 3 days (range 1 day to 6 years) were enrolled, of which 23 (54.7%) were diazoxide-responsive. Mutations were identified in 28 out of 41 (68.2%) patients. The commonest gene affected was ABCC8 in 22 patients. The pathogenic variant c.331G>A in ABCC8 gene was identified in 6 unrelated cases from one community. Good response to daily octreotide was seen in 13 of the 19 (68.4%) diazoxide-unresponsive patients. Monthly long-acting octreotide was initiated and daily octreotide could be stopped or tapered in 9 patients. Sirolimus was tried with variable response in 6 patients but was discontinued in 5 due to adverse effects. Four patients had focal CHI, of which one underwent partial pancreatic resection. The disease severity reduced with age and neurodevelopment was good in the patients with identifiable genetic defects who were optimally managed.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical management of CHI is effective, if compliance can be ensured, with good quality of life and neurological outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a generalized term, usually known as "jelly belly" since 1884. Incidence is very low, 1-3 per million people per year. Because of its indolent nature, it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, thereby impacting the quality of life. The 5-year survival rate varies from 23 to 86% in world literature. Even 10 years and 20 years of survival have been described. With our experience, we like to propose rename of PMP as abdomino-peritoneal mucinous carcinoma (APM) as we strongly feel the time has come to specify the term and standardize the management strategy.
METHODOLOGY: In the premier institute of India and as a tertiary referral center, we experienced the maximum number of advanced cases of APM. From 2012 to 2021, we analyzed all the APM patients based on a prospectively maintained computerized database in the department of surgical oncology and found the reasons for renaming from this traditional one.
RESULTS: We included a total of 87 patients who underwent surgical intervention. Thirty-five patients underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), and 52 patients underwent debulking. In CRS-HIPEC patients, CC-0 was achieved in 28 patients (80%), CC-1 in 4 patients (11.4%), and CC-2 in 3 patients (8.6%). Palliative intent HIPEC was done in 3 patients (8.6%). Clavien-Dindo grade III and IV morbidity was observed in 18.8% of patients with 90 days mortality of 5.7%.
CONCLUSION: With our long-term experience and advancement of scientific evidence, we like to propose a new name for PMP as APM. We strongly believe this paper will give a clear picture of this rare disease and standard management outlines.

AB  - The most important stage in activating an appropriate immune response during an infection is pathogen detection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are innate sensors used for pathogen detection that mould and link the innate and adaptive immune responses by the host. Toll Like receptors (TLRs) specifically TLR2 and TLR4, are PRRs, which have gained prominence due to their exceptional capacity to recognize unique molecular patterns from invading pathogens. They also play a critical role in maintaining the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses, which are necessary for the host's survival. Leprosy is a spectral disease with a wide range of immunological manifestations in the host. Cells of both the innate and adaptive branches play crucial roles in this polarized immune state. Here, we have analysed the proportional expression patterns of TLR2 and TLR4 on the surface of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD161+ lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes in different groups of leprosy patients. Further, these TLRs positive cells were correlated with the surface markers of cell exhaustion such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), which indicated their role in immunosuppression. Additionally, blocking the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 in lymphocytes demonstrated visible improvement in their immune activation status through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α).

AB  - BACKGROUND: To fill the gap in patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment in children with cancer in India, we planned to adapt domains from the HealthMeasures Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) tool. This study attempted to identify and pool outcomes relevant to children with cancer and their caregivers in Northern India.
METHODS: The study was qualitative and conducted through focussed group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews of children with cancer and their caregivers. Content analysis of transcripts from the sessions was done. The collected themes were collated with existing item banks of the PROMIS tool and new concepts unique to our population were compiled.
RESULTS: A set of three FGDs and 14 interviews each for children and their caregivers were conducted. Following content analysis, 121 themes were identified including 10 new concepts. Themes pertaining to the physical domain were cited most. The theme distribution across the three domains was similar among children and caregivers. In the survivor cohort, the relative frequency of mention of psychological and social themes was higher compared to the whole cohort. Themes pertaining to mobility, cognitive dysfunction and peer relationships were more common among survivors.
CONCLUSIONS: This qualitative study in children with cancer and their caregivers in India has facilitated a better understanding of the issues pertaining to cancer care that are of most importance to its stake holders. The themes collected may be used to formulate a PRO tool uniquely tailored for use in this population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, behavioural interventions to reduce disease transmission have been central to public health policy worldwide. Sustaining individual protective behaviour is especially important in low-income and middle-income settings, where health systems have fewer resources and access to vaccination is limited. This study seeks to assess time trends in COVID-19 protective behaviour in India.
DESIGN: Nationally representative, panel-based, longitudinal study.
SETTING: We conducted a panel survey of Indian households to understand how the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviours has changed over time. Our data span peaks and valleys of disease transmission over May-December 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: Respondents included 3719 adults from 1766 Indian households enrolled in the Harmonised Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India.
ANALYSIS: We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to quantify time trends in protective behaviours.
RESULTS: We find a 30.6 percentage point (95% CI (26.7 to 34.5); p<0.01) decline in protective behaviours related to social distancing over the observation period. Mask wearing and handwashing, in contrast, decreased by only 4.3 percentage points (95% CI (0.97 to 7.6); p<0.05) from a high base. Our conclusions are unchanged after adjusting for recorded COVID-19 caseload and nationwide COVID-19 containment policy; we also observe significant declines across socioeconomic strata spanning age, gender, education and urbanicity.
CONCLUSION: We argue that these changes reflect, at least in part, 'COVID-19 fatigue,' where adherence to social distancing becomes more difficult over time irrespective of the surrounding disease environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigating the underlying psychosocial factors is a cornerstone of planning need-based intervention for adult males accused of rape. Unresolved debates on its etiology, mediation, or interaction among causal psychosocial variables fuel curiosity to scrutinize it further. Hence, we studied potential influence of and relation between adverse childhood experiences, aggression, empathy, and psychopathology in adult males accused of rape in India and investigated the risk factors for the same.
METHODS: With a correlational research design, 40 literate and consenting adult males medically confirmed for rape were recruited using convenient sampling. The assessment was done on Adverse Childhood Experiences, Aggression Questionnaire, Symptom Checklist-90, and Interpersonal Reactivity Index. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and stepwise linear regression analysis were calculated.
RESULTS: Approximately 75% of the participants experienced at least one category of Adverse Childhood Experiences. Scores above cut-off points were obtained on anger, hostility, fantasy, and personal distress. Significant correlations were obtained between adverse childhood experiences and psychopathology; between hostility and psychopathology, perspective taking, and personal distress; and in case of indirect aggression, with perspective taking and empathetic concerns. Regression analysis revealed that an increase in Symptom Checklist-90 global scores increases hostility and that lower personal distress predicts higher scores on hostility on Aggression Questionnaire.
CONCLUSIONS: Adverse childhood experiences, aggression, and psychopathology play a critical role and, therefore, should be included as core components of the prevention of rape or relapse prevention programs at the community level.

AB  - In eukaryotic cells, miRNAs regulate a plethora of cellular functionalities ranging from cellular metabolisms, and development to the regulation of biological networks and pathways, both under homeostatic and pathological states like cancer.Despite their immense importance as key regulators of cellular processes, accurate and reliable estimation of miRNAs using Next Generation Sequencing is challenging, largely due to the limited availability of robust computational tools/methods/pipelines. Here, we introduce miRPipe, an end-to-end computational framework for the identification, characterization, and expression estimation of small RNAs, including the known and novel miRNAs and previously annotated pi-RNAs from small-RNA sequencing profiles. Our workflow detects unique novel miRNAs by incorporating the sequence information of seed and non-seed regions, concomitant with clustering analysis. This approach allows reliable and reproducible detection of unique novel miRNAs and functionally same miRNAs (paralogues). We validated the performance of miRPipe with the available state-of-the-art pipelines using both synthetic datasets generated using the newly developed miRSim tool and three cancer datasets (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Lung cancer, and breast cancer). In the experiment over the synthetic dataset, miRPipe is observed to outperform the existing state-of-the-art pipelines (accuracy: 95.23% and F 1-score: 94.17%). Analysis on all the three cancer datasets shows that miRPipe is able to extract more number of known dysregulated miRNAs or piRNAs from the datasets as compared to the existing pipelines.

AB  - AIM: A study was conducted to explore the characteristics of the videos on pediatric inguinal hernia repair on YouTube and compare the most popular videos (MPV) with the least popular ones in terms of educative value vis-a-vis their popularity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The term "Pediatric inguinal hernia repair" was searched for on YouTube on August 15, 2021, with the filter set to "view rate." Pertinent data were collected from the 50 MPV and the 50 least popular videos (LPV) and then compared. The h-index and affiliation of the surgeon were obtained from the Scopus database, and their affiliation was further categorized as academic or nonacademic.
RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-five videos were found with median views of MPV: LPV being 9270 (interquartile range [IQR] - 12099):127 (IQR - 194), respectively (P < 0.0001). Most of the videos in the MPV and LPV groups were uploaded from the United States of America (USA) (MPV - 17 and LPV - 13) and India (MPV - 15 and LPV - 15). The MPV were on YouTube for a median duration of 3.1 (IQR - 5.5) years as compared to 1.2 (IQR - 2.3) years for the LPV (P < 0.0001). Ninety-two surgeons were identified. The median h-index of the surgeons of MPV was 3 (IQR - 12) in comparison to 1 (IQR - 10) of LPV (P = 0.13). The ratio of academic versus nonacademic affiliation among MPV and LPV was almost equal in both the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: On either end of the spectrum of popularity, the majority of the pediatric inguinal hernia videos on YouTube were surgical videos uploaded from the USA and India. The educative value of these videos was found to be low and widely dispersed. Surgeons from both academic and nonacademic affiliations had contributed similarly.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Along with the rising prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)], biological therapies need an update/insight.
AREA COVERED: This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from PubMed database (2000-October 2022) of approved biologics and small molecules with primary outcome analysis on efficacy (clinical response/remission/mucosal healing) and/or adverse events (AEs). Considered for this review under biologics classes are TNF-α inhibitors, leukocyte trafficking inhibitors, and anti IL-12/IL-23; and under small molecules are Janus-kinase inhibitors, and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators.
EXPERT OPINION: In CD, clinical response and remission were better with tofacitinib (61.23%) and infliximab (44.86%), respectively, in the induction phase, and these were better with ustekinumab in the maintenance phase. In UC, the maximum rate of response, remission, and mucosal healing were obtained with infliximab during the induction phase (67.49%, 35.99%, and 60.25%, respectively). During the maintenance phase, response rate was better with ustekinumab, but remission and mucosal healing were better with vedolizumab. The combined percentage of AEs was highest with infliximab (174.45%) and least with ozanimod (23.04%), and most commonly belonged to the 'infection and infestation system organ class (SOC).' These efficacy and safety analyses will help in the optimization of biologic treatment in IBD.

AB  - PURPOSE: Anaerobic infections are common yet life-threatening. They are being recovered from all sites of the body, including the cardiovascular system. This study was aimed to determine the retrospective analysis on the isolation of anaerobes in cardiovascular samples received for a decade-long duration. It helps in knowing the frequency of isolation of anaerobic causes of cardiovascular infection.
METHODS: All cardiovascular samples from the department of Cardio-thoracic vascular surgery from January 2010 to December 2020 were studied.
RESULTS: Of 601 samples received, predominant samples were vegetations and valvular tissues of 258, followed by 98 samples of pericardial tissues, 92 samples of embolus, 90 samples of blood and post-operative collections, and 63 excised aneurysms and vascular grafts. Of the total, 15 samples grew anaerobes where Clostridium species were the predominant isolates. Clostridioides difficile was isolated in 2 samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobes in cardiovascular samples are uncommon yet form a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Most infections are from the contiguous spread, penetrating trauma, and hematogenous causing endocarditis or valvular infections. These conditions and samples form the seat of infectious focus and clinical suspicion towards the anaerobic cause of these conditions, especially in conventional routine culture-negative samples. Timely diagnosis of anaerobic infections plays a vital role in the good prognostic outcome of patients undergoing cardiothoracic and vascular surgery.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Preparations derived from the plant Calotropis procera, have been used for medicinal purpose though the plant is known for its toxic effects. The aerial parts of the plant contain latex in plenty and have been found effective in treating disorders of gastrointestinal system and cancer.
AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated the efficacy of C. procera dried latex extract prepared in methanol (MeDL) against inflammation and oxidative stress in experimental model of colorectal carcinoma (CRC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two subcutaneous injections of chemical carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH; 150 mg/kg) were given at an interval of one week to induce CRC in rats. The MeDL (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) were given daily and their effect was evaluated on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation after completion of 8 weeks following second injection of carcinogen. A comparison was made with normal and experimental control groups. The colon tissue levels of glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitrite and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine the levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and immunohistochemical analysis was performed for IL-1β.
RESULTS: Induction of cancerous changes in the colon resulted in altered oxidative homeostasis as evident from a reduction in GSH level and SOD activity and rise in TBARS level when compared with normal rats. Elevated levels of nitrite, MPO, TNF-α, PGE2 and immunoreactivity of IL-1β were also observed in these rats. The levels of these markers were normalized when the rats were treated with MeDL or anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the beneficial effect of MeDL in rat model of colon carcinogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antiepileptic-drug (AED) serum level and inflammatory biomarkers are primarily monitored/assessed during epilepsy treatment for effective seizure control; however, their correlation with seizure recurrence (SR) following AED-tapering has not been established, and this is being investigated in this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled persons with epilepsy (PWE) on AED monotherapy and going to start tapering after being seizure-free for ≥2 years. Data regarding seizure episodes, AED-treatment, and adverse events (using Liverpool Adverse Event profile [LAEP]-score) were recorded. Serum AED levels using high-performance liquid chromatography and biomarkers levels through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were estimated at AED-tapering commencement and at 6 months/SR time.
RESULTS: Among 129 enrolled PWE (levetiracetam [n = 52], valproate [n = 34], carbamazepine [n = 29], and phenytoin [n = 14]), SR occurred in 23.3% during follow-up (range 12-44 months). PWE with subtherapeutic serum AED level at the onset of tapering had higher SR (P = 0.004) than those with therapeutic or higher levels. Levetiracetam-treated PWEs with SR have significantly low AED levels than PWE with no-SR (P < 0.001). PWE had significantly raised inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-1 β, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-α, IL-6, and high-mobility group box protein 1) and decreased IL-10 than healthy control subjects. SR and no-SR groups did not differ significantly in inflammatory markers except for higher IL-1 β and TNF-α levels in SR group (P = 0.001, 0.02, respectively). Improvement in LAEP score was observed in follow-up visits without any difference between SR and no-SR groups.
CONCLUSION: Low serum AED levels (especially levetiracetam) and raised levels of TNF-α and IL-1 β during tapering commencement had a higher association with SR following AED-tapering.

AB  - Regenerative medicine using stem cells offers promising strategies for treating a variety of degenerative diseases. Regulation of stem cell behavior and rejuvenate senescence are required for stem cells to be clinically effective. The extracellular matrix (ECM) components have a significant impact on the stem cell's function and fate mimicking the local environment to maintain cells or generate a distinct phenotype. Here, human elastin-like polypeptide-based ECM-mimic biopolymer was designed by incorporating various cell-adhesion ligands, such as RGD and YIGSR. The significant effects of bioactive fusion ELPs named R-ELP, Y-ELP, and RY-ELP were analyzed for human bone-marrow-derived stem cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of stemness properties, and differentiation. Multivalent presentation of variable cell-adhesive ligands on RY-ELP polymers indeed promote efficient cell attachment and proliferation of human fibroblast cells dose-dependently. Similarly, surface modified with RY-ELP promoted strong mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) attachment with greater focal adhesion (FA) complex formation at 6 h post-incubation. The rate of cell proliferation, migration, population doubling time, and collagen I deposition were significantly enhanced in the presence of RY-ELP compared with other fusion ELPs. Together, the expression of multipotent markers and differentiation capacity of MSCs remained unaffected, clearly demonstrating that stemness properties of MSCs were well preserved when cultured on a RY-ELP-modified surface. Hence, bioactive RY-ELP offers an anchorage support system and effectively induces stimulatory response to support stem cell proliferation.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules play an important role in regulating molecular signaling associated with proliferation, migration, differentiation, and tissue repair. The identification of new kinds of ECM mimic biomaterials to recapitulate critical functions of biological systems are important for various applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The use of human elastin derived materials with controlled biological properties and other functionalities to improve their cell-response was proposed. Herein, we reported genetic encoded synthesis of ELP (elastin-like polypeptide) containing ECM domains like RGD (integrin binding ligand) and YIGSR (laminin-selective receptor binding ligand) to regulate cell behaviour in more complex ways, and also better model natural matrices. Thermal responsiveness of the ELPs and structural conformation were determined to confirm its phase transition behaviour. The fusion ELPs derivatives were analysed for mechanical involvement of growth mechanism, regenerative, and healing processes. The designed fusion ELPs promoted fast and strong attachment of fibroblast cells. The fusion ELP derivatives enhanced the migration of keratinocyte cells which of crucial for wound healing. Together it provides a profound matrix for endothelial cells and significantly enhanced tube formation of HUVEC cells. Thus, strategy of using cell adhesive ELP biopolymer emphasizing the role of bioactive ELPs as next generation skin substitutes for regenerative medicine.

AB  - Anaemia control programmes in India are hampered by a lack of representative evidence on anaemia prevalence, burden and associated factors for adolescents. The aim of this study was to: (1) describe the national and subnational prevalence, severity and burden of anaemia among Indian adolescents; (2) examine factors associated with anaemia at national and regional levels. Data (n = 14,673 individuals aged 10-19 years) were from India's Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS, 2016-2018). CNNS used a multistage, stratified, probability proportion to size cluster sampling design. Prevalence was estimated using globally comparable age- and sex-specific cutoffs, using survey weights for biomarker sample collection. Burden analysis used prevalence estimates and projected population from 2011 Census data. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse factors (diet, micronutrient deficiencies, haemoglobinopathies, sociodemographic factors, environment) associated with anaemia. Anaemia was present in 40% of girls and 18% of boys, equivalent to 72 million adolescents in 2018, and varied by region (girls 29%-46%; boys 11%-28%) and state (girls 7%-62%; boys 4%-32%). Iron deficiency (ferritin < 15 μg/L) was the strongest predictor of anaemia (odds ratio [OR]: 4.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [3.21,6.83]), followed by haemoglobinopathies (HbA2 > 3.5% or any HbS) (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: [1.66,4.74]), vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol <20 ng/ml) (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: [1.23,2.80]) and zinc deficiency (serum zinc < 70 μg/L) (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: [1.02,1.72]). Regional models show heterogeneity in the strength of association between factors and anaemia by region. Adolescent anaemia control programmes in India should continue to address iron deficiency, strengthen strategies to identify haemoglobinopathies and other micronutrient deficiencies, and further explore geographic variation in associated factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The existing World Health Organization (WHO) pneumonia case management guidelines rely on clinical symptoms and signs for identifying, classifying, and treating pneumonia in children up to 5 years old. We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-existing studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of current pneumonia case management guidelines.
METHODS: Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified studies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited investigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, including history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narrative synthesis to describe the final data set.
RESULTS: Forty-one separate data sets were included in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were community-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed descriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progression, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years. Of the 285 839 episodes, 280 998 occurred in children 0-59 months old, of which 129 584 (46%) were 2-11 months of age and 152 730 (54%) were males.
CONCLUSIONS: This data set could identify an improved specific, sensitive set of criteria for diagnosing clinical pneumonia and help identify sick children in need of referral to a higher level of care or a change of therapy. Field studies could be designed based on insights from PREPARE analyses to validate a potential revised pneumonia algorithm. The PREPARE methodology can also act as a model for disease database assembly.

TI  - Auer rods and faggot cells: A review of the history, significance and mimics of two morphological curiosities of enduring relevance
AU  - Sehgal, Tushar
AU  - Sharma, Prashant
T2  - European Journal of Haematology
AB  - Myeloid differentiation in blasts is distinguished by the presence of one or more needle-shaped crystalline structures called Auer rods. Auer rods manifest either alone or as faggot cells (containing bundles of Auer rods) in various types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN). Their presence largely portends a better prognosis in AML (as markers of maturation/differentiation) and upstages cases of MDS and MDS/MPN. Observation of these rods in residual blasts in treated cases of AML indicates an absence of remission. This article traces their historical discovery and examines their pathogenetic intricacies, as well as our current understanding of their relevance in myeloid neoplasms. Studies evaluating their prognostic impact in AML and MDS are catalogued. We also discuss a variety of other hematological and non-hematological neoplasms where structures potentially mistakable for Auer rods have been described. Even as the diagnostic approach to hematological malignancies has evolved from a morphology + cytochemistry + immunophenotyping-dependent one in the last century to a predominantly molecular genetics-based classification currently, and even as high-throughput sequencing and structural variation detection techniques surpass morphology in detecting clinically-relevant sub-categories of similar-appearing tumours, we review these curious microscopic structures that have withstood the test of time with respect to their diagnostic relevance.

AB  - Discoveries in the last few years have emphasized the existence of an enormous breadth of communication between osteo-immune systems. These discoveries fuel novel approaches for the treatment of several bone pathologies including osteoporosis. Bifidobacterium longum (BL) is a preferred probiotic of choice due to its varied immunomodulatory potential in alleviating various inflammatory diseases. Here, we evaluate the effect of BL in an ovariectomy (ovx)-induced post-menopausal osteoporotic mouse model. Our in vitro findings reveal that BL suppresses the differentiation and functional activity of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in both mouse bone marrow cells and human PBMCs. Strikingly, BL-induced Bregs were found to be significantly more efficient in suppressing osteoclastogenesis and modulating Treg-Th17 cell balance with respect to control Bregs in vitro. Our in vivo µCT and bone mechanical strength data further confirm that BL supplementation significantly enhanced bone mass and bone strength, along with improving the bone microarchitecture in ovx mice. Remarkably, alterations in frequencies of CD19+CD1dhiCD5+IL-10+ Bregs, CD4+Foxp3+IL-10+ Tregs, and CD4+Rorγt+IL-17+ Th17 cells in distinct lymphoid organs along with serum-cytokine data (enhanced anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines IFN-γ and IL-10 and reduced osteoclastogenic-cytokines IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-α) strongly support the immunomodulatory potential of BL. Altogether, our findings establish a novel osteo-protective and immunomodulatory potential of BL in augmenting bone health under osteoporotic conditions.

AB  - sgRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) provide a site-specific robust gene-editing approach avoiding the mutagenesis and unwanted off-target effects. However, the high molecular weight (∼165 kDa), hydrophilicity and net supranegative charge (∼-20 mV) hinder the intracellular delivery of these RNPs. In the present study, we have prepared cationic RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes that showed a size of 117.3 ± 7.64 nm with +6.17 ± 1.04 mV zeta potential and >90% entrapment efficiency of RNPs. Further, these RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes showed good complexation efficiency and were found to be stable for 12 h with fetal bovine serum. These RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes did not induce any significant cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells, and were efficiently uptaken via a clathrin-mediated pathway with optimal transfection efficiency and nuclear localization after 48 h. Further, HEK293T cells having the mGFP insert were used as a cell line model for gene editing, wherein the loss of the mGFP signal was observed as a function of gene editing after transfection with mGFP targeting RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes. Further, the T7 endonuclease and TIDE assay data showed a decent gene editing efficiency. Additionally, the lipopolymeric nanoplexes were able to transfect muscle cells in vivo, when injected intra-muscularly. Collectively, this study explored the potential of cationic lipopolymeric nanoplexes for delivering gene-editing endonucleases.

AB  - The association of airborne particulate matter exposure with the deteriorating function of the cardiovascular system is fundamentally driven by the impairment of mitochondrial-nuclear crosstalk orchestrated by aberrant redox signaling. The loss of delicate balance in retrograde communication from mitochondria to the nucleus often culminates in the methylation of the newly synthesized strand of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) through DNA methyl transferases. In highly metabolic active tissues such as the heart, mtDNA's methylation state alteration impacts mitochondrial bioenergetics. It affects transcriptional regulatory processes involved in biogenesis, fission, and fusion, often accompanied by the integrated stress response. Previous studies have demonstrated a paradoxical role of mtDNA methylation in cardiovascular pathologies linked to air pollution. A pronounced alteration in mtDNA methylation contributes to systemic inflammation, an etiological determinant for several co-morbidities, including vascular endothelial dysfunction and myocardial injury. In the current article, we evaluate the state of evidence and examine the considerable promise of using cell-free circulating methylated mtDNA as a predictive biomarker to reduce the more significant burden of ambient air pollution on cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe the clinical presentations, radiologic features, and outcomes of patients with autoimmune encephalitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (MOG).
BACKGROUND: During the past decade, the spectrum of the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated diseases (MOGAD) has expanded. Recently, patients with MOG antibody encephalitis (MOG-E) who do not fulfill the criteria for ADEM have been reported. In this study, we aimed to describe the spectrum of MOG-E.
METHODS: Sixty-four patients with MOGAD were screened for encephalitis-like presentation. We collected the clinical, radiological, laboratory, and outcome data of the patients who presented with encephalitis and compared it with the non-encephalitis group.
RESULTS: We identified sixteen patients (nine males and seven females) with MOG-E. The median age of the encephalitis population was significantly lower than the non-encephalitis group (14.5 years (11.75-18) vs. 28 years (19.75-42), p = 0.0004). Twelve out of sixteen patients (75%) had fever at the time of encephalitis. Headache and seizure were present in 9/16 (56.2%) and 7/16 (43.75%) patients, respectively. FLAIR cortical hyperintensity was present in 10/16 (62.5%) patients. Supratentorial deep gray nuclei were involved in 10/16 (62.5%) patients. Three patients had tumefactive demyelination, and one patient had a leukodystrophy-like lesion. Twelve of 16 (75%) patients had a good clinical outcome. Patient with leukodystrophy pattern and other with generalized CNS atrophy showed a chronic progressive course.
CONCLUSION: MOG-E can have heterogeneous radiological presentations. FLAIR cortical hyperintensity, tumefactive demyelination, and leukodystrophy-like presentations are novel radiological presentations associated with MOGAD. Though majority of MOG-E have a good clinical outcome, few patients can have chronic progressive disease even on immunosuppressive therapy.

AB  - We describe the clinical and demographic characteristics, virological follow-up, and management of five confirmed monkeypox cases from New Delhi, India without any international travel history. The viral load kinetics and viral clearance were estimated in oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS), EDTA blood, serum, urine, and various lesion specimens on every fourth day of follow-up ranging from 5 to 24 post onset day (POD) of illness. All five cases presented with mild to moderate-grade intermittent fever, myalgia, and lesions on the genitals, groins, lower limb, trunk, and upper limb. Four cases had non-tender firm lymphadenopathy. No secondary complications or sexually transmitted infections were recorded in these cases except for the presence of viral hepatitis B infection marker hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) in one case. All the cases were mild and had a good recovery. A higher viral load was detected in lesion fluid (POD 9), followed by lesion roof (POD 9), urine (POD 5), lesion base (POD 5), and OPS/NPS (POD 5). The monkeypox virus (MPXV) DNA was detected in clinical samples from 5th to 24th POD. These monkeypox cases without international travel history suggest the underdiagnosed monkeypox infection in the community. This emphasizes the need for active surveillance of MPXV in the high-risk population such as men having sex with men and female sex workers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare but acute severe drug reaction associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.
AIMS: To describe the clinical, molecular, biochemical, and therapeutic profile of these patients.
METHODS: A total of 24 acute SJS/TEN patients were recruited during their hospital stay and detailed clinical history and treatment course recorded. Blood samples collected were subjected to DNA and serum separation for molecular and biochemical analysis.
RESULTS: Of 24 patients, 18 (75%) were females and six (25%) were males with six SJS, six SJS-TEN overlap, and 12 TEN cases. The inciting drugs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (87.50%; n = 21) followed by antibiotics (66.67%; n = 16), antiepileptics (37.50%; n = 9), and others (37.50%; n = 9). Seventeen patients (77.2%) showed skin eruptions within 7 days after drug intake. Different co-morbidities were observed in 22 (91.6%) and 20 (83.3%) patients showed ocular manifestations. Length of hospital stay ranged from 8 to 55 days, 20 (83.3%) patients were treated with corticosteroids, and four (16.6%) received antimicrobial therapy. Interleukin polymorphisms revealed significantly low frequency of IL-4 in the patients, HLA-A locus typing revealed higher frequency of HLA-A*3301 (20.8%), HLA-A*02 (25%), HLA-A*2402 (14.6%), and sera showed raised levels of granulysin and sFas L in the patients compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary study illustrates the clinical, molecular, and biochemical features of acute SJS/TEN and provides a better understanding that helps to improve patient care at an earlier stage. It also highlights the use of corticosteroids and antimicrobial therapy for effective treatment of patients.

AB  - A 67-year-old man presented with a low-grade fever for 2 months, weakness of all four limbs for five days and altered sensorium for two days. He was recently diagnosed with AIDS and was treatment-naive. Investigations revealed a CD4 count of 27cells/mm3 MRI brain and spine exhibited bilateral cerebellar lesions with diffusion restriction, and severe arachnoiditis at the level of the lumbar spine. High suspicion of central nervous system tuberculosis in an endemic country like ours, led us to start antitubercular therapy and steroids. Repeated lumbar punctures resulted in a dry tap leading to a delay in diagnosis. Serum cryptococcal antigen detection came positive, following which antifungal treatment was initiated. Later a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid sample was obtained which confirmed the diagnosis of cryptococcosis. However, the patient worsened and succumbed to the illness. This case highlighted the rare presentation of cryptococcal cerebellar stroke and spinal arachnoiditis.

AB  - A patient, an adolescent male, presented to us with complaints of recurrent respiratory tract infections since childhood. Differentials considered were cystic fibrosis (CF), bronchial asthma with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and primary immunodeficiency disorders. Sweat chloride test, total IgE and Aspergillus fumigatus specific serum IgE and IgG levels were normal ruling out CF and ABPA. Nasal nitric oxide (NO) screening test showed reduced NO levels, and high-speed video microscopy of nasal scrapings showed stiff beating cilia with reduced ciliary beat frequency confirming the diagnosis of PCD. Immunodeficiency workup showed reduced serum IgG, IgA and IgM, when repeated on two separate occasions when the patient was not harbouring any active infection, suggestive of pan-hypogammaglobulinaemia. Thus, a diagnosis of coexistent PCD and pan-hypogammaglobulinaemia was made. Detection of immunodeficiency disorders is important in patients with PCD as they may benefit from immunoglobulin replacement.

AB  - Insulin-resistant brain state is proposed to be the early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can be studied in the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rodent model. ICV-STZ is reported to induce sporadic AD with the majority of the disease hallmarks as phenotype. On the other hand, available experimental evidence has used varying doses of STZ (< 1 to 3 mg/kg) and studied its effect for different study durations, ranging from 14 to 270 days. Though these studies suggest 3 mg/kg of ICV-STZ to be the optimum dose for progressive pathogenesis, the reason for such is elusive. Here, we sought to investigate the mechanism of action of 3 mg/kg ICV-STZ on cognitive and non-cognitive aspects at a follow-up interval of 2 weeks for 2 months. On the 60th day, we examined the layer thickness, cell density, ventricular volume, spine density, protein expression related to brain metabolism, and mitochondrial function by histological examination. The findings suggest a progressive loss of a spatial, episodic, and avoidance memory with an increase in anxiety in a span of 2 months. Furthermore, hippocampal neurodegeneration, ventricular enlargement, diffused amyloid plaque deposition, loss of spine in the dentate gyrus, and imbalance in energy homeostasis were found on the 60th day post-injection. Interestingly, AD rats showed a uniform fraction of time spent in four quadrants of the water maze with a change in strategy when they were exposed to height. Our findings reveal that ICV-STZ injection at a dose of 3 mg/kg can cause cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities due to structural loss both at the neuronal as well as the synaptic level, which is tightly associated with the change in neuronal metabolism.

To understand the effects of COVID-19 on community practices this study was conducted.
METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Intensive Field Practice Area of Comprehensive Rural health Services Project (CRHSP), Ballabgarh, Haryana. Five hundred participants (≥18 years) were selected by using simple random sampling from Health Management Information System (HMIS) maintained at Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS, New Delhi. Participants were informed regarding study and consent was taken. A semi-structured interview schedule was administered.
RESULTS: Study participants included 500 adults (52.2% Male). Mean age (S.D.) of participants were 39.1 (14.9) years. Almost all participants started practicing hand sanitisation (496, 99.2%), avoiding crowd (488, 97.6%), and covering face with cloth/handkerchief (459, 91.8%). More than 80% (428, 85.6%) started using mask, and following cough etiquettes (405, 81.0%). More than three-fourth (389, 77.8%) participants were very unsatisfied with lockdown. Majority faced financial difficulties (322, 64.4%), followed by difficulty in their entertainment/recreational activity (158, 31.6%), difficulty in acquiring ration/food items (87, 17.4%) and mental stress (46, 9.2%) during lockdown.
CONCLUSIONS: Rural community of Ballabgarh showed positive practices with respect to prevention of COVID-19. Financial distress and job loss due to lockdown were widely reported from the rural community. Majority of the community was displeased with lockdown as intervention for COVID-19.

AB  - Postoperative surgical site infections (SSIs) in neurosurgery are rare. However, they pose a formidable challenge to the treating neurosurgeon and substantially worsen patient outcomes. These infections require prompt intervention in the form of débridement, including removal of craniotomy bone. Reconstruction of the craniotomy defect can be performed along with the débridement or can be performed at a later time. Although there have been concerns about performing cranioplasty at the same time as débridement, recent studies have advocated performance of cranioplasty at the same time as the débridement, as it avoids the morbidity associated with having a craniectomy defect and avoids the need for another surgical procedure. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to examine the data on immediate cranioplasties and delayed cranioplasties performed for postcraniotomy SSIs. We analyzed 15 articles with a total of 353 patients. Our analysis revealed that the pooled proportion of treatment failure was 10.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.9%-17.8%) when an immediate cranioplasty was done and 16.1% (95% CI 7.2%-32.1%) when delayed cranioplasty was done. The pooled proportion of treatment failure was 12% (95% CI 5.9%-22.9%) when the same bone was used for cranioplasty and was 8% (95% CI 3%-20%) when prosthetic material such as titanium was used for cranial vault reconstruction. Thus, the rate of treatment failure was less when an immediate single-stage cranioplasty was done compared with a delayed cranioplasty following SSIs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism (cHypoPT) are prone to intracranial-calcification, cataract and nephrocalcinosis. In this study, we systematically investigated the possibility of increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) and coronary artery disease (CAD) in them.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Ninety-four nonsurgical cHypoPT (M:F = 50:44; age = 45 ± 15 years) with 18.6 ± 9.3 years of illness were assessed. Those with dyspnoea, angina, syncope, abnormal electrocardiogram, echocardiography or significant CAC underwent coronary angiography or myocardial-perfusion-stress imaging. Their lipid parameters and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were compared with age-matched healthy controls (Group A, n = 101). The prevalence of CAC in cHypoPT was compared with that of subjects referred from cardiology-clinics (Group B, n = 148, age = 52 ± 11 years).
RESULTS: One of 94 cHypoPT had known CAD. On screening, 17 cHypoPT required evaluation for CAD. Two of 17 had severe coronary stenosis, and 12 showed subclinical CAD. CAC and aortic-valve calcification occurred in 21.5% and 11.8%. Clinical and subclinical CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT ≥50 years of age was 8.1%, 27.0%, 52.8% and 27.8%, respectively. Frequency of age-adjusted CAC was comparable between cHypoPT and control Group B (30.2% vs. 30.7%, p = .93). Elevated hsCRP was higher in cHypoPT than in controls A (52% vs. 32%, p < .01). Factors associated with CAD in cHypoPT were CAC and hypertension. However, CAD and CAC showed no association with long-term calcemic or phosphatemic control and intracranial-calcification in cHypoPT.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and subclinical CAD was observed in 3.2% and 12.8% of cHypoPT patients. The increased prevalence of CAD, CAC and aortic-valve calcification in cHypoPT above 50 years of age suggested their careful cardiac evaluation during follow-up.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prognostic scores in Ewing sarcoma including baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics are necessary for pre-treatment risk stratification. In this study, we formulated and validated a prognostic model for baseline risk categorization in Ewing sarcoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-institutional study was conducted on Ewing sarcoma patients treated uniformly between January 2003 and December 2018. Baseline clinical/pathological characteristics and survival outcomes were noted from medical records. The cohort was randomised into a derivation and validation cohort. A prognostic score was formulated by including independent prognostic factors from the derivation cohort by multivariable analysis. The prognostic model was validated in the validation cohort along with estimation of its predictive ability.
RESULTS: A total of 860 patients were included with 40.3% having baseline metastases. Tumor diameter >5 cm (HR 2.04; P<0.001; score 2), baseline metastases (HR 2.33; P<0.001, score 2), and total leucocyte count >11000/mm3 (HR 1.44; P=0.015; score 1) were independent predictors of overall survival in derivation cohort and included for prognostic score calculation. Patients were categorized into low (score 0), intermediate (score 1-3) and high-risk (score 4-5) groups. Harrell's c-indexes of the model were 0.625, 0.622 and 0.624 in the derivation, validation and whole cohort respectively. The timed AUC of ROC of the prognostic score-group for 5-year survival was 0.72, 0.71 and 0.73 in the derivation, validation and whole cohort respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We have formulated and validated a prognostic score for Ewing sarcoma incorporating baseline clinical and laboratory parameters, with fair predictive ability for risk stratification and facilitating risk-adapted personalized therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Existing risk assessment tools to identify children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality have shown suboptimal discriminatory value during external validation. Our objective was to derive and validate a novel risk assessment tool to identify children aged 2-59 months at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality across various settings.
METHODS: We used primary, baseline, patient-level data from 11 studies, including children evaluated for pneumonia in 20 low-income and middle-income countries. Patients with complete data were included in a logistic regression model to assess the association of candidate variables with the outcome hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality. Adjusted log coefficients were calculated for each candidate variable and assigned weighted points to derive the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) risk assessment tool. We used bootstrapped selection with 200 repetitions to internally validate the PREPARE risk assessment tool.
RESULTS: A total of 27 388 children were included in the analysis (mean age 14.0 months, pneumonia-related case fatality ratio 3.1%). The PREPARE risk assessment tool included patient age, sex, weight-for-age z-score, body temperature, respiratory rate, unconsciousness or decreased level of consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis and hypoxaemia at baseline. The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory value when internally validated (area under the curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.84).
CONCLUSIONS: The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory ability for identifying children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality in a large, geographically diverse dataset. After external validation, this tool may be implemented in various settings to identify children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The diagnosis of Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is challenging and controversial due to the heterogeneity or lack of consensus regarding the screening and diagnostic criteria for GDM.
METHODS: A meta-analysis of studies comparing Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India (DIPSI) and WHO 1999 for diagnosing GDM was carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 6 comparative studies were included. Pooled analysis showed sensitivity and specificity as 0.79 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.92) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.94 to 0.98) respectively.
CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the meta-analysis, DIPSI showed higher specificity when compared to WHO 1999, hence may be used to rule in disease in probable GDM cases. However, the results should be interpreted more cautiously and carefully since only a few studies were included.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a diagnostic algorithm for cystic fibrosis (CF) in the setting of unavailability of sweat chloride, based on clinical features and basic laboratory investigations.
METHODS: In a prospective observational study, we enrolled children with recurrent/persistent pneumonia with either malabsorption or poor growth, undergoing a sweat chloride test, between January 2019 and December 2020. They were simultaneously evaluated for aquagenic wrinkling of hands, stool fat globules, sputum for bacterial culture, blood gas, and serum electrolytes. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for parameters having a significant difference between CF and non-CF groups. Scoring systems and algorithms for the diagnosis of CF were developed.
RESULTS: Of 134 children enrolled, 46 (34%) had CF. The sensitivity and specificity of various parameters to diagnose CF was: sibling death due to respiratory illness (30.43%, 96.59%), aquagenic wrinkling (76.74%, 47.67%), metabolic alkalosis (17.78%, 94.12%), hyponatremia (28.89%, 89.41%), stool fat globules (38.46%, 81.18%), and presence of Pseudomonas in sputum culture (23.68%, 98.80%). Using coefficients of significant parameters on stepwise logistic regression, the composite score for diagnosis of CF was calculated as: 3X sibling death due to respiratory illness + 1.5X hyponatremia + 1.5X metabolic alkalosis + 1.5X aquagenic wrinkling + 1X stool fat globules + 2.5X presence of Pseudomonas in sputum culture (each of the variables scores 0 or 1 for absence and presence, respectively). The cut-off of ≥2.5 had sensitivity and specificity of 81.82% and 76.83%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In resource-limited settings, the proposed diagnostic algorithm can be used for the diagnosis of presumptive CF with fair sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Escalated and inappropriate levels of aggressive behavior referred to as pathological in psychiatry can lead to violent outcomes with detrimental impact on health and society. Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain-region-specific long-term changes in Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. Ttr promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, Ttr knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH-responsive genes (Nrgn, Trh, and Hr). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced Ttr gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effect of body temperature (I) on the cyclic fatigue resistance (O) of nickel-titanium (NiTi) endodontic instruments (P) to that of room temperature (C).
METHODS: The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020204286). A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey was conducted in English until December 31, 2021. In vitro studies comparing the cyclic fatigue resistance of NiTi instruments at the body (35°C ± 2°C) and room temperature (20°C-25°C) were included. Eligible studies were evaluated for risk of bias and meta-analyzed to estimate the effects.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies out of 347 met the criteria for inclusion. The meta-analysis included six studies (n = 215) with comparative study parameters. The overall effect sizes (5.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.04-6.93) were significantly different (P < 0.001), indicating that the mean values at room temperature were significantly (P < 0.001) higher. The effect sizes for full rotary motion (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 4.80; 95% CI: 3.04-6.56) and reciprocating motion (SMD: 6.37; 95% CI: 3.63-9.11) were not significantly different (P = 0.346). Heterogeneity was high (I 2 = 94%). Sensitivity analysis revealed that the SMD values were not significantly different (P > 0.05) from the overall effect size, indicating that none of the studies had an effect on the overall effect size.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitation of the study, the cyclic fatigue resistance of heat-treated NiTi endodontic files is significantly reduced at body temperature when compared to room temperature. Cyclic fatigue testing should be conducted at simulated body temperature.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In healthy subjects, the intraocular pressure (IOP) is maintained by a dynamic equilibrium between continuous production of aqueous humor by ciliary bodies and continuous outflow through the two drainage pathways: trabecular meshwork and uveoscleral outflow. Here, we hypothesized that yogic ocular exercises, including extraocular muscles exercise, and modified Tratak Kriya (mTK), might reduce the IOP as well as stress and improve quality of life (QoL) in patients with glaucoma.
METHODOLOGY: A parallel two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in glaucoma patients (Control group and Intervention group). Control group patients were on standard medical treatment and intervention group patients practiced a Yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) for 4 weeks as add-on therapy with their standard medical treatment. All Participants were assessed at baseline day 1, day 14 (D14), and day 28 (D28). A minimum of 30 patients were recruited in each group.
RESULTS: We did not observe any statistically significant different mean IOP of right (IOP-r) or, left eyes at any time point as well as cortisol level and QoL between the two groups. However, with in intervention group, there was a reduction in IOP-r at D14 (15.54 ± 2.81 mmHg) and D28 (15.24 ± 3.1 mmHg), P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively, compared to their baseline IOP (16.26 ± 2.98).
CONCLUSION: Based on the present RCT, yoga-based ocular exercises practiced here cannot be recommended for management of raised IOP in glaucoma patients. Further larger studies are warranted with yoga-based interventions in patients with glaucoma.

AB  - Due to lack of well-designed trials, there is no good evidence on the efficacy of stem cells in spinal cord injury. We aim to study the efficacy and outcome of bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) in acute complete spinal cord injury (SCI). In this prospective study over a 3-year period, 27 patients with acute, complete SCI were randomized to receive BMSCs or placebo (intramedullary route) intraoperatively. Institutional ethics approval was taken and informed consent was taken from all patients. Functional outcome was assessed using ASIA scale, SCIM score and SSEP responses preoperatively, three and six months after surgery. Thirteen patients were available for final analysis of which six were in the stem cell group and seven received placebo. 6 patients had improvement by at least one grade in ASIA score in the stem cell group as compared to only one patient in the placebo group. However, no functional motor improvement in any of the patients. ASIA sensory score improved from a preoperative mean of 124 to 224 at 6 months compared to the static mean of 115 in the control group. Absent SSEP waveform converted to abnormal waveform at 6 months in 3 patients in the stem cell group and one patient in the control group. There was no significant difference in the SCIM scores between the groups at last follow-up. All patients in the stem cell group reported improved bladder sensation, decreased spasticity and improved posture control as compared to nine in the placebo group. BMSCs through intramedullary route are a potential therapy for acute complete SCI and more research is required in this area.

T2  - Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite significant prevalence of specific learning disorder (SLD) in India, insufficient efforts have been taken to deal with its burden. Currently, the workforce is limited and resources are expensive and difficult for families to access. Consequently, developing an alternative remedial program in the form of a home-based intervention (HBI) is imperative. This article describes the development phase of a manualized HBI program for 7 to 12-year-old children with SLD.
METHODS: Extensive literature search, 7 focus group discussions with parents of children with and without SLD and teachers/counselors (n = 44), and 22 in-depth interviews with SLD children (n = 9) and professionals (n = 13) were conducted. A thematic analysis was done. Intervention strategies were identified based on themes. Experts' feedback about the content and structure of HBI was also taken.
RESULTS: The design and application of the HBI program integrate several intervention areas, including psychoeducation, learning strategies, cognitive, social, and behavioral techniques, and therapy for parents. HBI comprised 14 parent training sessions, the duration being 45 to 60 min per session, over six months. Parent training consisted of four steps. (a) The researcher/clinician describes the steps of reading, writing, or math strategies to the parents/caregivers; (b) the researcher/clinician implements the strategies with or without the presence of the child and observation by the parent; (c) the parent practices the strategies in front of the researcher/clinician; and (d) the researcher/clinician observes parents' practice and corrects them if required.
CONCLUSION: HBI manual for children with SLD-mixed type has been developed, keeping with all stakeholders' perspectives. Further study is on the way to assess its acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of CPA relies on the detection of the IgG Aspergillus antibody, which is not freely available, especially in resource-poor settings. Point-of-care tests like LDBio Aspergillus ICT lateral flow assay, evaluated in only a few studies, have shown promising results for the diagnosis of CPA. However, no study has compared the diagnostic performances of LDBio LFA in setting of tuberculosis endemic countries and have compared it with that of IgG Aspergillus. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performances of LDBio LFA in CPA and compare it with existing the diagnostic algorithm utilising ImmunoCAP IgG Aspergillus. Methods: Serial patients presenting with respiratory symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, fever, etc.) for >4 weeks were screened for eligibility. Relevant investigations, including direct microscopy and culture of respiratory secretions, IgG Aspergillus, chest imaging, etc., were done according to existing algorithm. Serums of all patients were tested by LDBio LFA and IgG Aspergillus (ImmunoCAP Asp IgG) and their diagnostic performances were compared. Results: A total of 174 patients were included in the study with ~66.7% patients having past history of tuberculosis. A diagnosis of CPA was made in 74 (42.5%) of patients. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of LDBio LFA was 67.6% (95% CI: 55.7−78%) and 81% (95% CI: 71.9−88.2%), respectively, which increased to 73.3% (95% CI: 60.3−83.9%) and 83.9% (95% CI: 71.7−92.4%), respectively, in patients with a past history of tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG Aspergillus was 82.4% (95% CI: 71.8−90.3%) and 82% (95% CI: 73.1−89%); 86.7% (95% CI: 75.4−94.1%) and 80.4% (95% CI: 67.6−89.8%), in the whole group and those with past history of tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusions: LDBio LFA is a point-of-care test with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. However, further tests may have to be done to rule-in or rule-out the diagnosis of CPA in the appropriate setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rituximab and tacrolimus are therapies reserved for patients with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who have failed conventional steroid-sparing agents. Given their toxicities, demonstrating non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus may enable choice between these medications.
METHODS: This investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label, pilot randomized controlled trial examined the non-inferiority of two doses of intravenous (IV) rituximab given one-week apart to oral therapy with tacrolimus (1:1 allocation), in maintaining sustained remission over 12 months follow-up, in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, defined as frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease that had failed ≥ 2 steroid-sparing strategies. Secondary outcomes included frequency of relapses, proportion with frequent relapses, time to relapse and frequent relapses, and adverse events (CTRI/2018/11/016342).
RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable for 41 patients randomized to receive rituximab (n = 21) or tacrolimus (n = 20). While 55% of patients in each limb were in sustained remission at 1 year, non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus was not demonstrated (mean difference 0%; 95% CI - 30.8%, 30.8%; non-inferiority limit - 20%; P = 0.50). Frequent relapses were more common in patients administered rituximab compared to tacrolimus (risk difference 30%, 95% CI 7.0, 53.0, P = 0.023). Both groups showed similar reductions in relapse rates and prednisolone use. Common adverse events were infusion-related with rituximab and gastrointestinal symptoms with tacrolimus.
CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with rituximab was not shown to be non-inferior to 12-months treatment with tacrolimus in maintaining remission in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Frequent relapses were more common with rituximab. While effective, both agents require close monitoring for adverse events. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.

T2  - The Journal of Laryngology and Otology
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Commercially available suction devices are expensive, large and heavy, and need electricity, and thus restrict the outdoor activity of tracheostomised children and their carers. This study evaluated the efficacy and usability of a simple suction assembly using a syringe and feeding tube in paediatric tracheostomised patients.
METHODS: Following the domiciliary usage of this suction assembly instead of their existing suction device for a minimum of 15 days, carers responded to a set of questionnaires containing a subjective scoring system.
RESULTS: Ninety-three per cent of the carers considered this assembly as average, good or very good in cleaning the tracheostomy tube. Eighty per cent of the carers considered that this assembly would be suitable when their existing suction machines are unavailable, indicating high usability, and 66.67 per cent of the carers would be confident using this assembly in outdoor settings.
CONCLUSION: Larger studies with objective evaluation methods can validate the high efficacy of this simple, inexpensive and easy-to-use, hand-held suction apparatus as reported by the carers of 15 paediatric tracheostomised patients in this study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Working memory impairments in the subjects of opioid addiction may stem from an aberrant cortical activity in the executive areas, and may help in early identification of individuals with addictive tendencies and may also be used as a neurofeedback mechanism in adjunct to the existing therapeutics.
METHODS: Electrical neuroimaging via 128-channel electroencephalography (EEG) recording was done in 15 male subjects with opioid addiction (29.45±5.6 yr) during the performance of Sternberg Working Memory Task. EEG data were acquired and analyzed for cortical sources during task as compared to resting (baseline) condition.
RESULTS: Working memory deficits were manifested as decrease in accuracy percentage in the subjects with opioid addiction, while no significant difference was seen in reaction time, on comparison with laboratory-acquired matched controls. Standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA)-based EEG source analysis revealed higher cortical activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, inferior, middle and superior temporal gyri, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule and precuneus, whereas significant lower activity was seen in superior and middle frontal gyri, parietal lobule, cingulate cortex and pre- and postcentral gyri when the task was compared to baseline in the subjects with opioid addiction. Further, a negative correlation was seen between the accuracy of task performance and activation ratio for the significant gyri in the subjects with opioid addiction.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: EEG cortical sources revealed the failure of deactivation of default-mode network (DMN) during the task amongst the subjects with opioid addiction. In addition, there was a decrease in the executive function areas in the subjects with opioid addiction. This lack of sufficiently active executive network and persistence of DMN during the task (as compared to baseline) may potentially form the basis of functional impairments in the subjects with opioid addiction.

AB  - The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD) serves as a prognostic marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We evaluated the diagnostic potential of hnRNPD to differentiate between OSCC and normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry for hnRNPD and a routinely used diagnostic marker deltaNp63 (p40) was performed in 32 normal mucosae and 46 OSCC specimens. Subsequently, receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of hnRNPD in comparison to that of p40. Immunostaining for p40 and hnRNPD was observed in 39 (84.78%) and 38 (82.60%) cases, respectively, in OSCC specimens. The poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma displayed 100% (eight cases) immunoreactivity for hnRNPD as compared to 87.5% (seven cases) for p40. Nuclear staining of p40 and hnRNPD was observed in all OSCC specimens. p40 staining was restricted to basal cells, whereas both basal and para-basal cells displayed hnRNPD staining in OSCC specimens. Areas under the curve for p40 and hnRNPD were 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. p40 and hnRNPD showed equal sensitivities (80.95%). However, hnRNPD displayed marginally higher (88.23%) specificity for tumor cells as compared to that of p40 (85.29%). Conclusion: In addition to being a well-established prognostic marker, hnRNPD can serve as a diagnostic marker for OSCC.

AB  - Endocrine mucin-producing sweat gland carcinoma (EMPSCG) is a rare, low-grade cutaneous adnexal neoplasm with evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation, predominantly involving the eyelids of elderly. It has a striking resemblance to solid papillary carcinoma of breast which similarly displays neuroendocrine features. EMPSGC is considered a precursor of cutaneous mucinous carcinoma, and the term "mucinous carcinoma" is also recommended for hybrid lesions which reveal an invasive mucinous component associated with EMPSGC. While local recurrences are well- documented in EMPSGC, metastases had not been encountered until very recently; two reports in the past year have described metastases from eyelid EMPSGC to the parotid gland after a prolonged interval from the primary presentation. We report the case of a 78-year-old male with eyelid EMPSGC metastatic to the parotid gland nine years after excision of the primary tumor, which had initially been diagnosed as a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Development of metastasis after a prolonged interval is similar to both the previously described cases, and emphasizes the need to reevaluate the stated indolent nature of this neoplasm. It also aims to draw attention of pathologists to this uncommon tumor of the eyelid which is often misdiagnosed on primary presentation.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive use of mitomycin-C (MMC) using two different concentrations 0.2 mg/ml and 0.4 mg/ml for lacrimal duct probing to treat the nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) in adults.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Prospective, an interventional comparative randomized pilot study of lacrimal duct probing conducted in the two study groups 0.02% MMC group (n = 30) and 0.04% MMC group (n = 30) in confirmed primary acquired NLDO of <1-year duration. Patency of lacrimal duct probing confirmed by syringing was compared at 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up in the two study groups, and corresponding subjective improvement of watering was appraised according to Kraft and Crawford grading.
RESULTS: Patency of lacrimal duct probing in 0.02% MMC versus 0.04% MMC group was 66.66%/73.33% (P = 0.71) at 1 month, 46.66%/66.66% (P = 0.09) at 3 months and 46.66%/66.66% (P = 0.03) at 6-month follow-up, respectively. Subjective improvement of watering (no watering and mild watering) observed in 0.02% MMC versus 0.04% MMC group was 46.66%/73.33% (P = 0.03), at 1 month, 66.66%/83.33% (P = 0.13) at 3 months and 56.66%/73.33% (P = 0.17) at 6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Adult lacrimal duct probing with 0.04% MMC was associated with significant higher objective success rate than adult lacrimal duct probing with 0.02% MMC, without added concurrently side effects.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) for the treatment of fungal keratitis.
METHODS: Patients with fungal keratitis confirmed by potassium hydroxide (KOH) smear and/or confocal microscopy were administered topical L-AMB and randomized into three groups treated with three different formulations. The medication was administered two hourly till clinical improvement was achieved, followed by six hourly till complete resolution. The outcome measures were time to clinical improvement, resolution of epithelial defect, stromal infiltrate, hypopyon, extent and density of corneal opacity, neovascularization, and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 46.6 ± 14.8 years, and trauma with vegetative matter was the most common predisposing factor. Aspergillus flavus (36%) was the most common fungus cultured, followed by Fusarium (23%). Mean time to clinical improvement, time to resolution of epithelial defect, mean time to resolution of infiltrate, and time to resolution of hypopyon were 3.45 ± 1.38, 25.35 ± 8.46, 37.97 ± 9.94, and 13.33 ± 4.90 days, respectively, and they were comparable among the three groups. There was a significant difference between treatment failure and success cases in terms of days of presentation (P < 0.01), size of the epithelial defect (P-value 0.04), and infiltrate size at presentation (P-value 0.04). At 3 months follow-up, no statistically significant difference was noted in BCVA and mean scar size among groups.
CONCLUSION: L-AMB in a gel form is an effective antifungal agent that promotes the healing of fungal ulcers with notably least vascularization and better tolerance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the fractal dimension (FD) and radiomorphometric indices (RMIs) in the mandible from orthopantomographic radiographs in patients with oral lesions associated with smokeless/smoking tobacco (SLT/ST) and areca nut habits in a North Indian cohort.
STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted of 120 subjects, including controls and 3 study groups of 30 patients each with oral submucous fibrosis, tobacco pouch keratosis, and oral leukoplakia (OL). Two observers calculated FD and the RMIs of mandibular cortical thickness (MCT), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), and mandibular cortical index (MCI).
RESULTS: Mean FD was significantly reduced compared to controls with all oral lesions (P < .05) and with all habits in 3 of 4 regions of interest (P < .05). MCT was significantly reduced with OL (P < .005) and in ST users (P < .05). PMI did not differ regarding lesion status or habits. Compared to the controls, MCI C2 type was significantly more common in all oral lesions (P ≤ .005) and all types of habit (P < .005). Inter- and intraobserver agreement was strong to excellent.
CONCLUSIONS: FD and RMI values were significantly altered compared to controls in oral lesions associated with tobacco and areca nut habits and in the dominant type of habit.

AB  - The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating people with diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated based on new evidence include Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. The content of previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) has been deemed current and was not changed. This guideline update was developed according to an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence, and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed, and areas for which additional research is needed are presented.

AB  - AIM: Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a rare but life-threatening disease of infancy and childhood. 18F-DOPA PET/CT has been shown to be a useful modality in the localization of focal pancreatic lesions in these patients. We aimed to assess the role of 18F-DOPA PET/CT in such patients at our institution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, 18F-DOPA PET/CT scans and clinical details of 20 children with clinical diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia were reviewed. Scans were acquired at 5 min postinjection of 2-3 mCi of 18F-DOPA on dedicated PET/CT scanners (Biograph mCT, Siemens Inc and Discovery PET/CT, GE). Abdominal spot images over 1-2 bed positions were acquired. Additionally, genetic mutation status, where available, was correlated to the scan findings.
RESULTS: Out of 20 children (7 female and 13 male), 13 were infants. The age of the children ranged from 3 months to 8 years. Fifteen children had undergone gene analysis, 12 were positive for mutation in ABCC8, 1 for GLUD-1, 1 for GCK mutations and 1 had not shown any mutation. 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan showed 5 focal pancreatic lesions in 5 children (1 in each), two focal lesions in 1 child and diffuse pancreatic uptake in 14 children.
CONCLUSION: 18F-DOPA PET/CT is a useful modality for localizing focal pancreatic lesions in children with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The detection rate is significantly higher in patients with ABCC8 paternal monoallelic recessive gene mutation. 18F-DOPA PET/CT scan consequent to findings on genetic analysis appears to be useful in planning the management of children with hyperinsulinism.

AB  - In this study, we present an efficient Graph Convolutional Network based Risk Stratification system (GCRS) for cancer risk-stage prediction of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. GCRS is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a fusion of multiple connectivity graphs that are used to learn the latent representation of topological structures among patients. This proposed risk stratification system integrates these connectivity graphs prepared from the clinical and laboratory characteristics of NDMM cancer patients for partitioning them into three cancer risk groups: low, intermediate, and high. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCRS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of C-index and hazard ratio on two publicly available datasets of NDMM patients. We have statistically validated our results using the Cox Proportional-Hazards model, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank test on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We have also evaluated the contribution of various clinical parameters as utilized by the GCRS risk stratification system using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, an interpretability algorithm for validating AI methods. Our study reveals the utility of the deep learning approach in building a robust system for cancer risk stage prediction.

T2  - Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism: JPEM
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) in the paediatric population differ from that of their adult counterparts in terms of clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence of various genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of sporadic paediatric DTCs.
METHODS: This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic searches were made on the PubMed and Embase databases using relevant keywords, and articles published until October 15, 2021 were selected. Data on the prevalence of various genetic alterations were extracted from the individual articles. Random-effects model was employed for meta-analysis to generate pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).
RESULTS: Thirty-three articles comprising 1,380 paediatric patients were included. RET rearrangement (pooled prevalence: 24.4%, 95% CI: 19.1-30.1) was observed to be the most common genetic alteration in sporadic paediatric DTCs, closely followed by BRAF point mutation (pooled prevalence: 21.2%, 95% CI: 17.2-25.5). Other common alterations included: NTRK rearrangement (pooled prevalence: 13.5%, 95% CI: 9.5-17.9) and DICER1 mutation (pooled prevalence: 12.5%, 95% CI: 3.6-25.7). RAS and TERT mutations were observed to be relatively uncommon (pooled prevalence: 5.7%, 95% CI: 2.9-9.3, and 2.2%, 95% CI: 0.4-5.5, respectively). There was no evidence of publication bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Fusion oncogenes are noted to be the major oncogenic drivers in sporadic paediatric DTCs and underlie their unique behaviour. However, despite the relatively lower frequency of BRAF point mutation compared to adults, it remains a major player in childhood DTCs.

AB  - Background: Histological changes induced by gluten in the duodenal mucosa of patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are poorly defined. Objectives: To evaluate the structural and inflammatory features of NCGS compared to controls and coeliac disease (CeD) with milder enteropathy (Marsh I-II). Methods: Well-oriented biopsies of 262 control cases with normal gastroscopy and histologic findings, 261 CeD, and 175 NCGS biopsies from 9 contributing countries were examined. Villus height (VH, in μm), crypt depth (CrD, in μm), villus-to-crypt ratios (VCR), IELs (intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 enterocytes), and other relevant histological, serologic, and demographic parameters were quantified. Results: The median VH in NCGS was significantly shorter (600, IQR: 400−705) than controls (900, IQR: 667−1112) (p < 0.001). NCGS patients with Marsh I-II had similar VH and VCR to CeD [465 µm (IQR: 390−620) vs. 427 µm (IQR: 348−569, p = 0·176)]. The VCR in NCGS with Marsh 0 was lower than controls (p < 0.001). The median IEL in NCGS with Marsh 0 was higher than controls (23.0 vs. 13.7, p < 0.001). To distinguish Marsh 0 NCGS from controls, an IEL cut-off of 14 showed 79% sensitivity and 55% specificity. IEL densities in Marsh I-II NCGS and CeD groups were similar. Conclusion: NCGS duodenal mucosa exhibits distinctive changes consistent with an intestinal response to luminal antigens, even at the Marsh 0 stage of villus architecture.

AB  - Background During the peak of the Omicron wave, elective laparoscopic surgeries were restricted; however, semi-emergency and emergency cases were managed despite the limited resources and manpower. We conducted this study to assess the types of gynaecological laparoscopic surgeries performed, the difficulties faced during the Omicron wave, and how we could implement the lessons learnt from the previous Delta wave for better management of gynaecological cases in the Omicron wave. Methodology We conducted a prospective cohort study over a period of three months involving 105 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgeries. Based on the decision regarding surgical incision time, the surgeries were sub-classified into immediate, urgent, and expedited. The surgical outcome and satisfaction rates among the patients were assessed through various parameters. Results Most of the women (81.9%) were pre-menopausal. Diabetes and chronic hypertension were the predominant medical co-morbidities. Three patients had a history of cardiac valve replacement which required switching warfarin to unfractionated heparin in the pre-operative period. Nearly three-fourthsof the study patients were doubly vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (77; 73.4%). A total of 14 (13.3%) patients had a history of COVID-19 infection in the past two weeks prior to the current admission. Immediate, urgent, and expedited surgeries comprised 11.4%, 22.8%, and 65.8% of total surgeries, respectively. On assessing the ease of pre-operative preparation according to the five-point Likert scale, immediate, urgent, and expedited surgeries were rated with a mean score of two, four, and five, respectively. The mean duration of surgery in the immediate and urgent groups was 37.6 and 44.2 minutes, respectively. The expedited group comprising mostly laparoscopic myomectomies and hysterectomies required an average duration of 92.6 minutes. The mean rating of patient satisfaction measured by the Likert scale was four, five, and five, respectively, in the three subgroups. Pre-operative patient preparation during the Omicron wave was faster, thereby decreasing the decision to incision interval compared to the Delta wave. Conclusions The lessons learnt from the previous Delta wave were used to modify the existing hospital policies in the Omicron wave. More number of vaccinated ground staff, less stringent intubation and extubation protocols during surgery, and lesser duration of post-operative stay helped modify our existing hospital policies for better patient care and satisfaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Lifestyle preferences are inculcated in childhood and once established, persist into adulthood. The Project PROMoting Health LIteracy in School (i-PROMISe) aims to promote a healthy lifestyle among students for the universal prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes.
STUDY DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus-group-discussions (FGDs) and In-Depth Interviews (IDI).
METHOD: Project was undertaken in two-phases in two private schools in New Delhi, India. In phase-one, FGDs with students (grades IV to VIII) and IDIs with teachers were conducted to ascertain their perceptions of diabetes prevention and management according to the Health Belief Model. The data was analyzed using a thematic framework method. In phase-two, the resources were pre-tested and participants' feedback was requested on the duration, quality, and understanding of the resources.
RESULTS: In total, 89 students and 17 teachers participated in phase-one (n = 54 [in FGDs] and n = 5 [in IDIs]) and phase-two (n = 35 students and n = 12 teachers in FGDs). In phase-one, themes that emerged included: diabetes was considered a disease of the elderly; misconceptions about susceptibility to these diseases were common; children were largely aware of measures to prevent these diseases, but barriers to adopting a healthy lifestyle existed. Based on the findings, a comprehensive module was developed, which consisted of a teacher's manual with interactive activities and short films. The resources (teacher's manual and short films) were well received and contributed to a better understanding of diabetes and other NCDs; myths/misconceptions were clarified.
CONCLUSION: Development of resources using participatory approach can be effective in promoting and reinforcing healthy behaviours among school going children to prevent and control NCDs in schools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic steroid intake has been associated with attenuation of neuromuscular block. Despite some promising animal and adult studies, the effect of a single dose of intravenous dexamethasone on neuromuscular blockers is not well established. Thus, the present study aimed to demonstrate the effect of dexamethasone given at the time of induction for the prevention of PONV on the action of neuromuscular blockers in children undergoing elective surgery.
METHOD: After obtaining approval from the Institute Ethics Committee and written informed parental consent, 100 ASA I and II children aged 4-15 years undergoing elective surgery randomized to receive either: 0.15 mg/kg (maximum of 5 mg) of dexamethasone diluted to a total volume of 2 ml with 0.9% saline (n = 50) or 2 ml of 0.9% saline (n = 50) at the time of induction. The time interval between application of atracurium and maximum T1 depression, 25% twitch height recovery of T1, amid 25% and 75% twitch height recovery of T1, amid the 25% twitch height recovery of T1 and recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9, and in between the initiation of atracurium injection till the recovery of the neuromuscular block to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was defined as onset time, clinical duration, recovery index, recovery time, and total recovery period, respectively, and recorded.
RESULTS: The onset time and recovery index time were lower (1.96 ± 0.39, 8.04 ± 2.14, respectively) with dexamethasone in comparison with saline (2.01 ± 0.51, 8.9 ± 3.4, respectively) but not statistically significant. The clinical duration, recovery time, and total recovery period were similar.
CONCLUSION: Application of a single bolus dose (0.15 mg/kg) of dexamethasone during induction does not attenuate atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in children.

AB  - Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the host genome's epigenetic modifications are essential for living organisms to adapt to extreme conditions. DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histone and interassociation of noncoding RNAs facilitate the cellular manifestation of epigenetic changes in the genome. Out of various factors involved in the epigenetic programming of the host, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA, snoRNA and piRNA are new generation noncoding molecules that influence a variety of cellular processes like immunity, cellular differentiation and tumor development. During tumor development, temporal changes in miRNA/lncRNA rheostat influence sterile inflammatory responses accompanied by the changes in the carcinogenic signaling in the host. At the cellular level, this is manifested by the upregulation of inflammasome and inflammatory pathways, which promotes cancer-related inflammation. Given this, we discuss the potential of lncRNAs, miRNAs, circular RNA, snoRNA and piRNA in regulating inflammation and tumor development in the host.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) and Crohn's disease (CD) frequently present with a diagnostic dilemma because of similar presentation. Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) has been used in differentiating ITB from CD, but with sparse reports on its diagnostic accuracy in tuberculosis endemic regions and this study evaluated the same.
METHODS: Patients with definitive diagnosis of ITB (n=59) or CD (n=49) who underwent IGRA testing (n=307) were retrospectively included at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (July 2014 to September 2021). CD or ITB was diagnosed as per standard criteria. IGRA was considered positive at >0.35 IU/mL. Relevant data was collected and IGRA results were compared between ITB and CD to determine its accuracy.
RESULTS: Among 59 ITB patients (mean age, 32.6±13.1 years; median disease duration, 1 year; male, 59.3%), 24 were positive and 35 tested negative for IGRA. Among 49 CD patients (mean age, 37.8±14.0; median disease duration, 4 years; male, 61.2%), 12 were positive and 37 tested negative for IGRA. Hence, for diagnosing ITB, IGRA showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 40.68%, 75.51%, 66.67%, and 51.39%, respectively. The area under the curve of IGRA for ITB diagnosis was 0.66 (95% confidence interval, 0.55-0.75). In a subset (n=64), tuberculin skin test (TST) showed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 64.7%, 73.3%, 73.3%, and 64.71%, respectively. IGRA and TST were concordant in 38 (59.4%) patients with κ=0.17.
CONCLUSIONS: In a tuberculosis endemic region, IGRA had poor diagnostic accuracy for differentiating ITB from CD, suggesting a limited value of IGRA in this setting.

AB  - AIM: To study the role of check point inhibitors (CPI) in sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Retrospective data of 15 patients diagnosed with advanced sarcoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors and treated with CPI.
RESULTS: 3/14 patients (21.4%) responded to treatment with a disease control rate of 42.8% (6/14). After a median follow-up of 14 months (range: 2-24 months), 11 (73.3%) patients progressed, the median progression-free survival was 4 months (95% CI: 1.7-6.3) and median overall survival was 14 months (95% CI: 2.6-25.7). Only one patient experienced a grade IV adverse event.
CONCLUSION: Our data represent the first real-world application of CPI in sarcoma from India. We believe that CPI should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

AB  - We assessed the potential negative effects of bacteriostatic and bactericidal antibiotics on the AMD cybrid cell lines (K, U and J haplogroups). AMD cybrid cells were created and cultured in 96-well plates and treated with tetracycline (TETRA) and ciprofloxacin (CPFX) for 24 h. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔψM), cellular metabolism and ratio of apoptotic cells were measured using H2DCFDA, JC1, MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. Expression of genes of antioxidant enzymes, and pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic pathways were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Higher ROS levels were found in U haplogroup cybrids when treated with CPFX 60 µg/mL concentrations, lower ΔψM of all haplogroups by CPFX 120 µg/mL, diminished cellular metabolism in all cybrids with CPFX 120 µg/mL, and higher ratio of dead cells in K and J cybrids. CPFX 120 µg/mL induced overexpression of IL-33, CASP-3 and CASP-9 in all cybrids, upregulation of TGF-β1 and SOD2 in U and J cybrids, respectively, along with decreased expression of IL-6 in J cybrids. TETRA 120 µg/mL induced decreased ROS levels in U and J cybrids, increased cellular metabolism of treated U cybrids, higher ratio of dead cells in K and J cybrids and declined ΔψM via all TETRA concentrations in all haplogroups. TETRA 120 µg/mL caused upregulation of IL-6 and CASP-3 genes in all cybrids, higher CASP-7 gene expression in K and U cybrids and downregulation of the SOD3 gene in K and U cybrids. Clinically relevant dosages of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline have potential adverse impacts on AMD cybrids possessing K, J and U mtDNA haplogroups in vitro.

AB  - Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) is associated with innate immune dysfunction and high short-term mortality. Neutrophils have been identified to influence prognosis in ACLF. Neutrophil biology is under-evaluated in ACLF. Therefore, we investigated neutrophil-specific genes and their association with ACLF outcomes. This is an observational study. Enriched granulocytes, containing neutrophils, isolated from study participants in three groups- ACLF(n = 10), chronic liver disease (CLD, n = 4) and healthy controls (HC, n = 4), were analysed by microarray. Differentially expressed genes were identified and validated by qRT-PCR in an independent cohort of ACLF, CLD and HC (n = 30, 15 and 15 respectively). The association of confirmed overexpressed genes with ACLF 28-day non-survivors was investigated. The protein expression of selected neutrophil genes was confirmed using flow cytometry and IHC. Differential gene expression analysis showed 1140 downregulated and 928 upregulated genes for ACLF versus CLD and 2086 downregulated and 1091 upregulated genes for ACLF versus HC. Significant upregulation of neutrophilic inflammatory signatures were found in ACLF compared to CLD and HC. Neutrophil enriched genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 were highly upregulated in ACLF and their expression was higher in ACLF 28-day non-survivors. Elevated expression of CD177 protein on neutrophil surface in ACLF was confirmed by flow cytometry. IHC analysis in archival post mortem liver biopsies showed the presence of CD177+ neutrophils in the liver tissue of ACLF patients. Granulocyte genes ELANE, MPO and CD177 are highly overexpressed in ACLF neutrophils as compared to CLD or HC. Further, this three-gene signature is highly overexpressed in ACLF 28-day non-survivors.

AB  - Immunogens mimicking the native-like structure of surface-exposed viral antigens are considered promising vaccine candidates. Influenza viruses are important zoonotic respiratory viruses with high pandemic potential. Recombinant soluble hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein-based protein subunit vaccines against Influenza have been shown to induce protective efficacy when administered intramuscularly. Here, we have expressed a recombinant soluble trimeric HA protein in Expi 293F cells and purified the protein derived from the Inf A/Guangdong-Maonan/ SWL1536/2019 virus which was found to be highly virulent in the mouse. The trimeric HA protein was found to be in the oligomeric state, highly stable, and the efficacy study in the BALB/c mouse challenge model through intradermal immunization with the prime-boost regimen conferred complete protection against a high lethal dose of homologous and mouse-adapted InfA/PR8 virus challenge. Furthermore, the immunogen induced high hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers and showed cross-protection against other Inf A and Inf B subtypes. The results are promising and warrant trimeric HA as a suitable vaccine candidate.

AB  - Vertigo is not an uncommon presenting symptom in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) and primary physician's clinic, and around one-tenth of these patients have a central cause, i.e., posterior circulation stroke. HINTS, the acronym for head impulse (HI) test, nystagmus (N), and test of skew (TS), is a neurological examination utilized for differentiating a peripheral cause of vertigo from a sinister central cause. It is a simple, easy-to-do, inexpensive, and less time-consuming test. Here, we present a 27-year young male case without any known comorbidity or trauma, presented to the ED, with complaints of sudden onset isolated vertigo for 2 hours. HINTS examination pointed towards a central cause (normal head impulse test and direction-changing nystagmus). Other neurological and systemic examinations were normal. Non-contrast computed tomography of the brain was normal. Further, computed tomography angiography of head and neck vessels was performed, showing left vertebral artery dissection (VAD). The patient's neurological status deteriorated in the next 8 hours. The patient underwent decompressive craniotomy and got discharged after two weeks. Early performance of the HINTS examination by the primary care physicians and emergency physicians lead to early diagnosis and treatment of this common cause of posterior circulation stroke in young patients. Essential take-home points are the importance of the HINTS test and not to forget VAD as a cause of isolated vertigo without any neck manipulation or trauma.

AB  - AIMS: Various factors can influence the learning curve of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Initiating CRS and HIPEC programmes in low- and middle-income countries is challenging due to resource constraints and limited availability of expertise. We present our experience of CRS and HIPEC from a learning curve perspective among a cohort 155 peritoneal surface malignancy patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC between May 2015 and February 2019 were included in the study. Patients were divided into two consecutive cohorts: the first 73 cases comprised the learning phase, group 1; the subsequent cohort of 82 patients were considered as the implementation phase, group 2. A comparative analysis of clinical and surgical outcome parameters was carried out between the two groups.
RESULTS: The clinical spectrum was comparable among group 1/group 2. Most were ovarian (56.8%), colorectal (13.5%) and appendiceal (11.0%) malignancies. Group 2 had a higher number of moderate to high peritoneal cancer index patients (34.1% versus 19.1%), total peritonectomies (48.8% versus 45.2%), multi-visceral resections (colonic 41.5% versus 27.4%, small bowel 25.6% versus 19.1%, diaphragmatic 8.5% versus 6.5% and hepatic resections 8.5% versus 2.7%) and completeness of cytoreduction 0/1 rates (97.6% versus 93.1%). A lower incidence of intraoperative urological injuries (2.6% versus 12.3%) was noticed in group 2 (P = 0.007). Non-significant improvements seen in group 2 included surgery duration (6.0 ± 1.3 h versus 6.4 ± 1.7 h), intensive care unit stay (1.3 ± 1.1 days versus 1.8 ± 1.5 days), overall hospital stay (8.1 ± 0.9 days versus 8.8 ± 1.4 days) and reduction in Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 complications (25.4% versus 36.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that by implementing standard protocols and mentoring by an experienced team, a learning curve of CRS and HIPEC can be achieved in fewer than 75 cases. The baseline expertise of the treating team can also influence the learning curve.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious respiratory virus associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Discoveries in the field revealed that inflammatory conditions exert a negative impact on bone metabolism; however, only limited studies reported the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on skeletal homeostasis. Inflammatory immune cells (T helper-Th17 cells and macrophages) and their signature cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are the major contributors to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 disease. Our group along with others has proven that an enhanced population of both inflammatory innate (Dendritic cells-DCs, macrophages, etc.) and adaptive (Th1, Th17, etc.) immune cells, along with their signature cytokines (IL-17, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6, etc.), are associated with various inflammatory bone loss conditions. Moreover, several pieces of evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects various organs of the body via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors including bone cells (osteoblasts-OBs and osteoclasts-OCs). This evidence thus clearly highlights both the direct and indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the physiological bone remodeling process. Moreover, data from the previous SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2004 revealed the long-term negative impact (decreased bone mineral density-BMDs) of these infections on bone health.
METHODOLOGY: We used the keywords "immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2," "SARS-CoV-2 and bone cells," "factors influencing bone health and COVID-19," "GUT microbiota," and "COVID-19 and Bone health" to integrate the topics for making this review article by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence and reports indicate the direct relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and bone health and thus warrant future research in this field. It would be imperative to assess the post-COVID-19 fracture risk of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals by simultaneously monitoring them for bone metabolism/biochemical markers. Importantly, several emerging research suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota-GM (established role in inflammatory bone loss conditions) is further involved in the severity of COVID-19 disease. In the present review, we thus also highlight the importance of dietary interventions including probiotics (modulating dysbiotic GM) as an adjunct therapeutic alternative in the treatment and management of long-term consequences of COVID-19 on bone health.

AB  - PURPOSE: Published experience with autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT) in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from the Indian subcontinent is extremely limited. Here, we describe the activity and outcomes of this treatment modality at a large tertiary care center in India.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed adult patients with NHL who were eligible for ASCT and autografted between January 1, 2002, and December 15, 2020, at our transplant unit. Toxicities, complications, and long-term outcomes were compared between patients who underwent transplant during 2002-2012 (group A) and 2013-2020 (group B).
RESULTS: Overall, 80 patients (group A, n = 37; group B, n = 43) underwent ASCT using peripheral blood stem cells. At a median follow-up of 57.6 months, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 43.5% and 47.6%, respectively, for all patients. More recently (group B), patients had reduced 100-day transplant-related mortality (2.3% v 21.6%, P < .01), improved 3-year EFS (52.9% v 37.3%, P = .04), and superior OS (at 3-year; 63.4% v 43.2%, P = .02). Patients in group B also tolerated the procedure better, with improved resource utilization. In multivariate analysis, an International Prognostic Index (IPI) ≥ 3 at diagnosis adversely affected EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.82, P = .009) and OS (HR = 2.84, P = .01) after ASCT. Low pretransplant serum albumin levels were associated with inferior EFS (HR = 2.68, P = .02) and transplant-related mortality (odds ratio = 10.80, P = .02) after ASCT.
CONCLUSION: It is feasible to achieve comparable short- and long-term outcomes in patients with NHL undergoing ASCT in a resource-poor country with improved supportive care and expertise of the transplant team and center.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) is increasing in India and now constitutes nearly one-third of all liver transplantation procedures performed in the country. There is currently no uniform national system of allocation of deceased donor livers.
METHODS: A national task force consisting of 19 clinicians involved in liver transplantation from across the country was constituted under the aegis of the Liver Transplantation Society of India to develop a consensus document addressing the above issues using a modified Delphi process of consensus development.
RESULTS: The National Liver Allocation Policy consensus document includes 46 statements covering all aspects of DDLT, including minimum listing criteria, listing for acute liver failure, DDLT wait-list management, system of prioritisation based on clinical urgency for adults and children, guidelines for allocation of paediatric organs and allocation priorities for liver grafts recovered from public sector hospitals.
CONCLUSION: This document is the first step in the setting up of a nationally consistent policy of deceased donor liver allocation.

T2  - Recenti Progressi in Medicina
AB  - Riassunto. Le malattie tropicali trascurate (NTD) sono una serie di malattie che prosperano nelle comunità povere di risorse, in particolare nei climi tropicali. I fattori sociali, ambientali ed economici contribuiscono alla loro persistenza. La filariosi linfatica (LF), classificata come NTD in tutto il mondo, è una malattia parassitaria causata da vermi microscopici noti come microfilarie. I vermi adulti dimorano solo nel sistema linfatico degli esseri umani. Le zanzare trasferiscono la LF da persona a persona. Gonfiore di braccia, gambe e seno (linfedema) o dello scroto (idrocele) sono alcuni dei sintomi più gravi e dolorosi. La LF ha una grave influenza sia sulla salute mentale e sociale sia su quella fisica, e porta le persone a convivere con una deformazione, una debilitazione e uno stigma legati alla condizione di malattia. Di seguito descriviamo un caso clinico di un uomo con LF, alienato e umiliato dalla sua malattia. L'OMS ha avviato un'iniziativa globale per debellare la LF. Oltre alla somministrazione di trattamenti regolari, è stata posta uguale enfasi sull'apprendimento di come lavare e alzare gli arti colpiti, per aiutare a ridurre la gravità clinica e la progressione del disturbo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metastases account for 6-25% of parotid tumors, often presenting dilemmas in their diagnosis.
METHODS: Parotid metastases diagnosed on histology/cytology were retrieved. MUC2, MUC5AC, androgen receptor immunohistochemistry was performed in select cases.
RESULTS: Fifty-one samples were identified from 42 patients, including 14 aspirates, 7 biopsies and 30 parotidectomies. Previous history was available in 17 cases, 13 parotidectomies accompanied excision of the primary, and relevant clinical data was unavailable for 12 patients. Majority (81%) had head and neck primaries; eye and ocular adnexa were the commonest subsite (52.4%), and sebaceous carcinoma the commonest histology (33%). When history was unavailable, most metastases were initially diagnosed as poorly differentiated carcinoma/malignant tumor, or mucoepidermoid carcinoma on cytology.
CONCLUSIONS: Intraparotid metastases encompass a wide spectrum, often mimicking primary salivary gland neoplasms, particularly on limited samples. Metastases should be considered when histological/cytological features are unusual; detailed clinical information and ancillary techniques aid in arriving at an accurate diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.
METHODS: Total fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin + Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were histopathological response to NACT (good-response ≥ 50% necrosis and poor-response < 50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters (D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.
RESULTS: Good-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC = 0.87, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 77% at t0, and AUC = 0.96, Sensitivity = 86%, Specificity = 100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller tumour volume (HR = 1.002, p = 0.001) higher ADC-25th-percentile (HR = 0.047, p = 0.005) & D-Mean (HR = 0.1, p = 0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.052, p = 0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR = 4.33, p < 10-3), smaller tumour-volume (HR = 1.001, p = 0.042), lower D*-Mean (HR = 1.045, p = 0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR = 0.544, p = 0.048) were independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values: < 10-3, 0.07, < 10-3, 0.019 respectively).
CONCLUSION: IVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sclerosing epithelioid fibrosarcoma (SEF) is an extremely rare subtype of soft tissue sarcoma and the data from India is sparse. It is an unusual variant of fibrosarcoma that commonly arises in the soft tissues of the limb, head and neck, trunk and occasionally in the visceral organs and bones. This entity is commonly reported in the middle age group, men and women alike. Pathological clinchers include MUC 4 (Mucin 4, cell surface associated) positivity by immunohistochemistry, FUS-CREB3L1 fusion and EWSR1 rearrangement. This disease is notoriously known for its local recurrence and metastatic spread. Response to systemic therapy is poor and relapses are frequent. The role of targeted and immunotherapy is not well defined.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a 46-year-old gentleman who presented to the Sarcoma Medical Oncology Clinic in our centre. He had primary involvement of right pubic bone with metastasis to liver, lung and diffuse lytic bony lesions. His diagnosis was reviewed multiple times before coming to final diagnosis of SEF. His molecular test for EWSR1 rearrangement was positive by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. He did not respond to palliative doxorubicin, pazopanib and gemcitabine and docetaxel.
CONCLUSION: Through this case report, we would like to highlight the rarity of this sarcoma, its classical pathological features, its close relationship to low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma and the limited therapeutic options available. Hence, there is a need for further research in this entity.

AB  - Heterogeneous Ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD) is an RNA binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of multiple mediators of carcinogenesis. We previously demonstrated a strong association of hnRNPD over expression with poor outcome in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). However, hitherto the precise molecular mechanism of its overexpression in oral cancer was not clear. Therefore, in an attempt to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of hnRNPD expression, we cloned 1406 bp of 5' flanking region of human hnRNPD gene along with 257 bp of its first exon upstream to promoterless luciferase reporter gene in pGL3-Basic. Transfection of the resulting construct in SCC-4 cells yielded 1271 fold higher luciferase activity over parent vector. By promoter deletion analysis, we identified a canonical TATA box containing 126 bp core promoter region that retained ~ 58% activity of the full length promoter. In silico analysis revealed the presence of four putative NFκB binding motifs in the promoter. Sequential deletion of these motifs from the full-length promoter reporter construct coupled with luciferase assays revealed an 82% decrease in promoter activity after deletion of the first (-1358/-1347) motif and 99% reduction after the deletion of second motif (-1052/-1041). In-vivo binding of NFκB (RelA) to these two motifs in SCC-4 cells was confirmed by ChIP assays. Site directed mutagenesis of even one of these two motifs completely abolished promoter activity, while mutagenesis of the remaining two motifs had marginal effect on the same. Consistent with these findings, treatment of SCC-4 cells with PDTC, a known inhibitor of NFκB dramatically reduced the levels hnRNPD mRNA and protein. Finally, the expression of hnRNPD and NFκB in clinical specimen from 37 oral cancer patients was assessed and subjected to Spearmen's Correlation analysis which revealed a strong positive correlation between the two. Thus, results of the present study for the first time convincingly demonstrate NFκB (RelA) mediated transcriptional upregulation of hnRNPD expression in oral cancer.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that manifest lung abnormalities during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients with severe COVID-19 and ten uninfected controls. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant 'classical' signature (n=23) showed upregulation of the unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation, supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) that potentially represents 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such as IL1 and CCL19, but absence of complement activation. We found that a majority of patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in 'classical' patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients, which can be identified through complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. These findings can be used to design personalized therapy using in silico identified drug molecules or in mitigating specific secondary infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accuracy of screw placement is one of the important factors necessary for adequate union in odontoid fractures with malposition rates as high as 27.2% with standard techniques.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy of intraoperative O-arm assistance in improving accuracy of anterior odontoid screw placement and clinco-radiological outcome in type II and III odontoid fractures.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, surgery consisted of anterior odontoid screw fixation under intraoperative O-arm assistance over 5 years. Demographical, clinical, radiological, operative details and postoperative events were retrieved from hospital database and evaluated for fusion and surgical outcome.
RESULTS: 50 patients (Mean age 34.6 years, SD 14.10, range: 7-70 years; 44 males and 6 females) with Type II and Type III odontoid fracture underwent O-arm assisted anterior screw placement. The mean interval between injury and surgery was 12 days (range 1-65 days). Mean operating time was 132.2 min ± SD 33.56 with average blood loss of 93 ml. ±SD 61.46. With our technique, accurate screw placement was achieved in 100% patients. At the mean follow-up of 26.4 month (SD13.75), overall acceptable fusion rate was 97.8% with non-union in 2.2% patients. Morbidity occurred in two patients; one patient developed fixation failure while other patient had nonunion which was managed with posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis. We had surgical mortality in one patient due to SAH. So overall our procedure was successful in 94% patients and among patients whose follow-up was available, acceptable fusion rates of 97.8% were achieved.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that use of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging using O-arm for anterior odontoid screw fixation improves accuracy and leads to improved radiological and clinical outcomes. It further enables us to extend the indications of odontoid screw fixation to selected complex Type II and rostral Type III odontoid fractures.

AB  - A patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a frequent incidental finding during echocardiography in otherwise healthy children. In most healthy children with a diagnosis of isolated incidental PFO, no further follow-up or intervention is necessary. In some children, PFO is associated with certain clinical syndromes such as cryptogenic stroke, decompression sickness, migraine, and platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome. This review discusses PFO anatomy, diagnostic imaging, PFO-associated clinical situations, management options, and the role of PFO in certain congenital heart disease. This review also highlights the current deficiency of pediatric data guiding management of these uncommon but important PFO-associated conditions. Future multicenter randomized controlled studies are necessary to guide the management of these unique and challenging PFO-associated conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the ocular surface parameters of children with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) with those of healthy controls and to correlate cytological characteristics with clinical findings and disease severity.
METHODS: Newly diagnosed cases of VKC, not currently being treated, were recruited, along with age-matched controls with no ocular comorbidities. The Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire (OSDI) was administered to all children. Slit lamp biomicroscopy for meibomian gland dysfunction and ocular surface analysis was performed, including tear meniscus height, noninvasive tear film break-up time, lipid layer thickness, meibomian gland morphology, and meibomian gland duct distortion on meibography imaging. Conjunctival impression cytology was also performed.
RESULTS: A total of 68 VKC patients and 33 controls were included. Statistically significant difference was seen in the mean OSDI score (30 ± 13.7 vs 16.1 ± 3 [P ≤ 0.01]), lipid layer thickness (24.2 ± 7.9 nm vs 69.9 ± 15.1 nm [P <0.001]), and noninvasive tear film break-up time (6.8 ± 1.7 vs 12.5 ± 1.8 sec [P < 0.01]) between groups. Mean tear meniscus height was 0.22 ± 0.06 mm in the VKC and 0.24 ± 0.04 mm in the control group (P = 0.096). Significant association was seen between grade of squamous metaplasia and severity of VKC (P < 0.01). Severity of VKC was found to be positively correlated with OSDI score (r = 0.767), grade of squamous metaplasia (r = 0.64) and negatively correlated with noninvasive tear film break-up time (r = -0.468), and lipid layer thickness (r = -0.253).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the poor ocular surface health of children with VKC, with severe disease being associated with worse forms of dry eye disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare pneumatic vitreolysis and pars plana vitrectomy in the management of focal symptomatic vitreomacular traction (VMT).
METHOD: Patients aged 18 years or older, with idiopathic focal symptomatic VMT and best-corrected visual acuity <20/40, without any other retinal pathology were randomized to undergo pneumatic vitreolysis (Group 1) or pars plana vitrectomy (Group 2). The primary outcome measure was resolution of traction confirmed with optical coherence tomography at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures were to compare changes in best-corrected visual acuity, central foveal thickness, and complications if any.
RESULTS: A total of 30 eyes of 30 patients were included with 15 eyes in each group. Vitreomacular traction resolved successfully in 12 of 15 (80%) eyes in Group 1 and in all (100%) eyes in Group 2 (P = 0.224). The mean visual acuity improved from 0.80 ± 0.26 (20/126 Snellen's equivalent) to 0.70 ± 0.46 logMAR (20/100 Snellen's equivalent) in Group 1 (P = 0.71) and from 0.904 ± 0.44 (20/160 Snellen's equivalent) to 0.47 ± 0.26 logMAR (20/59 Snellen's equivalent) in Group 2 (P = 0.0016). Although 4 of 15 (26.66%) eyes in Group 1 had formation of full-thickness macular hole and 7 eyes required resurgery (4 for full-thickness macular hole and 3 for unresolved VMT), none in the pars plana vitrectomy group had any complications requiring resurgery (P = 0.0063). Two eyes in the pars plana vitrectomy group had intraoperative deroofing of the fovea leading to full-thickness macular hole.
CONCLUSION: Pars plana vitrectomy is better than pneumatic vitreolysis as a single intervention in the management of focal symptomatic VMT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prognostic disclosure to patients with advanced cancer facilitates treatment decisions and goals of care discussions. However, the perspectives of patients, families and physicians differ in this regard across different cultures. Non-disclosure of cancer diagnosis or prognosis is commonly observed in family-centric cultures such as India.
AIM: To assess the prevalence of and factors associated with cancer patients' awareness of advanced disease status; and its with quality of life and psychological distress.
METHODS: Patients for this cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey were recruited from oncology and palliative medicine clinics at a tertiary cancer hospital in India from January 2017 to June 2018. Patients aged ≥ 21 years, aware of cancer diagnosis and receiving oncology treatment for Stage IV solid cancer were included in the study after obtaining written informed consent.
RESULTS: Two hundred patients were enrolled, of which 146 (73%) were not aware of the stage of their malignancy and 9 (4.5%) believed that their disease was at stage I, II or III. Those who were aware of their advanced cancer stage had more years of education (9.9 years vs 8.1 years, p = .05) and had poorer spiritual wellbeing in the faith domain (adjusted difference -1.6, 95% confidence interval -3.1 to -0.1, p = .03) compared to those who were unaware.
CONCLUSION: It is recommended that future studies may explore prognostic understanding in Indian patients according to their socio-cultural, spiritual and educational background.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT)-based study was to evaluate the outcome of nonsurgical root canal treatment (RCT) performed for the management of large cyst-like periapical lesions (LCPL) and to identify the predictive factors affecting healing.
METHODOLOGY: Fifty-four subjects (77 permanent maxillary anterior teeth) with LCPL (>10 mm) of endodontic origin were included. A single operator performed standardized multi-visit RCT. Patients were clinically and radiographically examined at 6, 12 months, and a CBCT scan was taken at 24 months. Two independent blinded evaluators measured the pre- and postoperative volume of periapical lesions on CBCT scans using ITK snap software (version 3.8.0-beta-20181028-win64). The outcome was assessed as a percentage change in lesion volume and dichotomized as success (resolved/reduced) or failure (unchanged/enlarged). Ten preoperative (gender; age; intraoral draining sinus, soft tissue swelling, tooth discoloration, pulp canal obliteration, open apex, root resorption, cortical bone defect and lesion volume) and four intraoperative (apical extent and density of root filling; number of treatment visits and type of root filling) predictive factors were observed. Bivariate and stepwise multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors affecting treatment outcomes. The significance level was set at 5%.
RESULTS: A recall rate of 88% was achieved. The success rate of RCT was 82.2% (8.9% resolved, 73.3% reduced). Median lesion volume reduction was 75% (IQR 61%-93%). No pre- or intra-operative factors were related to treatment failure. However, presence of preoperative cortical bone defect (palatal versus no cortical defect, β = -51.5; 95% CI: -86.9 to -16, p = .006) and apical extent of obturation (long versus flush, β = -27.2; 95% CI: -53.8 to -0.6, p = .04) were negatively associated with reduction in lesion volume (%).
CONCLUSION: Large cyst-like periapical lesions may be successfully managed with RCT. Preoperative cortical bone defect and apical extent of obturation may negatively influence osseous healing.

T2  - Indian Journal of Ophthalmology
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the preferred surgical technique of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) among corneal surgeons in India, and barriers in performing DMEK surgeries amongst the non-DMEK surgeons.
METHODS: An online, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among members of the Cornea Society of India (CSI) (n = 500). Responses on their surgical experience, preferred technique, complications, and outcome of DMEK were collected and analyzed. Barriers in performing DMEK surgeries were assessed amongst the non-DMEK surgeons.
RESULTS: A total of 100 responses were obtained and response rate for the survey was 20%. DMEK was performed by 55% of the participants of whom only 40% had formal training in this technique. Surgical video-based learning was the most often used self-training method for others. Lack of training was the most common reason for not performing DMEK by the non-DMEK surgeons. Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) was the most common endothelial keratoplasty (EK) performed by both DMEK and non-DMEK surgeons. High volume (>50 cases) DMEK surgeries were reported by limited surgeons (n = 6). Nearly all the DMEK surgeons prepared the donor tissue by themselves on the day of the surgery, and majority felt that unrolling the graft in the anterior chamber was the most difficult surgical step. Nearly 80% of the DMEK surgeons were more comfortable with DSEK or Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) when compared to DMEK.
CONCLUSION: DMEK practice in India needs improvement with increased accessibility to DMEK training programs, wet lab facilities, and better support from eye banks.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Mechanical ventilation in prone position was associated with a reduction in mortality and increase in arterial oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. However, physiological effects of prone position in COVID ARDS patients are unknown.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, data of n = 47 consecutive real time RT- PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with severe ARDS were included. Respiratory mechanics and oxygenation data of recruited patients were collected before and after prone position.
RESULTS: Median (Interquartile range, IQR) age of the recruited patients was 60 (50-67) years and median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 61.2 (54-80) mm Hg with application of median (IQR) positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 12 (10-14) cm H2O before initiation of prone position. Out of those patients, 36 (77%) were prone responders at 16 hours after prone session, evident by increase of PaO2 by at least 20 mm Hg or by 20% as compared to baseline, and 73% patients were sustained responders (after returning to supine position). Plateau airway pressure (p < 0.0001), peak airway pressure (p < 0.0001), and driving pressure (p < 0.0001) were significantly reduced in prone position, and static compliance (p = 0.001), PaO2/FiO2 ratio (p < 0.0001), PaO2 (p = 0.0002), and SpO2 (p = 0.0004) were increased at 4 hours and 16 hours since prone position and also after returning to supine position.
CONCLUSION: In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, mechanical ventilation in prone position is associated with improvement in lung compliance and oxygenation in almost three-fourth of the patients and persisted in supine position in more than 70% of the patients.

AB  - Literature is lacking on the spectrum of symptoms of long COVID-19 (defined as symptoms persisting beyond 28 days of diagnosis) and its impact on quality of life. This single-center, cross-sectional study included mild COVID-19 cases as determined by a positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Patients were contacted at least 28 days after diagnosis and were interviewed telephonically using semi-structured questionnaires for duration of symptoms, fatigue using Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and quality of life using the World Health Organization Quality of Life: Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). A total of 251 COVID-19 patients were included; of which 169 (67.3%) were males. The mean age of the patients was 35.8 years (SD = 12.5). The prevalence of long COVID-19 was 28.2% (n = 71, 95% CI: 23.0-34.2). The most common symptoms involved the musculoskeletal system (12.7%), upper respiratory tract (7.6%), and fatigue among 17 (6.8%) patients. Patients with long COVID-19 had significantly higher FSS score and lower WHOQOL-BREF score compared to the patients without long COVID-19 (<28 days).

AB  - Chronic inflammation in the gallbladder leading to persistent epithelium damage promotes invasive cancer. The study aimed to assess the prognostic value of PDL1 and CA19-9 markers in cancer/inflammatory lesions of the gallbladder. A total of 29 cases (19 cancer and 10 inflammatory) were included. The PDL1 protein concentration level and mRNA expression were assessed in the tissues' lysates by ELISA and real-time PCR, respectively. PDL1 and CA19-9 concentration levels were compared and statistically related with clinico-pathological variables. The PDL1 protein level and its relative mRNA expression were correlated. Kaplan-Meir survival and Cox regression analyses were conducted for predicting prognosis. This study investigated the PDL1 and CA19-9 marker expression in both cancer and inflammatory cases of the gallbladder (p = 0.48 and p = 0.17 respectively). PDL1 protein expression was significantly associated with the hormonal profile of the cases (p = 0.04) at an optimum cut-off value of 13 pg/mL, while the CA19-9 marker expression was correlated with the status of liver metastasis (p = 0.0043) and size of the tumor (p = 0.004). A low PDL1 concentration was found when compared to the CA19-9 level among cancer cases (p = 0.12) and proportional in the inflammatory lesions (p = 0.63). A significant positive correlation was found between the PDL1 protein and its relative mRNA expressions in the inflammatory lesions (p = 0.029) when compared to cancer cases (p = 0.069). Our results showed that a protein-based assay for PDL1 expression would be more sensitive compared to RNA based assays for GBC risk stratifications. Overall survival was predicted with CA19-9 and PDL1 levels (p = 0.0074, p = 0.23, respectively). PDL1 and CA19-9 may act as a probable predictor of a poor prognosis in gallbladder cancer (GBC) cases.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: For the purpose of prognostication of sinonasal mucormycosis, a detailed analysis of the clinical, diagnostic, therapeutic and outcome parameters has been contemplated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively data was collected for all patients of sinonasal mucormycosis managed in a tertiary care hospital in last 5years.
RESULTS: Diabetes was the commonest comorbidity among total of 52 cases. Disease extent-wise, 16, 23 and 13 patients had sino-nasal (SN), rhino-orbital (RO) and rhino-orbito-cerebral (ROC) mucormycosis respectively. Median cumulative Amphotericin-B administered was 3.5gms and 94.2% of cases underwent surgical debridement depending on the disease extent. With a median follow-up of 18months, 67% of the patients are alive and disease free, 2% are under treatment and 29% of patients have expired. The mortality rate was 12.5% in SN, 30.5% in RO and 38.5% in ROC mucormycosis. Palatal and orbital involvement is associated with statistically significant mortality risk at one month.
CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rate in sino-nasal mucormycosis can be significantly curtailed with prompt control of underlying comorbidity, aggressive medical and adequate surgical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The surgical skill practice in neurosurgery is being compromised in the recent past owing to the duty time constraint, patient safety concerns, and medico-legal issues. Surgical practice outside the operating room is essential to enhance a resident's operative skills and to gain confidence.
OBJECTIVE: To discuss the experience of establishing an 'in-house neurosurgery skills laboratory' and various training sessions conducted with cadaveric and non-cadaveric simulation modules.
METHODS: A skills laboratory was set up in the existing resident teaching hall with nine workstations. Each station has been equipped with an operating table, surgeon's chair, basic microscope, endoscope, high-speed drill system, and a suction machine. Vascular anastomosis, high-speed drilling, and basic neuroendoscopy were planned on low-cost non-cadaveric modules. Craniotomy and various surgical approaches were designed on cadaveric modules obtained from the anatomy department.
RESULT: A total of 18 residents in divided groups during their initial three semesters had participated in the non-cadaveric simulation courses. Twenty-six residents had participated and 12 sessions were conducted on the cadaveric modules. Three workshops were conducted and 20 residents and faculty members from five other institutions had participated in the cadaveric hands-on training session.
CONCLUSION: A well-equipped skills laboratory provides an opportunity for the residents to acquire operative expertise in a similar atmosphere to that of the operating theater. A structured program comprising various operative practice sessions should be incorporated into the resident training program.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal outcomes in acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) are related to time-bound management based upon early prediction of response to intravenous (IV) steroids. In an earlier study, we described the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) index (baseline Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity [UCEIS] ≥ 7 and day 3 fecal calprotectin [FCP] > 1000 μg/g) for predicting failure of IV steroids. The current study is designed to validate this index in a prospective cohort.
METHODS: IV steroid-naïve patients with ASUC, satisfying Truelove and Witts' criteria, hospitalized from August 2018 to July 2019 were included. Patients' assessment included baseline sigmoidoscopy, day 1 and 3 FCP, hemogram, biochemistry and day 3 C-reactive protein. All patients received IV steroids, and the primary outcome was steroid failure, defined as the need for colectomy or rescue therapy with cyclosporine (CYC)/infliximab (IFX) during admission.
RESULTS: Of the 47 patients, eight were excluded (four received steroids outside, two were directly taken for surgery/infliximab therapy, one had toxic megacolon, and one had infectious colitis), and 39 patients were included (mean age: 36.1 ± 12.6 years, male: 31%). Fifteen patients (38%) failed IV steroid and required rescue therapy (IFX: 9, CYC: 2, Colectomy: 3, IFX followed by colectomy: 1). On univariate analysis, UCEIS ≥ 7 at baseline (p = 0.006), day 1 FCP (p = 0.03), day 3 FCP > 1000 μg/g (p = 0.001), Oxford criteria (p = 0.04) and AIIMS index (p < 0.001) were significantly different between steroid responders and steroid failures. On multivariate analysis, day 3 FCP > 1000 μg/g (odds ratio (odds ratio (OR)= 6.4;(95% CI =2.2-196.1) and baseline UCEIS ≥ 7 (OR) = 10.1;(95% CI = 2.1-80.2) were independent predictors. The AIIMS index predicted steroid failure with a better specificity (100% vs. 83%, p = 0.04) and positive predictive value (100% vs. 64%, p = 0.03) than Oxford criteria.
CONCLUSION: AIIMS index has been validated in 39 prospective ASUC patients as an effective early predictor of steroid failure (sensitivity = 53%, specificity = 100%).

AB  - Fibrin is the fibrous protein network that comprises blood clots; it is uniquely capable of bearing very large tensile strains (up to 200%) due to multiscale force accommodation mechanisms. Fibrin is also a biochemical scaffold for numerous enzymes and blood factors. The biomechanics and biochemistry of fibrin have been independently studied. However, comparatively little is known about how fibrin biomechanics and biochemistry are coupled: how does fibrin deformation influence its biochemistry? In this study, we show that mechanically induced protein structural changes in fibrin affect fibrin biochemistry. We find that tensile deformation of fibrin leads to molecular structural transitions of α-helices to β-sheets, which reduced binding of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an enzyme that initiates fibrin lysis. Moreover, binding of tPA and Thioflavin T, a commonly used β-sheet marker, were mutually exclusive, further demonstrating the mechano-chemical control of fibrin biochemistry. Finally, we demonstrate that structural changes in fibrin suppressed the biological activity of platelets on mechanically strained fibrin due to reduced αIIbβ3 integrin binding. Our work shows that mechanical strain regulates fibrin molecular structure and biological activity in an elegant mechano-chemical feedback loop, which possibly extends to other fibrous biopolymers.

AB  - Spindle cell squamous cell carcinomas (SpSCC) are aggressive neoplasms constituting 1% of oral cavity tumors. A proportion of SpSCC do not stain with epithelial markers, and frequently express mesenchymal markers, viz. Vimentin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, S100 and desmin, confounding the diagnosis. Immunoexpression of SATB2, a transcription factor indicating osteoblastic lineage, has not been evaluated in SpSCC previously. We therefore performed SATB2 immunohistochemistry in 15 cases of SpSCCs and scored them with respect to intensity and percentage of tumor cells stained. SATB2 immunopositivity was identified in 9/15 (60%) SpSCCs, with varying intensity and distribution. Eight cases (53.3%) showed nonfocal staining of moderate to strong intensity, and 1 case (6.7%) showed focal weak staining. Of these, 3 cases (3/9; 33.33%) did not stain with epithelial/squamous markers. Thus, a subset of SpSCC demonstrate SATB2 immunopositivity. In oral tumors with bone involvement, SATB2 positivity may lead away from the diagnosis of SpSCC. Knowledge of this aberrant immunostaining is, therefore, extremely relevant to guard against misdiagnosis as osteosarcoma, particularly on biopsies which lack adjacent dysplastic epithelium, in cases which are monophasic spindle cell, and in those that do not show immunopositivity for epithelial/ squamous markers. Our results emphasize that an appropriate panel and not a single immunomarker is required to distinguish SpSCC from mesenchymal tumors including osteosarcoma.

AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a nosocomial infection contracted by ventilator patients in which bacteria colonize the upper digestive tract and contaminated secretions are released into the lower airway. This nosocomial infection increases the morbidity and mortality of the patients as well as the cost of treatment. Probiotic formulations have recently been proposed to prevent the colonization of these pathogenic bacteria. In this prospective observational study, we aimed to investigate the effects of probiotics on gut microbiota and their relation to clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated patients. For this study, 35 patients were recruited (22 probiotic-treated and 13 without probiotic treatment) from a cohort of 169 patients. Patients in the probiotic group were given a dose of 6 capsules of a commercially available probiotic (VSL#3®:112.5 billion CFU/cap) in three divided doses for 10 days. Sampling was carried out after each dose to monitor the temporal change in the gut microbiota composition. To profile the microbiota, we used a 16S rRNA metagenomic approach, and differences among the groups were computed using multivariate statistical analyses. Differences in gut microbial diversity (Bray Curtis and Jaccard distance, p-value > 0.05) between the probiotic-treated group and the control group were not observed. Furthermore, treatment with probiotics resulted in the enrichment of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus in the gut microbiota of the probiotic-treated groups. Our results demonstrated that probiotics might lead to favorable alterations in gut microbiome characteristics. Future studies should focus on the appropriate dosages and frequency of probiotics, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Information technology (IT) can be used by frontline health workers (FLWs) to connect and deliver care to the community. Various studies in India have assessed the beneficial impact of IT usage by FLWs, but for the long-term sustainability, the attitude and belief toward IT usage have not been adequately studied. We conducted this study to assess the knowledge and attitude and to explore the beliefs of FLWs toward the use of IT in a rural area of Haryana.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a mixed-method study (qualitative and quantitative approach) in a rural setting of Haryana, India. We included FLWs of two primary health centers (PHCs). Data were collected from October 19, 2020 to December 31, 2020. We collected data from 75 accredited social health activists (ASHAs), 37 Anganwadi workers (AWWs), 28 multi-purpose workers (MPWs), two information assistants, and two medical officers using a semi-structured interview schedule. Their knowledge about the benefits of IT use, past use of IT applications and devices, and self-rating of knowledge regarding computers or laptops were collected. We used 14 attitude statements, each with a five-point Likert scale to assess the attitude; a total score ≥35 was considered a positive attitude. We conducted eight focus group discussions (FGDs) to explore the beliefs regarding IT usage (four FGDs with ASHAs, two FGDs with AWWs, and two FGDs with MPWs). A descriptive analysis was performed for the quantitative data, and a thematic analysis was performed for qualitative data.
RESULTS: Knowledge about the benefits of IT use was present among 77.8% of FLWs. Among the FLWs, 79.2% self-rated their knowledge of computers/laptops as 'do not have knowledge', 16% self-rated as 'low knowledge', and 4.8% self-rated as 'good knowledge'. The median total score for attitude statements among all the FLWs (n = 144) was 54 [inter-quartile range - 48-59]. Four themes emerged for beliefs toward IT usage, namely, positive beliefs, negative beliefs, challenges anticipated in adopting IT use, and facilitation factors. The positive beliefs were related to improvement in work efficiency and social status, less paperwork, timely report generation, and better learning. The negative beliefs were related to an increase in working hours, close monitoring, and feeling over-burdened.
CONCLUSION: We found that FLWs had knowledge regarding the benefits of IT use, but they lacked knowledge regarding laptop/computer use. They had a satisfactory level of confidence in using smartphones, and most of them were using mobile applications. The majority of the FLWs had a positive attitude and beliefs toward IT use and wanted to use it in the future.

AB  - Peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) is an inflammatory, necrotic condition in the peripheral cornea which may end in corneal perforation and visual morbidity if not treated adequately. PUK can occur due to infectious or non-infectious causes. Early cases need medical therapy, both locally and systemically (for some cases). However, advanced PUK may necessitate surgical removal of inciting cause of the pathology and maintaining tectonic stability. Such surgical treatment, including corneal transplantations, may be used in an emergency setting or for visual rehabilitation following preliminary stabilization of the affected cornea. The outcome of these surgeries need to be analyzed to understand the long-term visual prognosis of such eyes. This is an attempt to analyze surgical modalities in the management of PUK and their outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The intramedullary route holds the potential to provide the most concentration of stem cells in cases of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the safety and feasibility of this route need to be studied in human subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramedullary injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in acute complete SCI.
METHODS: In this prospective study conducted over a 2-year period, 27 patients with acute (defined as within 1 week of injury) and complete SCI were randomized to receive BM-MSC or placebo through an intramedullary route intraoperatively at the time of spinal decompression and fusion. Institutional ethics approval was obtained, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Safety was assessed using laboratory and clinicoradiological parameters preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 180 patients were screened during the study period. Of these, 27 were enrolled in the study. Three patients withdrew, 3 patients were lost to follow-up, and 8 patients died, leaving a total of 13 patients for final analysis. Seven of these patients were in the stem cell group, and 6 were in the control group. Both groups were well matched in terms of sex, age, and weight. No adverse events related to stem cell injection were noted for laboratory and radiological parameters. Five patients in the control group and 3 patients in the stem cell group died during the follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: Intramedullary injection of BM-MSCs was found to be safe and feasible for use in patients with acute complete SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Selective spinal anesthesia has been safely applied for short-duration outpatient gynecological laparoscopic procedure. However, this anesthesia technique is often inadequate and not tolerated by awake patients due to pneumoperitoneum and visceral manipulation.
AIMS: We aimed to conduct a study to compare spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine, fentanyl, and i.v. sedation with i.v. sedation and laparoscopic port-site infiltration with local anaesthetic in outpatient laparoscopic tubal ligation procedures.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 100 female patients posted for elective surgeries were recruited for a prospective single blind randomised control trial in a tertiary care center in two groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Group S, patients receive intrathecal 3 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% plus 20 microgram fentanyl along with intravenous (i.v.) fentanyl at 1μg.kg-1.h-1 and in Group C i.v. fentanyl at 1μg.kg-1.h-1 along with laparoscopic port site infiltration with 0.5% bupivacaine. Postoperatively, overall patient satisfaction, visual analog score (VAS) score, duration of motor blockade, sensory blockade, and time to attain discharge criteria and any adverse.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Continuous variables between the groups were compared by the independent t-test and Wilcoxon rank sum. Chi-square and Fisher exact test used for the categorical value.
RESULTS: Overall VAS was significantly lower and patient satisfaction was higher in Group S than Group C. Time to oral intake was significantly prolonged in Group C 126.33 (±29.54) compared to group S 110.81 (±29.54). The requirement of total rescue analgesia (fentanyl) was significantly higher in Group C 2.0 (±0.6) μg.kg-1 compared to group S 0.79 (±0.53) μg.kg-1. Incidence of postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV) was significantly greater in Group C while incidence of pruritus was significantly greater in Group S.
CONCLUSION: Low-dose intrathecal anesthesia with 3 mg bupivacaine and 20 μg fentanyl provided better analgesia, patient satisfaction and with less opioids consumption.

AB  - Severe anemia is a high-risk factor in pregnancy and needs to be treated appropriately to prevent poor maternal and fetal outcomes. A pregnant woman with severe anemia reluctant for blood transfusion due to issues of accessibility was given four doses of 300 mg intravenous iron sucrose (IVIS) in 300 ml normal saline starting at 31 weeks 5 days of gestation and her hemoglobin level increased by 4.2 gm/dl over a period of five weeks without any complications and without any intake of iron and folic acid tablets during the entire duration. Intravenous iron sucrose is a useful intervention for severe anemia of pregnancy even in late pregnancy with rapid increase in haemoglobin levels and can be used regularly for treating severe anemia in pregnant women alternative to blood transfusion who have limited accessibility to blood transfusion facilities.

T2  - Trauma, Violence & Abuse
AB  - Psychological traumatic life events (TLEs) and resilience, both are multidimensional, complex, and share salient features. Both are products of individual, familial, and environmental (socio-cultural-political contextual) variables, which is very crucial in children and adolescents. This systematic review used Boolean search strategies in electronic databases, namely, PubMED, PsycNET, JStor, and Google scholar. All researches not studying resilience per se but similar or related constructs such as life strengths, hardiness, protective/risk factors, social support, self-efficacy, social-emotional adjustment, and so on were excluded. A total of 12 resilience tools meant for children between 5 and 18 years were reviewed. The scale characteristics were analyzed in terms of targeted age-group of sample; purpose (i.e. screening and profiling for intervention); number of items; purpose/type of scale; year, country, and domain wise distribution; response format, standardization sample profile; psychometric properties; and availability of manual with norms of cutoff score. Although no scale was originally developed for children and adolescent population with history of TLEs particularly various forms of abuse and trauma, Child and Youth Resilience Measure and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale had small samples of children from welfare homes. Neither did any scale tested the divergent validity against absence of any psychopathology or global functioning or poor quality of life Nor did Majority of scales provide a cutoff value for institutionalized children and adolescents with history of TLEs; therefore, using an existing scale for this purpose should be carefully examined. Trauma-focused multidimensionality in resilience needs to be explored more rigorously through mixed methods.

AB  - Renal transplant (RT) is the preferred treatment modality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, it is associated with a significant rate of complications. Early diagnosis and management of these complications are essential to prevent graft loss. Herein, we describe a case of a 48-year-old male who developed ESRD due to underlying autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease and underwent an RT. A routine renal dynamic scintigraphy (RDS) performed on day 4 posttransplant showed a focal minute area of radiotracer accumulation on the delayed static images raising suspicion for urinoma. However, it was deemed normal considering the normal renogram curve and stable clinical condition of the patient. However, on day 9 posttransplant, in view of clinical deterioration marked by decreasing urine output and rising serum creatinine levels, ultrasonography - kidney, ureter, and bladder (USG-KUB) and a repeat RDS were performed. Although the USG-KUB described a peri-nephric fluid collection, the nature of the collection could not be determined. RDS confirmed that the collection was urinoma. On retrospective analysis, the focal area of increased radiotracer uptake corresponded to the site of initial suspicion, although there was an increase in the size of the same. In experienced hands, RDS thus proves to be a highly sensitive tool for the diagnosis of urinoma, much before the clinical complications set in.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Laparoscopic trans abdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair of hernia is one of the most commonly performed surgeries and may cause significant postoperative pain. Among different truncal block techniques, quadratus lumborum (QL) and transversus abdominis plane blocks (TAP) are used during this abdominal surgery. We aimed to investigate whether, bilateral QL block by trans-muscular approach provided better analgesia as compared to posterior TAP block in these patients.
METHODS: Forty adult patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, undergoing inguinal hernia repair were randomized to receive either QL or TAP block, with 20 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine bilaterally. The primary objective of the study was to compare the total fentanyl consumption (in μg) within 24 hours postoperatively. The secondary objectives studied were dermatomal spread, quality of recovery at discharge and at 3 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in total 24-hour fentanyl consumption (552 ± 229.56 vs 735.5 ± 264 μg, P =0.01) in the QL group, with longer duration of analgesia [282.5 ± 89.9 min group TAP vs. 354.8 ± 107 min QL, (mean difference -72.34,95% confidence interval -135.516 to -9.024), P =0.03], as compared to TAP group. At T8 and T9 dermatomes, greater proportion of patients in the QL group attained analgesia. Quality of Recovery at 24 hours and at 3 months of follow-up were comparable.
CONCLUSION: QL block provided better perioperative analgesia than TAP block, in patients undergoing laparoscopic hernia repair. It also leads to greater dermatomal spread but without any decrease in the incidence of chronic pain at 3 months postoperatively.
