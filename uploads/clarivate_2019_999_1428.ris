AB  - Context: Patients with hypoparathyroidism are treated with vitamin D and calcium. PTH is an emerging option because of its physiological action. It is important to assess the efficacy and shortcomings of conventional therapy.
   Objective: We assessed the efficacy and safety of alfacalcidol in a large cohort of patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) and identified a subset who could be treated without oral calcium.
   Design and Setting: Observational study at tertiary care center.
   Subjects and Methods We assessed 92 patients with IH who were receiving alfacalcidol and oral calcium to maintain an optimal serum total calcium level of 8.0 to 8.5 mg/dL during routine follow-up. Patients with suboptimal control were provided free medicines and followed up frequently. Oral calcium and alfacalcidol doses were titrated sequentially to determine the minimum doses for optimal calcium control. Serum phosphate level, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEPh), and hypercalciuria (urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, >0.2) were assessed at each step of titration.
   Results: Only 38% of patients had optimal calcium control during routine follow-up. With good compliance, all achieved optimal serum calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and 43% of patients could stop taking oral calcium. Hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and low FEPh persisted at all stages of therapy. Serum phosphorus levels normalized when the serum calcium level increased to 9.9 mg/dL, but this level of serum total calcium was associated with hypercalciuria in 90% of patients.
   Conclusion: Alfacalcidol is effective in achieving calcemic control in IH. Calcemic control without oral calcium was achieved in 43% of patients receiving alfacalcidol. However, optimal calcium control was associated with hyperphosphatemia and hypercalciuria in most patients.

AB  - Introduction: p38 MAPK signaling molecules plays a dual role in cancer, both progression and suppression. Elevated expression of p38 alpha was reported in lung cancer tissue in rat model. Our objective was to explore the concentration of all 4 isoforms of p38MAPK in serum of Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
   Material and methods: The blood samples were collected from 77 NSCLC patients, 52 ethically matched healthy controls and 18 follow up patients were collected as some patients expired and some discontinued the treatment. The concentration of all isoforms of p38 (p38 alpha, p38 beta, p38 gamma, and p38 delta) were evaluated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) technology.
   Result: The levels of all isoforms of serum p38 were significantly elevated at pre-therapy compare to control. Only p38 alpha expression was significantly associated with tumor stage and its expression reduced after treatment which is then validated by western blot. However, no changes were observed in other isoforms after therapy.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed that, p38 alpha is more efficient among all the isoform to predict the disease accurately and it can be concluded that p38 MAPK may be used as diagnostic as well as prognostic marker of NSCLC disease.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the effect of structured training on resident performance in improving medication fallacies during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
   Methods: This before-and-after study was conducted in the pediatric acute care areas of tertiary care teaching hospitals of a developing country from August to December 2015. Case records of children younger than 18 years who underwent CPR were reviewed. Senior residents rotating through pediatric emergency department and pediatric intensive care unit were evaluated for their knowledge. Incidence of medication fallacies in pediatric CPR and change in the knowledge scores of residents posted in these areas were the main outcome measures.
   Results: One-hundred records were evaluated (pre-intervention, 54; post-intervention, 46). In the pre-intervention period, 25 had medication fallacies (documentation, 16; dosing, 9). In the post-intervention period, 7 fallacies pertaining to documentation (not dosing) were found. The incidence of severe fallacies decreased from 20% pretraining to 0% posttraining. The mean (SD) knowledge scores of residents increased from 7.9 (2.9) pretraining to 13 (1.4) posttraining. On univariate analysis, fallacies were found to be less if the resident was formally trained (pediatric advanced life support certified), if the patient was older, and during morning and night shifts as compared with evening shift. On multivariate analysis, however, only status of training (posttraining) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.68) and the morning shift (adjusted odds ratio, 0.03; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.72) remained significant with lower incidence of fallacies associated with these variables.
   Conclusions: Rates of medication fallacies in pediatric CPR declined with structured training. Documentation fallacies may not be eliminated completely with only 1-time training.

AB  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) belongs to a group of prion disease that is caused by abnormally folded proteins and is clinically characterized by rapidly progressive cognitive decline, gait abnormalities, and myoclonus. Familial CJD is very rare and is described only in few families around the world. We report a case with rapidly progressive cognitive decline, ataxia, and myoclonus, with a history of several members of his family developing similar symptoms and succumbing to it. Clinical presentation and neuroimaging were suggestive of CJD. On genetic analysis, our index case and two of his family members (younger brother and younger son) were found to have D178N mutation in PRNP gene. The polymorphism of the 129th amino acid was V/V. We report the first kindred familial CJD from South-East Asia with genetically proven D178N-129V haplotype.

AB  - Background: Philadelphia chromosome (Ph): Hallmark of CML is caused by reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 resulting in BCR-ABL fusion protein. Most commonly associated breakpoint with CML is M-bcr in exon 13 or exon 14, producing splice variant b2a2 or b3a2 respectively. The distribution of these transcripts and their influence on clinico-hematological parameters is variable. Impact of the fusion transcripts on treatment outcome in Imatinib treated CML patients is still a matter of debate. Aims/settings and design: We conducted this study on 400 CML-CP patients to look for the distribution of fusion transcripts i.e. b3a2 and b2a2, their clinico-hematological profile and impact on treatment response in patients treated with Imatinib. Material and Methods: CML-CP was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) for the BCR-ABL fusion transcript. Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was performed on peripheral blood every 3-6 monthly to look for treatment response. Results: The overall frequency of b3a2 transcript was observed in 288 (72%) followed by b2a2 in 104 (26%) and hybrid fusion transcript (b3a2 + b2a2) was seen in 8 (2%) cases. MMR was attained in 198/288 (68.7%) patients with b3a2 transcript and 90/288 (31.3%) patients failed to achieve MMR after 12 months of Imatinib therapy. Among the patients with b2a2 transcript, 44/104 (42.3%) patients achieved MMR and 60/104 (57.7%) patients failed to achieve MMR after 12 months of Imatinib therapy. Conclusions: In conclusion, the frequency of b3a2 transcript was more as compared to b2a2 transcript. MMR was significantly higher in patients with b3a2 transcript as compared to patients with b2a2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The recommended technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer is a combination of blue dye and radiotracer. In the Indian scenario, SLNB is still not routinely practiced due to lack of nuclear medicine facilities and unavailability of isosulfan blue or patent blue violet (PBV). This study was conducted for optimizing SLN identification techniques by comparing the identification rate using PBV and methylene blue (MB) in combination with radiotracer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Single-blinded two-arm parallel design randomized control trial was conducted at an apex teaching and research medical institute in India. Patients with axillary LNunegative breast cancer were included. Blue dye and radio tracer were injected preoperatively, and SLNB was performed using a combination technique. Frozen section was performed. Demographic, clinical, radiological, operative, and histopathological data were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to represent patient characteristics. Baseline characteristics for entire cohort and between groups were compared using Student's t-test for quantitative variables and Chi-square test for qualitative variables. RESULTS: A total of 119 patients were randomized for mapping with MB and 118 patients with PBV between 2011 and 2015. SLN was identified in 116 patients with MB and 115 with PBV. SLN identification proportions were 97.4% (MB) and 96.6% (PBV). In patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection, concordance with SLNB was 98.5% and 96.61% in MB and PBV, respectively. False-negative proportion for MB was 2.56% and 7.69% for PBV, respectively. The cost of MB is about INR 15 per 10-mL vial. The cost of PBV is approximately $91 per ampoule (equivalent to approximately INR 8190). CONCLUSION: SLNB using MB can be recommended as the technique of choice in low-resource settings.

AB  - Objective To develop and validate birthweight prediction models using fetal fractional thigh volume (TVol) in an Indian population, comparing them with existing prediction models developed for other ethnicities. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted among 131 pregnant women (>36 weeks) attending a tertiary hospital in New Delhi, India, for prenatal care between December 1, 2014, and November 1, 2016. Participants were randomly divided into formulating (n=100) and validation (n=31) groups. Multiple regression analysis was performed to generate four models to predict birthweight using various combinations of two-dimensional (2D) ultrasonographic parameters and a three-dimensional (3D) ultrasonographic parameter (TVol). The best fit model was compared with previously published 2D and 3D models. Results The best fit model comprised biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and TVol. This model had the lowest mean percentage error (0.624 +/- 8.075) and the highest coefficient of determination (R-2=0.660). It correctly predicted 70.2% and 91.6% of birthweights within 5% and 10% of actual weight, respectively. Compared with previous models, attributability for the 2D and 3D models was 0.65 and 0.55, respectively. Accuracy was -0.05 +/- 1.007 and -2.54 +/- 1.11, respectively. Conclusion Models that included TVol provided good prediction of birthweight in the target population.

AB  - Hearing loss and cognitive decline are commonly associated with aging and morbidity. Present clinical interest lies in whether peripheral hearing loss promotes cognitive decline and if prophylaxis with selective adenosine receptor agonist CGS21680 effectively mitigates the adverse effects. In the current study, male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 200-250 g m were randomly allocated into three groups: Group 1) rats exposed to 100 dB SPL white noise, 2 h a day for 15 consecutive days, 2) rats supplemented with an adenosine receptor agonist, CGS21680 at 100 mu g/kg/day prior to noise exposure and 3) unexposed control rats. Baseline hearing and cognition assessed by auditory brainstem response (ABR) and water maze respectively was undertaken for all the groups. Phalloidin stain and synaptic ribbons count in cochlea, and, Ki67, DCX and NeuN in hippocampus were observed by immunohistochemistry. It was inferred that noise exposed rats showed elevated thresholds of ABR and poorer performances in spatial working memory when compared with controls. On the contrary, CGS21680 administered group exhibited improved ABR and cognitive functions with shorter mean latency and path-length to reach the platform, significant reduction in the noise induced loss of synaptic ribbons count and increased number of Ki67 and doublecortin (DCX) positive cells compared to their noise exposed counterparts. Pharmacologic intervention with selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 provided adequate protection from noise by effectively maintaining hearing threshold levels, cell viability in cochlea and hippocampus & functional/intact reference memory.

AB  - PurposeTo evaluate the long-term course of primary angle-closure ocular hypertension and primary open-angle ocular hypertension and possible risk factors for progression to glaucoma.MethodsA total of 109 eyes of 109 ocular hypertension (OHT) patients with a minimum follow-up period of 5years having complete ocular/medical records were evaluated. They were classified into primary angle closure or primary open angle based on gonioscopy at baseline. Baseline and review data of Humphrey field analyser, HFA, and Heidelberg retinal tomography, HRT, were recorded. Guided progression analysis (GPA) and univariate Cox regression were used for time to event analysis in identifying progression to glaucoma.ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 12.184.8years, progression to glaucoma was 17.43% (19 eyes), out of whom 5.5% (6 eyes) showed3 loci on GPA. Sub-classifying them, progression to primary angle-closure glaucoma was 19.72%, and that of primary open-angle glaucoma was 13.16%. The mean time to progression was 9.34 +/- 3.6years. Significant risk factors included small disc area (1.99 sq.mm on HRT), requirement of2 drugs to maintain target IOP and those engaged in activities yielding a Valsalva effect in daily life. Coronary artery disease (CAD) and systemic use of steroids were associated with increased severity.Conclusion p id=Par4 Overall progression of OHT to glaucoma was 17.43% over a mean of 9years, with target IOP of18mm Hg. Patients with smaller discs, CAD, exercising Valsalva type activities and using2 glaucoma medications or systemic steroids should be closely monitored.

AB  - Background: Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) measured the global prevalence of symptoms of asthma in children. We undertook comprehensive analyses addressing risk factors for asthma symptoms in combination, at both the individual and the school level, to explore the potential role of reverse causation due to selective avoidance or confounding by indication.
   Objective: To explore the role of reverse causation in risk factors of asthma symptoms.
   Methods: We compared two sets of multilevel logistic regression analyses, using (a) individual level exposure data and (b) school level average exposure (ie prevalence), in two different age groups. In individual level analyses, reverse causation is a possible concern if individual level exposure statuses were changed as a result of asthma symptoms or diagnosis. School level analyses may suffer from ecologic confounding, but reverse causation is less of a concern because individual changes in exposure status as a result of asthma symptoms would only have a small effect on overall school exposure levels.
   Results: There were 131 924 children aged 6-7 years (2428 schools, 25 countries) with complete exposure, outcome and confounder data. The strongest associations in individual level analyses (fully adjusted) were for current paracetamol use (odds ratio = 2.06; 95% confidence interval 1.97-2.16), early life antibiotic use (1.65; 1.58-1.73) and open fire cooking (1.44; 1.26-1.65). In school level analyses, these risk factors again showed increased risks.
   There were 238 586 adolescents aged 13-14 years (2072 schools, 42 countries) with complete exposure, outcome and confounder data. The strongest associations in individual level analyses (fully adjusted) were for current paracetamol use (1.80; 1.75-1.86), cooking on an open fire (1.32; 1.22-1.43) and maternal tobacco use (1.23; 1.18-1.27). In school level analyses, these risk factors again showed increased risks.
   Conclusions & clinical relevance: These analyses strengthen the potentially causal interpretation of previously reported individual level findings, by providing evidence against reverse causation.

AB  - Background Although sevoflurane is preferred for inhalational induction in children, financial and environmental costs remain major limitations. The aim of this study was to determine if the use of low-fresh gas flow during inhalational induction with sevoflurane could significantly reduce agent consumption, without adversely affecting induction conditions. Methods After institutional ethical committee approval, 50 children, aged 1-5 years, undergoing ophthalmic procedures under general anesthesia, were randomized into two groups-standard induction (Group S) and low-flow induction (Group L). A pediatric circle system with 1 L reservoir bag was primed with 8% sevoflurane in oxygen at 6 L min(-1) for 30 seconds before beginning induction. In Group S, fresh gas flow was maintained at 6 L min(-1) until the end of induction. In Group L, fresh gas flow was reduced to 1 L min(-1) after applying facemask (time = T0). In both groups, sevoflurane was reduced to 5% after loss of eyelash reflex (T1). Once adequate depth of anesthesia was achieved (regular respiration, loss of muscle tone, and absence of movement to trapezius squeeze), intravenous access was secured (T2), followed by insertion of an appropriately sized LMA-Classic (TM) (T3). Heart rate and endtidal sevoflurane concentration were measured at each of the above time points, and at 15 seconds following laryngeal mask airway insertion (T4). The total amount of sevoflurane consumed during induction was recorded. Results Sevoflurane consumption was significantly lower in Group L (4.17 +/- 0.70 mL) compared to Group S (8.96 +/- 1.11 mL) (mean difference 4.79 [95% CI = 4.25-5.33] mL; P < 0.001). Time to successful laryngeal mask airway insertion was similar in both groups. There were no significant differences in heart rate, incidence of reflex tachycardia, or need for rescue propofol. Conclusion Induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane using low-fresh gas flow is effective in reducing sevoflurane consumption, without compromising induction time and conditions.

AB  - The stapes surgery has evolved through different eras of technical and technological development. The current standard of care is creating a stapedotomy with piston placement, and both these aspects have multiple variations and show well-established technological advances. The conventional technique has been fairly standardized, and it offers gratifying results to both the surgeon and the patient. To overcome certain procedural risks and potential complications, the reversal of steps technique was developed and streamlined by Ugo Fisch in the early 1980s. Since its beginning, the technique has been adopted by various centers, and surgical outcomes have been demonstrated to be at par with the conventional technique, with a reduced risk of complications. The aim of the present review is to detail the various surgical nuances and outcomes of this particular technique in a comprehensive narrative manner.

AB  - This work discusses the biomechanical testing of 3 elbow bones, namely the humerus, ulna, and radius. There is a need to identify the mechanical properties of the bones at the organ level. The following tests were performed: 3-point bending, fracture toughness, and axial compression. Six sets of whole-bone samples of human male cadaveric humerus, ulna, and radius (age of donor: 35 to 56 years) were tested. The results were analyzed for statistical significance by 2-stage, repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA). The difference between the bending strength of the humerus, ulna, and radius was statistically significant (P = .001) when compared to one another. However, the fracture toughness and compressive strength were observed to be similar for the 3 bones. The knowledge of mechanical properties of elbow bones can aid in the design of elbow implants and upper limb protection systems, and also allow us to identify criteria for injury. Further, knowledge of the mechanical properties of the elbow bones can aid in calibrating simulations through finite elements analysis.

AB  - Alteration in mitochondrial DNA plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer. The Displacement Loop (D-loop) region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the regulatory region for its replication and transcription. Therefore, we aimed to characterize mutations in the D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA along with the morphological changes and analyzed their impact on survival in retinoblastoma patients. mtDNA D-loop region was amplified by Nested-Polymerase Chain Reaction (Nested-PCR) and mutations were analyzed in 60 tumor samples from retinoblastoma patients by DNA sequencing. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on 5 retinoblastoma specimens. Mutations were correlated with clinical, histopathological parameters and patient survival. D-loop mutations were found in total of 52/60 (86.6%) patients. The most common mutations were T to C and C to T followed by A to G. There were 5.81% mutations which were not previously reported in the MITOMAP database. A73G (83.33%) were the most frequent mutations found in our cases and it was statistically significant with poor tumor differentiation and age. In addition, this study was further analyzed for morphological changes in retinoblastoma that had disorganized, swollen and less numbers of mitochondria on electron microscopy. This is the first study showing high frequency of mtDNA mutation which might be due to abnormal morphology of mitochondria in retinoblastoma. Our results indicate that pathogenic mtDNA D-loop mutations may be involved in tumorigenesis of retinoblastoma tumor.

AB  - A case of granulomatous hepatitis due to Nocardia is reported here. The case patient was a 63-year-old immunocompetent man who presented with persistent fever, weight loss, and malaise. Radiology suggested an enlarged liver with dense diffuse to multiple tiny micronodular areas of parenchymal involvement, possibly granulomatous. Liver biopsy showed necrotizing granulomas and anti-tuberculosis therapy was initiated, but the patient showed no improvement. A repeat liver biopsy showed similar histopathology; however PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was negative, while MGIT 960 culture grew filamentous Gram-positive bacilli, acid-fast by 1% H2SO4, identified biochemically as Nocardia spp. 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed Nocardia spp. A diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis due to Nocardia spp. was made. Treatment based on drug sensitivity testing was initiated, resulting in a resolution of symptoms. The patient's history revealed that stray dogs adopted by his family had skin lesions, likely canine distemper (two newborn puppies had died recently). Nocardia is known to co-infect animals with distemper. This could have been the possible source of a zoonotic infection to the case patient. Nocardia spp. are seldom reported from sites other than the lungs, skin, or brain; the current case highlights the involvement of the liver. Due to the granulomatous tissue response, it could represent a differential diagnosis of tuberculosis in such cases.

TI  - Clinical presentation and management of corneal fistula
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - Purpose To describe the clinical features and management of corneal fistula in patients of healed keratitis.
   Methods Medical records of all patients of healed keratitis presenting to the cornea clinic from November 2016 to September 2017 were reviewed. Eightcases of corneal fistula (six true fistulas, two closed fistulas) were identified. Six patients were managed with autologous tenon patch graft while two patients were managed medically. Various risk factors and treatment outcomes of corneal fistulisation were evaluated.
   Results The patients included two patients of failed therapeutic keratoplasty (with resolved graft infection) and six patients of healed keratitis. The age of the patients ranged between 10 and 60 years. Five of the patients were male while three were female. The size of the fistula measured between 1 and 2 mm. A surrounding cystic area of diameter ranging between 1 and 4.5 mm was seen in all the patients. In all of the patients, the treating physician missed the diagnosis. Complete healing was noted at 6-8 weeks in all the patients who underwent tenon graft. One patient refused to undergo any surgery and was lost to follow-up. In another case, surgery was deferred due to uncontrolled hypertension and he developed anterior staphyloma subsequently.
   Conclusion Corneal fistula can often be missed in an apparently healed perforated corneal ulcer. Tenon patch graft is an effective technique for the management of corneal fistula.

AB  - Introduction The data on the role of OAGB in super obese patients and its direct comparison with LSG in super obese patients is scarce.
   Objectives To compare weight loss, impact on comorbidities and nutritional parameters between LSG and OAGB in super obese patients.
   Methods Prospectively collected data of 75 matched patients with BMI > 50, who underwent either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), was analyzed retrospectively. Percentage excess weight loss at 1 year and impact on comorbidities were compared in both the groups.
   Results Both the groups were comparable for age, sex, BMI, and presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. Mean TWL% +/- 2SD at 1 year was 30.09% +/- 19.76 in patients undergoing LSG, while it was 39.9% +/- 12.78 in patients undergoing OAGB (p < 0.001). In the LSG group, 85.7% and 66.67% of patients had remission of diabetes mellitus and hypertension, respectively, as compared to 77.77% and 78.5%, respectively, in the OAGB group. All the patients with OSA had a resolution of their symptoms in both the groups. Patients in the OAGB group became more folate deficient despite regular supplementation.
   Conclusion Weight loss following OAGB was found to be better than LSG in the super obese patients in our study. There was a similar resolution of comorbidities and a lesser rate of major complications in the OAGB group.

AB  - Purpose. The public health burden of infections caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is magnified due to high rates of resistance to traditional antimicrobials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro efficacy of an alternative dual therapy comprising gentamicin and azithromycin.
   Methodology. The E-test method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of gentamicin and azithromycin individually prior to testing in combination using the cross or 90 degrees angle formation method. A total of 70 clinical isolates of N. gonorrhoeae displaying varying ceftriaxone MICs along with 2 reference strains (WHO K and P) and 1 ceftriaxone-resistant QA isolate were examined. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was calculated and the results were interpreted using the following criteria: synergy, FICI <= 0.5; indifference or additive, FICI >0.5 to <= 4.0; and antagonism, FICI >4.0.
   Results. A total of 54 (77.1 %) isolates displayed indifference, while 16 (22.(%) demonstrated synergy. When azithromycin was tested alone, the MICs ranged from 0.016 to 2 mu g ml(-1). However, in combination with gentamicin, the mean MIC value of all isolates decreased from 0.275 mu g ml(-1) to 0.090 mu g ml(-1) (P=0.05). When gentamicin was tested alone, the MICs ranged from 0.25 to 8 mu g ml(-1), with a mean MIC of 4.342 mu g ml(-1), whereas in combination with azithromycin it decreased significantly to 2.042 mu g ml(-1) (P=0.04).
   Conclusion. No antagonism was observed in this combination, suggesting that it could be a future treatment option as we prepare for a post-cephalosporin era. However, comprehensive in vivo evaluations are warranted and recommendations should be made based on clinical trials.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health care burden associated with significant morbidity and serious impact on the quality of life. Estimating blood glucose levels is the currently employed method for screening for DM. Due to the invasive nature of access to blood glucose; new methods are being suggested that depend upon different targets than blood or another biochemical pathway altogether. But these are not cost effective and have inherent limitations related to public screening. We hypothesize a simple, non invasive and cheap paper strip method to estimate tear film glucose levels for screening purposes at community level. We also discuss the ideal properties of such a paper strip and the process of validation the technique should undergo before being employed for mass usage.

AB  - Background Physical therapist intervention can play a significant role in the prevention of mechanical and infectious complications in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) who are mechanically ventilated.
   Objective The objective of this study was to observe and compare the effects of manual and mechanical airway clearance techniques on intracranial pressure (ICP) and hemodynamics in patients with severe TBI.
   Design The design was a prospective, randomized, crossover trial.
   Setting The setting was a neurointensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center.
   Patients Forty-six adult patients aged 18 to 75 years, of either sex, with severe TBI, receiving mechanical ventilatory support with continuous ICP monitoring, and undergoing regular airway clearance techniques participated in this study.
   Intervention Two techniques were performed by a single trained physical therapist. Treatment A was a manual chest percussion technique and treatment B used a mechanical chest wall vibrator. Each treatment was applied for 10 minutes alternately, separated by an interval of 4 hours.
   Measurements ICP was measured from the start of intervention to 10 minutes postintervention. Secondary measurements included cerebral perfusion pressure, heart rate, mean arterial pressure (each from the start of the intervention until 10 minutes postintervention at 1-minute intervals), and arterial blood gas parameters (from just before the start of the intervention and 10 minutes postintervention).
   Results The increases in mean (95% CI) intracranial pressure of 2.4 (1.4-3.4) and 1.0 (0.2-1.8) mmHg, during and after the intervention with treatment A, respectively, were statistically significantly higher than for treatment B, irrespective of sequence. In contrast, a mean heart rate rise of 6.4 (3.3-9.5) beats/min and mean arterial pressure rise of 5.3 (2.0-8.6) mmHg were significantly higher only during the intervention phase of treatment A compared with treatment B. Peak mean values of ICP, heart rate, and arterial pressure were also significantly higher during treatment A. However, mean values of cerebral perfusion pressure or its degree of change were statistically comparable in both treatment groups.
   Limitations Patients with high baseline ICP values (>20 mmHg) were excluded, and, because of the crossover design, the effect of individual technique on final (long-term) neurological or respiratory outcomes could not be studied.
   Conclusion Manual chest percussion technique in patients with severe TBI was associated with statistically significant transient increases in ICP and hemodynamics, compared with the mechanical method. However, such transient increases in ICP by either technique were not clinically relevant in patients with moderate-to-severe TBI without intracranial hypertension on a mechanical ventilator.

AB  - Labile plasma iron (LPI) levels are proposed as marker of iron overload in thalassemia patients and are also known to be the earliest parameter to indicate efficacy of chelation therapy. It was a prospective study in 35 patients of thalassemia major. Patients were recruited in two groups-group A (n=13) patients not on chelation therapy and group B (n=22) patients who were on regular oral chelation therapy. Ten age and gender matched healthy controls were also studied. For all patients, ferritin levels and LPI levels were measured at baseline, 6months and 12months. For group B patients paired samples for LPI were taken (before and 2h after chelator). LPI levels were found to be significantly higher in group B patients versus group A patients versus normal healthy controls at all time-points. (P value-<0.0001, 0.001) In group A, both LPI levels and ferritin levels follow an upward trend and correlated well with each other (P value-<0.0001). In group B, the serum ferritin trend was not significant over follow up period of 1year (P value 0.16), however LPI levels showed a significant decreasing trend on continued chelation (P value 0.0347) In patients on chelation therapy, the immediate change (2h) in LPI levels on administration of chelators was not found to be significant (P value 0.22). LPI assay appears potentially attractive alternate to serum ferritin and can serve to monitor the trend of iron overload during long-term follow up.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine an appropriate cut-off of capillary Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for congenital hypothyroidism.Study designCross-sectional.Participants174,000 neonates born in different hospitals of Delhi, India, from November 2014 to October 2016.Main outcome measuresCorrelation between initial and repeat capillary TSH level and subsequent venous free thyroxine (fT4) level.Results102 newborns with initial/repeat capillary TSH level of 20 mIU/L (n=174) were confirmed to have congenital hypothyroidism at mean (SD) age of 5 (4) days. A good correlation between capillary TSH level and confirmatory venous fT4 level and postnatal age of sampling was obtained (r -0.6, -0.4). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95%CI 0.75 to 0.88), indicating referral capillary TSH level of 20 mIU/L to be a good predictor of subsequent high venous TSH level.ConclusionA cut off of 20 mIU/L for capillary TSH screening beyond 24 hours of life is optimal in the Indian setting for deciding further recall and workup, keeping a balance between sensitivity and recall rate.

   IgA nephropathy(IgAN) is a common glomerular disease with a higher risk of progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in certain ethnic populations. Since galactose deficient IgA1(Gd-IgA1) is a critical molecule in its pathogenesis, it has generated interest as a biomarker for this disease.
   Methods
   We measured serum Gd-IgA1 levels using a non-lectin based enzyme linked immunoassay (ELISA) in 136 immunosuppression naive patients with primary IgAN and 110 controls(60non IgA glomerular diseases, 50-healthy volunteers).
   Results
   Median serum Gd-IgA1 levels were significantly higher in IgAN patients [13135.6(2723.3, 59603.8) ng/ml] compared to those with non IgA glomerular disease [4954.8(892.9,18256.2) ng/ml] and healthy controls [6299.5(1993.2,19256) ng/ml] and this was observed even after log transformation and adjustment for age and gender(p<0.0001). Considering a cut-off value of serum Gd-IGA1 >= 7982.1ng/ml, the sensitivity for diagnosing IgAN compared to healthy controls was 74.3% and specificity was 72.0% with a positive predictive value of 87.8% and negative predictive value of 50.7%. The serum Gd-IgA1 level did not co-relate with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, urine protein creatinine ratio and the M, E, S, T and C scores on renal biopsy. The renal survival (absence of >30% decrease in eGFR, ESRD or death) was lower in patients with higher serum Gd-IgA1 levels(>= 7982ng/ml) than those who had lower levels but it was not statistically significant(p = 0.486).
   Conclusion
   Serum Gd-IgA1 level is higher in IgAN patients compared to non-IgA glomerular diseases and healthy controls and has a good positive predictive value for diagnosis. However, it does not correlate with clinical and histological characteristics of disease severity and does not predict disease progression.

AB  - A study to compare biogas production potentials of wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse and pressmud was conducted at pH 8.0, temperature 40 degrees C and substrate concentration 20 g/L. Raw substrates were thermogravimetrically and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopically characterised. TGA showed the weight loss of samples attributable to moisture, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin losses. FTIR analysis indicated functional groups characteristics of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Biogas production was the maximum between 10th and 25th day for all the tests. WS with 10% inoculum showed the highest cumulative biogas production of 370 mL/g followed by the SB (316 mL/g) and PM (211 mL/g) counterparts. The corresponding values with 5% inoculum were 303 mL/g (WS), 244 mL/g (SB) and 152 mL/g (PM). The inoculum volume also positively affected the cumulative biogas production (22.1, 29.5 and 38.8% respectively). The higher volatile fatty acids as observed in case of WS which further facilitated higher biogas production could be due to its maximum volatile solids content (88.9%) and water swelling capacity (7.37). A consistently increasing trend in the methane content (varying between 54 and 61%) in all the tests was observed till the 20th day. The biogas (7.7-21.7 mL/g) and the methane (35-42%) contents showed a decreasing trend thereafter, the lowest being observed during the 35-40-day period.

TI  - A nanogel based oral gene delivery system targeting SUMOylation machinery to combat gut inflammation
T2  - NANOSCALE
KW  - BOWEL-DISEASE
AB  - Poor success rates and challenges associated with the current therapeutic strategies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have accelerated the emergence of gene therapy as an alternative treatment option with great promise. However, oral delivery of nucleic acids (NAs) to an inflamed colon is challenged by multiple barriers presented by the gastrointestinal, extracellular and intracellular compartments. Therefore, we screened a series of polyaspartic acid-derived amphiphilic cationic polymers with varied hydrophobicity for their ability to deliver NAs into mammalian cells. Using the most effective TAC6 polymer, we then engineered biocompatible and stable nanogels composed of polyplexes (TAC6, NA) and an anionic polymer, sodium polyaspartate, that were able to deliver the NAs across mammalian cells using caveolae-mediated cellular uptake. We then utilized these nanogels for oral delivery of PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1), a SUMO 3 ligase, encoding plasmid DNA since PIAS1 is a key nodal therapeutic target for IBD due to its ability to control NF-kappa B-mediated inflammatory signaling. We show that plasmid delivery using TAC6-derived nanogels diminished gut inflammation in a murine colitis model. Therefore, our study presents engineering of orally deliverable nanogels that can target SUMOylation machinery to combat gut inflammation with very high efficacy.

AB  - While children approaching end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are considered at risk of uremic anorexia and underweight they are also exposed to the global obesity epidemic. We sought to investigate the variation of nutritional status in children undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) around the globe. The distribution and course of body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score over time was examined prospectively in 1001 children and adolescents from 35 countries starting CPD who were followed in the International Pediatric PD Network (IPPN) Registry. The overall prevalence of underweight, and overweight/obesity at start of CPD was 8.9% and 19.7%, respectively. Underweight was most prevalent in South and Southeast Asia (20%), Central Europe (16.7%) and Turkey (15.2%), whereas overweight and obesity were most common in the Middle East (40%) and the US (33%). BMI SDS at PD initiation was associated positively with current eGFR and gastrostomy feeding prior to PD start. Over the course of PD BMI SDS tended to increase on CPD in underweight and normal weight children, whereas it decreased in initially overweight patients. In infancy, mortality risk was amplified by obesity, whereas in older children mortality was markedly increased in association with underweight. Both underweight and overweight are prevalent in pediatric ESKD, with the prevalence varying across the globe. Late dialysis start is associated with underweight, while enteral feeding can lead to obesity. Nutritional abnormalities tend to attenuate with time on dialysis. Mortality risk appears increased with obesity in infants and with underweight in older children.

AB  - The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) Rv2747 gene encodes for a functional protein known as ArgA, which plays an important role in the first step of the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. ArgA transfers the acetyl group from the acetyl-CoA to either L-glutamate or L-glutamine, which are the known substrates. Here, we present two crystal structures of ArgA: one complexed with CoA and product bound N-acetylglutamine and the other complexed with acetyl-CoA and the inhibitor L-arginine at 2.3 and 3.0 angstrom resolution respectively. The Mtb ArgA protomer was found to have a "V" cleft and a "beta" bulge, archetypal of a classical GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase super-family of proteins. The product bound form implies that ArgA can also acetylate L-glutamine like L-glutamate. The active site is strongly inhibited by L-arginine resulting in a closed conformation of ArgA and both L-arginine and N-acetylglutamine were found to occupy at the same active site. Together with structural analysis, molecular docking studies, microscale thermophoresis and enzyme inhibition assays, we conclude that L-glutamine, L-glutamate and L-arginine, all occupy at the same active site of ArgA. Furthermore in case of Mtb ArgA, L-arginine does not act as an allosteric inhibitor unlike other N-acetylglutamate synthase family of proteins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The therapeutic options for the reducing the damage caused by myocardial ischemia are limited and not devoid of adverse effects. The role of the flavanoid, fisetin, predominantly found in strawberry and apple, is yet to be explored in the heart.
   Study design: Male Wistar rats (n = 48) were administered fisetin (10, 20 & 40 mg/kg/day, orally) or vehicle for 28 days while ISO, 85 mg/kg, subcutaneously, was also administered at 24 h interval on the 27th and 28th day. On the 29th day, rats were anaesthetized and right carotid artery was cannulated to record hemodynamic parameters. Subsequently, blood sample was collected and heart was removed to evaluate various parameters.
   Results: Fisetin at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg reversed ISO induced detrimental alterations in blood pressure and left ventricular pressures and reduced the myocardial injury markers CK-MB and LDH in the serum. These findings were supported by amelioration of ISO induced histological and ultrastructural damage by fisetin. The disequilibrium in the levels of pro and anti oxidants in the myocardial tissue caused by ISO was also normalized Furthermore, apoptosis was evident from enhanced DNA fragmentation and raised pro-apoptotic proteins (bax, caspase-3, cytochrome-c) as well as suppressed anti-apoptotic protein (Bcl-2) in case of ISO treatment which again was reversed by fisetin. A molecular mechanism for this protection was elucidated as downregulation of RAGE and NF-kappa B However fisetin at 40 mg/kg revealed a deteriorating effect which was similar to ISO group of rats.
   Conclusion: Hence, through our study, the role of fisetin in cardioprotection has been uncovered via a molecular pathway.

AB  - Survival of the Acinetobacter baumannii inside host requires different micronutrients such as iron, but their bio-availability is limited because of nutritional immunity created by host. A. baumannii has to develop mechanisms to acquire nutrient iron during infection. The present study is an attempt to identify membrane proteins involved in iron sequestration mechanism of A. baumannii using two-dimensional electrophoresis and LC-MS/MS analysis. The identified iron-regulated membrane protein (IRMP) of A. baumannii was used for its interaction studies with different siderophores, and designing of the inhibitor against A. baumannii targeting this IRMP. Membrane proteomic results identified over-expression of four membrane proteins (Fhu-E receptor, ferric-acinetobactin receptor, ferrienterochelin receptor, and ferric siderophore receptor) under iron-limited condition. A. baumannii produces siderophores that have good interaction with the FhuE receptor. Result also showed that FhuE receptor has interaction with siderophores produced by other bacteria. Interaction of FhuE receptor and siderophores helps in iron sequestration and survival of Acinetobacter under nutritional immunity imposed by the host. Hence it becomes essential to find a potential inhibitor for the FhuE receptor that can inhibit the survival of A. baumannii in the host. In-silico screening, and molecular mechanics studies identified ZINC03794794 and ZINC01530652 as a likely lead to design inhibitor against the FhuE receptor of A. baumannii. The designed inhibitor is experimentally validated for its antibacterial activity on the A. baumannii. Therefore, designed inhibitor interferes with the iron acquisition mechanism of Acinetobacter hence may prove useful for preventing infection caused by A. baumannii by limiting nutrient availability.

AB  - In India, there is a lack of information about the adequate daily dose of vitamin D-3 supplementation in school children. Hence, we undertook this study to evaluate the adequacy and efficacy of different doses of vitamin D-3 in schoolchildren. A total of 1008 vitamin D-deficient (VDD) children, aged 6-16 years with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels <50nmol/l, were cluster randomised into three groups (A-344, B-341 and C-232) for supplementation (600, 1000 and 2000 IU daily) of vitamin D-3 under supervision for 6 months. Of the 1008 subjects who completed the study, 938 (93 %) were compliant. Baseline and post-supplementation fasting blood and urine samples were evaluated for Ca, phosphates, alkaline phosphatase, 25(OH)D and parathormone and urine Ca:creatinine ratio. The mean age of the subjects was 11 center dot 7 (sd 2 center dot 4) years, and the overall mean baseline serum 25(OH)D level was 24 center dot 3 (SD 9 center dot 5)nmol/l. Post-supplementation rise in serum 25(OH)D in compliant group was maximum with 2000 IU (70 center dot 0 (SD 30 center dot 0)nmol/l), followed by 1000 IU (46 center dot 8 (SD 22 center dot 5)nmol/l) and 600 IU (36 center dot 5 (SD 18 center dot 5)nmol/l), and serum 25(OH)D levels of >= 50nmol/l were achieved in 71 center dot 5, 81 center dot 8 and 92 center dot 9 % by groups A, B and C, respectively. Secondary hyperparathyroidism decreased from 31 center dot 7 to 8 center dot 4 % post-supplementation. Two participants developed hypercalciuria, but none developed hypercalcaemia. Children with VDD benefit maximum with the daily supplementation of 2000 IU of vitamin D-3. Whether recommendations of 400 IU/d by Indian Council of Medical Research or 600 IU by Indian Academy of Pediatrics or Institute of Medicine would suffice to achieve vitamin D sufficiency in children with VDD remains debatable.

KW  - VERSION
AB  - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of mental disorder-IV (DSM-IV) TR based INCLEN Diagnostic Tool for Autism Spectrum Disorder (INDT-ASD) is an established instrument for the diagnosis of ASD in Indian subcontinent and low-middle income countries (LMIC). The introduction of DSM-5 necessitated revision of existing INDT-ASD tool to incorporate the DSM-5 related changes. This study was undertaken to develop and validate the DSM-5 based All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-Modified-INDT-ASD Tool. The modifications were done using Delphi method and included: (a) rearrangement of questions from the previous tool; and (b) addition of new questions on sensory symptoms. The modified tool was validated against DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the cut-off for total score as compared to Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) score to grade the severity of ASD. Two-hundred-twenty-five children (159 boys, median age = 47months) were enrolled. The modified tool demonstrated sensitivity of 98.4% and specificity of 91.7% to diagnose ASD. A score >= 14 on the tool was suggestive of severe ASD (CARS>36.5) with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 80.7% respectively [Area under the curve = 0.89]. AIIMS-Modified-INDT-ASD Tool is a simple and structured instrument based on DSM-5 criteria which can facilitate diagnosis of ASD with acceptable diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Background
   Axshya SAMVAD is an active tuberculosis (TB) case finding (ACF) strategy under project Axshya (Axshya meaning 'free of TB' and SAMVAD meaning 'conversation') among marginalized and vulnerable populations in 285 districts of India.
   Objectives
   To compare patient characteristics, health seeking, delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation among new sputum smear positive TB patients detected through ACF and passive case finding (PCF) under the national TB programme in marginalized and vulnerable populations between March 2016 and February 2017.
   Methods
   This observational analytic study was conducted in 18 randomly sampled Axshya districts. We enrolled all TB patients detected through ACF and an equal number of randomly selected patients detected through PCF in the same settings. Data on patient characteristics, health seeking and delays were collected through record review and patient interviews (at their residence). Delays included patient level delay (from eligibility for sputum examination to first contact with any health care provider (HCP)), health system level diagnosis delay (from contact with first HCP to TB diagnosis) and treatment initiation delays (from diagnosis to treatment initiation). Total delay was the sum of patient level, health system level diagnosis delay and treatment initiation delays.
   Results
   We included 234 ACF-diagnosed and 231 PCF-diagnosed patients. When compared to PCF, ACF patients were relatively older (>= 65 years, 14% versus 8%, p = 0.041), had no formal education (57% versus 36%, p<0.001), had lower monthly income per capita (median 13.1 versus 15.7 USD, p = 0.014), were more likely from rural areas (92% versus 81%, p<0.002) and residing far away from the sputum microscopy centres (more than 15 km, 24% versus 18%, p = 0.126). Fewer patients had history of significant loss of weight (68% versus 78%, p = 0.011) and sputum grade of 3+ (15% versus 21%, p = 0.060). Compared to PCF, HCP visits among ACF patients was significantly lower (median one versus two HCPs, p<0.001). ACF patients had significantly lower health system level diagnosis delay (median five versus 19 days, p = 0.008) and the association remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. Patient level and total delays were not significantly different.
   Conclusion
   Axshya SAMVAD linked the most impoverished communities to TB care and resulted in reduction of health system level diagnosis delay.

AB  - Multigram drug depot systems for extended drug release could transform our capacity to effectively treat patients across a myriad of diseases. For example, tuberculosis (TB) requires multimonth courses of daily multigram doses for treatment. To address the challenge of prolonged dosing for regimens requiring multigram drug dosing, we developed a gastric resident system delivered through the nasogastric route that was capable of safely encapsulating and releasing grams of antibiotics over a period of weeks. Initial preclinical safety and drug release were demonstrated in a swine model with a panel of TB antibiotics. We anticipate multiple applications in the field of infectious diseases, as well as for other indications where multigram depots could impart meaningful benefits to patients, helping maximize adherence to their medication.

AB  - Adolescence is the most critical phase of human growth that radically alters physiology of the body and wherein any inconsistency can lead to serious health consequences in adulthood. The timing and pace at which various developmental events occur during adolescence is highly diverse and thus results in a drastic change in blood biochemistry. Monitoring the physiological levels of various biochemical measures in ample number of individuals during adolescence can call up for an early intervention in managing metabolic diseases in adulthood. Today, only a couple of studies in different populations have investigated blood biochemistry in a small number of adolescents however, there is no comprehensive biochemical data available worldwide. In view, we performed a cross-sectional study in a sizeable group of 7,618 Indian adolescents (3,333 boys and 4,285 girls) aged between 11-17 years to inspect the distribution of values of common biochemical parameters that generally prevails during adolescence and we observed that various parameters considerably follow the reported values from different populations being 3.56-6.49mmol/L (fasting glucose), 10.60-199.48 mu mol/L (insulin), 0.21-3.22nmol/L (C peptide), 3.85-6.25% (HbA(1)c), 2.49-5.54mmol/L (total cholesterol), 1.16-3.69mmol/L (LDL), 0.78-1.85mmol/L (HDL), 0.33-2.24mmol/L (triglycerides), 3.56-11.45mmol/L (urea), 130.01-440.15 mu mol/L (uric acid) and 22.99-74.28 mu mol/L (creatinine). Barring LDL and triglycerides, all parameters differed significantly between boys and girls (p< 0.001). Highest difference was seen for uric acid (p = 1.3 x10(-187)) followed by C peptide (p = 6.6 x10(-89)). Across all ages during adolescence, glycemic and nitrogen metabolites parameters varied markedly with gender. Amongst lipid parameters, only HDL levels were found to be significantly associated with gender following puberty (p< 0.001). All parameters except urea, differed considerably in obese and lean adolescents (p< 0.0001). The present study asserts that age, sex and BMI are the essential contributors to variability in blood biochemistry during adolescence. Our composite data on common blood biochemical measures will benefit future endeavors to define reference intervals in adolescents especially when the global availability is scarce.

TI  - Effect of methylprednisolone on acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump: a randomized controlled trial

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative corticosteroid use may reduce acute kidney injury. We sought to test whether methylprednisolone reduces the risk of acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery.
   METHODS: We conducted a prespecified substudy of a randomized controlled trial involving patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (2007-2014); patients were recruited from 79 centres in 18 countries. Eligibility criteria included a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death based on a preoperative score of 6 or greater on the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation I. Patients (n = 7286) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous methylprednisolone (250 mg at anesthetic induction and 250 mg at initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass) or placebo. Patients, caregivers, data collectors and outcome adjudicators were unaware of the assigned intervention. The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in the serum creatinine concentration (from the preoperative value) of 0.3 mg/dL or greater (>= 26.5 mu mol/L) or 50% or greater in the 14-day period after surgery, or use of dialysis within 30 days after surgery.
   RESULTS: Acute kidney injury occurred in 1479/3647 patients (40.6%) in the methylprednisolone group and in 1426/3639 patients (39.2%) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.11). Results were consistent across several definitions of acute kidney injury and in patients with preoperative chronic kidney disease.
   INTERPRETATION: Intraoperative corticosteroid use did not reduce the risk of acute kidney injury in patients with a moderate-to-high risk of perioperative death who had cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Our results do not support the prophylactic use of steroids during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.

AB  - Background Hurthle cell-rich nodules (HCNs) encompass non-neoplastic to malignant lesions. There is paucity of literature on the frequency distribution of HCNs among Bethesda categories, histologic follow-up, risk of malignancy (ROM), and risk of neoplasia (RON). The objective of this retrospective, multi-institutional study was to determine the prevalence of the cytologic diagnostic category and surgical outcomes of patients with HCN. Methods Nine tertiary health centers representing 6 Asian countries participated. Cases were retrieved from respective databases. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology was used. Cytology results were correlated with surgical diagnoses. Results Of 42,190 thyroid aspirates retrieved, 760 (1.8%) had a Hurthle cell predominance. Most (61%) were categorized as atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance, Hurthle cell type" (AUS-H); 35% were categorized as follicular neoplasm, Hurthle cell type (FN-H); and 4% were categorized as suspicious for malignancy (SFM). Histologic follow-up was available for 288 aspirates (38%). Most were benign on resection (66%), and the most common histologic diagnosis was Hurthle cell adenoma (28.5%). The ROM for AUS-H, FN-H, and SFM, as calculated on resected nodules, was 32%, 31%, and 71%, respectively; and the RON was 47%, 81%, and 77%, respectively. The 5 institutions that had an AUS-H:HCN ratio below 0.5 diagnosed HCN less frequently as AUS-H than as FN-H. Conclusions This is the largest, contemporary, multi-institutional series of HCNs with surgical follow-up. Although there was wide interinstitutional variation in prevalence and surgical outcomes, there was no significant difference in the ROM among institutions. The categories AUS-H and FN-H had a similar ROM for resected nodules.

This has led to the development and study of novel PI3K inhibitors for targeted therapy and also to overcome resistance to radiotherapy.MethodThe anti-tumour effects of PI3K inhibitors (PI-828, PI-103 and PX-866) in terms of cell proliferation, colony formation, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, invasion, autophagy, and pNF-B/p65 translocation in SCC-4, SCC-9 and SCC-25 cells were studied by performing MTT, clonogenic, DAPI staining, propidium iodide staining, annexin-V binding, matrigel invasion, acridine orange staining and immuno-fluorescence assay. Western blot assay was performed to assess the alteration in the expression of various proteins.ResultPI-828 and PI-103 treatment exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of growth and proliferation of OSCC cells with a concomitant induction of apoptosis, altered cell cycle regulation and decreased invasiveness (p<0.01). PX-866 induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy and a significant decrease in the invasiveness of oral cancer cells as compared to untreated cells (p<0.01). These compounds significantly reduced expression of COX-2, cyclin-D1 and VEGF in the treated cells besides cytoplasmic accumulation of pNF-B/p65 protein. In addition to PI3K, inactivation of downstream components, i.e. Akt and mTOR was seen.ConclusionPI3K inhibitors such as PI-103, PI-828 and PX-866 may be developed as potential therapeutic agents for effective treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients, associated with activated PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - We previously reported that von Willebrand Factor gene (VWF) conversions are a relatively frequent cause of von Willebrand disease (VWD), however, their molecular pathomechanisms resulting in variant phenotypes is largely unknown. Here, we characterized VWF conversions harbouring missense and synonymous mutations, through generating a series of mutant constructs followed by transient expression in 293 cells, and qualitative and quantitative analysis of recombinant VWF (rVWF). The characterization of mutant rVWF showed the critical roles of synonymous variants in the pathogenicity of VWF conversions. The gene conversion variants p.Val1229Gly, p.Asn1231Thr, p.Asn1231Ser and p.Ala1464Pro in the absence of synonymous p.Ser1263= and p.Gln1449= showed minimal effect on rVWF synthesis and activity. Interestingly, a construct including the synonymous variants displayed significantly low rVWF expression and activity. The variant p.Pro1266Leu showed gain of rVWF function toward glycoprotein Ib alpha; surprisingly, this function was significantly abolished in the presence of gene conversion variants p.Val1229Gly-p.Asn1231Thr. Taken together, our expression studies suggest that synonymous variants in the combination of other gene conversion variants suppress the protein expression, possibly due to defective primary mRNA structure or processing. The variants p.Val1229Gly-p.Asn1231Thr affected the VWF gain of function caused by variant p.Pro1266Leu, probably due to conformational changes in VWF.

AB  - Aims The landmark STICH trial found that surgical revascularization compared to medical therapy alone improved survival in patients with heart failure (HF) of ischaemic aetiology and an ejection fraction (EF) <= 35%. However, the interaction between the burden of medical co-morbidities and the benefit from surgical revascularization has not been previously described in patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy.
   Methods and results The STICH trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00023595) enrolled patients >= 18 years of age with coronary artery disease amenable to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and an EF <= 35%. Eligible participants were randomly assigned 1: 1 to receive medical therapy (MED) (n = 602) or MED/CABG (n = 610). A modified Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI) based on the availability of data and study definitions was calculated by summing the weighted points for all co-morbid conditions. Patients were divided into mild/moderate (CCI 1-4) and severe (CCI = 5) co-morbidity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between CCI and outcomes and the interaction between severity of co-morbidity and treatment effect. The study population included 349 patients (29%) with a mild/moderate CCI score and 863 patients (71%) with a severe CCI score. Patients with a severe CCI score had greater functional limitations based on 6-min walk test and impairments in health-related quality of life as assessed by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire. A total of 161 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate = 50%) with a mild/moderate CCI score and 579 patients (Kaplan-Meier rate = 69%) with a severe CCI score died over a median follow-up of 9.8 years. After adjusting for baseline confounders, patients with a severe CCI score were at higher risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.74; P < 0.001). There was no interaction between CCI score and treatment effect on survival (P = 0.756).
   Conclusions More than 70% of patients had a severe burden of medical co-morbidities at baseline, which was independently associated with increased risk of death. There was not a differential benefit of surgical revascularization with respect to survival based on severity of co-morbidity.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of the present study was to investigate why the magnitude of reactive hyperemia (RH) observed by pulse volume amplitude (PVA) after arm occlusion differs greatly among study subjects.MethodsHealthy subjects (n=12) in the age range of 22-30years participated in this study. Vascular reactivity was assessed by measuring the changes in finger PVA simultaneously in the test (occluded arm) and control arm (contralateral non-occluded arm) using two separate Photoplethysmographic sensors. Short-term HRV was computed from simultaneously acquired lead II ECG signal to monitor the changes in cardiac sympathetic nervous activity.ResultsThe observed coefficient of variation for inter-subject variability in PVA response in test arm during second minute of RH was 115.3%. In the control arm, significantly reduced PVA was observed during the period of occlusion as well as RH. This observation was corroborated by simultaneously acquired short-term HRV which showed a significant rise in total power (p value<0.005) and low-frequency (LF) power (p value<0.05) during release of occlusion when compared to the baseline. A significant positive correlation (Spearman r=0.33; p=0.02) was observed between % change in PVA in the control arm and in the test arm for first 3min of RH.ConclusionsSympathetic activation possibly plays an important role in mediating the inter-subject variability of vascular responses during reactive hyperemia which warrants simultaneous recording of both the test and the control arm responses during RH to accurately assess endothelial function.

AB  - Aims To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Materials and methods PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged >= 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged >= 60 years with >= 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration. Results Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD. Conclusions PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

AB  - Insulin is a commonly used measure of pancreatic beta-cell function but exhibits a short half-life in the human body. During biosynthesis, insulin release is accompanied by C-peptide at an equimolar concentration which has a much higher plasma half-life and is therefore projected as a precise measure of beta-cell activity than insulin. Despite this, genetic studies of metabolic traits have neglected the regulatory potential of C-peptide for therapeutic intervention of type-2 diabetes. The present study is aimed to search genomewide variants governing C-peptide levels in genetically diverse and high risk population for metabolic diseases-Indians. We performed whole genome genotyping in 877 healthy Indians of Indo-European origin followed by replication of variants with P <= 1 x 10(-3) in an independent sample-set of 1829 Indians. Lead-associated signals were also tested in-silico in 773 Hispanics. To secure biological rationale for observed association, we further carried out DNA methylation quantitative trait loci analysis in 233 Indians and publicly available regulatory data was mined. We discovered novel lncRNA gene AC073333.8 with the strongest association with C-peptide levels in Indians that however missed genomewide significance. Also, noncoding genes, RP1-209A6.1 and RPS3AP5; protein gene regulators, ZNF831 and ETS2; and solute carrier protein gene SLC15A5 retained robust association with C-peptide after meta-analysis. Integration of methylation data revealed ETS2 and ZNF831 single-nucleotide polymorphisms as significant meth-QTLs in Indians. All genes showed reasonable expression in the human lung, signifying alternate important organs for C-peptide biology. Our findings mirror polygenic nature of C-peptide where multiple small-effect size variants in the regulatory genome principally govern the trait biology.

AB  - Introduction: With rise in incidence and prevalence of cancers in the ageing population, the need for an age sensitive comprehensive assessment measure has been felt. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is often difficult to implement due to time and logistic constraints. A brief assessment tool encompassing the specific domains of the CGA would be a better way to assess older adults with cancer. These tools exist but have not necessarily been culturally adapted. The main aim of the study was to develop a culturally relevant short geriatric assessment tool and explore its psychometric properties.
   Methodology: An initial item pool was formed after review of the literature and study of the existing scales. This draft tool was then pre and pilot tested to finalize the items and check the feasibility of application. The final tool was validated by exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 100 older patients with cancer.
   Results: After pre and pilot study on fifteen and thirty older patients with cancer respectively, this tool consisting of a total of 38 items spread over eight domains was developed and validated on a sample of 100 subjects. Due to co-linearity, three items were deleted after exploratory factor analysis, bringing the final item number to 35. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) was 0.94. Thus, the final tool had 13 questions with sub-parts (35 items in total). The time taken to administer the tool was around 25 min.
   Conclusion: The tool developed is valid and reliable and can be used for the initial assessment and further care planning of older Indian patients with cancer. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Fluid management during intracranial surgery is an important concern. The type of fluid used can have biochemical and metabolic effects during intraoperative management. However, it is yet to be known whether biochemical and metabolic effects have an influence on the clinical outcome of a patient.
   Objective: A prospective evaluation of the effects of normal saline (NS), Ringer's lactate (RL), and a combination of NS and RL on the biochemical, metabolic, and clinical outcomes in patients undergoing intracranial tumor surgery was carried out.
   Materials and Methods: Ninety patients undergoing elective intracranial tumor surgery were randomized to receive NS, RL, or a combination of NS and RL. The biochemical and metabolic parameters were studied at different time points in the intraoperative and postoperative period. The hemodynamic parameters, brain relaxation score at the time of bone flap elevation, postoperative complications, and the duration of hospital stay were the clinical outcome variables of our study.
   Results: The use of NS was associated with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and ionic hypocalcemia. RL caused significant hyponatremia and increase in serum lactate levels. The combination of NS and RL has least influence on biochemical and metabolic parameters. The effects of three fluids were similar on the hemodynamics, brain relaxation score, as well as on postoperative complications and the duration of postoperative hospital stay.
   Conclusion: There are variable effects of NS, RL, or its combination on the biochemical and metabolic parameters in patients undergoing intracranial tumor surgery. However, the clinical outcome of the patients remains similar.

AB  - IntroductionObstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been estimated to affect 4-11% of the population and causes systemic inflammation which leads to metabolic syndrome (MS). Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is also associated with MS whether NAFLD is an additional risk factor for the systemic inflammation that occurs in OSA is unclear.ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to analyze the association of OSA and NAFLD with MS and systemic inflammation in Asian Indians.MethodsTotal 240 (132 males and 108 females) overweight/obese subjects [body mass index (BMI >23kg/m(2))] were recruited; of these, 124 subjects had OSA with NAFLD, 47 had OSA without NAFLD, 44 did not have OSA but had NAFLD and 25 had neither OSA nor without NAFLD. Severity of NAFLD was based on abdomen ultrasound and of OSA on overnight polysomnography. Clinical examinations, anthropometry, body composition, metabolic parameters, and inflammatory biomarkers were recorded.ResultsSerum levels of leptin, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) were significantly higher, and adiponectin levels were significantly lower in OSA with NAFLD subjects. Prevalence of MS was significantly increased in OSA and NAFLD subjects (p=0.001). There was a strong association and correlation between leptin, IL-6, Hs-CRP, MIF, and TNF- in OSA and NAFLD subjects. Multivariate logistic regression showed that OSA was positively associated with the NAFLD [odds ratio (OR), (95% confidence interval (CL) 3.12 (2.58-7.72), (P=0.002)].ConclusionNAFLD is an additional risk factor in OSA subject which contributes to systemic inflammation in Asian Indians.

AB  - Diet and environment are two critical regulators that influence an individual's epigenetic profile. Besides the anterograde signaling, mitochondria act as a key regulator of epigenetic alterations in cancer either by controlling the concentration of the cofactors, activity of vital enzymes or by affecting the transcription of NF-kappaB and associated signaling molecules. As epigenetic modifications are the major drivers of aberrant gene expression, designing novel nutri-epigenomic strategies to modulate reversible epigenetic modifications will be important for effective cancer protection. In this regard, nutraceuticals such as flavonoids holds significant promise to modulate the epigenome through a network of interconnected anti-redox mechanisms. However, low solubility, rapid metabolism and poor absorption of flavonoids in gastrointestinal tract hinder their use in clinical settings. Therefore, it is imperative to develop nano-engineered systems which could considerably improve the targeted delivery of these bioactive compounds with better efficacy and pharmacokinetic properties. Concerted efforts in nano-engineering of flavonoids using polymer, lipid and complexation based approaches could provide successful benchto-bedside translation of flavonoids as broad spectrum anti-cancer agents.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the effect of sleep quality on memory, executive function, and language performance in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and controlled epilepsy and compare these with healthy individuals. We prospectively enrolled 37 adolescent and adult patients with refractory focal epilepsy (Group 1) and controlled epilepsy (Group 2) in each group. History pertaining to epilepsy and sleep were recorded, and all patients underwent overnight polysomnography. Language, memory, and executive function assessments were done using Western Aphasia Battery. Post Graduate Institute (PGI) memory scale, and battery of four executive function tests (Trail Making Test A & B. Digit symbol test, Stroop Task, and Verbal Fluency Test), respectively. Forty age- and sex-matched controls were also included in the study. Significant differences were noted in both objective and subjective sleep parameters among all the groups. On polysomnography, parameters like total sleep time, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and rapid eye movement (REM) latency were found to be significantly worse in Group 1 as compared with Group 2. Cognitive and executive parameters were significantly impaired in Group 1. Shorter total sleep time, poorer sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies were observed to be associated with poor memory and executive function in patients with refractory epilepsy. Our study strongly suggests that sleep disturbances, mainly shorter total sleep time, poor sleep efficiency, and prolonged sleep latencies, are associated with impaired memory and executive function in patients with refractory focal epilepsy and to a lesser extent, among those with medically controlled epilepsy.

AB  - Dengue and Chikungunya are two important mosquito-borne acute febrile illnesses in children. With increased urbanization and newer strains of chikungunya virus with improved transmission with Aedes albopictus, the at-risk population for these infections has greatly increased. Dengue fever has been classified by WHO as dengue with/ without warning signs and severe dengue. Severe dengue is associated with hemorrhagic manifestations, hypovolemia and hypotension secondary to third space loss due to capillary leak or severe end organ dysfunction. NS1 antigen detection and dengue polymerase chain reaction, [polymerase chain reaction (PCR during first 5 d)] and IgM for dengue (6th day of fever onwards) are commonly utilized diagnostic tests. Appropriate fluid therapy with timely tapering of intravenous fluid rate with hematocrit, treatment of hemorrhagic manifestations and clinical monitoring are the mainstay of dengue treatment. Chikungunya has less severe course with shorter febrile phase with prominent and persistent joint symptoms. PCR and IgM against chikungunya are appropriate investigations. Treatment is supportive for chikungunya infection with appropriate joint pain relief.

AB  - Background Endoscopic surgery is developing in various clinical specialties. During ear endoscopic surgery, a surgeon has to hold an endoscope with one hand and operate the surgical instruments with another hand. Therefore, the stability of the surgeon's hand affects the field of surgical view and quality of the surgery considerably. There are few techniques which are used during surgery to stabilize the endoscope. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy of such techniques in detail. This study examined the three dimensional movement of an endoscope to compare and evaluate the effect of various stabilization techniques to reduce the hand tremor while using the endoscope.
   Methods A non-randomized controlled trial involving 15 medical students was conducted in Tottori University, Japan. Subjects held an endoscope with their non-dominant hand and manipulated it using three different stabilization techniques i.e. with resting the elbow on the table, resting the endoscope on the ear canal, both with the elbow on the table and endoscope on the ear canal. For the control, subjects were made to use the endoscope without any stabilization technique. The endoscopic movement was measured with and without using the stabilization techniques.
   Results The results obtained in this study indicated that manipulating the endoscope with resting the elbow on the table restrains both vertical (Y-axis) and optical axis (Z-axis) direction of tremor, and manipulating the endoscope by resting it on the ear canal restrains both vertical (Y-axis) and horizontal axis (X-axis) direction while the combined use of both the techniques reduces the endoscope movement in all the three X, Y and Z axes.
   Conclusion In conclusion, concomitant use of both techniques appears to be clinically beneficial in endoscopic ear surgery.

AB  - PurposeSentinel lymph node biopsy is an essential staging tool in patients with clinically localized oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma. The harvesting of a sentinel lymph node entails a sequence of procedures with participation of specialists in nuclear medicine, radiology, surgery, and pathology. The aim of this document is to provide guidelines for nuclear medicine physicians performing lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node detection in patients with early N0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.MethodsThese practice guidelines were written and have been approved by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to promote high-quality lymphoscintigraphy. The final result has been discussed by distinguished experts from the EANM Oncology Committee, and national nuclear medicine societies. The document has been endorsed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI).These guidelines, together with another two focused on Surgery and Pathology (and published in specialised journals), are part of the synergistic efforts developed in preparation for the 2018 Sentinel Node Biopsy in Head and Neck Consensus Conference.ConclusionThe present practice guidelines will help nuclear medicine practitioners play their essential role in providing high-quality lymphatic mapping for the care of early N0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients.

AB  - We assessed the plaque disruption in 245 consecutive patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The plaque fissure was diagnosed with optical coherence tomography, and intravascular ultrasound was used to determine arterial remodeling. Of them, 26 fissures were found in this study. The definite fissure was seen in 17 (65.4%) and probable fissure was seen in 9 (34.6%) patients. In 18 (69.2%), plaque fissure component was lipidic or thin-capped fibroatheroma. Eighteen (69.2%) of fissured plaque were seen within 30mm of coronary ostium. Combined plaque fissure with plaque rupture/erosion was seen in 21 (80.8%) cases. The isolated fissure was seen in 5 (19.2%). Compared to the maximal necrotic core site of the ruptured plaque, the fissure site showed a smaller %necrotic core (p=0.012), however, greater in fissure site than minimal lumen area site (24.93 +/- 11.50% vs 15.34 +/- 10.40%, p<0.0001). The remodeling index was higher at fissure site as compared to minimal lumen area site (1.02 +/- 0.22 vs 0.94 +/- 0.27; p=0.047), but similar to the rupture plaque (p=0.31). The frequency of positive remodeling was 34.6% (9/26) at the plaque fissure. Although the plaque fissure can be interchangeable with the rupture in acute coronary syndrome, the limited extension to the small lipid core might and less positive remodeling provoke a fissuring of the plaque. Further study is necessary to assess the plaque fissure.

AB  - Objective. To recount experience with cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea and temporal bone meningoencephalocele repair in a tertiary care hospital.
   Method. A retrospective review was conducted of 16 cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea and meningoencephalic herniation patients managed surgically from 1991 to 2016.
   Results. Aetiology was: congenital (n = 3), post-traumatic (n = 2), spontaneous (n = 1) or post-mastoidectomy (n = 10). Surgical repair was undertaken by combined middle cranial fossa and transmastoid approach in 3 patients, transmastoid approach in 2, oval window plugging in 1, and subtotal petrosectomy with middle-ear obliteration in 10. All patients had successful long-term outcomes, except one, who experienced recurrence after primary stage oval window plugging, but has been recurrence-free after second-stage subtotal petrosectomy with middle-ear obliteration.
   Conclusion. Dural injury or exposure in mastoidectomy may lead to cerebrospinal fluid otorrhoea or meningoencephalic herniation years later. Congenital, spontaneous and traumatic temporal bone defects may present similarly. Middle cranial fossa dural repair, transmastoid multilayer closure and subtotal petrosectomy with middle-ear obliteration were successful procedures. Subtotal petrosectomy with middle-ear obliteration offers advantages over middle cranial fossa dural repair alone; soft tissue closure is more robust and is preferred in situations where hearing preservation is not a priority.

TI  - What do Vitiligo Impact Scale-22 scores mean? Studying the clinical interpretation of scores using an anchor-based approach

AB  - BackgroundThe Vitiligo Impact Scale (VIS)-22 is a vitiligo-specific quality-of-life instrument. Its criterion, convergent and known-groups validity, test-retest reliability and responsiveness have been studied previously in an Indian population. The clinical meaning of VIS-22 scores has not yet been analysed.
   ObjectivesTo assign clinical meaning to VIS-22 scores using anchor-based methods.
   MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study conducted in a large teaching hospital in North India. Patients with vitiligo > 15 years of age (n = 391) completed the VIS-22 and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaires, and answered a Global Question (GQ) on the effect of vitiligo on their lives on a five-point Likert scale. Multiple band sets of VIS-22 scores were devised using GQ as the anchor. A weighted kappa-coefficient was calculated to estimate the level of agreement between different band sets of VIS-22 and GQ. VIS-22 and DLQI were compared based on their degree of correlation and agreement with GQ.
   ResultsThe mean SD of VIS-22 scores was 248 140 (range 0-61). VIS-22 scores showed good correlation with GQ (r = 076). Of the various VIS-22 band sets tested, the following was chosen: 0-5, 6-15, 16-25, 26-40 and 41-66 (weighted = 057), corresponding to the five categories of GQ. The degree of correlation (VIS-22, r = 077; DLQI, r = 069) and agreement (VIS-22, 516%; DLQI, 361%; P < 0001) of VIS-22 with GQ was higher than that with DLQI.
   ConclusionsVIS-22 scores can be used to stratify the impairment of vitiligo-related quality of life.

AB  - Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a multisystem disease affecting young children. Lung involvement has a myriad of manifestations and the outcomes for these patients have been poorly defined. We present a 2-year-old child who presented with multisystem disease with multiple lung cysts. Treatment consisted of multiagent chemotherapy for 18 months and was associated with a slow but favorable response.

AB  - IMPORTANCE It is unknown whether coronary revascularization, when added to optimal medical therapy, improves prognosis in patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD) at increased risk of cardiovascular events owing to moderate or severe ischemia.
   OBJECTIVE To describe baseline characteristics of participants enrolled and randomized in the International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) trial and to evaluate whether qualification by stress imaging or nonimaging exercise tolerance test (ETT) influenced risk profiles.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The ISCHEMIA trial recruited patients with SIHD with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. Blinded coronary computed tomography angiography was performed in most participants and reviewed by a core laboratory to exclude left main stenosis of at least 50% or no obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) (< 50% for imaging stress test and < 70% for ETT). The study included 341 enrolling sites (320 randomizing) in 38 countries and patients with SIHD and moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing. Data presented were extracted on December 17, 2018.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Enrolled, excluded, and randomized participants' baseline characteristics. No clinical outcomes are reported.
   RESULTS A total of 8518 patients were enrolled, and 5179 were randomized. Common reasons for exclusion were core laboratory determination of insufficient ischemia, unprotected left main stenosis of at least 50%, or no stenosis that met study obstructive CAD criteria on study coronary computed tomography angiography. Randomized participants had a median age of 64 years, with 1168 women (22.6%), 1726 nonwhite participants (33.7%), 748 Hispanic participants (15.5%), 2122 with diabetes (41.0%), and 4643 with a history of angina (89.7%). Among the 3909 participants randomized after stress imaging, core laboratory assessment of ischemia severity (in 3901 participants) was severe in 1748 (44.8%), moderate in 1600 (41.0%), mild in 317 (8.1%) and none or uninterpretable in 236 (6.0%), Among the 1270 participants who were randomized after nonimaging ETT, core laboratory determination of ischemia severity (in 1266 participants) was severe (an eligibility criterion) in 1051 (83.0%), moderate in 101 (8.0%), mild in 34 (2.7%) and none or uninterpretable in 80 (6.3%). Among the 3912 of 5179 randomized participants who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography, 79.0% had multivessel CAD (n = 2679 of 3390) and 86.8% had left anterior descending (LAD) stenosis (n = 3190 of 3677) (proximal in 46.8% [ n = 1749 of 3739]). Participants undergoing ETT had greater frequency of 3-vessel CAD, LAD, and proximal LAD stenosis than participants undergoing stress imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ISCHEMIA trial randomized an SIHD population with moderate or severe ischemia on stress testing, of whom most had multivessel CAD.

AB  - Purpose: Aromatic antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are frequently implicated in cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs), a few of which are associated with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in some populations. We aimed to find HLA-associations with AED-related cADRs among North Indians.
   Methods: North Indian subjects with cADR due to an AED, and those who were AED-tolerant were recruited as cases and controls, respectively. Genotyping for HLA-A, B and DRB1 were performed. Statistical analysis to compare carrier-rates and allele-frequencies between cases and controls (and healthy population, where necessary), was done for HLA-alleles occurring more than twice in either group.
   Results: 120 cases {11- Lamotrigine (LTG), 14-Valproic acid (VPA), 8-Levetiracetam (LEV), 35-Carbamazepine (CBZ) and 52- Phenytoin (PHT)}, and 250 controls were recruited. Presence of HLA-A(star)31:01 and HLA-B(star)51:01 were found to increase the risk of Maculopapular exanthema (MPE) due to CBZ and PHT (OR = 6.38; 95% CI: 1.46-27.75; OR = 4.60; 95% CI: 1.54-13.72, respectively). Among the severe cADRs, HLA-B(star)57:01(OR = 11.00 95% CI: 1.41-85.81) and HLA-DRB1(star)-07:01 (OR = 7.25; 95% CI: 1.09-48.18) were noted to be significantly associated with CBZ-induced Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS)/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN); HLA-B (star)51:01 was associated with drug reaction eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) caused by PHT (OR = 6.90; 95% CI: 1.38-34.29).
   Conclusions: We found significant associations of some HLA alleles with specific cADRs to CBZ and PHT in North Indians, which may need to be tested before AED-initiation; only screening for HLA-B(star)15:02 may not help in this population.

AB  - Purpose: Cardiac changes accompanying seizures may be responsible for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), and drugs with antiseizure and favorable cardiovascular profile could be beneficial. The effect of losartan and enalapril alone and in combination with sodium valproate on seizures, cognition, cardiac histopathology, and serum brain-derived ncurotropic factor (BDNF) levels were determined.
   Methods: Male "Wistar" rats (200-250 g) were administered enalapril (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and losartan (10 mg/kg, i.p.) daily and simultaneously subjected to pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-kindling (PTZ 30 mg/kg,VIZ 30 i.p., every alternate day). Enalapril and losartan were injected 45 & 120 min before seizure stimuli. In another set of experiments, sodium valproate (150 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in combination with enalapril (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and losartan (10 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered daily during induction of kindling. The effect on seizures and behavior were noted; rats were sacrificed, and blood and hearts were collected for further analysis, i.e., BDNF levels, heart weight-body weight (HWBW) ratio, and cardiac histopathology.
   Results: losartan, but not enalapril, suppressed the seizure score in PTZ kindling. Sodium valproate alone or in combination with losartan or enalapril prevented kindled seizures. Sodium valproate per se caused cognitive impairment, which was prevented on combining with losartan or enalapril. A decrease in HWBW ratio was observed only in enalapril group (p value = 0.02). Kindling led to cardiac ischemic changes, which could be prevented by losartan and sodium valproate. Serum BDNF level was decreased in PTZ (p value = 0.02) and sodium valproate per se group (p value = 0.04), but sodium valproate could reverse the PTZ-induced decrease in serum BDNF level.
   Conclusion: The use of losartan with sodium valproate in epilepsy may prevent the cognitive and cardiac sequelae of seizures. The BDNF levels as a marker for cardiovascular risk in persons with epilepsy (PWE) needs to be explored further. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective The modulatory role of prolactin in autoimmune regulation is well established. Hyperprolactinemia is often associated with autoimmune disease like systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thyroid diseases. The objective was to compare levels of direct and indirect autoimmune factors in different categories of hyperprolactinemia cases and predict the direction of association between hyperprolactinemia and autoimmune factors, if any. Methods A total of 102 hyperprolactinemia cases (>100 ng/mL serum prolactin level) were included along with 24 controls. Among 102 hyperprolactinemia cases, there were 36 idiopathic cases, 19 pituitary adenoma cases, 36 drug-induced cases, and 11 cases associated with other secondary/systemic diseases (chronic renal failure, chronic hepatic failure, etc). Measurements Direct autoimmune markers, IL-2, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-5, were measured in serum by ELISA. Indirect autoimmune markers, anti-TPO, anti-tg, anti-CCP, VDRL, platelet count, and aPTT, were measured as per laboratory-defined protocol. Results Serum levels of IL-4 and anti-TPO were significantly high in idiopathic hyperprolactinemia cases. Serum IL-4 levels were also significantly high in pituitary adenoma cases, drug-induced cases, and in cases with other secondary causes of hyperprolactinemia. Serum anti-TPO levels were also significantly high in drug-induced hyperprolactinemia cases. Conclusion No significant difference in autoimmune factors is observed between macroprolactinemia and true hyperprolactinemia. Serum IL-4 and anti-TPO were high in all categories of hyperprolactinemia. This suggests a possible association of hyperprolactinemia with autoimmune conditions (high IL-4 and anti-TPO), mostly subclinical. Thus, hyperprolactinemia case with serum prolactin level >100 ng/mL may require long-term follow-up for the development of autoimmune disease in future.

AB  - Objective Digoxin is widely used in patients with rheumatic heart disease (RHD) despite a lack of data on its impact on clinical outcomes. We aimed to determine the association of digoxin use on clinical outcomes in patients with RHD.
   Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the association of digoxin use with mortality at 2 years in a large RHD registry. Secondary outcomes were recurrent heart failure (HF) and hospitalisation for any cause. We assessed associations using multivariable logistic regression in the entire cohort and in subgroups of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and HF. We also estimated average treatment effects from propensity-adjusted analyses using inverse probability treatment weighting.
   Results Information on digoxin use at baseline was available for 98.7% (3298/3343) of patients. In the overall population, digoxin was significantly associated with mortality (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.30 to 2.04, p<0.0001) and recurrent HF (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.04, p=0.019). On propensity-weighted analyses, this effect was markedly attenuated (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09, p=0.005). Patients in sinus rhythm without HF had a higher propensity-adjusted odds of death with digoxin use (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12, p=0.015), but those with both AF and HF had lower mortality (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.98, p=0.019).
   Conclusion Digoxin use is associated with higher mortality in patients with RHD, but this is greatly attenuated on propensity adjustment, indicating the presence of substantial treatment bias. The adjusted estimates may therefore not be reliable, and large randomised trials are needed to determine the true effect of digoxin in patients with RHD.

AB  - Background & objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is an important risk factor for tuberculosis and has received increasing emphasis. However, the reverse association of tuberculosis impacting blood sugar levels has not been well studied. The present study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of hyperglycemia in patients with tuberculosis and assess its resolution following successful treatment of tuberculosis.
   Methods: In this prospective study, a total of 582 patients with tuberculosis were evaluated for hyperglycaemia [DM or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)] with random blood sugar (RBS) and all patients with RBS 100 mg/dl were subjected to a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). All patients received thrice weekly intermittent Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS) for tuberculosis. Patients with hyperglycaemia were re-evaluated at the end of anti-tuberculosis treatment with an OGTT and glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels to assess for glycaemic status.
   Results: In the present study, 41 of the 582 patients were found to have DM [7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (5.2, 9.4)] while 26 patients were found to have IGT [4.5%, 95% CI (3, 6.5)]. Three patients were lost to follow up. Of the 26 patients with IGT, 17 [65.4%, 95% CI (46.1, 80.7)] reverted to euglycaemic status following successful treatment of tuberculosis, while the blood sugar levels improved in all patients with DM following treatment of tuberculosis.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our study results show that tuberculosis adversely impacts glycaemic status with improvement in blood sugar levels at the end of successful treatment of tuberculosis. Longitudinal studies with large sample size are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver without any history of chronic alcohol consumption. It encompasses a wide spectrum of diseases that range from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. NAFLD is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance / type-2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome. NAFLD is a complex disorder; environmental and genetic factors interact with NAFLD manifestation and determine its progression. In this review, an attempt was made to provide current information on the genetic variants of NAFLD in Asian populations. Literature search was performed by using PubMed, Medline and Google Scholar database. Candidate gene, validation and genomewide association studies (GWASs) were included in this review. A total of 41 studies fulfilled inclusion criteria of which 12 candidate gene studies exclusively focussed on the PNPLA3 gene and 17 other studies on other important candidate genes such as NCAN-CILP2, PPARG, AGTR1, FABP1, APOC3 etc. reported significant association with NAFLD. Eight validation studies identified associations of variants on PNPLA3, LYPLAL1, TM6SF2, ADIPOR2, STAT3, GCKR, SAMM50 etc. with NAFLD. Thus, so far, four GWASs have been conducted in Asian population that reported PNPLA3, SAMM50, PARVB and GATAD2A genes which were significantly associated with NAFLD. Findings indicate that PNPLA3, APOC3, PPARG, NCAN and GCKR genes emerge out to be the important biological markers associated with NAFLD.

AB  - Recently conducted human phase- I trials showed protective effect of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The V3 region of the HIV-1 envelope is highly conserved as it is the co-receptor binding site, and is highly immunogenic. Recombinant single-chain antibody fragments (scFvs) can serve as potential tools for construction of chimeric/bispecific antibodies that can target different epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope. Previously, we have constructed a V3 specific human scFv phage recombinant library by a combinational approach of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformation and antigen (V3) preselection, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), from a subtype C HIV-1 infected antiretroviral naive donor. In the present study, by biopanning this recombinant scFv phage library with V3B (subtype B) and V3C (subtype C) peptides, we identified unique cross reactive anti-V3 scFv monoclonals. These scFvs demonstrated cross-neutralizing activity when tested against subtype A, subtype B, and subtype C viruses. Further, molecular modeling of the anti-V3 scFvs with V3C and V3B peptides predicted their sites of interaction with the scFvs, providing insights for future immunogen design studies. A large collection of such monoclonal antibody fragments with diverse epitope specificities can be useful immunotherapeutic reagents along with antiretroviral drugs to prevent HIV-1 infection and disease progression.

AB  - The aim of study was to assess the combined effectiveness of structured teaching program (STP) and patient information pamphlet (PIS) on caregivers knowledge with regard to domiciliary management of seizure as compared with PIS alone. Study participants included caregivers of typically developing children aged 1-18 years with at least one episode of convulsion. The enrolled participants were allocated to either of the two groups: intervention group (STP along with PIS) and control group (PIS). The outcome was measured by a structured questionnaire - 'first-aid measures knowledge questionnaire'. Baseline knowledge scores were recorded and compared with postintervention scores measured at one-month follow-up. The preintervention knowledge scores were comparable in the two groups (p = 0.72). The control group has shown no significant difference in the knowledge scores at one-month follow-up (p = 0.58). Postintervention knowledge scores (p < 0.01) and mean difference in the knowledge scores (p < 0.01) were significantly higher in the intervention group when compared with controls. Structured teaching program regarding first-aid measures for convulsion along with PIS was effective in improving the knowledge of caregivers than PIS alone. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: To report the cases with features of macular telangiectasia type II and pachychoroid spectrum of macular disorders simultaneously. Methods: It is a retrospective case series from a tertiary eye care center. Multimodal imaging features of these eyes including color fundus photographs, red free imaging, short-wave autofluorescence, fundus fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, and optical coherence tomography were studied. Results: Six eyes of three patients having combination of macular telangiectasia type II and pachychoroid group of disorders were found. Three eyes showed features of central serous chorioretinopathy, one eye had polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, one eye had pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy and one had thickened choroid. Conclusion: This is the first report of macular telangiectasia type II in association with the pachychoroid spectrum of macular disorders and provides insight into possible common etiopathogenetic mechanisms.

AB  - PurposeThere has been a recent interest in the association of macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 with central serous choroidopathy and other pachychoroid disorders. This study was performed to assess the subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) in patients with MacTel type 2 and compare it with healthy controls using swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT).MethodsIt was a retrospective case-control study performed at a tertiary eye care center. The cases constituted patients with MacTel type 2 detected over the last 2years (April 2016 to March 2018). The controls were healthy adults with no posterior segment pathology. The patients were evaluated with color fundus photography, SS-OCT (Triton, Topcon Inc., Oakland, New Jersey, USA) and fundus fluorescein angiography. The cases were staged based on Gass and Blodi classification. SFCT was compared between the two groups.ResultsSixty-five eyes of 33 patients with MacTel were included. The controls consisted of 61 eyes of 33 healthy age-matched (p=0.81) and sex-matched (p=0.31) adults. The mean SFCT in cases (353.091.2m) was higher than controls (289.2 +/- 69.0m), and this difference was statistically significant (p=0.0001). The mean SFCT was different in various stages: 346.6 +/- 86.3m (stage 2), 334.6 +/- 90.2m (stage 3), 374.6 +/- 94.0m (stage 4), and 294.8 +/- 68.8m (stage 5), though this was not statistically significant (p=0.28).Conclusions The choroid in MacTel type 2 patients was significantly thickened as compared to controls. SFCT may vary as the structural changes worsen over time.

TI  - A global consensus statement on ashy dermatosis, erythema dyschromicum perstans, lichen planus pigmentosus, idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation, and Riehl's melanosis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - CHILD
AB  - Ashy dermatosis (AD), lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP), erythema dyschromicum perstans (EDP), and idiopathic eruptive macular pigmentation are several acquired macular hyperpigmentation disorders of uncertain etiology described in literature. Most of the published studies on these disorders are not exactly comparable, as there are no clear definitions and different regions in the world describe similar conditions under different names. A consensus on the terminology of various morphologies of acquired macular pigmentation of uncertain etiology was a long-felt need. Several meetings of pigmentary disorders experts were held to address this problem. A consensus was reached after several meetings and collation of e-mailed questionnaire responses and e-mail communications among the authors of publications on the above conditions. This was achieved by a global consensus forum on AD, LPP, and EDP, established after the 22nd International Pigment Cell Conference held in Singapore in 2014. Thirty-nine experts representing 18 countries participated in the deliberations. The main focus of the deliberations was terminology of the conditions; as such, we present here the consensus statement of the forum and briefly review the available literature on the subject. We have not attempted to discuss treatment modalities in detail.

AB  - Celiac disease, once thought to be very uncommon in Asia, is now emerging in many Asian countries. Although the absolute number of patients with celiac disease at present is not very high, this number is expected to increase markedly over the next few years/decades owing to increasing awareness. It is now that the medical community across the Asia should define the extent of the problem and prepare to handle the impending epidemic of celiac disease in Asia.

AB  - Background: The Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (OUKR) has achieved excellent functional outcomes and long term survivorship in many single center and single surgeon series. However, in national registries, the failure rates are up to three times higher than total knee replacement. This is at least in part due to difficulty experienced by low-volume surgeons in implanting the prosthesis accurately. A new instrumentation system (Microplasty) was introduced to help surgeons achieve better component positioning, however, it is not known whether the new instruments achieve that goal. This study investigates whether the new system achieves better component positioning and whether it improves the clinical outcomes when compared to the existing instruments. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study compared 50 consecutive OUKR implanted using the conventional Phase 3 instrumentation with 100 consecutive OUKR implanted using the new Microplasty instrumentation. Component orientation was measured on postoperative radiographs, and the percentage outside the recommended range was identified. Intraoperative data and retrospectively collected clinical data were also analyzed. Results: Femoral component alignment improved significantly, and there were no outliers in the Microplasty group. Although there were fewer tibial component alignment outliers with Microplasty, the difference was not significant. The intraoperative incidence of tibial recut, patient satisfaction and patient expectations was significantly better in the Microplasty group. The Oxford Knee Scores were also better with Microplasty, however, the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Microplasty instrumentation helps the surgeon achieve optimal component positioning and reduces the need for tibial recut. The clinical outcomes are also better with the Microplasty instrumentation.

AB  - Oxford unicompartmental knee replacement (OUKR) has shown excellent long-term clinical outcomes as well as implant survival when used for correct indications with optimal surgical technique. Anteromedial osteoarthritis is highly prevalent in Indian patients, and OUKR is the ideal treatment option in such cases. Uncertainty prevails about the best method to determine femoral component size in OUKR. Preoperative templating has been shown to be inaccurate, while height- and gender-based guidelines based on European population might not apply to the Indian patients. Microplasty instrumentation introduced in 2012 introduced the sizing spoon, which has the dual function of femoral component sizing and determining the level of tibia cut. We aimed to check the accuracy of sizing spoon and also to determine whether the present guidelines are appropriate for use in the Indian patients. A total of 130 consecutive Oxford mobile bearing medial cemented UKR performed using the Microplasty instrumentation were included. The ideal femoral component size for each knee was recorded by looking for overhang and underhang in post-operative lateral knee radiograph. The accuracy of previous guidelines was determined by applying them to our study population. Previously published guidelines (which were based on Western population) proved to be accurate in only 37% of cases. Hence, based on the demographics of our study population, we formulated modified height- and genderbased guidelines, which would better suit the Indian population. Accuracy of modified guidelines was estimated to be 74%. The overall accuracy of sizing spoon (75%), when used as an intraoperative guide, was similar to that of modified guidelines. Existing guidelines for femoral component sizing do not work in Indian patients. Modified guidelines and use of intraoperative spoon should be used to choose the optimal implant size while performing OUKR in Indian patients.

AB  - Introduction: Substance use among adolescents is on the rise across the globe along with a diminution of gender gap observed earlier posing a huge public health burden. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of literature on adolescent substance use. The literature is even sparse about substance use among adolescent girls. The current study aims to provide a glimpse of the profile and pattern of substance use among Indian adolescent girls seeking treatment for substance use problems in a specialty addiction treatment centre in India.
   Materials and methods: This study is retrospective in design. Information regarding socio-demographics and substance use were extracted from the medical records of adolescent girls (<= 19 years) who sought treatment for substance use problems during 2004-2018, at the adolescent clinic of a tertiary addiction treatment centre located in north India was retrieved carried out. The data was statistically analysed using SPSS.
   Results: A total of 28 girls sought treatment during this period. The mean age of the girls was 15.89 +/- 2.72 years. Most of the girls were students (6/28) or had never started working (12/28). Majority of them were coming from an urban background (89.3%) and were educated up to 10th class (85.5%). A total of 17 (60.7%) girls sought treatment for opioids use of which 11 were using illicit opioids like heroin and five (29.9%) of them reported taking opioids by injecting route primarily. History of past abstinence attempts, and treatment attempt were present in very few of them (10.7% and 14.3%).
   Conclusion: Our study suggests a distinct substance use profile of adolescent girls. There is a need for further systematic studies to assess their clinical needs.

AB  - Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is the most common childhood idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM). It is characterized by the classic skin rash in the form of Gottron papules and heliotrope rash, and symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Renal involvement in JDM is rare which includes acute kidney injury and glomerulonephritis. We report a 10-year-old boy with juvenile dermatomyositis and IgA nephropathy. Child responded dramatically to the conventional therapy with steroids and methotrexate for the primary disease, and did not require any additional treatment for his renal disease. Child's primary disease is in remission and has normal urinalysis with normal renal function at 6-month follow-up. We reviewed the literature and found 11 cases of IIMs with renal involvement. Four patients (one JDM, two polymyositis, and one dermatomyositis) had IgA nephropathy out of which three patients responded to the conventional therapy of primary disease and only one patient with polymyositis needed hiking immunosuppression targeted for renal condition. Therapy targeting the underlying disorder is usually sufficient in patients with JDM and secondary IgA nephropathy.

KW  - PROPOSAL
AB  - BACKGROUND: Split cord malformation (SCM) is a rare congenital anomaly of the spinal cord. Rarely, SCM coexists with a variety of dysraphic pathologies that occur at the same or different spinal level in a patient. Exceptionally rare is the occurrence of SCM type 1 and lipomeningomyelocele of each hemicord.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 15-month-old girl presented with gradually progressive, painless swelling in the lower back since birth. Spinal imaging showed the presence of type I SCM associated with lipomeningomyelocele of each hemicord. Surgical exploration and detethering was done.
   CONCLUSIONS: Management of such complex cases of spinal dysraphism is challenging. Delineating their embryologic basis, detailed radiologic assessment, and meticulous microneurosurgical techniques are the cornerstone for successful management.

AB  - Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) serves as an independent biomarker for acute and chronic inflammation, and is also associated with metabolic diseases. Genomewide loci regulating CRP level in Indian population, a high-risk group for metabolic illness, is unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to discover common polymorphisms associated with plasma CRP level in 4493 Indians of Indo-European origin using genomewide association study. Genomewide strong associations of two known intronic variants in hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 gene (HNF1A) were identified among Indian subjects. We also detected prior associations of several variants in/near metabolic and inflammatory process genes: APOC1, LEPR, CRP, HNF4A, IL6R and APOE with modest associations. This study confirms that Indians from Indo-European origin display similar core universal genetic factors for CRP levels.

AB  - The probable chain of events responsible for choroidal rupture is as follows. During high-speed orbital injuries, the protective ocular reflexes position the eye in an elevated, and abducted position. At this point in time, the anteroposterior compressive forces on to the globe create an eccentrically positioned circle of damaging currents along the posterior ocular coats against a relatively static optic nerve. Because of this eccentricity, a longer radius of curvature is expected to lie along the temporal half of the globe leading to an elastic recoil of the retinal and scleral layers and a fracture along the RPE-Bruch's-Choriocapillaris complex manifesting clinically as choroidal rupture.

AB  - The etiopathologies behind autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs) unravel misbehavior of immune components leading to the corruption of immune homeostasis where thyroid autoantigens turn foe to the self. In AITDs lymphocytic infiltration in the thyroid shows up a deranged immune system charging the follicular cells of the thyroid gland (thyrocytes) leading to the condition of either hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. The inflammation in AITDs consistently associate with ER function due to which disturbances in the ER protein homeostasis leads to unfolded protein response (UPR) that promotes pathogenesis of autoimmunity. The roles of ER stress in the instantaneous downregulation of MHC class I molecules on thyrocytes and the relevance of IFN gamma in the pathogenesis of AITD has been well-documented. Thyroglobulin being the major target of autoantibodies in most of the AITDs is because of its unusual processing in the ER. Autoimmune disorders display a conglomeration of ER stress-induced UPR activated molecules. Several epidemiological data highlight the preponderance of AITDs in women as well as its concurrence with breast cancer. Both being an active glandular system displaying endocrine activity, thyroid as well as breast tissue show various commonalities in the expression pattern of heterogenous molecules that not only participate in the normal functioning but at the same time share the blame during disease establishment. Studies on the development and progression of breast carcinoma display a deranged and uncontrolled immune response, which is meticulously exploited during tumor metastasis. The molecular crosstalks between AITDs and breast tumor microenvironment rely on active participation of immune cells. The induction of ER stress by Tunicamycin advocates to provide a model for cancer therapy by intervening glycosylation. Therefore, this review attempts to showcase the molecules that are involved in feeding up the relationship between breast carcinoma and AITDs.

AB  - Background and purposeMitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant late-onset polyglutamine ataxia that results from an unstable expansion of a CAG tract in the ATXN3 gene. The size of the CAG tract only partially explains age at onset (AO), highlighting the existence of disease modifiers. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups have been associated with clinical presentation in other polyglutamine disorders, constituting potential modifiers of MJD phenotype.
   MethodsA cross-sectional study, using 235 unrelated patients from Portugal, Brazil, India and Japan, was performed to investigate if mtDNA haplogroups contribute to AO of MJD. mtDNA haplogroups were obtained after sequencing the mtDNA hypervariable region I. Patients were classified in 15 phylogenetically related haplogroup clusters.
   ResultsThe AO was significantly different among populations, implying the existence of other non-CAG factors, which seem to be population specific. In the Portuguese population, patients classified as belonging to haplogroup JT presented the earliest onset (estimated onset 34.6years of age). Haplogroups W and X seem to have a protective effect, causing a delay in onset (estimated onset 47years of age). No significant association between haplogroup clusters and AO was detected in the other populations or when all patients were pooled. Although haplogroup JT has already been implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, no previous reports of an association between haplogroups W and X and disease were found.
   ConclusionsThese findings suggest that haplogroups JT, W and X modify AO in MJD. Replication studies should be performed in European populations, where the frequency of the candidate modifiers is similar.

AB  - The Mental Healthcare Act (MHCA), 2017, is enacted with an aim to promote and protect the rights of and improve the care and treatment for people affected by mental illness in India. The Act purportedly includes substance use disorder (SUD) specifically in the definition of mental illness itself. However, some of the phrases used in the definition such as "abuse" are not clear, as the current classificatory systems of mental illnesses do not have any diagnostic category termed "abuse." Another important issue is the lack of clarity on which categories of SUD would be covered under MHCA. Simple reading of the text of the Act seems to suggest that SUD is a single entity for the purpose of this law. In such case, many provisions of the act such as supported admission that are meant for the treatment of people with severe mental illnesses with gross impairment may become applicable to all types of SUD. This can create potential problems for addiction treatment providers. On the other hand, certain other provisions of the Act are good news for patients suffering from SUD. The Act lays down various rights that include, among others, protection from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment in any mental health establishment. This is very important from the perspective of treatment of SUD in the context of India, where human rights violations in the name of addiction treatment are often reported. The inclusion of SUD in MHCA, 2017, slots SUD as a health issue, rather than a law-and-order issue alone. This displays the intent of policymakers toward SUD, which, in itself, is laudable. There are certain ways in which the potential pitfalls mentioned earlier can be addressed, which is discussed in the article.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the proportion of children fulfilling "Sepsis-3" definition and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference definition among children diagnosed to have septic shock and compare the mortality risk between the two groups.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Setting: PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital from 2014 to 2017.
   Patients: Children (<= 17 yr old) with a diagnosis of septic shock at admission or during PICU stay.
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Main Results: We applied both International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference and the new "Sepsis-3" definition (sepsis with hypotension requiring vasopressors and a lactate value of <= 2 mmol/L) to identify cases of septic shock by these definitions. Key outcomes such as mortality, proportion attaining shock reversal at 24 hours and organ dysfunction were compared between those fulfilling "Sepsis-3" definitions ("Sepsis-3" group) and those fulfilling " International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference" definition (" International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference" group). A total of 216 patients fulfilled International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference definitions of septic shock. Of these, only 104 (48%; 95% CI, 42-55) fulfilled "Sepsis-3" definition. Children fulfilling "Sepsis-3 plus International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference definitions" ("Sepsis-3 and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference" group) had lower proportion with shock resolution (61% vs 82%; relative risk, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88) and higher risk of multiple organ dysfunction (85% vs 68%; 1.24; 1.07-1.45) at 24 hours. The mortality was 48.5% in "Sepsis-3 and International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference" group as compared with 37.5% in the " International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference only" group (relative risk, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.94-1.75).
   Conclusions: Less than half of children with septic shock identified by International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference definitions were observed to fulfill the criteria for shock as per "Sepsis-3" definitions. Lack of difference in the risk of mortality between children who fulfilled "Sepsis-3" definition and those who did not fulfill the definition raises questions on the appropriateness of using this definition for diagnosis of septic shock in children.

AB  - PurposeTo discuss the clinical features, differential diagnosis and the novel confocal microscopic findings noted in the rare deep blue dot corneal degeneration'.MethodsObservational case report.ResultsSlit-lamp biomicroscopic examination revealed bilateral, numerous, circular to oval discrete blue opacities at the level of deep stroma and fine grey linear opacities at the level of mid to deep stroma. Confocal microscopy demonstrated two types of corresponding hyper-reflective extracellular lesions: oval deposit-like, most concentrated at a depth of 430-480 mu and needle-like at the depth 330-370 mu.ConclusionsDeep blue dot corneal degeneration is a rare entity where blue deposits of amyloid are seen in the deep corneal stroma. It should be considered as a differential diagnosis when an old-aged person presents with good vision and the above mentioned findings.

AB  - Invasive fungal infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality particularly in high-risk patients. Recognizing such infections is often difficult because of non-specific symptoms and clinical signs. Timely diagnosis is also a challenge due to difficulty in obtaining adequate volume of samples, need for anaesthesia to perform certain diagnostic procedures, and insufficient data and experience related to fungal biomarkers and molecular detection tests. This results in widespread use of empiric broad spectrum antifungal agents with the consequent emergence of drug-resistant strains. This review focusses on the definition, clinical and microbial profile and diagnostic modalities for invasive fungal infections.

AB  - Background & objectives: Azithromycin has been in use as an alternate treatment option for enteric fever even when the guidelines on the susceptibility testing were not available. There is lack of data on susceptibility and mechanisms of resistance of azithromycin in Salmonella Typhi and S. Paratyphi A. The aim of the present study was to determine the azithromycin susceptibility and resistance mechanisms in typhoidal salmonellae isolates archived in a tertiary care centre in north India for a period of 25 years.
   Methods: Azithromycin susceptibility was determined in 602 isolates of S. Typhi (469) and S. Paratyphi A (133) available as archived collection isolated during 1993 to 2016, by disc diffusion and E-test method. PCR was done for ereA, ermA, ermB, ermC, mefA, mphA and msrA genes from plasmid and genomic DNA and sequencing was done to detect mutations in acrR, rplD and rplV genes.
   Results: Azithromycin susceptibility was seen in 437/469 [93.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 90.5 to 95.1%] isolates of S. Typhi. Amongst 133 isolates of S. Paratyphi A studied, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <= 16 mg/l was found in 102 (76.7%; 95% CI, 68.8 to 83.0). MIC value ranged between 1.5 and 32 mg/l with an increasing trend in MIC50 and MIC90 with time. Mutations were found in acrR in one and rplV in two isolates of S. Typhi. No acquired mechanism for macrolide resistance was found.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Azithromycin could be considered as a promising agent against typhoid fever on the basis of MIC distribution in India. However, due to emergence of resistance in some parts, there is a need for continuous surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance mechanisms. There is also a need to determine the breakpoints for S. Paratyphi A.

AB  - Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is an approach to reconstruct electrical resistivity images of the body noninvasively. Here we present a novel wireless high-speed frequency division multiplexing and flexible switching-based EIT system with increased temporal resolution using raspberry pi. Proposed multi-frequency electrical impedance system has good performance, portable, energy and cost-efficient. Current is injected to all the electrodes simultaneously having different frequencies which increase the speed for capturing the fast change in impedances. Proposed system can reconstruct real-time 2D images for continuously monitoring applications where impedance changes rapidly. It can capture 70 frames/sec, and its power consumption is 10 mW. The system is designed for a bandwidth of 1 kHz-1 MHz, which covers most of the medical impedance investigations. Performance of the system was measured at 25 KHz by calculating parameter of blur radius (PBR) and percentage of position error (PPE). Average PBR and PPE obtained were 0.985 and 7.24%, respectively. SNR, linearity and stability were calculated after proper calibration by applying a small current of . SNR of the system is more than 70 dB. Amplitude and phase measurement repeatability were 0.7% and , respectively. CMRR of both wired and wireless systems were measured to find the effect of noise on the wireless system. Result shows that the proposed WMFEIT system has comparable performance with the reference systems and has good scope to be used for clinical imaging applications.

AB  - Background We report the prevalence, risk factors and mortality associated with multimorbidity in urban South Asian adults.
   Methods Hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and chronic kidney disease were measured at baseline in a sample of 16 287 adults ages >= 20 years in Delhi, Chennai and Karachi in 2010-11 followed for an average of 38 months. Multimorbidity was defined as having >= 2 chronic conditions at baseline. We identified correlates of multimorbidity at baseline using multinomial logistic models, and we assessed the prospective association between multimorbidity and mortality using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results The adjusted prevalence of multimorbidity was 9.4%; multimorbidity was highest in adults who were aged >= 60 years (37%), consumed alcohol (12.3%), body mass index >= 25 m/kg(2) (14.1%), high waist circumference (17.1%) and had family history of a chronic condition (12.4%). Compared with adults with no chronic conditions, the fully adjusted relative hazard of death was twice as high in adults with two morbidities (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6, 3.3) and thrice as high in adults with >= 3 morbidities (HR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.9, 5.1).
   Conclusion Multimorbidity affects nearly 1 in 10 urban South Asians, and each additional morbidity carries a progressively higher risk of death. Identifying locally appropriate strategies for prevention and coordinated management of multimorbidity will benefit population health in the region.

AB  - Classical protein kinase C (cPKC) enzymes are ser/thr protein kinases that have been an important factor in regulating a variety of cellular functions required for both in terms of health and disease. Therefore, precise control of cPKC-mediated signal is necessary for cellular homeostasis; however, their dysregulation leads to the development of several pathophysiological conditions including cancer. In cellular microenvironment, cPKC-mediated signaling is accompanied by multiple molecular mechanisms including phosphorylation, second messenger binding, and scaffold proteins. Functional cPKC interacts with a number of cellular proteins involved in the regulation of multiple biological functions such as cell growth, survival, migration, and adhesion. Further, the role of cPKC varies from cell to cell, substrate to substrate and, therefore, it is plausible to assume that the dysregulation of cPKC activity causes cellular transformation. Currently, there is no sufficient literature available to provide better understating to develop an effective therapeutic regimen to reverse pathophysiological condition caused by functionally dysregulated cPKC. Therefore, in the present review, we have focused on to provide a better and detail information on the various aspects of cPKC such as structure, mode of activation, regulation, and distinct cellular functions useful for the development of an effective therapeutic regimen against the breast cancer.

AB  - Objective The present study aimed to assess the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment targeting either supplementary motor area (SMA) or orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) among patients with OCD in real-world clinical practice settings. Also, the present study explored for potential predictors of response to rTMS treatment. Methods Retrospective review and analysis of records of 79 patients with medication-refractory OCD, all of whom had received 20 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS as part of routine clinical care. Of 79 patients, 46 received rTMS over the bilateral SMA and 33 over the left OFC. A reduction of 25% and 35% in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) scores was used to classify outcome as partial and complete response, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 23.0. Results There was a significant decrease in mean YBOCS score from baseline to end of treatment (7.68 +/- 5.62; t = 12.14, P < 0.001). Forty-five patients (57%) met criteria for partial response, of which 32 patients (40.5%) showed complete response. There was no significant difference in outcomes between patients receiving rTMS over SMA or OFC. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed presence of comorbid depression and higher baseline YBOCS score to be associated with lesser likelihood of response to rTMS. Conclusions This study provided evidence for overall effectiveness of adjunctive 1-Hz rTMS treatment over either SMA or OFC in patients with medication-refractory OCD, and reported comorbid depression and higher pretreatment YBOCS scores as potential predictors of poor response to rTMS.

AB  - Introduction: Studies have shown that Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is not a good tool to predict obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, data regarding the accuracy of ESS in the prediction of OSA among morbidly obese patients are scarce. Methods: The study involved a retrospective review of the charts of the consecutive patients who underwent bariatric surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital. All the patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) and undertook the ESS questionnaire. The sensitivity and specificity of ESS were calculated based on its correlation with the PSG findings. Furthermore, a new score was devised to improve the utility of ESS to predict OSA. Results: A total of 232 consecutive patients from January 2014 to July 2017 were included in the study. The mean age and body mass index (BMI) were 40.511.8 years and 47.6 +/- 7.3kg/m(2), respectively. Among the 162 patients who had an ESS <10, 57.4% had moderate-to-severe OSA. The sensitivity of ESS to predict moderate-to-severe OSA was found to be 38.8% and the positive predictive value was 84.2% (positive likelihood ratio 2.82, 95% confidence interval=1.57-5.06). A predictive score was identified as 0.031Age (years) +0.039BMI (kg/m(2)) + 0.038ESS + Gender (1 for male, 0 for female). The score had a sensitivity of 80% at a cutoff of 3.3. Conclusions: Among the morbidly obese, ESS is a poor predictor of OSA. Its utility as a tool for prediction of moderate-to-severe OSA can be improved by use of a new formula incorporating age, gender, and BMI beside ESS.

AB  - Waardenburg syndrome (WS) is a disorder of neural crest cell migration characterized by auditory and pigmentary abnormalities. We investigated a cohort of 14 families (16 subjects) either by targeted sequencing or whole-exome sequencing. Thirteen of these families were clinically diagnosed with WS and one family with isolated non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL). Intra-familial phenotypic variability and non-penetrance were observed in families diagnosed with WS1, WS2 and WS4 with pathogenic variants in PAX3, MITF and EDNRB, respectively. We observed gonosomal mosaicism for a variant in PAX3 in an asymptomatic father of two affected siblings. For the first time, we report a biallelic pathogenic variant in MITF in a subject with WS2 and a biallelic variant in EDNRB was noted in a subject with WS2. An individual with isolated NSHL carried a pathogenic variant in MITF. Blended phenotype of NSHL and albinism was observed in a subject clinically diagnosed to have WS2. A phenocopy of WS1 was observed in a subject with a reported pathogenic variant in GJB2, known to cause isolated NSHL. These novel and infrequently reported observations exemplify the allelic and genetic heterogeneity and show phenotypic diversity of WS.

AB  - Background and aimsIn clinical studies, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir has demonstrated high cure rates and favorable tolerability in patients chronically infected with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) of any genotype. We evaluated the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir administered with minimal medical monitoring to patients in India. MethodsAt 16 sites in India, 129 adult patients with chronic HCV infection of any genotype initiated 12weeks of once-daily sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (400-100mg). Patients with compensated cirrhosis or prior treatment experience could be included in the study. Study drug was dispensed monthly, but there were no on-treatment study assessments. The primary efficacy endpoint was rate of sustained virologic response (HCV RNA<15IU/mL) 12weeks after treatment (SVR12), which was compared to a pre-specified performance goal of 85%.ResultsThe majority of patients had HCV genotype 3 infection (70%), followed by HCV genotype 1 (22%). The SVR12 rate was 93% (120/129; 95% CI, 87% to 97%) (p=0.009 compared with the 85% performance goal). Of the nine patients who did not achieve SVR12, 1 experienced virologic failure, 2 relapsed after treatment, 1 withdrew consent after treatment, and 5 were lost to follow-up (1 during and 4 after treatment). Sofosbuvir-velpatasvir was well-tolerated, and no patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache (3% of patients), upper abdominal pain (2%), and pyrexia (2%).ConclusionsIn this study conducted at multiple sites in India, sofosbuvir-velpatasvir administered without genotype restriction or on-treatment safety assessments was well-tolerated and highly effective.

AB  - Objectives: We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare del Nido (DN) and histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) cardioplegia solution in pediatric patients undergoing intracardiac tetralogy of Fallot repair.
   Methods: One hundred consecutive patients 12 years of age or younger, undergoing intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot were randomized into DN (n = 50) and HTK (n = 50) groups. Cardioplegia strategy consisted of a single dose of DN (20 mL/kg) or HTK (6 mL/kg/min for 6 minutes). Primary outcome was cardiac index (CI). Secondary outcomes were ventricular arrhythmias post cross-clamp release, time to peripheral rewarming, duration of mechanical ventilation, inotropic score, intensive care unit and hospital stay, and serum levels of troponin-I, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Ultrastructural changes in the myocardium were assessed.
   Results: CI was significantly higher in the DN group compared with the HTK group at 6 (P = .005) and 24 hours (P<. 001) after surgery. It was on an average 0.44 L/min/m(2) higher in the DN group at any time point (P = .004). Time for complete cessation of electrical activity was longer in the HTK group (P = .01) and more patients in the HTK group had ventricular arrhythmias post cross-clamp release (P = .03). Duration of mechanical ventilation (P = .006), intensive care unit stay (P = .05), and hospital stay (P<. 001) were lower in the DN group. Patients in the DN group had lower troponin I levels 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass (P<. 001). Electron microscopic studies showed more myocardial edema (P = .02) and myofibrillar disarray (P =.04) in the HTK group along with lower glycogen stores (P = .04). DN cardioplegia was more cost-effective than HTK cardioplegia (P<. 001).
   Conclusions: DN cardioplegia was associated with better preservation of CI, less duration of mechanical ventilation, shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays, lower inotropic scores, and less release of troponin-I. Electron microscopy showed less myocardial edema and better preservation of the myofibrillar architecture and glycogen stores in the DN group.

AB  - BackgroundNeurosurgical management of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is challenging, with only low-quality evidence. We aimed to explore differences in neurosurgical strategies for TBI across Europe.MethodsA survey was sent to 68 centers participating in the Collaborative European Neurotrauma Effectiveness Research in Traumatic Brain Injury (CENTER-TBI) study. The questionnaire contained 21 questions, including the decision when to operate (or not) on traumatic acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) and intracerebral hematoma (ICH), and when to perform a decompressive craniectomy (DC) in raised intracranial pressure (ICP).ResultsThe survey was completed by 68 centers (100%). On average, 10 neurosurgeons work in each trauma center. In all centers, a neurosurgeon was available within 30min. Forty percent of responders reported a thickness or volume threshold for evacuation of an ASDH. Most responders (78%) decide on a primary DC in evacuating an ASDH during the operation, when swelling is present. For ICH, 3% would perform an evacuation directly to prevent secondary deterioration and 66% only in case of clinical deterioration. Most respondents (91%) reported to consider a DC for refractory high ICP. The reported cut-off ICP for DC in refractory high ICP, however, differed: 60% uses 25mmHg, 18% 30mmHg, and 17% 20mmHg. Treatment strategies varied substantially between regions, specifically for the threshold for ASDH surgery and DC for refractory raised ICP. Also within center variation was present: 31% reported variation within the hospital for inserting an ICP monitor and 43% for evacuating mass lesions.ConclusionDespite a homogeneous organization, considerable practice variation exists of neurosurgical strategies for TBI in Europe. These results provide an incentive for comparative effectiveness research to determine elements of effective neurosurgical care.

AB  - A major impediment to developing effective antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacteria like Salmonella is the ability of the bacteria to develop resistance against existing antibiotics and the inability of the antimicrobials to clear the intracellular bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal tract. As the critical balance of charge and hydrophobicity is required for effective membrane-targeting antimicrobials without causing any toxicity to mammalian cells, herein we report the synthesis and antibacterial properties of cholic acid derived amphiphiles conjugated with alkyl chains of varied hydrophobicity. Relative to other hydrophobic counterparts, a compound with hexyl chain (6) acted as an effective antimicrobial against different Gram-negative bacteria. Apart from its ability to permeate the outer and inner membranes of bacteria; compound 6 can cross the cellular and lysosomal barriers of epithelial cells and macrophages and kill the facultative intracellular bacteria without disrupting the mammalian cell membranes. Oral delivery of compound 6 was able to clear the Salmonella-mediated gut infection and inflammation, and was able to combat persistent, stationary, and multi-drug-resistant clinical strains. Therefore, our study reveals the ability of cholic acid-derived amphiphiles to clear intracellular bacteria and Salmonella-mediated gut infection and inflammation.

AB  - The presence of lipopolysaccharide and emergence of drug resistance make the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections highly challenging. Herein, we present the synthesis and antibacterial activities of cholic acid peptide conjugates (CAPs), demonstrating that valine - glycine dipeptide-derived CAP 3 is the most effective antimicrobial. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis revealed that a precise intramolecular network of CAP 3 is maintained in the form of evolving edges, suggesting intramolecular connectivity. Further, we found high conformational rigidity in CAP 3 that confers maximum perturbations in bacterial membranes relative to other small molecules. Interestingly, CAP 3-coated catheters did not allow the formation of biofilms in mice, and treatment of wound infections with CAP 3 was able to clear the bacterial infection. Our results demonstrate that molecular conformation and internal connectivity are critical parameters to describe the antimicrobial nature of compounds, and the analysis presented here may serve as a general principle for the design of future antimicrobials.

AB  - Background: Certain limitations of the existing opioid substitution therapies necessitate exploration of other options for maintenance of patients with opioid dependence. This study aimed to present the experience of use of tramadol for long-term treatment of patients with opioid dependence. Methods: This was a cross-sectional interview-based observational study conducted in Uttar Pradesh state in India. Patients with opioid dependence who received oral tramadol treatment for a period of more than 6 months were recruited. Outcome was assessed in terms of self-reported abstinence on tramadol. Results: A total of 102 participants were recruited in the study, with a mean age of 41.3 years. All the participants were males. Abstinence to extraneous opioids was reported by 58.8% of the sample, and the median dose of tramadol at which abstinence was achieved was 350 mg/d. Those who reported to be taking natural opioids (raw opium or poppy husk) at the time of seeking treatment had higher rates of achieving abstinence. Conclusions: Tramadol may be a possible option for the maintenance treatment among some opioid-dependent individuals. Further studies are required to establish its efficacy vis-a-vis other medications used in opioid substitution treatment.

TI  - Sub-national TB prevalence surveys in India, 2006-2012: Results of uniformly conducted data analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - TUBERCULOSIS
KW  - DISTRICT
KW  - BURDEN
AB  - Setting
   Community based tuberculosis (TB) prevalence surveys in ten sites across India during 2006-2012
   Objective
   To re-analyze data of recent sub-national surveys using uniform statistical methods and obtain a pooled national level estimate of prevalence of TB.
   Methods
   Individuals >= 15 years old were screened by interview for symptoms suggestive of Pulmonary TB (PTB) and history of anti-TB treatment; additional screening by chest radiography was undertaken in five sites. Two sputum specimens were examined by smear and culture among Screen-positives. Prevalence in each site was estimated after imputing missing values to correct for bias introduced by incompleteness of data. In five sites, prevalence was corrected for non-screening by radiography. Pooled prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB was estimated using Random Effects Model after excluding data from one site. Overall prevalence of TB (all ages, all types) was estimated by adjusting for extra-pulmonary TB and Pediatric TB.
   Results
   Of 769290 individuals registered, 715989 were screened by interview and 294532 also by radiography. Sputum specimen were examined from 50 852 individuals. Estimated prevalence of smear positive, culture positive and bacteriologically positive PTB varied between 108.4-428.1, 147.9-429.8 and 170.8-528.4 per 100000 populations in different sites. Pooled estimate of prevalence of bacteriologically positive PTB was 350.0 (260.7, 439.0). Overall prevalence of TB was estimated at 300.7 (223.7-377.5) in 2009, the mid-year of surveys. Prevalence was significantly higher in rural compared to urban areas.
   Conclusion
   TB burden continues to be high in India suggesting further strengthening of TB control activities.

AB  - Background: Previous studies, which were primarily based on the fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) technique, revealed conflicting evidence regarding male foetal microchimerism in endometriosis. FISH is a relatively less sensitive technique, as it is performed on a small portion of the sample. Additionally, the probes used in the previous studies specifically detected centromeric and telomeric regions of Y chromosome, which are gene-sparse heterochromatised regions. In the present study, a panel of molecular biology tools such as qPCR, expression microarray, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR were employed to examine the Y chromosome microchimerism in the endometrium using secretory phase samples from fertile and infertile patients with severe (stage IV) ovarian endometriosis (OE) and without endometriosis.
   Methods: Microarray expression analysis followed by validation using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR experiments at the RNA levels and further validation at the DNA level by qPCR of target inserts for selected targets in eutopic endometrium samples obtained from control (CON) and stage IV ovarian endometriosis (OE), either from fertile (FCON and FOE; n=30/each) or infertile (ICON and IOE; n=30/each) women, were performed.
   Results: Six coding (AMELY, PCDH11, SRY, TGIF2LY, TSPY3, and USP9Y) and 10 non-coding (TTTY2, TTTY4C, TTTY5, TTTYY6, TTTY8, TTTY10, TTTY14, TTTY21, TTTY22, and TTTY23) genes exhibited a bimodal pattern of expression characterised by low expression in samples from fertile patients and high expression in samples from infertile patients. Seven coding MSY-linked genes (BAGE, CD24, EIF1AY, NLGN4Y, PRKY, VCY and ZFY) exhibited differential regulation in microarray analysis, and this change was validated by RNA-seq or qRT-PCR. DNA inserts for 7 genes in various samples were validated by qPCR. The prevalence and concentration of PCR-positive target inserts for BAGE, PRKY, TTTY9A and ZFY displayed higher values in the fertile, control (FCON) patients compared with the fertile, endometriosis patients (FOE).
   Conclusion: Several coding and non-coding MSY-linked genes displayed microchimerism as evidenced by the presence of their respective DNA inserts, along with their differential transcript expression, in the endometrium during endometriosis and in cases of infertility.

AB  - Background: A previous laboratory study involving wild type, mutant and devR/dosR complemented strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis reported the attenuation phenotype of complemented strain, Comp1. This phenotype was intriguing since the parental strain H37Rv, devR mutant (Mut1) and additional complemented strains, Comp9 and Comp11, were virulent in the guinea pig model.
   Results: Towards deciphering the mechanism underlying the attenuation of Comp1, a whole genome sequencing approach was undertaken. Eight Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) unique to the Comp1 strain were identified. Of these, 5 SNPs were non-synonymous and included a G -> A mutation resulting in a W1591Stop mutation in ppsD gene of the phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) biosynthetic cluster. Targeted sequence analysis confirmed this mutation in only Comp1 strain and not in wild type (H37Rv), devR knockout (Mut1) or other complemented (Comp9 and Comp11) bacteria. Differential expression of the PDIM locus in Comp1 bacteria was observed which was associated with a partial deficiency of PDIM, an increased sensitivity to detergent and a compromised ability to infect human THP-1 cells.
   Conclusions: It is proposed that a spontaneous mutation in the ppsD gene of Comp1 underlies down-modulation of the PDIM locus which is associated with defects in permeability and infectivity as well as virulence attenuation in guinea pigs. Our study demonstrates the value of whole genome sequencing for resolving unexplainable bacterial phenotypes and recommends the assessment of PDIM status while assessing virulence properties of laboratory-manipulated strains of M. tuberculosis.

AB  - Purpose: Ensuring compliance to treatment protocol, especially regular visit to treating facility, is an important aspect of clubfoot management. However, the factors affecting compliance to follow-up schedule are myriad. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken among caregivers of clubfoot patients from a tertiary referral clubfoot clinic in a developing country. Hospital records were reviewed to collect demographic data and subjects were classified as either "regular" or "irregular" if they missed <= 3 and >3 scheduled hospital visits, respectively. Various factors that could affect compliance such as family size, number of children, literacy of caregiver, occupation of breadwinner, and time taken to travel to hospital were studied. Caregivers were probed regarding the reason for their irregularity. Results: A total of 238 patients were included, of which 138 formed the "regular" group and the rest 100 formed the "irregular" group. Patients in the regular group were significantly younger (mean age 43.8 months) compared to the irregular group (59.8 months; p = 0.001). The mean follow-up period in the regular group was 28.1 months and in the irregular group was 33.8 months. On univariate analysis, age, duration of follow-up, and transport duration were found to be significant between the two groups. However, multivariate analysis revealed that female children with clubfoot are more likely to be irregular as compared to males (p = 0.038). Conclusion: In a developing country setting, higher age and being a female child are associated with irregularity to hospital visit protocol. At clubfoot clinics, identifying these children and counseling their caregivers might improve compliance.

AB  - In breast cancer, 20%-30% of cases require a second surgery because of incomplete excision of malignant tissues. Therefore, to avoid the risk of recurrence, accurate detection of the cancer margin by the clinician or surgeons needs some assistance. In this paper, an automated volumetric analysis of normal and breast cancer tissue is done by a machine learning algorithm to separate them into two classes. The proposed method is based on a supportvector-machine-based classifier by dissociating 10 features extracted from the A-line, texture, and phase map by the swept-source optical coherence tomographic intensity and phase images. A set of 88 freshly excised breast tissue [44 normal and 44 cancers (invasive ductal carcinoma tissues)] samples from 22 patients was used in our study. The algorithm successfully classifies the cancerous tissue with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91.56%, 93.86%, and 92.71% respectively. The present computational technique is fast, simple, and sensitive, and extracts features from the whole volume of the tissue, which does not require any special tissue preparation nor an expert to analyze the breast cancer as required in histopathology. Diagnosis of breast cancer by extracting quantitative features from optical coherence tomographic images could be a potentially powerful method for cancer detection and would be a valuable tool for a fine-needle-guided biopsy.

AB  - Early-stage detection of breast cancer is the primary requirement in modern healthcare as it is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Histopathology is the most widely preferred method for the diagnosis of breast cancer, but it requires long processing time and involves qualitative assessment of cancer by a trained person/doctor. Here, we present an alternate technique based on white light interference microscopy (WLIM) and Raman spectroscopy, which has the capability to differentiate between cancerous and normal breast tissue. WLIM provides quantitative phase information about the biological tissues/cells, whereas Raman spectroscopy can detect changes in their molecular structure and chemical composition during cancer growth. Further, both the techniques can be implemented very quickly without staining the sample. The present technique is employed to perform ex vivo study on a total of 80 normal and cancerous tissue samples collected from 16 different patients. A generalized machine learning model is developed for the classification of normal and cancerous tissues, which is based on texture features obtained from phase maps with an accuracy of 90.6%. The correlation of outcomes from these two techniques can open a new avenue for fast and accurate detection of cancer without any trained personnel. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America

AB  - Recent studies on celiac disease (CeD) have reported alterations in the gut microbiome. Whether this alteration in the microbial community is the cause or effect of the disease is not well understood, especially in adult onset of disease. The first-degree relatives (FDRs) of CeD patients may provide an opportunity to study gut microbiome in pre-disease state as FDRs are genetically susceptible to CeD. By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we observed that ecosystem level diversity measures were not significantly different between the disease condition (CeD), pre-disease (FDR) and control subjects. However, differences were observed at the level of amplicon sequence variant (ASV), suggesting alterations in specific ASVs between pre-disease and diseased condition. Duodenal biopsies showed higher differences in ASVs compared to fecal samples indicating larger disruption of the microbiota at the disease site. The duodenal microbiota of FDR was characterized by significant abundance of ASVs belonging to Parvimonas, Granulicatella, Gemella, Bifidobacterium, Anaerostipes, and Actinomyces genera. The duodenal microbiota of CeD was characterized by higher abundance of ASVs from genera Megasphaera and Helicobacter compared to the FDR microbiota. The CeD and FDR fecal microbiota had reduced abundance of ASVs classified as Akkermansia and Dorea when compared to control group microbiota. In addition, predicted functional metagenome showed reduced ability of gluten degradation by CeD fecal microbiota in comparison to FDRs and controls. The findings of the present study demonstrate differences in ASVs and predicts reduced ability of CeD fecal microbiota to degrade gluten compared to the FDR fecal microbiota. Further research is required to investigate the strain level and active functional profiles of FDR and CeD microbiota to better understand the role of gut microbiome in pathophysiology of CeD.

AB  - BackgroundThe role of concomitant peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and capecitabine therapy has shown benefit in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. However, data reporting its role in paraganglioma (PGL) patients is lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of combined capecitabine and Lu-177-DOTATATE in malignant PGL patients.MethodsIn this retrospective, single-institutional, single-arm, observational study, data of consecutive advanced stage PGL patients treated with concomitant Lu-177-DOTATATE-capecitabine therapy, between July 2009 and March 2017, were collected and analyzed.ResultsTwenty-five PGL patients received an average dose of 22.869.54 (14.43-50) GBq Lu-177-DOTATATE and 1250mg/m(2) capecitabine from days 0 to 14, commencing on the morning of PRRT. The median overall survival (OS) was not attained in this patient cohort; however, the median PFS was 32months. Morphological response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria was achieved in 28% (7/25) patients. Biochemical response with >50% reduction in chromogranin A levels was observed in 28% of the patients.Conclusions Our data confirm that Lu-177-DOTATATE-capecitabine therapy is effective in achieving an objective response in 28% and symptomatic response in 43% patients. In comparison to published PRRT monotherapy outcomes in PGL, we did not observe any great advantage of concomitant therapy; however, it could be due to under-powered study. We recommend a large randomized trial to prove or disprove the utility of capecitabine as a radiosensitizer for PRRT in PGL patients.

AB  - BackgroundTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous Ferric Carboxymaltose. (FCM) in comparison with intravenous Iron sucrose complex (ISC) for treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy.MethodsA randomized clinical trial was conducted from (January 2016-August 2017). at a tertiary hospital. Pregnant women diagnosed with moderate to severe iron deficiency anaemia were screened for the study. One hundred patients were randomized to receive either intravenous FCM or ISC. Primary outcome was rise in hemoglobin (Hb) from baseline after 12weeks. Secondary outcomes were change in RBC indices, serum iron studies, improvement in fatigue scores, number of visits and perinatal outcome.ResultsMean rise in Hb at 12weeks was significantly higher in FCM group (29g/L vs 22g/L; p value <0.01). FCM was associated with greater improvement in fatigue scores. Number of visits were significantly less in FCM group. No serious adverse events were noted in either group.ConclusionTreatment with FCM resulted in rapid replenishment of iron stores in pregnant women with significantly higher Hb rise over a 12week period. The convenient dosing with lesser number of total doses to complete the treatment will lead to better compliance in community setting.Clinical trial registration (www.ctri.nic.in)CTRI/2015/09/006224.

AB  - Data on the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii causing Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) among children are still limited, and there are no available data from the Indian subcontinent, particularly associations between genotypes and clinical characteristics. A total of 37 children (62 days-12 years [median 5.5 years]) were included in this study. Pneumocystis was diagnosed by microscopy using Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain in 12 cases and by nested PCR using mtLSUrRNA in 25 cases. Genotyping was performed using three different genes, mitochondrial large subunit ribosomal RNA (mtLSUrRNA), dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). mtLSUrRNA genotype 3 and novel mutations at the gene target DHFR (401 T > C) and DHPS 96/98 were frequently observed and clinically associated with severe PCP and treatment failure. Phylogenetic analyses revealed 13 unique sequence types (STs). Two STs (i) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96/98 - PJ1 and (ii) 3-DHFR 401 T > C-DHPS 96-PJ3 were significantly associated with treatment failure and high mortality among PCP-positive patients. In conclusion, the present study strongly suggests the emergence of virulent P. jirovecii strains or genetic polymorphisms, leading to treatment failure and high mortality. Our study is the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent and has highlighted the genetic diversity of Pneumocystis jirovecii among children and their clinical outcomes. These findings emphasize the need to focus more on genotypes to better understand the epidemiology of Pneumocystis pneumonia.

AB  - Patients with asthma need uninterrupted supplies of affordable, quality-assured essential medicines. However, access in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Global Action Plan 2013-2020 sets an 80% target for essential NCD medicines' availability. Poor access is partly due to medicines not being included on the national Essential Medicines Lists (EML) and/or National Reimbursement Lists (NRL) which guide the provision of free/subsidised medicines. We aimed to determine how many countries have essential asthma medicines on their EML and NRL, which essential asthma medicines, and whether surveys might monitor progress. A cross-sectional survey in 2013-2015 of Global Asthma Network principal investigators generated 111/120 (93%) responses41 high-income countries and territories (HICs); 70 LMICs. Patients in HICs with NRL are best served (91% HICs included ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) and salbutamol). Patients in the 24 (34%) LMICs with no NRL and the 14 (30%) LMICs with an NRL, however no ICS are likely to have very poor access to affordable, quality-assured ICS. Many LMICs do not have essential asthma medicines on their EML or NRL. Technical guidance and advocacy for policy change is required. Improving access to these medicines will improve the health system's capacity to address NCDs.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among bacterial species that resides in complex ecosystems is a natural phenomenon. Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials in healthcare, livestock, and agriculture provides an evolutionary advantage to the resistant variants to dominate the ecosystem. Ascendency of resistant variants threatens the efficacy of most, if not all, of the antimicrobial drugs commonly used to prevent and/or cure microbial infections. Resistant phenotype is very common in enteric bacteria. The most common mechanisms of AMR are enzymatic modifications to the antimicrobials or their target molecules. In enteric bacteria, most of the resistance traits are acquired by horizontal gene transfer from closely or distantly related bacterial population. AMR traits are generally linked with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and could rapidly disseminate to the bacterial species through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from a pool of resistance genes. Although prevalence of AMR genes among pathogenic bacteria is widely studied in the interest of infectious disease management, the resistance profile and the genetic traits that encode resistance to the commensal microbiota residing in the gut of healthy humans are not well-studied. In the present study, we have characterized AMR phenotypes and genotypes of five dominant commensal enteric bacteria isolated from the gut of healthy Indians. Our study revealed that like pathogenic bacteria, enteric commensals are also multidrug-resistant. The genes encoding antibiotic resistance are physically linked with MGEs and could disseminate vertically to the progeny and laterally to the distantly related microbial species. Consequently, the AMR genes present in the chromosome of commensal gut bacteria could be a potential source of resistance functions for other enteric pathogens.

AB  - Cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (CBH) is a well-known muscle relaxant that is widely used to relieve muscle spasms and other pain associated with acute musculoskeletal conditions. In this study, we elucidated the binding characteristics of this muscle relaxant to human serum albumin (HSA). From a pharmaceutical and biochemical viewpoint, insight into the structure, functions, dynamics, and features of HSA-CBH complex holds great importance. The binding of CBH with this major circulatory transport protein was studied using a combination of biophysical approaches such as UV-VIS absorption, fluorescence quenching, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Various in silico techniques, molecular docking and molecular dynamics, were also used to gain deeper insight into the binding. A reduction in the fluorescence intensities of HSA-CBH complex with a constant increase in temperature, revealed the static mode of protein fluorescence quenching upon CBH addition, which confirmed the formation of the HSA-CBH ground state complex. The alteration in the UV-VIS and far-UV CD spectrum indicated changes in both secondary and tertiary structures of HSA upon binding of CBH, further proving CBH binding to HSA. The analysis of thermodynamic parameters H degrees and S degrees showed that binding of CBH to HSA was dominated by intermolecular hydrophobic forces. The results of the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies also confirmed the stability of the complex and supported the experimental results.

AB  - Background & objectives: Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant, Pseudomonas species have become a major clinical and public health concern. The aim of this study was to characterize phenotypic and genotypic profile of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Pseudomonas spp. isolated from hospitalized patients.
   Methods: A total of 126 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates of Pseudomonas spp. isolated from various clinical samples were included in the study over a period of two years. Identification and antimicrobial sensitivity was performed using automated culture system according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendations. Phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), Amp-C beta-lactamase (AmpC) and metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) were done by various combinations of disc-diffusion and E-test methods, followed by polymerase chain reaction-based detection of beta-lactamase-encoding genes.
   Results: Among 126 clinical isolates, 121 (96.1%) isolates were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most of the isolates were recovered from pus sample, 35 (27.8%) followed by urine, 25 (19.84%); endotracheal aspirate, 24 (19.04%); blood, 14 (11.11%) and sputum, four (3.17%). The highest rate of resistance was against ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, 113 (89.7%) followed by meropenem, 92 (72.5%) and ceftazidime, 91 (72.3%). Overall, ESBLs, AmpC and carbapenemase production was detected in 109 (96.4%), 64 (50.8%) and 105 (94.6%) isolates by phenotypic methods. The most prevalent ESBL gene was bla(TEM) in 72 (57.1%) and the least prevalent was bla(SHV) in 19 (15.1%) isolates. AmpC gene was seen less compared to ESBL gene. The most prevalent carbapenemases gene was bla(NDM-1) 41 (46.06%) followed by bla VIM and bla(OXA-1).
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our findings suggested that a high rate of ESBLs and carbapenemases production was observed in Pseudomonas spp. Therefore, phenotypic and genotypic detection of AMR needs to be combined for better characterization of resistance patterns in Pseudomonas spp.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to provide normative database for subfoveal choroidal thickness in Indian eyes using swept-source optical coherence tomography. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study based at a tertiary eye care center in Northern India. Two hundred and thirty eight eyes of 119 healthy subjects were examined in terms of axial length, spherical equivalent, and choroidal thickness. Inclusion criteria included age 19-60 years, no retinal or choroidal disorder, and patients with clear media and good fixation. Patients with high hypermetropia (>4 D) or myopia (>6 D) or any systemic disease likely to affect choroidal thickness were excluded. Twelve radial line scans were obtained centered on the fovea that were used to calculate choroidal and retinal thickness in 9 early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) zones. Results: The mean age of all the subjects was 28.70 +/- 11.28 years; mean axial length was 23.63 +/- 1.96 mm, and mean spherical equivalent was -0.92 +/- 3.08 D. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was 299.10 +/- 131.2 mu and mean foveal thickness was 239.92 +/- 48.16 mu. A negative correlation was found between subfoveal choroidal thickness and age (r = -0.0961, P = 0.1392) and axial length (r = -0.3166, P < 0.001). A statistically significant positive correlation was found between subfoveal choroidal thickness and refractive error (r = 0.2393, P = 0.0002). Conclusion: This study provides normative database for subfoveal choroidal thickness and foveal thickness using swept-source optical coherence tomography. The choroidal thickness measured with swept-source platform is slightly higher than that reported with spectral domain platforms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Endoscope-assisted hemispherotomy (EH) has emerged as a good alternative option for hemispheric pathologies with drug-resistant epilepsy.
   METHODS This was a prospective observational study. Parameters measured included primary outcome measures (frequency, severity of seizures) and secondary outcomes (cognition, behavior, and quality of life). Blood loss, operating time, complications, and hospital stay were also taken into account. A comparison was made between the open hemispherotomy (OH) and endoscopic techniques performed by the senior author.
   RESULTS Of 59 cases (42 males), 27 underwent OH (8 periinsular, the rest vertical) and 32 received EH. The mean age was 8.65 +/- 5.41 years (EH: 8.6 +/- 5.3 years; OH: 8.6 +/- 5.7 years). Seizure frequency per day was 7 +/- 5.9 (EH: 7.3 +/- 4.6; OH: 15.0 +/- 6.2). Duration of disease (years since first episode) was 3.92 +/- 1.24 years (EH: 5.2 +/- 4.3; OH: 5.8 +/- 4.5 years). Number of antiepileptic drugs per patient was 3.9 +/- 1.2 (EH: 4.2 +/- 1.2; OH: 3.8 +/- 0.98). Values for the foregoing variables are expressed as the mean +/- SD. Pathologies included the following: postinfarct encephalomalacia in 19 (EH: 11); Rasmussen's syndrome in 14 (EH: 7); hemimegalencephaly in 12 (EH: 7); hemispheric cortical dysplasia in 7 (EH: 4); postencephalitis sequelae in 6 (EH: 2); and Sturge-Weber syndrome in 1 (EH: 1). The mean follow-up was 40.16 +/- 17.3 months. Thirty-nine of 49 (79.6%) had favorable outcomes (International League Against Epilepsy class I and II): in EH the total was 19/23 (82.6%) and in OH it was 20/26 (76.9%). There was no difference in the primary outcome between EH and OH (p = 0.15). Significant improvement was seen in the behavioral/quality of life performance, but not in IQ scores in both EH and OH (p < 0.01, no intergroup difference). Blood loss (p = 0.02) and hospital stay (p = 0.049) were less in EH.
   CONCLUSIONS EH was as effective as the open procedure in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. It also resulted in less blood loss and a shorter postoperative hospital stay.

AB  - Background & objectives: Antimicrobial resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of typhoid fever with limited choices left to empirically treat these patients. The present study was undertaken to determine the current practices of antibiotic use in children attending a tertiary care hospital in north India.
   Methods: This was a descriptive observational study in children suffering from enteric fever as per the case definition including clinical and laboratory parameters. The antibiotic audit in hospitalized children was measured as days of therapy per 1000 patient days and in outpatient department (OPD) as antibiotic prescription on the treatment card.
   Results: A total of 128 children with enteric fever were included in the study, of whom, 30 were hospitalized and 98 were treated from OPD. The mean duration of fever was 9.5 days at the time of presentation. Of these, 45 per cent were culture positive with Salmonella Typhi being aetiological agent in 68 per cent followed by S. Paratyphi A in 32 per cent. During hospitalization, the average length of stay was 10 days with mean duration of defervescence 6.4 days. Based on antimicrobial susceptibility ceftriaxone was given to 28 patients with mean duration of treatment being six days. An additional antibiotic was needed in six patients due to clinical non-response. In OPD, 79 patients were prescribed cefixime and additional antibiotic was needed in five during follow up visit.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Based on our findings, ceftriaxone and cefixime seemed to be the first line of antibiotic treatment for typhoid fever. Despite susceptibility, clinical non-response was seen in around 10 per cent of the patients who needed combinations of antibiotics.

AB  - Autoimmune skin diseases are a group of disorders that arise due to a deregulated immune system resulting in skin tissue destruction. In the majority of these conditions, either autoreactive immune cells or the autoantibodies are generated against self-antigens of the skin. Although the etiology of these diseases remains elusive, biochemical, genetic, and environmental factors such as infectious agents, toxins damage the skin tissue leading to self-antigen generation, autoantibody attack and finally results in autoimmunity of skin. Immune dysregulation, which involves predominantly T helper 1/17 (Th1/Th17) polarization and the inability of regulatory T cells to regress immune response, is implicated in autoimmune skin diseases.
   The emerging roles of immune cells, cytokines, and chemokines in the pathogenesis of common autoimmune skin diseases like pemphigus, vitiligo, and psoriasis are discussed in this review. The main focus is on the interplay between immune cell network including the innate and adaptive immune system, regulatory cells, immune checkpoints and recently identified tissue-resident memory cells (TRMs) in disease pathogenesis and relapse. We also attempt to highlight on the immune mechanisms common to these diseases which can be targeted for designing novel therapeutics.

AB  - Despite of various advancements in biosensing, a rapid, accurate, and on-site detection of a bacterial pathogen is a real challenge due to the lack of appropriate diagnostic platforms. To address this unmet need, we herein report an aptamer-mediated tunable NanoZyme sensor for the detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an infectious bacterial pathogen. Our approach exploits the inherent peroxidase-like NanoZyme activity of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) in combination with high affinity and specificity of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa-specific aptamer (F23). The presence of aptamer inhibits the inherent peroxidase-like activity of GNPs by simple adsorption on to the surface of GNPs. However, in the presence of cognate target (P. aeruginosa), owing to the high affinity for P. aeruginosa, the aptamer leaves the GNP surface, allowing GNPs to resume their peroxidase-like activity, resulting in oxidation of 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). As TMB is an electrochemically active species, we have been able to translate the NanoZyme-based method into an ultrasensitive electrochemical assay using disposable carbon screen-printed electrode. This approach is highly sensitive and allows us to rapidly detect P. aeruginosa with a low-end detection limit of 60CFU/mL in water within 10min. This generic aptamer-NanoZyme-based electrochemical sensing strategy may, in principle, be applicable for the detection of various other bacterial pathogens.

AB  - Movement disorders are one of the common clinical features of neurological disease associated with neuronal antibodies which is a group of potentially reversible disorder. They can present with hypokinetic or hyperkinetic types of involuntary movements and may have other associated neurological symptoms. The spectrum of abnormal movements associated with neuronal antibodies is widening. Some specific phenomenology of movement disorders are likely to give clue about the type of antibody, for instance, presence of paroxysmal dystonia (facio-brachial dystonic seizures) are a pointer toward presence of LGI-1 antibodies, and orofacial lingual dyskinesia is associated with NMDAR associated encephalitis. The presence of specific type of movement disorder allows high suspicion of testing of certain specific type of antibodies. In this review, we have discussed the various antibodies and the spectrum of movement disorder associated with them, highlighting if any distinct movement disorder allows the clinician to suspect type of antibody in a certain clinical context. We have also reviewed the treatment of the movement disorder associated with the neuronal antibodies. Physicians should have high index of suspicion of these disorders, as early institution of treatment options can lead to better outcome.

AB  - Despite proven clinical utility, use of sublinugual buprenorphine is fraught with issues of potential diversion among patients with opioid dependence. Transdermal buprenorphine patches provide an alternative delivery model that can be utilized to reduce such diversion. This narrative review discusses the transdermal buprenorphine formulations, and its pharmacology, drug interaction and tolerability profile. The studies utilizing buprenorphine transdermal patches in the treatment of opioid dependence are examined, while the potential of using such patches for maintenance treatment of opioid dependence is examined.

AB  - The events occurring at the maternal-foetal interface define a successful pregnancy but the current paradigm has shifted towards assessing the contribution of spermatozoa for embryogenesis. Spermatozoa with defective DNA integrity may fertilise the oocyte but affect subsequent embryonic development. The present case-control study was conducted in male partners of couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) to assess the gene expression of spermatozoal FOXG1, SOX3, OGG1, PARP1, RPS6, RBM9, RPS17 and RPL29. This was correlated with reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI). Semen samples were obtained from 60 cases and 30 fertile controls. Gene expression was done by qPCR analysis, and relative quantification was calculated by the 2(-Delta Delta Ct) method. Chemiluminescence and the sperm chromatin structure assay were used to measure the ROS and DFI levels respectively. FOXG1, OGG1, RPS6 and RBM9 were seen to be upregulated, while SOX3 and PARP1 were downregulated. Relative expression of SOX3, OGG1, RPS6 and RPS17 showed a significant difference between patients and controls (p < 0.05). RPL patients were seen to have high ROS (>27.8; p = 0.001) and DFI (>30.7; p < 0.0001) with respect to controls. Sperm transcript dysregulation and oxidative DNA damage can be "carried over" after implantation, thus affecting embryogenesis and health of the future progeny.

AB  - The second most leading cause of death in women is breast cancer even after surgery 20%-30% patients require re-surgery for the removal of the incomplete malignant tissue. To reduce the risk of recurrence exact navigation during surgery is essential. In this paper, a multi-level ensemble model is developed to classify the normal and cancerous breast tissue using features extracted from optical coherence tomography images. Both A-line and B-scan features were extracted and the training data feature space was best-first search to select the best feature subset for each base classifier. To improve the performance of the model reverse active learning process is used to remove the mislabelled images. The ensemble classifier attained the average sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and Mathew correlation coefficient is 0.954%, 0.93%, 94.35%, and 0.887%, respectively with testing data in detecting the breast tissues collected from 24 patients (11 normal fibro-adipose tissue and 13 invasive ductal carcinomas cancerous tissues). In comparison to individual classifier, multi-level ensemble model based on best-first search algorithm achieved a high performance in terms of performance metrics. This study demonstrates the automated tissue characterization based on OCT measurements of cancer tissue, will become a biomarker for the complete excision of malignant tissue and also does not require any special tissue preparation.

AB  - Purpose To objectively assess recovery of thumb opposition in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) after open carpal tunnel release and to evaluate electrophysiological and magnetic resonance (MR) neurography findings as predictors of thumb opposition recovery.
   Methods A total of 22 patients with severe CTS and thenar atrophy were included in this study. A detailed clinical, electrophysiological, and MR neurography evaluation was done both before and after surgery at 6 months to assess thumb opposition recovery.
   Results The median duration of symptoms was 12 months (interquartile range, 12-20 months). The compound muscle action potential of the abductor pollisis brevis (CMAP-APB) also showed statistically significant improvement of 0.5 thorn 0.2 mV after surgery. Tip-tip pulp pinch strength increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 to 2.0 +/- 0.4 kg at 6-month follow-up, lateral pulp pinch strength increased from 1.9 +/- 0.6 to 2.8 +/- 0.9 kg at 6-month follow-up, and 3-point pulp pinch also improved from 1.9 +/- 0.5 to 2.8 +/- 0.9 at final follow-up. On MR neurogram, the proportion of patients with abnormal median nerve morphology decreased from 81.8% to 68.2%, abnormal thenar branch morphology decreased from 63.6% to 36.4% and denervation edema deceased from 59.1% to 13.6%.
   Conclusions Patients suffering from severe CTS with thenar atrophy and detectable CMAPAPB showed promising improvement following open carpal tunnel release. Copyright (C) 2019 by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background & objectives: The increasing prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) has abated therapeutic options worldwide. This study was undertaken to investigate the molecular profile and resistance patterns of ESBLs among clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae at four tertiary care centres in India.
   Methods: Clinical isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were collected from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi; the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Puducherry; Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh and Christian Medical College (CMC), Vellore, over one and a half year period. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. ESBLs were confirmed phenotypically, and multiplex PCR was performed to identify genes for beta-lactamases (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTXM-1), bla(CTXM-2), bla(CTXM-9) and bla(CTXM-15)).
   Results: Among 341 E. coli isolates collected during the study period, 171 (50%) harboured bla(TEM), 145 (43%) bla(OXA-1), 70 (21%) bla(CTXM-1), 19 (6%) bla(SHV) and four (1%) harboured bla(CTXM-2). Phenotypically, combined disc test detected ESBL production in 98/298 (33%) E. coli. Among 304 K. pneumoniae isolates, 115 (38%), 89 (29%), 83 (27%), 64 (21%) and two (0.6%) harboured bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTXM-1), bla(SHV) and bla(CTXM-2), respectively. Combined disc test (CDT) detected ESBL production in 42 per cent K. pneumoniae. Most of the bla(CTXM-1) positive isolates were also bla(CTXM-15) positive. The carbapenem susceptibility ranged from 56 to 88 per cent for E. coli and from 20 to 61 per cent for K. pneumoniae. Antibiotic sensitivity patterns showed that colistin (CST) was the most sensitive drug for both E. coli (271/274, 99%) and K. pneumoniae (229/234, 98%).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The prevalence of ESBL among four study centres varied, and bla(TEM), bla(OXA-1) and bla(CTXM-15) were the most common genotypes in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates in India. The growing carbapenem resistance and emerging colistin resistance warrant the judicious use of these antimicrobials.

AB  - Renal tumors comprise 7% of all childhood cancers. A wide variety of renal tumors can affect the pediatric kidneys, which can be broadly classified as primary benign tumors, primary malignant tumors, and metastatic lesions. This article aims to enumerate usual benign and malignant renal tumors that can occur in childhood and emphasizes the characteristic imaging appearances which aid in their differential diagnosis. Additionally, the leading role of the Radiologist in primary diagnosis of renal infiltration by hematological malignancies and contiguous invasion by neuroblastoma is also introduced and unraveled. Imaging protocol comprises initial Ultrasound evaluation with subsequent computed tomography (CT) and/or Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), all of which are invaluable in confirming the diagnosis, documenting the organ of origin, describing extent of local and distant spread. The complimentary role of nuclear medicine studies in delineating differential renal function, post-operative complications, and metastasis is also highlighted.

AB  - We report an interesting case of Kimura's disease (KD) that presented as a giant head and neck mass. KD is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder and usually presents as small subcutaneous swellings in the head and neck region. Such a large mass of 15x17.5cm as seen in our patient has previously not been reported, to the best of our knowledge. The radiological picture was that of an enlarged subcutaneous mass with heterogeneous enhancement of the salivary gland. The histological findings were helpful in identifying the lesion as KD. The combination of these two aided us in differentiating it from other lesions such as follicular lymphoma, angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) and Langerhan's histiocytosis. There is no standard protocol for management of this disease owing to its rarity. Due to the extensive and ill-defined nature of the lesion in our patient, we have started the patient on systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy to downsize the lesion and we plan to follow up with surgical excision if needed.

AB  - Aim This study aims to determine whether a resource- and culturally appropriate lifestyle intervention programme in South Asian countries, provided to women with gestational diabetes (GDM) after childbirth, will reduce the incidence of worsening of glycaemic status in a manner that is affordable, acceptable and scalable. Methods Women with GDM (diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test using the International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria) will be recruited from 16 hospitals in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Participants will undergo a repeat oral glucose tolerance test at 6 +/- 3 months postpartum and those without Type 2 diabetes, a total sample size of 1414, will be randomly allocated to the intervention or usual care. The intervention will consist of four group sessions, 84 SMS or voice messages and review phone calls over the first year. Participants requiring intensification of the intervention will receive two additional individual sessions over the latter half of the first year. Median follow-up will be 2 years. The primary outcome is the proportion of women with a change in glycaemic category, using the American Diabetes Association criteria: (i) normal glucose tolerance to impaired fasting glucose, or impaired glucose tolerance, or Type 2 diabetes; or (ii) impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance to Type 2 diabetes. Process evaluation will explore barriers and facilitators of implementation of the intervention in each local context, while trial-based and modelled economic evaluations will assess cost-effectiveness. Discussion The study will generate important new evidence about a potential strategy to address the long-term sequelae of GDM, a major and growing problem among women in South Asia.

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficits in social communication, social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities. The concept of autism has changed since its inception, from childhood schizophrenia to neuro-variation. These changes in concept have been accompanied by changes in the diagnostic threshold through which the 'case' of autism is identified. The occurrence of multiple changes in its diagnostic criteria over last 80 odd years opens up the possibility of challenges being posed to the existence of the disorder as it is today, with a possibility of newer conceptualization of autism coming up in the future. The potential consequences of the changes in its nosology and concept, such as those on the management and on prevalence estimation are some of the essential issues which need attention. In the current paper, we evaluate the evolution of the concept and nosology of autism with an overview of the accompanying impact of these changes.

AB  - Early-stage esophageal cancer (stages 0-1) has been shown to have relatively good outcomes after local endoscopic or surgical resection. For this reason, neoadjuvant chemoradiation usually is reserved for higher-stage disease. Some early tumors, however, are found after resection to be more advanced than predicted based on initial clinical staging, termed pathologic upstaging. Such tumors may have benefited from alternate treatment models had their true stage been known preoperatively. This study aimed to identify high-risk features in early esophageal cancers that might predict tumor upstaging and guide more individualized treatment algorithms.
   Through retrospective review of a single-institution foregut disease registry, we evaluated patients who underwent esophagectomy for high-grade dysplasia (Tis) or stage 1 esophageal cancer, searching for factors associated with pathologic upstaging.
   The review included 110 patients (88% male, median age at diagnosis, 64.5 years) treated between January 2000 and June 2016. Upstaging occurred for 20.9% of the patients, and was more common for patients with angiolymphatic invasion (odds ratio [OR], 11.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.96-41.44; P < 0.001) or signet-ring features (OR, 23.9; 95% CI, 2.6-216.8; P = 0.005). In the absence of other predictors, upstaging was associated with decreased overall survival (P = 0.006).
   Approximately 20% of patients with early-stage esophageal cancer may be upstaged at resection. Angiolymphatic invasion and signet-ring features may predict tumors likely to be upstaged, resulting in decreased overall survival.

AB  - PurposeMacroprolactinemia is characterized by predominance of macroprolactin molecules in circulation and generally has extra-pituitary origin. Macroprolactin is viewed as biologically inactive, therefore asymptomatic, and thus may not require any treatment or prolonged follow-up. In addition, data on prevalence of macroprolactinemia and its clinical manifestation are also rare. Therefore, the present study was aimed to find out prevalence of macroprolactinemia and its association, if any, with reproductive manifestations.Material and methodsMacroprolactin was measured in 102 hyperprolactinemia cases (>100ng/ml prolactin level), 135 physiological hyperprolactinemia cases (50 pregnant and 85 lactating females; >100ng/ml prolactin level) and 24 controls. Poly ethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation method was carried out to screen macroprolactin. Prolactin recovery of <25% was considered overt macroprolactinemia. Detailed clinical data was recorded which included complete medical history, physical examination and hormone measurements besides CT/MRI for pituitary abnormalities.ResultsPrevalence of macroprolactinemia was 21.57% (22/102) in hyperprolactinemia (prolactin >100ng/ml). There was no case of macroprolactinemia in physiological hyperprolactinemia, or healthy control females. Reproductive manifestations were present in 72.73% (16/22) macroprolactinemia cases, out of which macroprolactinemia was the sole cause of associated reproductive manifestations in 68.7% (11/16) cases. Reversal of reproductive dysfunction/s was observed in five cases with appropriate treatment for high macroprolactin.ConclusionMacroprolactinemia prevalence was found to be 21.5%, out of which 72.73% cases had associated reproductive dysfunctions.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the relative efficacy of ultrasound-guided serratus anterior plane block (SAPB), pectoral nerves (Pecs) II block, and intercostal nerve block (ICNB) for the management of post-thoracotomy pain in pediatric cardiac surgery.
   Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparative study.
   Setting: Single-institution tertiary referral cardiac center.
   Participants: The study comprised 108 children with congenital heart disease requiring surgery through a thoracotomy.
   Interventions: Children were allocated randomly to 1 of the 3 groups: SAPB, Pecs II, or ICNB. All participants received 3 mg/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine for ultrasound-guided block after induction of anesthesia. Postoperatively, intravenous paracetamol was used for multimodal and fentanyl was used for rescue analgesia.
   Measurements and Main Results: A modified objective pain score (MOPS) was evaluated at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours post-extubation. The early mean MOPS at 1, 2, and 4 hours was similar in the 3 groups. The late mean MOPS was significantly lower in the SAPB group compared with that of the ICNB group (p < 0.001). The Pecs II group also had a lower MOPS compared with the ICNB group at 6, 8, and 10 hours (p < 0.001), but the MOPS was comparable at hour 12 (p = 0.301). The requirement for rescue fentanyl was significantly higher in ICNB group in contrast to the SAPB and Pecs II groups.
   Conclusion: SAPS and Pecs II fascial plane blocks are equally efficacious in post-thoracotomy pain management compared with ICNB, but they have the additional benefit of being longer lasting and are as easily performed as the traditional ICNB. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives To elucidate potential target areas of intervention and mechanisms for implementation of intervention for children with cancer during the treatment phase.
   Methods Focused group discussion (FGDs) served as a primary source of providing phenomenal perspectives to explore the key objective. Eight focus groups of 45-60 min each were held with 5-9 members in each discussion. The participants were either patients, their caregivers or health care providers. The focus group audio recordings were professionally transcribed after all identifiers were removed. Employing a constructivist paradigm with a phenomenological approach, also known as emergent-systematic focus group design the study reported on families' experiences of childhood cancer as construction of objective reality. Investigator triangulation method was adopted to ensure trustworthiness.
   Results Using constant comparison analysis, multistage process analysis was done which resulted in 849 codes, 32 subthemes, 20 themes and 5 domains. A total of 64 participants participated: 4 FGDs with parents of children with ALL (n = 31); 1 FGD with professionals working in the field of cancer (n = 10) and 3 FGDs with children with ALL (n = 23). Participant's mean age at the time of study was 10 y (+3.3) for children; 37 y (+4.93) for caregivers and 35 y (+3.5) for professionals. The number of participants and their age range at study varied slightly between the eight focus groups.
   Conclusions Caregivers presented care burden and compromised aspects of Quality of life (QOL). An effective and culturally sensitive psychosocial support for patients and their families during and post treatment, in addition to medical therapy, is strongly recommended.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the analgesic efficacy of bilateral erector spinae plane (ESP) block compared with conventional treatment for pain after cardiac surgery in adult patients.
   Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study.
   Setting: Single-center tertiary teaching hospital.
   Participants: One hundred and six adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 (ESP block group, n = 53) received ultrasound-guided bilateral ESP block with 3 mg/kg of 0.375% ropivacaine before anesthesia induction at the T6 transverse process level. Patients in group 2 (paracetamol and tramadol group, n = 53) received paracetamol (1 gm every 6 hours) and tramadol (50 mg every 8 hours) intravenously in the postoperative period. The primary study outcome was to evaluate pain at rest using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing NRS scores.
   Measurements and Main Results: The postoperative pain level after extubation and duration of analgesia during which NRS was < 4 of 10 was compared between the groups. The median pain score at rest after extubation in group 1 was 0 of 10 until hour 6, 3 of 10 at hour 8, and 4 of 10 at hours 10 and 12 postextubation. These were significantly less in comparison with group 2 (p = 0.0001). Patients in group 1 had a significantly higher mean duration of analgesia (8.98 +/- 0.14 hours), during which NRS was < 4 of 10, compared with group 2 (4.60 +/- 0.12 hours) (p = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: ESP block safely provided significantly better pain relief at rest for longer duration as compared to intravenous paracetamol and tramadol. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have demonstrated protective effects against HIV-1 in primate studies and recent human clinical trials. Elite neutralizers are potential candidates for isolation of HIV-1 bNAbs. The coexistence of bNAbs such as BG18 with neutralization-susceptible autologous viruses in an HIV-1-infected adult elite controller has been suggested to control viremia. Disease progression is faster in HIV-1-infected children than in adults. Plasma bNAbs with multiple epitope specificities are developed in HIV-1 chronically infected children with more potency and breadth than in adults. Therefore, we evaluated the specificity of plasma neutralizing antibodies of an antiretroviral-naive HIV-1 clade C chronically infected pediatric elite neutralizer, AIIMS_330. The plasma antibodies showed broad and potent HIV-1 neutralizing activity with >87% (29/33) breadth, a median inhibitory dilution (ID50) value of 1,246, and presence of N160 and N332 supersite-dependent HIV-1 bNAbs. The sorting of BG505.SOSIP.664.C2 T332N gp140 HIV-1 antigen-specific single B cells of AIIMS_330 resulted in the isolation of an HIV-1 N332 supersite-dependent bNAb, AIIMS-P01. The AIIMS-P01 neutralized 67% of HIV-1 cross-clade viruses, exhibited substantial indels despite limited somatic hypermutations, interacted with native-like HIV-1 trimer as observed in negative stain electron microscopy, and demonstrated high binding affinity. In addition, AIIMS-P01 neutralized the coexisting and evolving autologous viruses, suggesting the coexistence of vulnerable autologous viruses and HIV-1 bNAbs in the AIIMS_330 pediatric elite neutralizer. Such pediatric elite neutralizers can serve as potential candidates for isolation of novel HIV-1 pediatric bNAbs and for understanding the coevolution of virus and host immune response.
   IMPORTANCE More than 50% of the HIV-1 infections globally are caused by clade C viruses. To date, there is no effective vaccine to prevent HIV-1 infection. Based on the structural information of the currently available HIV-1 bNAbs, attempts are under way to design immunogens that can elicit correlates of protection upon vaccination. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an HIV-1 N332 supersite-dependent bNAb, AIIMS-P01, from a clade C chronically infected pediatric elite neutralizer. The N332 supersite is an important epitope and is one of the current HIV-1 vaccine targets. AIIMS-P01 potently neutralized the contemporaneous and autologous evolving viruses and exhibited substantial indels despite low somatic hypermutations. Taken together with the information on infant bNAbs, further isolation and characterization of bNAbs contributing to the plasma breadth in HIV-1 chronically infected children may help provide a better understanding of their role in controlling HIV-1 infection.

AB  - Background: Gall bladder cancer (GBC) is the most common biliary tract malignancy in India. GBC present either with incidental diagnosis after simple cholecystectomy (SC) or with a primary gall bladder mass. Incidentally detected gall bladder cancer (ICGB) has traditionally been thought to be a relatively early stage disease but there are controversies associated with various aspects of its management. In this article we describe our experience with multimodality management of ICGB.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of incidentally detected GBC patients was performed to analyze the profile of presentation and treatment outcome. After initial radiological evaluation for operability, all the patients underwent surgical exploration. If found resectable, revision surgery including 2 cm wedge resection of liver and lymphadenectomy was done followed by concurrent chemo-radiation for tumors T2 and above stages.
   Results: A total of 54 patients with incidentally detected GBC with a male to female ratio of 1:3 and mean age of 47.5 years were included in the study. Thirty-four (63%) patients underwent curative resection followed by adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The remaining 20 patients had metastatic/unresectable disease. The 5 years disease free and overall survival (OS) for patients receiving curative treatment was 64% and 72% respectively. On univariate analysis, presence of residual disease in the gallbladder fossa and liver were significant risk factors for disease recurrence. Depth of invasion, adjuvant treatment received and stage were significant prognostic factors for OS.
   Conclusions: Incidentally detected GBC is increasing in incidence. A multi-modality approach with revision surgery and adjuvant chemo-radiation treatment may yield better outcome. Presence of residual disease is a poor prognostic factor. Optimal evaluation before SC and early referral to specialty center is therefore important in patients with suspicion of gallbladder malignancy because first chance is probably the best chance.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance particularly in Gram-negative bacilli is an increasing problem worldwide. Pseudomonas spp. is one the most common Gram-negative bacteria associated with nosocomial infections and therefore, its trend of antimicrobial resistance needs to be studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of antimicrobial resistance and changes in resistance pattern over a period of five years (2012-2016) in Pseudomonas spp. isolated from trauma patients attending a tertiary care hospital in north India. During the study, a total of 2444 Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the various clinical sample. The most common species isolated was P. aeruginosa (2331, 95%). The highest level of resistance was observed against levofloxacin (1678, 69%) and the lowest level of resistance was observed against tobramycin (1254, 51%). Irrational and inappropriate use of antibiotics was found to be responsible for multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas spp. Hence, there is an urgent need to emphasize strict antibiotic policy to minimize the misuse of antimicrobials.

AB  - Introduction Esophageal atresia with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (EA with or without TEF) is one of the neonatal surgical emergencies requiring surgical intervention in the early neonatal period, influencing the developmental outcome in the operated children. This study was aimed to assess the developmental status of children operated for EA with or without TEF along with maternal stress, their quality of life (QOL), and coping abilities.
   Materials and Methods A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted on 51 children aged up to 5 years after EA with or without TEF repair and their mothers' in a tertiary care facility. The tools used were, namely, demographic datasheet of child and mother, anthropometry assessment, Developmental Assessment Scale for Indian Infants, and modified Vineland Social Maturity Scale for the developmental evaluation, Child Behavior Checklist (1.5-5 years) caregiver report form, Parental Stress Scale, WHOQOL BREF, and Coping Strategies Checklist.
   Results The majority of children had low weight (47.1%) and height (31.4%), for reference age. The overall and social developmental delay was observed in 40.7 and 37.5% of children, respectively, and few children (7.4%) had behavioral problems in the borderline range. Among the mothers, 47% had moderate stress and relatively poor QOL in environmental (60.118.9) and psychological (60.8 +/- 18.8) domains. The most commonly used coping strategy by the mothers was an emotional outlet (29.4%).
   Conclusion Developmental delay was present in children operated for EA with or without TEF caused significant stress among mothers, affecting their QOL for which the emotional outlet was the most commonly used coping strategy.

AB  - The identification of novel antimetastatic therapeutic targets is necessary for improved treatment of patients with acquired BRAF inhibitor-resistant (BRAFi-R) melanoma, in whom metastasis is a major concern. Our present study focused on the identification of such targets to explore novel antimetastatic therapeutic options for BRAFi-R melanoma patients. We confirmed the development of BRAFi resistance in our BRAFi-treated melanoma cell lines by demonstrating reduced sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors, increased ERK1/2 activity and increased WNT5A expression. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that high secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) was associated with increased invasive migration of BRAFi-R melanoma cells. This finding could be readily explained by the increased expression of WNT5A in BRAFi-R melanoma cells and the presence of an IL-6/WNT5A positive feedback loop in parental melanoma cells. Surprisingly, however, we found that the IL-6/WNT5A positive feedback loop present in parental melanoma cells was lost during the development of acquired BRAFi resistance, meaning that IL-6 and WNT5A signalling were independent events in BRAFi-R melanoma cells. Despite the absence of an IL-6/WNT5A loop, we found that both an IL-6 blocking antibody and the WNT5A antagonist Box5 alone impaired the elevated invasive migration of BRAFi-R melanoma cells, but combined use of the two was more effective. This impaired invasive migration of BRAFi-R melanoma cells correlated well with the reduction in Cdc42-GTPase activity and alterations of the actin cytoskeleton in these cells. In summary, our novel identification of IL-6 as a key independent promoter of the invasive migration of BRAFi-R melanoma cells stresses that a combination of a blocking IL-6 antibody and administration of the WNT5A antagonist Box5 might be an attractive antimetastatic approach for future treatment of BRAFi-R melanoma patients.

AB  - Determination of time since death is one of the important objectives of a medicolegal autopsy. The level of electrolytes present in the body fluids acts as a helpful indicator in this regard. Nowadays cold chambers are present in most of the autopsy centres where the body is stored for a variable period of time at a temperature which is different from the environmental temperature. This study was undertaken to know the effect of the cold chamber temperature on the changes in sodium, potassium and chloride levels of vitreous humor and plasma and also to estimate the time since death from the levels of these electrolytes. For this, the study subjects were exposed to the cold chamber temperature (in a range of +2 degrees C to +4 degrees C) for a variable duration of time before beginning the autopsy. The results obtained substantiate the fact that the temperature of the cold chamber has a significant effect on the change in vitreous humor potassium level. In subjects exposed to the cold chamber, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the sodium and chloride levels of vitreous humor with time since death. The R-squared value for the regression equation to predict time since death from vitreous humor sodium level was found to be 0.0916 and was considered a significant predictor of time since death.

AB  - Objective. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of splint therapy in improving outcomes after arthrocentesis for the management of temporomandibular joint disorders.
   Study Design. A comprehensive electronic search was conducted to search for randomized control trials, controlled clinical trials, and retrospective studies comparing arthrocentesis and splint therapy with arthrocentesis alone.
   Results. Six studies were included in this review. There was no statistical significant difference in pain reduction with or without the use of splint after arthrocentesis at 1 month (fixed: weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.46 to 0.44; P =.96; I-2 = 0%) and 6 months (fixed: WMD= -0.08; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.42; P =.66; I-2 = 0%). Similarly, no difference was seen in improvement in maximal mouth opening at 1 month (fixed: WMD= -0.16; 95% CI -1.75 to 1.42; P =.84; I-2 = 44%), and 6 months (fixed: WMD= -0.83; 95% CI -0.52 to 2.18; P =.23; I-2 = 0%).
   Conclusions. Within the limitation of this review, there is some evidence that splint therapy may not improve outcomes after arthrocentesis. There is a need for well-designed RCTs evaluating the additional benefit of splint therapy after arthrocentesis for managing temporomandibular joint disorders.

AB  - Study objective: This study was undertaken to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound-guided single-shot caudal block with ultrasound-guided single-shot paravertebral block in children undergoing renal surgeries.
   Design: Randomised, interventional, blinded clinical trial.
   Setting: Operating rooms of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.
   Patients: 50 children aged 2-10 years, of ASA status I/II, posted for elective renal surgeries.
   Interventions: The children were randomised into two groups (Group C-caudal block, Group P-paravertebral block). After induction of general anesthesia, single-shot caudal or paravertebral block was performed under ultrasound guidance, with 0.2% ropivacaine with 1:200000 adrenaline.
   Measurements: Time to first rescue analgesia, time to perform blocks, intraoperative and post-operative hemodynamics, post-operative FLACC scores, incidence of complications, parental satisfaction scores were recorded.
   Main results: Children in Group P had significantly longer duration of analgesia (p < 0.0004) than Group C. Post-operative FLACC scores (p < 0.005) and analgesic requirements (p < 0.0004) were lower in Group P. The mean fentanyl requirement over 24 h in group P was 0.56 +/- 0.82 mu g/kg, compared to 1.8 +/- 1.2 mu g/kg in group C. Parents in Group P reported greater satisfaction (p < 0.02). No complications were seen in either of the groups.
   Conclusion: This study showed superior analgesia and parental satisfaction with single-shot paravertebral block in comparison to single-shot caudal block for renal surgeries in children. However, the block performance in children requires adequate expertise and practice.

AB  - Objectives: To determine if transfusing ABO compatible platelets has a greater effect on incremental change in platelet count as compared to ABO incompatible platelets in critically ill children. Design: Secondary analysis of a prospective, observational study. Transfusions were classified as either ABO compatible, major incompatibility, or minor incompatibility. The primary outcome was the incremental change in platelet count. Transfusion reactions were analyzed as a secondary outcome. Setting: Eighty-two PICUs in 16 countries. Patients: Children (3 d to 16 yr old) were enrolled if they received a platelet transfusion during one of the predefined screening weeks. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Five-hundred three children were enrolled and had complete ABO information for both donor and recipient, as well as laboratory data. Three-hundred forty-two (68%) received ABO-identical platelets, 133 (26%) received platelets with major incompatibility, and 28 (6%) received platelets with minor incompatibility. Age, weight, proportion with mechanical ventilation or underlying oncologic diagnosis did not differ between the groups. After adjustment for transfusion dose, there was no difference in the incremental change in platelet count between the groups; the median (interquartile range) change for ABO-identical transfusions was 28 x 10(9) cells/L (8-68 x 10(9) cells/L), for transfusions with major incompatibility 26 x 10(9) cells/L (7-74 x 10(9) cells/L), and for transfusions with minor incompatibility 54 x 10(9) cells/L (14-81 x 10(9) cells/L) (p = 0.37). No differences in count increment between the groups were noted for bleeding (p = 0.92) and nonbleeding patients (p = 0.29). There were also no differences observed between the groups for any transfusion reaction (p = 0.07). Conclusions: No differences were seen in the incremental change in platelet count nor in transfusion reactions when comparing major ABO incompatible platelet transfusions with ABO compatible transfusions in a large study of critically ill children. Studies in larger, prospectively enrolled cohorts should be performed to validate whether ABO matching for platelet transfusions in critically ill children is necessary.

AB  - Ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) catalyzes the cleavage of glycosidic bond formed between adenine and ribose sugar of ribosomal RNA to inactivate ribosomes. Previous structural studies have shown that RNA bases, adenine, guanine, and cytosine tend to bind to RIP in the substrate binding site. However, the mode of binding of uracil with RIP was not yet known. Here, we report crystal structures of two complexes of type 1 RIP from Momordica balsamina (MbRIP1) with base, uracil and nucleoside, uridine. The binding studies of MbRIP1 with uracil and uridine as estimated using fluorescence spectroscopy showed that the equilibrium dissociation constants (K-D) were 1.2 x 10(-6) M and 1.4 x 10(-7) M respectively. The corresponding values obtained using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were found to be 1.4 x 10(-6) M and 1.1 x 10(-7) M, respectively. Structures of the complexes of MbRIP1 with uracil (Structure-1) and uridine (Structure-2) were determined at 1.70 and 1.98 angstrom resolutions respectively. Structure-1 showed that uracil bound to MbRIP1 at the substrate binding site but its mode of binding was significantly different from those of adenine, guanine and cytosine. However, the mode of binding of uridine was found to be similar to those of cytidine. As a result of binding of uracil to MbRIP1 at the substrate binding site, three water molecules were expelled while eight water molecules were expelled when uridine bound to MbRIP1.

AB  - Accelerated epidemiological transition in India over the last 40 years has resulted in a dramatic increase in the burden of cardiovascular diseases and the related risk factors of diabetes and hypertension. This increase in disease burden has been accompanied by pervasive health disparities associated with low disease detection rates, inadequate awareness, poor use of evidence-based interventions, and low adherence rates among patients in rural regions in India and those with low socioeconomic status.
   Several research groups in India have developed innovative technologies and care-delivery models for screening, diagnosis, clinical management, remote-monitoring, self-management, and rehabilitation for a range of chronic conditions. These innovations can leverage advances in sensor technology, genomic tools, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and so on, for improving access to and delivering quality and affordable personalized medicine in primary care. In addition, several health technology start-ups are entering this booming market that is set to grow rapidly. Innovations outside biomedical space (eg, protection of traditional wisdom in diet, lifestyle, yoga) are equally important and arc part of a comprehensive solution.
   Such low-cost, culturally tailored, robust innovations to promote health and reduce disparities require partnership among multi-sectors including academia, industry, civil society, and health systems operating in a conducive policy environment that fosters adequate public and private investments.
   In this article, we present the unique opportunity for India to use culturally tailored, low-cost, high-impact technological innovations and strategies to ameliorate the perennial challenges of social, policy, and environmental challenges including poverty, low educational attainment, culture, and other socioeconomic factors to promote cardiovascular health and advance health equity.

KW  - OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY
AB  - Congenital simple hamartoma of the retinal pigment epithelium is localized to the retinal tissue only with variable amount of surface extension. With consistent morphological and OCT features of the lesion around fovea, it appears that some of the embryologically undifferentiated ectopic progenitor cells destined for RPE within the retinal tissue may not undergo any further differentiation due to lack of necessary homeostatic factors leading to only hyperplasia and accumulation of the cells within the retina leading to simple hamartoma.

T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
KW  - Flap tear
KW  - Rectus muscle rupture
KW  - Strabismus surgery
KW  - RECTUS
AB  - The assessment of nature and the extent of extraocular muscle injuries during initial visit in ocular emergencies is of paramount importance to avoid/minimize the subsequent need for strabismus surgery. Based on our experience in managing acute globe and orbital injuries and cases of strabismus, we propose the probable mechanism involved in the occurrence of extraocular muscle flap tear and a complete rupture of the muscle. During high-velocity injuries when the forces are equally transmitted along the orbital bony framework and the globe, then due to differential shearing forces created between the global and the orbital fibres leads to a flap tear. In the second scenario, if the forces are only directed along the bony framework, then the globe continues to be in continuous motion leading to increased tension between the muscles and the globe. Thus the weaker portions between these two structures are at risk of complete separation, that is along the insertion of muscle onto the globe or the musculotendinous portion.

KW  - REPLICATION
AB  - Background
   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is a long known mosquito-borne disease that is associated with severe morbidity, characterized by fever, headache, rashes, joint pain, and myalgia. It is believed that virus load has relation with severity of clinical features. Objectives We performed this study to assess the relationship between virus load and clinical features in children during the acute phase of CHIKV infection, in order to draw insights for betterinformed treatment.
   Objectives
   We performed this study to assess the relationship between virus load and clinical features in children during the acute phase of CHIKV infection, in order to draw insights for better-informed treatment.
   Study design
   Between June 1, 2009, and May 31, 2010, 338 patients with fever and susceptive to CHIKV during first 4 days of illness were prospectively enrolled from Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences, Hubli in our hospital based cross sectional observational study. Sybr green quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to estimate the virus load.
   Results
   Quantitative RT-PCR was positive for CHIKV in 54 patients. The median copy number of CHIKV was 1.3x 10(8) copies/ml (1.7x10(5) -9.9x10(9) copies/ml). Among the observed clinical features, a statistically significant difference in log mean virus load was found between patients with and without myalgia (log mean 7.50 vs 8.34, P = 0.01).
   Conclusion
   Patients with myalgia had lower virus load and those without myalgia had a higher virus load.

AB  - Background & objectives: Plasmid has led to increase in resistant bacterial pathogens through the exchange of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genetic determinants through horizontal gene transfer. Baseline data on the occurrence of plasmids carrying AMR genes are lacking in India. This study was aimed to identify the plasmids associated with AMR genetic determinants in ESKAPE pathogens.
   Methods: A total of 112 ESKAPE isolates including Escherichia coli (n= 37), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 48, including 7 pan-drug susceptible isolates), Acinetobacter baumannii (n= 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 1) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 18) were analyzed in the study. Isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility and whole genome sequencing of isolates was performed using Ion Torrent (PGM) sequencer. Downstream data analysis was done using PATRIC, ResFinder, PlasmidFinder and MLSTFinder databases. All 88 whole genome sequences (WGS) were deposited at GenBank.
   Results: Most of the study isolates showed resistant phenotypes. As analyzed from WGS, the isolates included both known and unknown sequence types. The plasmid analysis revealed the presence of single or multiple plasmids in the isolates. Plasmid types such as IncHI1B(pNDM-MAR), IncFII(pRSB107), IncFIB(Mar), IncFIB(pQil), IncFIA, IncFII(K), IncR, ColKP3 and ColpVC were present in K. pneumoniae. In E. coli, IncFIA, IncFII, IncFIB, Col(BS512), IncL1, IncX3 and IncH were present along with other types. S. aureus harboured seven different plasmid groups pMW2 (rep5), pSAS1 (rep7), pDLK1 (rep10), pUB110 (repUS12), Saa6159 (rep16), pKH12 (rep21) and pSA1308 (rep21). The overall incidence of IncF type plasmids was 56.5 per cent followed by Col type plasmids 18.3 per cent and IncX 5.3 per cent. Other plasmid types identified were <5 per cent.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Results from the study may serve as a baseline data for the occurrence of AMR genes and plasmids in India. Information on the association between phenotypic and genotypic expression of AMR was deciphered from the data. Further studies on the mechanism of antibiotic resistance dissemination are essential for enhancing clinical lifetime of antibiotics.

AB  - Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a rare variant of thrombotic microangiopathy, is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal impairment. The condition is associated with poor clinical outcomes with high morbidity and mortality. Atypical HUS predominantly affects the kidneys but has the potential to cause multi-organ system dysfunction. This uncommon disorder is caused by a genetic abnormality in the complement alternative pathway resulting in over-activation of the complement system and formation of microvascular thrombi. Abnormalities of the complement pathway may be in the form of mutations in key complement genes or autoantibodies against specific complement factors. We discuss the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, complications, and management of aHUS. We also review the efficacy and safety of the novel therapeutic agent, eculizumab, in aHUS, pregnancy-associated aHUS, and aHUS in renal transplant patients.

AB  - Biliary tract shows a large number of anatomic variations and duplication of the bile duct is an extremely rare anomaly. It has been reported to be associated with other congenital conditions like Abnormal Pancreato Biliary Junction (APBJ), biliary atresia and choledochal cyst and may lead to complications like cholangitis, choledocholithiasis and malignancy. The clinical presentation may be with one of the above complications and the condition usually reveals itself only on imaging investigations, as a surprise to the radiologist and the surgeon. Its detection is important prior to any biliary tract surgery to prevent inadvertent bile duct injury. The authors report a case of a rare subtype of extrahepatic bile duct duplication with coexisting choledochal cyst.

AB  - Prognostic indices combining several clinical and laboratory parameters have been proposed for prognostication in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Recently, international consortium on CLL proposed an international prognostic index (CLL-IPI) integrating clinical, molecular, and genetic parameters. The present study was designed to evaluate the reproducibility of CLL-IPI in Indian CLL cohort. The prognostic ability of CLL-IPI in terms of overall survival (OS) and time to first treatment (TTFT) was investigated in treatment-naive CLL patients and also compared with other existing prognostic scores. For assigning scores, clinical and laboratory details were obtained from medical records, and IGHV gene mutation status, 2-microglobulin levels, and copy number variations were determined using c-DNA, ELISA, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), respectively. The scores were generated as per the weighted grades assigned to each variable involved in score categorization. The predictive value of prognostic models was assessed and compared using Harrell's C-index and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Stratification of patients according to CLL-IPI yielded significant differences in terms of OS and TTFT (p<0.001). Comparative assessment of scores for OS suggested better performance of CLL-IPI (C=0.64, AIC=740) followed by Barcelona-Brno (C=0.61, AIC=754) and MDACC score (C=0.59, AIC=759). Comparison of predictive value of prognostic scores for TTFT illustrated better performance of CLL-IPI (C=0.72, AIC=726) followed by Barcelona-Brno (C=0.68, AIC=743), modified GCLLSG (C=0.66, AIC=744), and O-CLL1 index (C=0.55, AIC=773). The results suggest better performance of CLL-IPI in terms of both OS and TTFT as compared to other available scores in our cohort.

AB  - Objective: The detailed epidemiological and molecular characterization of an outbreak of Burkholderia cepacia at a neurotrauma intensive care unit of a level 1 trauma centre is described. The stringent infection control interventions taken to successfully curb this outbreak are emphasized.
   Methods: The clinical and microbiological data for those patients who had more than one blood culture that grew B. cepacia were reviewed. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done using automated Vitek 2 systems. Prospective surveillance, environmental sampling, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were performed for extensive source tracking. Intensive infection control measures were taken to further control the hospital spread.
   Results: Out of a total 48 patients with B. cepacia bacteraemia, 15 (31%) had central line-associated blood stream infections. Two hundred and thirty-one environmental samples were collected and screened, and only two water samples grew B. cepacia with similar phenotypic characteristics. The clinical strains characterized by MLST typing were clonal. However, isolates from the water represented a novel strain type (ST-1289). Intensive terminal cleaning, disinfection of the water supply, and the augmentation of infection control activities were done to curb the outbreak. A subsequent reduction in bacteraemia cases was observed.
   Conclusion: Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy, along with the rigorous implementation of essential hospital infection control practices is required for successful containment of this pathogen and to curb such an outbreak.

AB  - Following approval of the ICD-11 by the World Health Assembly in May 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) member states will transition from the ICD-10 to the ICD-11, with reporting of health statistics based on the new system to begin on January 1, 2022. The WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse will publish Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioural and Neurodevelopmental Disorders following ICD-11's approval. The development of the ICD-11 CDDG over the past decade, based on the principles of clinical utility and global applicability, has been the most broadly international, multilingual, multidisciplinary and participative revision process ever implemented for a classification of mental disorders. Innovations in the ICD-11 include the provision of consistent and systematically characterized information, the adoption of a lifespan approach, and culture-related guidance for each disorder. Dimensional approaches have been incorporated into the classification, particularly for personality disorders and primary psychotic disorders, in ways that are consistent with current evidence, are more compatible with recovery-based approaches, eliminate artificial comorbidity, and more effectively capture changes over time. Here we describe major changes to the structure of the ICD-11 classification of mental disorders as compared to the ICD-10, and the development of two new ICD-11 chapters relevant to mental health practice. We illustrate a set of new categories that have been added to the ICD-11 and present the rationale for their inclusion. Finally, we provide a description of the important changes that have been made in each ICD-11 disorder grouping. This information is intended to be useful for both clinicians and researchers in orienting themselves to the ICD-11 and in preparing for implementation in their own professional contexts.

KW  - OPHTHALMIC MANIFESTATIONS
AB  - A 45-year-old diabetic male, with diabetic retinopathy and medically uncontrolled neovascular glaucoma (NVG) underwent intracameral bevacizumab followed by trabeculectomy, with controlled intraocular pressures (IOP) post-operatively, OD: 12 mmHg; OS: 14 mmHg. Patient was referred to hematology, where he was diagnosed as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and started on imatinib mesylate. Thereafter, he presented with recurrence of neovascularization and vascularization of the bleb along with OS vitreous hemorrhage at 6 weeks follow-up. While he was planned for OS vitreo-retinal surgery, he presented with OD spontaneous hyphema with raised IOP (OD: 38 mmHg, OS: 16 mmHg). He had maintained a tight glycemic control. Following imatinib therapy, there was a rapid progression and recurrence of neovascularization, eventually leading to failure of trabeculectomy OD and bilateral severe loss of vision. Imatinib may be implicated in the worsening of NVG in CML patients, especially with co-existing diabetes and thus, such patients should receive regular thorough ophthalmic evaluation as long as imatinib continues.

AB  - Keratoconus (KC) is a bilateral corneal dystrophy and a multifactorial, multigenic disorder with an etiology involving a strong environmental component and complex inheritance patterns. The underlying pathophysiology of KC is poorly understood because of potential crosstalk between genetic-epigenetic variants possibly triggered by the environmental factors. Here, we decode the etiopathological basis of KC using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic approaches. The lack of relevant models that accurately imitate this condition has been particularly limiting in terms of the effective management of KC. Tissue engineered in vitro models of KC could address this need and generate valuable insights into its etiopathology for the establishment of disease models to accelerate drug discovery.

AB  - Cisplatin has been confined due to the reported cases of nephrotoxicity. In the present study, an active xanthone, Mangiferin (from Mangifera indica) was investigated for its defensive role in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Male wistar albino rats were divided into six groups i.e., group 1 (normal); group 2 (cisplatin control); group 3, 4, and 5 (mangiferin 10, 20, and 40mg/kg, i.p.); and per se (40mg/kg; i.p.). The treatment was given for 10 days. On day 7, single dose of cisplatin 8mg/kg i.p. was administered to induce nephrotoxicity in all groups except normal and per se. On day 11, animals were anesthetized, blood was taken from heart and serum was separated. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed and kidneys were isolated and preserved for histopathological, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and western blot analysis. Cisplatin control group showed significant impairment in renal function due to increased inflammation and oxidative stress which was also confirmed by histopathology and MAPK pathway proteins expression. However, pretreatment with mangiferin 20 and 40mg/kg significantly reversed the renal function along with the structural changes and the levels of antioxidants. Mangiferin treatment attenuated DNA damage and apoptotic pathway.

AB  - The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostatic cancer. However, PSMA expression is also noted in various benign and malignant nonprostatic neoplasms in the endothelial cells of tumor-associated neovasculature. We performed Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT in a 14-year-old boy with juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA) to explore its theranostic potential. The scan revealed high uptake in the lesion. Performance of PSMA PET/CT in JNA opens up new frontiers with respect to radiological staging, early recurrence identification, and perhaps even radioligand therapy of residual/recurrent JNAs in the future.

AB  - About 1.35 million babies are born with congenital heart disease each year globally. Most of these are expected to lead normal, productive lives if they are treated in time. However, 90% of babies born with congenital heart disease live in regions where medical care is inadequate or unavailable. The privilege of early diagnosis and timely intervention is restricted to only those born in developed countries. Added to the burden of congenital heart disease is rheumatic heart disease, which remains a global health problem in many low-income and middle-income countries. Providing optimal care for all these children is a daunting task, and requires funds and proper planning at various levels of the health care system. This article describes the burden of pediatric heart disease, including lacunae in the current state, as well as challenges and opportunities for providing optimal care to this large population of children.

AB  - Purpose: To study the change in intraocular pressure (IOP) and angle status after phacoemulsification in a cohort of primary angle closure hypertension (PACHT) patients.
   Setting: Tertiary Eye Care, India.
   Design: Prospective interventional case-series.
   Methods: Case-series of 18 eyes of 18 patients. Preoperative biometry including axial length, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, and central corneal thickness were studied. Preoperative and post-operative IOP, number of topical glaucoma medications, angle swept source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) parameters of nasal and temporal angle opening distance, trabecular iris space area, scleral spur angle, lens vault and circumferential iridotrabecular contact (ITC) were studied and their correlations derived.
   Results: The mean preoperative IOP, 31 +/- 6 mm Hg, decreased to 14 +/- 1 mm Hg at 6-months postoperative period, P < 0.001, a fall by 58 +/- 14%. The number of glaucoma medications reduced from 4(3-5) to 2(1-3), P < 0.001. All SS-OCT studied parameters denoted significant angle widening postsurgery. The ITC % reduced from 52 (16-100) to 19(0-97), P < 0.001. The preoperative ITC showed moderate to strong correlation with all preoperative nasal and temporal angle parameters. It also showed moderate positive correlation with percentage fall in IOP at 1-month postoperative period. The preoperative ACD showed significant negative correlation with preoperative and postoperative ITC.
   Conclusions: PACHT patients benefit significantly from cataract surgery with marked angle widening, IOP reduction and a decrease in the number of glaucoma medications. The SS-OCT derived circumferential iridotrabecular contact index can be used as the single best parameter to indicate the preoperative angle status and predict postoperative change in IOP, as against the numerous single section measured angle parameters.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the difficulty perceived of each step of phacoemulsification and analyze the factors affecting them. Methods: Overall, 12 trainee residents were allotted 10 cases of phacoemulsification of eyes with senile cataract, under a single observer, and the steps of each surgery were rated from very easy to very difficult with a questionnaire. The completion rates of steps and complications of each surgery were noted. Principal component analysis of the responses to the difficulty level questionnaire was conducted to obtain factors resulting in the perceived difficulty. Results: The lowest difficulty scores were for initial step of incision creation (1.63 +/- 0.84), followed by intraocular lens insertion (2.51 +/- 0.8). The most difficult step was divide/chop of the nucleus (3.74 +/- 0.97) followed by phacoemulsification (3.32 +/- 0.82). Highest completion rates were seen for the initial steps of the surgery and the lowest for divide/chop. We identified two major patterns of difficulty among the trainees -one for steps involving high amount of binocularity and the other, for steps involving high precision of hand control. The rate of complication of our study was within acceptable range. Conclusion: Although trainees have practiced phacoemulsification steps on simulation, real-life situation may bring in unprecedented level of difficulty and challenges, which may be documented and used for targeted improvement of surgical skills. Stereopsis and hand control training should form a major part of training modules of cataract surgery both on simulation and real-life scenarios.

AB  - A 19-year-old female, having aniridia with secondary glaucoma, presented with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP) in the right eye (RE) on maximal topical and systemic medications. On examination, RE had a subluxated cataractous lens with advanced cupping. She underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. On postoperative day 1, as the IOP was 32 mmHg, one releasable suture was removed followed by gentle bleb massage. On postoperative day 2, suprachoroidal hemorrhage was noted, for which the patient underwent two drainage procedures. Hemorrhagic choroidals resolved completely 4 weeks after drainage.

AB  - Common cold is an acute illness affecting pediatric population in particular. The use of antihistamines is a common practice, with cetirizine being a frequently used drug with a good safety profile. However, adverse events due to the use of antihistamines have been rarely reported, such as drug-induced dystonia with the use of cetirizine. In our present case, dystonia due to the intake of cetirizine was observed, which the patient responded well to the use of benzodiazapines, namely, clonazepam. We report this case to highlight the occurrence of this adverse event with the use of cetirizine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Around 7%-33% of cases of neurocysticercosis (NCC) have intraventricular involvement, and the fourth ventricle is the most frequent site. Medical management and various surgical approaches have been described for treating this disease. The objective of this study was to describe technical modification for endoscopic fourth ventricular NCC removal in a series of 5 cases.
   METHODS: In this study (January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017), all cases of fourth ventricular NCC which were treated with a special technique (endoscopic transcortical transforaminal transaqueductal approach) using a rigid endoscope system and 6-French infant feeding tube (IFT) were included in the study. The IFT was passed through the main channel, the cyst was engaged at the tip by applying gentle suction with a 20 cm(3) syringe, and the cyst was removed along with the whole endoscopic assembly. Patient's clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data were retrieved from the department database records.
   RESULTS: Five patients (3 men, 2 women; mean age, 20 years; range, 11-27 years) were enrolled. All patients had features of raised intracranial pressure. Two patients also had drop attacks, and one presented with altered sensorium and one had upgaze palsy. Duration of symptoms ranged from 3 months to 3 years. All patients had isolated fourth ventricular NCC with obstructive hydrocephalus. Complete removal of the neurocysticercal cyst could be performed in all patients without any injury to the periaqueductal region or fornix. There was no intraoperative rupture of the neurocysticercal cyst. On follow-up (range, 12-28 months; mean, 19.4 months), all patients had relief of symptoms and imaging showed no cyst and hydrocephalus.
   CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that our endoscopic approach is safe, simple, cost-effective, and allows minimally invasive removal of the fourth ventricle cyst and treatment of hydrocephalus without any morbidity.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy of the topical, systemic and targeted therapy (TST) protocol in management of fungal keratitis. Method: All cases of treatment-naive smear- or culture-proven fungal keratitis presenting between June 2013 and May 2017 were recruited. The TST protocol included initial treatment with topical natamycin 5% with addition of oral ketoconazole or voriconazole in ulcers with size >5 mm, depth >50%, or impending perforation. Topical voriconazole 1% was included in case of poor response at 7 to 10 days. Intrastromal or intracameral antifungal injections were administered in case of poor response to combination therapy. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in case of poor response to any of the regimen. Results: The study included 223 cases of fungal keratitis with a mean age of 43.6 +/- 15.3 years and a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. The mean area of the ulcer and infiltrate at presentation was 25.52 +/- 19 and 25.7 +/- 14.4 mm(2), respectively. Corrected distance visual acuity at presentation was 2.05 +/- 0.43 logMAR that improved to 1.6 +/- 0.4 logMAR at 3 months. Fusarium (42.2%) was the most common microorganism isolated, followed by Aspergillus (32.8%). The mean healing time was 41.5 +/- 22.2 days, with a final scar size of 14.6 +/- 8.2 mm(2). The treatment success rate with the TST protocol was 79.8%. Corneal perforation developed in 7% of cases (n = 15), and keratoplasty was performed for 20.2% of cases (n = 45). Conclusions: The TST protocol provides a stepwise treatment algorithm for management of cases of fungal keratitis with varying severity.

AB  - PurposeWe assessed the surgical outcome of cloacal malformation (CM) with emphasis on need and timing of vaginal replacement.MethodsAn ambispective study of CM was carried out including prospective cases from April 2014 to December 2017 and retrospective cases that came for routine follow-up. Early vaginal replacement was defined as that done at time of bowel pull through. Surgical procedures and associated complications were noted. The current state of urinary continence, faecal continence and renal functions was assessed.Results18 patients with CM were studied with median age at presentation of 5days (1day-4years). 18;3;2 babies underwent colostomy; vaginostomy; vesicostomy. All patients underwent posterior sagittal anorectovaginourethroplasty (PSARVUP)/ Pull through at a median age of 13 (4-46) months. Ten patients had long common channel length (>3cm). Six patients underwent early vaginal replacement at a median age of 14 (7-25) months with ileum; sigmoid colon; vaginal switch; hemirectum in 2;2;1;1. Three with long common channel who underwent only PSARVUP had inadequate introitus at puberty. Complications included anal mucosal prolapse, urethrovaginal fistula, perineal wound dehiscence, pyometrocolpos, bladder injury and pelvic abscess. Persistentvesicoureteric reflux remained in 8. 5;2 patients had urinary; faecal incontinence. 2 patients of uterus didelphys are having menorrhagia. One patient succumbed to sepsis at 7months age. Renal functions remained normal in 16. One patient is undergoing dialysis.ConclusionEarly vaginal replacement in CM is feasible. Patients with inadequate introitus may suffer from menorrhagia. A regular follow-up is mandatory.

AB  - Aim: There is an urgent need to design a reliable diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB). Methods: Real-time immuno-PCR (RT-I-PCR) assay was devised for the quantitative detection of a cocktail of mycobacterial MPT64 (Rv1980c) and PstS1 (Rv0934) in TB patients. Results: A broad dynamic range of 0.95pg/ml-95ng/ml of MPT64+PstS1 was detected in TB patients. In smear-positive (n=59) and smear-negative (n=42) pulmonary TB cases, sensitivities of 93.2 and 83.3% were observed, respectively with 92.8% specificity, whereas a sensitivity of 77.9% and a specificity of 91.3% were observed in extrapulmonary TB cases (n=86). Furthermore, significantly reduced MPT64+PstS1 concentrations (p <0.001) were noticed in patients on therapy by RT-I-PCR as compared with untreated patients. Conclusion: Our RT-I-PCR assay revealed high sensitivity especially for the rapid diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary TB and paucibacillary extrapulmonary TB samples, which could also monitor the dynamics of disease in patients on therapy.

AB  - ObjectiveTo study the utility of aquagenic wrinkling as screening test for children with cystic fibrosis.DesignEvaluation of diagnostic test.SettingPediatric Chest Clinic, and Pediatric Wards of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi.ParticipantsThree groups (children with cystic fibrosis, carriers of cystic fibrosis, and controls).MethodsTime taken to develop aquagenic wrinkling was measured. The test was performed by asking the enrolled subject to put their one hand in water and was checked for development of wrinkling every minute, and a photograph was also taken every minute.ResultsA total of 64 children with cystic fibrosis, 64 controls and 64 carriers were enrolled in the study. Median (IQR) time to develop aquagenic wrinkling in the three groups was 2 (1.5,3) minutes, 4 (3,5) minutes and 8 (5,11) minutes, respectively. The optimal cut-off was calculated as 3 minutes by Receiver operating characteristic curve with a sensitivity and specificity for identification of children with cystic fibrosis as 81% and 57%, respectively. The area under curve was 76.5%. The 3 minute cut-off for development of aquagenic wrinkling was applied to 54 children referred for sweat test. 20 children had sweat chloride values of 60 mEq/l and diagnosed as cystic fibrosis. 15 of these developed aquagenic wrinkling at 3 minutes, giving a sensitivity of 75%.ConclusionsIn places with no facility for sweat test, children with phenotype compatible with cystic fibrosis who develop aquagenic wrinkling in 3 minutes may be diagnosed as probable cystic fibrosis and referred for confirmation by sweat test.

AB  - Aims: Idiopathic nature of male infertility disorder needs to be investigated by different horizons of molecular biology for its treatment and to device male contraceptive. Further, it can also aid in advancement of assisted reproductive technology (ART), as nowadays the failure and disquiets of ART are consistent. Herein, we have attempted to find out proteins responsible for male infertility by comparing proteome profile of sperms collected from normal control and asthenozoospermic (AS) males.
   Main methods: Differential proteome profiles were studied by 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and mass spectrometry. The confirmation of proteome profiling results was done by western blotting and ELISA. Quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR was also performed in an independent cohort of AS and normal individuals to investigate the transcriptional regulation of proteins.
   Key findings: Although seven differentially regulated proteins were identified, highpoints of the study were two proteins, TEX40 and ATP6V0A2. Lower expression of a crucial sperm motility related protein, TEX40 is reported for the first time in clinically diagnosed AS males in the present investigation. Most likely with reference to previous findings the down regulation of TEX40 leads to fewer entries of calcium ions in the sperm and lower expression of ATP6V0A2 is responsible for acrosomal de-acidification.
   Significance: Conclusively, the down regulation of these two proteins in AS males might result in diminished sperm motility. The findings can be worthwhile for male contraception and ART management besides their use for male infertility therapy.

AB  - Background: Alcohol consumption in India has been rising at an increasing rate. A better understanding of current trends of consumption and expenditure is necessary for tackling future challenges.
   Aims: To determine association between household income and amount of alcohol consumed, type of beverage consumed, and expenditure on alcohol in Indian households across different income-groups for rural and urban areas.
   Method: Secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Consumption Expenditure Survey by National Sample Survey Organization for 2011-12 in a nationally representative sample of over 65,000 households. We used estimates of average household Monthly Per Capita Consumer Expenditure (MPCE) including distribution of households and persons over the MPCE range, break-up of average MPCE by commodity group.
   Results and Conclusion: Households in India, on average, consumed 0.18 L of all alcoholic beverages per month (0.22 L in rural areas; 0.10 L in urban areas). The absolute quantity of alcohol consumed was higher among higher income-groups in both rural and urban areas. Country liquor was used by a majority across India; was used seven times more than toddy and beer, and 3.5 times more than Indian Made Foreign Liquor. Households' expenditure on alcohol was Rs.16.46 (US$0.26) per month, which was 0.98% of average total household MPCE. Fraction of average total household MPCE on alcohol in rural areas (1.14%) was almost double that of urban areas (0.62%). It increased steadily from lowest (0.5%) to highest (1.7%) income group in rural areas whereas in urban areas, it varied a little (0.5-0.8%) across income groups.

AB  - A patient, being a moderate myope with an axial length of 24.71 mm, presented to us with a fresh rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and marked peripheral chorioretinal degeneration. Difficulty in maneuvering with the standard 23 gauge vitrectomy cutter, inability to identify the break due to poor peripheral contrast, inadequate laser uptake, and an unusual large silicon oil fill (7.3 ml) were a few findings raising suspicion. Postoperative ocular ultrasonography showed an oblate eyeball with a relatively longer oblique axis (26.1 mm) as compared to the axial length confirming our suspicion. Oblateness should be suspected when the chorioretinal degenerations are more marked in the periphery as compared to the posterior pole. Intraoperative difficulties should be kept in mind while operating such cases.

AB  - Objective: There is limited literature on cognitive, behaviour and sleep-related adverse effects of levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine among adult epilepsy patients, except for what is available from the initial efficacy trials. This study was initiated with the aim to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of various cognitive, behaviour and sleep-related adverse effects of levetiracetam versus oxcarbazepine among people with epilepsy.
   Methods: The study was conducted in two parts: part A was a cross-sectional study, and part B was a longitudinal study. Trail making test A & B, digit symbol substitution test, Stroop colour and word test, controlled oral word association test and PGI memory scale, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, sleep log and ESS-I were used for assessment of cognitive, behaviour and sleep-related adverse effects.
   Results: In the cross-sectional as well as prospective study, no significant difference was observed in the cognitive performance of patients in levetiracetam and oxcarbazepine group in any of the cognitive assessment. Among 120 patients enrolled in the cross-sectional study, significantly higher number of patients in the levetiracetam group compared to the oxcarbazepine group,had agitation/aggression (20% vs10%, p = 0.047) and irritability (26.7% vs 3.3%, p = 0.007).Among 132 patients enrolled in the prospective study, significantly higher increase in the domain score of agitation/aggression (14.5% vs 1.6%, p = 0.028) and irritability (17.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.018) was observed in the levetiracetam group compared to oxcarbazepine group. A significantly higher proportion of patients in the oxcarbazepine group had hypersomnolence (11.3% vs 1.6%, p = 0.026), as compared to the levetiracetam group.
   Significance: On cross-sectional as well as on longitudinal assessment, nearly one-fifth of patients on levetiracetam have behaviour related adverse effects, with dose modification required for half among these. Nearly 11% of patients on oxcarbazepine reported sleep-related adverse effects (higher total sleep duration per 24 h).

AB  - Introduction Dysregulation of apoptosis has been explored in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); yet, its correlation with clinical outcomes in pediatric AML is unknown. This study was aimed to analyze percentage of apoptosis and apoptosis mediated through the intrinsic pathway with clinical outcomes in patients with pediatric AML. Methods This prospective study included pediatric AML patients enrolled from July 2013 to August 2016. Annexin-V (marker of total apoptosis) and caspase-9 expression (marker of intrinsic pathway) was determined in baseline bone marrow (BM) samples by flow cytometery and compared with controls (unaffected BM of solid tumors and peripheral blood [PB] of unaffected siblings). Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared using log-rank test. Results A total of 151 AML patients were enrolled, median age 10 (range: 0.7-18 years). Annexin-V expression in blast cells was significantly high in AML patients as compared to BM of subjects with solid tumors (P = 0.01) and PB of healthy subjects (P = 0.04). Caspase-9 expression in blast cells was not significantly different. Median annexin-V expression was significantly higher in patients with WBC count >= 11 000/mm(3) (P = 0.02), poor-risk cytogenetics (P = 0.02), the absence of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 translocation (P = 0.004), and the absence of NPM1 mutation (P = 0.05). Patients with high annexin-V expression had significantly inferior OS (P = 0.05) in univariate analysis but not in multivariate analysis (P = 0.32). Conclusion Apoptosis as a whole was found to be activated in baseline BM samples of AML patients. High apoptosis may be associated with high-risk phenotype in this disease.

AB  - Background Mucinous adenocarcinoma (MC) of gallbladder is a rare histological subtype of gallbladder carcinoma (CaGB) which presents at an advanced stage and is associated with a poor prognosis compared to the conventional CaGB. This variant has been described mostly as reports or series, except for a single detailed histological and immunohistochemical analysis. Till date, there are no studies describing the cytomorphology of MC in detail. Hence, we undertook this study to analyse the cytomorphological features of MC. Methods A retrospective cytomorphological analysis was performed on MC identified out of all CaGB diagnosed on cytology over a period of last 4 years. The architectural and cellular features were recorded in a structured proforma. Results Thirty-three cases (33/987, 3.3%) were identified as MC. Extracellular mucin >90% was seen only in 3 cases whereas the remaining 30 had 50%-90% mucin. The predominant architectural pattern was tight epithelial fragments (14/33). The tumour cells were mostly of intermediate size (31/33) and had moderate amount of cytoplasm (31/33). Majority of the cases showed moderate nuclear pleomorphism (28/33) and nuclear chromatin was fine granular (17/33) or vesicular (14/33). Most of the cases had single and small nucleoli (26/33). Presence of inflammation composed predominantly of polymorphs was noted in 25 cases. Majority of the cases showed no (15/33) or scant necrosis (13/33). Conclusion The morphological features of MC can very well be demonstrated on cytology. As they are associated with poor prognosis compared to conventional CaGB, cytopathologists should try to document the subtype.

AB  - Oxidative stress plays a major role in myocardial injury. Morin, a bioflavonoid has known to possess various biological activities in previous studies. Hence, this study evaluated the cardioprotective mechanism(s) of Morin against isoproterenol induced myocardial necrosis in rats. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n=8) i.e., I (normal), II (ISO-control), III, IV and V (morin 20, 40 and 80mg/kg respectively). Groups III, IV and V were treated orally with daily doses of Morin accordingly for 28 days. On 26th and 27th day, a single injection of isoproterenol was injected (85mg/kg s.c.) at 24h interval to induce myocardial necrosis in group II, III, IV and V. On 28th day, hemodynamic parameters were evaluated, animals were euthanised and heart was excised for measurement of various parameters. In ISO-control rats, there was deterioration of hemodynamic parameters, decreased anti-oxidants levels, increased cardiac injury markers and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6). Also, there was increased level of Bax, Caspase-3, p-JNK, p-38 and NF-kappa B and decreased expression of Bcl-2 and p-ERK1/2 in ISO-C group. Morin dose-dependently improved hemodynamic profile, increased anti-oxidant levels, normalized myocardial architecture and reduced inflammatory markers and apoptosis. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of MAPK pathway proteins demonstrated the mechanism responsible for anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory potential of morin. Thus, this study substantiated the beneficial effect of Morin by virtue of its modulation of MAPK pathway in myocardial injury.

AB  - Background & objectives: Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for causing nosocomial infections. A. baumannii develops resistance to various antimicrobial agents including carbapenems, thereby complicating the treatment. This study was performed to characterize the isolates for the presence of various beta-lactamases encoding genes and to type the isolates to compare our clones with the existing international clones across five centres in India.
   Methods: A total 75 non-repetitive clinical isolates of A. baumannii from five different centres were included in this study. All the isolates were confirmed as A. baumannii by bla(OXA-51-like) PCR. Multiplex PCR was performed to identify the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases. Multilocus sequence typing was performed to find the sequence type (ST) of the isolates. e-BURST analysis was done to assign each ST into respective clonal complex.
   Results: bla(OXA-51-like) was present in all the 75 isolates. The predominant Class D carbapenemase was bla(OXA-23-like) followed by Class B carbapenemase, bla(NDM-like). Class A carbapenemase was not observed. bla(PER-like) was the predominant extended spectrum beta-lactamase. ST-848, ST-451 and ST-195 were the most common STs. Eight-novel STs were identified. e-BURST analysis showed that the 75 A. baumannii isolates were clustered into seven clonal complexes and four singletons, of which, clonal complex 208 was the largest.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Most of the isolates were grouped under clonal complex 208 which belongs to the international clonal lineage 2. High occurrence of ST-848 carrying bla(OXA-23-like) gene suggested that ST-848 could be an emerging lineage spreading carbapenem resistance in India.

AB  - The Indian Council of Medical Research, in 2013, initiated the Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance & Research Network (AMRSN) to enable compilation of data on six pathogenic groups on antimicrobial resistance from the country. The overarching aim of this network was to understand the extent and pattern of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and use this evidence to guide strategies to control the spread of AMR. This article describes the conception and implementation of this AMR surveillance network for India. Also described are the challenges, limitations and benefits of this approach. Data from the Network have shown increasing resistance in Gram-negative bacteria in the hospitals that are part of this network. Combined resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones and increasing carbapenem resistance are worrisome, as it has an important bearing on the patients' outcome and thus needs to be addressed urgently. Data generated through this Network have been used to develop treatment guidelines, which will be supportive in harmonizing treatment practices across the tertiary level healthcare institutions in the country. While, the major benefit of having a surveillance system is the collection of real-time accurate data on AMR including the mechanisms of resistance, representativeness to community, sustaining the current effort and expanding the current activities to next levels of healthcare settings are the major challenges. The data emanating from the network besides providing evidence, expose several gaps and lacunae in the ecosystem and highlight opportunities for action by multiple stakeholders.

AB  - BackgroundProtein secretion is an essential process in all eukaryotes including organisms belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes many intracellular parasites. The apicomplexan parasites possess a specialized collection of secretory organelles that release a number of proteins to facilitate the invasion of host cells and some of these proteins also participate in immune evasion. Like in other eukaryotes, these parasites possess a series of membrane-bound compartments, namely the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the intermediate compartments (IC) or vesicular tubular clusters (VTS) and Golgi complex through which proteins pass in a sequential and vectorial fashion. Two sets of proteins; COPI and COPII are important for directing the sequential transfer of material between the ER and Golgi complex.ResultsHere, using in silico approaches, we identify the components of COPI and COPII complexes in the genome of apicomplexan organisms. The results showed that the COPI and COPII protein complexes are conserved in most apicomplexan genomes with few exceptions. Diversity among the components of COPI and COPII complexes in apicomplexan is either due to the absence of a subunit or due to the difference in the number of protein domains. For example, the COPI epsilon subunit and COPII sec13 subunit is absent in Babesia bovis, Theileria parva, and Theileria annulata genomes. Phylogenetic and domain analyses for all the proteins of COPI and COPII complexes was performed to predict their evolutionary relationship and functional significance.ConclusionsThe study thus provides insights into the apicomplexan COPI and COPII coating machinery, which is crucial for parasites secretory network needed for the invasion of host cells.

AB  - Psoriasis is an immune mediated inflammatory skin disease with complex etiology involving interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors as disease initiating event. Enhanced understanding on genetic risk factors, differentially expressed genes, deregulated proteins and pathway-targeted therapeutics have established multiple axis of psoriasis pathogenesis. So far, loci in 424 genes are reported to be associated with psoriasis alongside copy number variations and epigenetic alterations. From clinical perspective, presence of specific genetic trigger(s) in individual psoriasis patient could aid in devising a personalized therapeutic strategy. Therefore, the review presents an updates on reported genomic alterations and their subsequent course of cutaneous inflammations that potentially drive to psoriasis.

AB  - Background: Therapeutic adherence is one of the most important determinants of the outcome with OST. There are no published studies that have explored the impact of change in tablet formulation of buprenorphine-naloxone from one brand to another among patients receiving OST. Objectives: The current study is aimed at evaluation of the impact of change in buprenorphine-naloxone formulation on prescription pattern, treatment adherence, and patient satisfaction with OST. Methods: Our study was a cross sectional study based on a cohort of patients who were receiving OST at the study setting. Changes in prescription pattern, reports of subjective opioid withdrawal symptoms, or observation of objective opioid withdrawal symptoms were noted from the case records. The satisfaction and concerns of the patients with buprenorphine-naloxone formulations were assessed using a semi-structured proforma. Results: An increase in dose of buprenorphine-naloxone was noted in 22 participants, since formulation change. Twenty participants reported that the color of the formulation was different from the previous one, the intensity of effect was reported to be different by 87% participants. Seventy-three percent participants endorsed that increase in dose can be a possible solution to address the perceived differences in the effects of two formulations. Changes in physical attributes of the formulation, perception among treatment seeking peers regarding such changes in treatment, and lack of sense of autonomy regarding one's treatment play a more important role in determining response of the patients to changes in formulation of buprenorphine-naloxone.

AB  - Differentiating Crohn's disease (CD) and intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) has remained a dilemma for most of the clinicians in the developing world, which are endemic for ITB, and where the disease burden of inflammatory bowel disease is on the rise. Although, there are certain clinical (diarrhea/hematochezia/perianal disease common in CD; fever/night sweats common in ITB), endoscopic (longitudinal/aphthous ulcers common in CD; transverse ulcers/patulous ileocaecal valve common in ITB), histologic (caseating/confluent/large granuloma common in ITB; microgranuloma common in CD), microbiologic (positive stain/culture for acid fast-bacillus in ITB), radiologic (long segment involvement/comb sign/skip lesions common in CD; necrotic lymph node/contiguous ileocaecal involvement common in ITB), and serologic differences between CD and ITB, the only exclusive features are caseation necrosis on biopsy, positive smear for acid-fast bacillus (AFB) and/or AFB culture, and necrotic lymph node on cross-sectional imaging in ITB. However, these exclusive features are limited by poor sensitivity, and this has led to the development of multiple multi-parametric predictive models. These models are also limited by complex formulae, small sample size and lack of validation across other populations. Several new parameters have come up including the latest Bayesian meta-analysis, enumeration of peripheral blood T-regulatory cells, and updated computed tomography based predictive score. However, therapeutic anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) trial, and subsequent clinical and endoscopic response to ATT is still required in a significant proportion of patients to establish the diagnosis. Therapeutic ATT trial is associated with a delay in the diagnosis of CD, and there is a need for better modalities for improved differentiation and reduction in the need for ATT trial.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring of imatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is an ongoing debate. We studied the influence of imatinib trough levels on therapeutic response in 206 newly diagnosed patients with CML. We also compared the drug levels in patients taking branded and generic imatinib. Imatinib levels were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Marked inter-individual variability was seen in imatinib levels (coefficient of variation = 69%). Trough levels were significantly higher in patients who attained complete cytogenetic response than those who did not (2213.9 +/- 1101 vs. 1648.6 +/- 1403.4ng/mL; p < .001). Patients with major molecular response (MMR) had higher trough levels than those without MMR (2333.4 +/- 1112 vs. 1643.4 +/- 1383.9ng/mL; p = .001). Patients with trough levels <= 1000ng/mL were at high risk for failure of imatinib therapy [RR =1.926; 95%CI (1.562, 2.374); p < .001]. Trough levels emerged as an independent predictor of imatinib response in multivariate analysis. To conclude, imatinib trough levels significantly influence cytogenetic and molecular response and might emerge as a potential biomarker for therapeutic response in CML.

AB  - Background: The burden of noncommunicable diseases and their risk factors has rapidly increased worldwide, including in India. Innovative management strategies with electronic decision support and task sharing have been assessed for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and depression individually, but an integrated package for multiple chronic condition management in primary care has not been evaluated.
   Methods: In a prospective, multicenter, open-label, cluster-randomized controlled trial involving 40 community health centers, using hypertension and diabetes mellitus as entry points, we evaluated the effectiveness of mWellcare, an mHealth system consisting of electronic health record storage and an electronic decision support for the integrated management of 5 chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, current tobacco and alcohol use, and depression) versus enhanced usual care among patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus in India. At trial end (12-month follow-up), using intention-to-treat analysis, we examined the mean difference between arms in change in systolic blood pressure and glycated hemoglobin as primary outcomes and fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, predicted 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease, depression score, and proportions reporting tobacco and alcohol use as secondary outcomes. Mixed-effects regression models were used to account for clustering and other confounding variables.
   Results: Among 3698 enrolled participants across 40 clusters (mean age, 55.1 years; SD, 11 years; 55.2% men), 3324 completed the trial. There was no evidence of difference between the 2 arms for systolic blood pressure (=-0.98; 95% CI, -4.64 to 2.67) and glycated hemoglobin (=0.11; 95% CI, -0.24 to 0.45) even after adjustment of several key variables (adjusted differences for systolic blood pressure: - 0.31 [95% CI, -3.91 to 3.29]; for glycated hemoglobin: 0.08 [95% CI, -0.27 to 0.44]). The mean within-group changes in systolic blood pressure in mWellcare and enhanced usual care were -13.65 mmHg versus -12.66 mmHg, respectively, and for glycated hemoglobin were -0.48% and -0.58%, respectively. Similarly, there were no differences in the changes between the 2 groups for tobacco and alcohol use or other secondary outcomes.
   Conclusions: We did not find an incremental benefit of mWellcare over enhanced usual care in the management of the chronic conditions studied.

KW  - INDEX
AB  - Proactive detection of hemodynamic shock can prevent organ failure and save lives. Thermal imaging is a non-invasive, non-contact modality to capture body surface temperature with the potential to reveal underlying perfusion disturbance in shock. In this study, we automate early detection and prediction of shock using machine learning upon thermal images obtained in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. 539 images were recorded out of which 253 had concomitant measurement of continuous intra-arterial blood pressure, the gold standard for shock monitoring. Histogram of oriented gradient features were used for machine learning based region-of-interest segmentation that achieved 96% agreement with a human expert. The segmented center-to-periphery difference along with pulse rate was used in longitudinal prediction of shock at 0, 3, 6 and 12 hours using a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The model achieved a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 75% at 0 hours (classification), 77% at 3 hours (prediction) and 69% at 12 hours (prediction) respectively. Since hemodynamic shock associated with critical illness and infectious epidemics such as Dengue is often fatal, our model demonstrates an affordable, non-invasive, non-contact and tele-diagnostic decision support system for its reliable detection and prediction.

AB  - Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy against dietary gluten present in wheat, rye and barley and is one of the most common lifelong food-related disorders worldwide. Coeliac disease is also considered to be a systemic disorder characterized by a variable combination of gluten-related signs and symptoms and disease-specific antibodies in addition to enteropathy. The ingestion of gluten leads to the generation of harmful gluten peptides, which, in predisposed individuals, can induce adaptive and innate immune responses. The clinical presentation is extremelyvariable; patients may have severe gastrointestinal symptoms and malabsorption, extraintestinal symptoms or have no symptoms at all. Owing to the multifaceted clinical presentation, diagnosis remains a challenge and coeliac disease is heavily underdiagnosed. The diagnosis of coeliac disease is achieved by combining coeliac disease serology and small intestinal mucosal histology during a gluten-containing diet. Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong strict gluten-free diet; however, the diet is restrictive and gluten is difficult to avoid. Optimizing diagnosis and care in coeliac disease requires continuous research and education of both patients and health-care professionals.

AB  - Context: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a sleep respiration disorder with multiple pathophysiological risks. The study of OSA is important from a public health perspective due to increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and metabolic disorders. Objective: The review content contributes to amalgamate the clinico-molecular analysis of microRNAs, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), transcriptome profiles and epigenetics in the prognosis of OSA. The conceptual focus here is to demarcate the involvement of regulatory players like miRNAs that have most probable contributions towards other changes in patients leading to clinical outcomes. Methods: Literature survey was done by retrieving data from databases such as Google Scholar, PubMed and Science Direct. Results: Abundant reports have suggested the involvement and role of biomarkers such as CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and CAMs but there are interspersed speculations about the involvement of epigenetics in OSA. Conclusions: miRNA and transcriptome profiling, DNA methylation and SNPs are some of the less researched aspects that aim to bridge the gap in the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of OSA. The quest for biomarkers in OSA is now distinctly achieving new heights. In the context of diagnosis, the above mentioned epigenetic regulators are likely to emerge as viable contenders.

AB  - Objective: To prospectively compare positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and FNAC for diagnosis of non- traumatic vertebral lesions fracture in countries like India where tuberculosis is endemic. Methods: Fifty four patients with non-traumatic spontaneous vertebral lesions were prospectively studied. All patients underwent CEMRI focusing on the spinal lesions, whole-body PET-CT and FNAC.Results were then analysed and compared with final diagnosis obtained either by FNAC or clinical follow up. Results: Out of total 54 patients, FNAC from the spinal lesion could establish diagnosis in 36 patients (26 TB, 1 Fungal and 9 tumors). Of the remaining 18 patients, diagnosis could be established in 7 utilizing FNAC from other sites as dictated by PET-CT. In the remanining11 patients, the diagnosis and management was decided on the concordance of MRI and PET-CT. Conclusion: All three investigations have their own advantages and pitfalls and they complement each other in reaching the final diagnosis. MRI has a better pick up rate (than PET-CT) for inflammatory lesions. PET-CT on the other hand has better sensitivity for malignant vertebral disease. Diagnosis was established if FNAC was conclusive. In cases where FNAC was inconclusive, an additional 38.9% patients' diagnosis could be established by FNAC from other sites of involvement as dictated by PET-CT. This was an incremental utility of PET-CT. When even this fails, there were two possible scenarios-MRI and PET-CT in concordance with each other. In such a scenario, the combined report of MRI and PET-CT was relied upon. The last sub group (where MRI and PET-CT were discordant and FNAC was inconclusive) still remains achilles' heel. Wide bore biopsy may help in establishing diagnosis in such group.

AB  - In the present work, cold rolling and cryo-rolling were performed on 99% commercially pure copper substrates. Both cold and cryo-rolling processes caused severe plastic deformation that led to an increase in dislocation density by 14x and 28x respectively, as compared to the pristine material. Increases in average tensile strengths, by 75% (488 MPa) and 150% (698 MPa), were observed in the two rolled materials as the result of the enhancement in dislocation density. In addition to strength, enhanced antibacterial property of cryo-rolled copper was observed in comparison to cold rolled and pristine copper. Initial adhesion and subsequent proliferation of bio-film forming Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus was reduced by 66% and 100% respectively for cryo-rolled copper. Approximately 55% protein leakage, as well as ethidium bromide (EtBr) uptake, were observed confirming rupture of cell membrane of S. aureus. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy reveals higher leaching of elemental copper in nutrient broth media from the cryo-rolled copper. Detailed investigations showed that increased dislocation led to leaching of copper ions that caused damage to the bacterial cell wall and consequently killing of bacterial cells. Cryo-rolling enhanced both strength, as well as antibacterial activity, due to the presence of dislocations.

AB  - The present work demonstrates a novel method to preferentially orient carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in an epoxy matrix using a non-uniform electric field. The alignment method is based on the principle of dielectrophoresis. Aligned CNT/epoxy composites containing 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1 wt. % CNTs, respectively were fabricated using the method. The elastic modulus and hardness of the samples evaluated using nanoindentation technique were observed to increase with increasing CNT loading. The tensile strength of nanocomposite samples containing 0.1 wt. % CNTs increased by approximately 27% due to CNT alignment in epoxy matrix.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs have emerged as an important regulatory layer in biological systems. Of the various types of lncRNAs, one class (designated as divergent RNAs/XH), which is in head-to-head overlap with the coding genes, has emerged as a critical biotype that regulates development and cellular differentiation. This work aimed to analyze previously published data on differential expression, epigenetic and network analysis in order to demonstrate the association of divergent lncRNAs, a specific biotype with the differentiation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). We have analyzed various available RNAseq databases that address the neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of hNPCs and identified differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) during cell-fate determination. Key DELs identified from the databases were experimentally verified by us in our in-vitro hNPC differentiation system. We also analyzed the change in promoter activity using ChIP-seq datasets of the histone markers H3K4me3 (activation) and H3K27me3 (inactivation) of these DELs. Additionally, we explored the change in the euchromatinization state of DELs (by analyzing DNase-seq data) during lineage-specific differentiation of hNPCs and performed their network analysis. We were able to identify differences between neuronal and astrocytic differentiation of hNPCs at the level of divergent DELs epigenetic markers, DNAase hypersensitive sites and gene expression network. Divergent lncRNAs are more involved in neuronal rather than astrocytic differentiation, while the sense downstream lncRNA biotype appears to be more involved in astrocytic differentiation. By studying the lncRNA involvement of distinct biotypes, we have been able to indicate the preferential role of a particular biotype during lineage-specific differentiation.

AB  - Purpose: To correlate the anatomical extent of ocular surface toxicity due to colours using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) with the clinical findings. Methods: Patients presenting to our emergency department with ocular colour toxicity during the Holi festival celebrations from March 2 2018 to March 5 2018 were assessed for any adnexal, conjunctival, corneal, and anterior chamber findings, as well as findings on anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Results: A total of 21 patients were observed. The average age was 23 years with 16 patients being male (76.19%). Bilateral ocular involvement was more common (13 patients, 61.90%). Clinically, the corneal changes included localized punctate epitheliopathy (type I) in 12 patients (57.14%) and diffuse punctate epitheliopathy admixed with a variable sized epithelial defect (type II) in the other 9 patients (42.85%). The visual acuity among the former group varied from 6/6 to 6/9, whereas for the latter, it ranged from 6/12 to 6/24. On ASOCT in both the types, the superficial stromal involvement was noted up to 60 microns. Interestingly in two patients with type II corneal involvement, anterior segment involvement was noted in the form of staining of the lens capsule and dense anterior chamber inflammation. Conclusions: Ocular toxicity due to colours used during Holi mainly involves the surface epithelium and the superficial stroma. This was observed clinically and also confirmed on ASOCT. The colour can rarely diffuse into the anterior chamber causing an inflammatory reaction and staining of the lens capsule. However, if managed appropriately, vision-threatening complications can be averted.

AB  - Amputation in the transfemoral amputee (TFA) results in loss of sensory feedback of the amputated limb and therefore results in the poor postural stability. To assess the postural stability, the limit of stability (LOS) is a reliable parameter. In this study, we have investigated the effect of vibrotactile feedback (VF) on the LOS during the weight shifting exercise (WSE) for a TFA. The data of centre of pressure (COP) during WSE was collected from five TFA and five healthy individuals using a zebris force plate. The VF was provided on the amputated/healthy limb's anterior and posterior part of the stump/thigh during forward and backward WSE, respectively. A customized foot insole with 24 embedded dielectric sensors was used to drive the vibratory motor. The effect of VF was analyzed by pre and post-test. Results show that with the use of VF, TFA significantly improved (t-test, p<.05) the sound limb's LOS during forward WSE. Also, ANOVA analysis between WSE divisions shows that the prosthetic limb does not follow the path of WSE. We further examine the spectral power using the Welch method to determine the dominant sway frequency of COP. It shows a decreased frequency between 0.5-2Hz in the healthy and decreased frequency between 0-0.5Hz and >2Hz in the amputee with VF. It concluded that VF could improve the LOS of TFA during WSE which ultimately leads to postural stability enhancement.

AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is defined as any disease or damage to the peripheral nerves. Imaging modalities are emerging as a complementary tool of choice for diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. This has been made possible by the advent of high-resolution ultrasound, higher field strength magnets, better surface array coils, and superior software. In addition, imaging plays a pivotal role in deciding the management. They help in determining the continuity and course of the nerve, thereby helping in the pre-surgical mapping of nerve. Imaging studies also help in prognosticating the recovery by determining the event to be acute or chronic. This article describes the imaging findings of various neuropathies affecting upper limb peripheral nerves, broadly categorized as traumatic and non-traumatic. The non-traumatic group is further divided as entrapment, infective, inflammatory and tumors.

AB  - PurposeTo provide a comprehensive update of the joint consultation of the International Consultation on Urological Diseases (ICUD) for the diagnosis and management of non-urothelial cancer of the urinary bladder.MethodsA detailed analysis of the literature was conducted reporting on the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of non-urothelial cancer of the urinary bladder. An international, multidisciplinary expert committee evaluated and graded the evidence according to the Oxford System of Evidence-based Medicine modified by the ICUD.ResultsThe major non-urothelial cancers of the urinary bladder are squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and neuroendocrine tumors. Several other non-urothelial tumors are rare but important to identify because of their aggressive behavior when compared to urothelial bladder tumors. Radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, preceded by neoadjuvant radiation or chemotherapy in some of these tumors, is the main method or treatment for resectable disease. Adjuvant therapy is not usually successful and no novel targeted or immunotherapeutic agents have been identified to provide benefit. Patients with small cell neuroendocrine tumors of the bladder should be offered chemotherapy before surgery. Because non-urothelial cancers are usually locally advanced and/or metastatic at the time of diagnosis, 5-year survival is generally poor.ConclusionsNon-urothelial cancers of the urinary bladder are rare and mostly lack established protocols for treatment. The prognosis of most of these tumors is poor because they are usually advanced at the time of diagnosis. A multimodal treatment approach should be considered to improve outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE. To compare the distribution of visual field progression rates in three subgroups of glaucoma, being primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), POAG, and juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG).
   METHODS. We assessed glaucoma patients treated in an Indian tertiary care setting with at least four visual field assessments. We determined rates from a single eye of each of 525 patients using linear regression of the summary index mean deviation (MD) over time. The main outcome measures were the proportions of fast (< -1.0 to -2.0 dB/y) and catastrophic (< -2 dB/y) visual field progression. Bootstrapped 95% CIs allowed comparison with published data from a large clinical cohort in Canada.
   RESULTS. The combined proportion of fast and catastrophic progressors in our cohort was less than half that in the Canada dataset (2.3% vs. 5.8%), despite median progression rates differing by only 0.03 dB/y. PACG, POAG, and JOAG represented 45%, 32%, and 12% of our cohort, respectively. Baseline MD values were similarly distributed between these subtypes. All subtypes showed a similar shaped distribution for progression rates, with median progression rates of -0.03, -0.05, and 0.02 dB/y for PACG, POAG, and JOAG, respectively. Combined proportions of fast and catastrophic progression rates did not significantly differ between subtypes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Differences in fast and catastrophic visual field progression can exist despite only small changes in median progression rates, highlighting the importance of considering the full shape of the progression rate distribution when comparing the risk of devastating visual field loss.

AB  - Background: The biochemical basis of depression has been related to blood-brain barrier (BBB) allowing/restricting a number of components to enter the brain milieu from the peripheral plasma milieu. S100B has been associated with BBB damage and is used as a marker of its integrity. Several studies have reported that depressive patients have increased levels of S100B in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.
   Materials and Methods: Forty-two confirmed cases of depression, 13-25 years of ages were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences during the period from January 2013 to June 2014 along with 42 healthy controls of comparable age and sex. Psychometric evaluation of the patients and controls was done to assess the severity of depression using Beck's Depression Inventory-II and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Medical assessment and laboratory investigations were done. Serum S100B levels were measured using Sandwich ELISA. The results obtained were statistically analyzed.
   Results: Levels of serum S100B were significantly elevated in patients with major depression as compared to controls. Significantly higher levels of S100B were seen only in females as compared to their healthy counterparts. Serum S100B was higher in depressed participants with the recurrent disorder than those with single episode. No correlation of levels of this marker was seen with clinical severity of the patients. It was found that with increased duration of illness for which the patient was being treated with antidepressants, the patients had higher levels of S100B.
   Conclusions: Serum S100B can be used as a biomarker of depression.

AB  - Introduction: There is a worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity among the adolescent population in India from 16.3% in 2001 to 19.3% in 2010. Recent evidence suggests that bariatric surgery leads to resolution of comorbidities and associated long-term complications in adolescent patients with morbid obesity. Aim: The aim of this study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on the weight loss and comorbidities of morbidly obese adolescents. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of the data of 10 adolescent patients, who underwent Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy at our institute (tertiary care hospital), from July 2009 to July 2016 was carried out. Results: Of the 10 patients, 4 patients had syndromic forms of obesity. The median age was 16.54 years. The median pre-operative weight and height were 112 kg and 154 cm, respectively, with a body mass index of 47.2 kg/m(2). There was no intra-operative or post-operative complication except for suspected methylene blue toxicity in one patient which was treated conservatively. Median follow-up period was 1 year (0u5 years). The patients had an increase in excess weight loss (EWL) of 54.5% until the end of 1 year. There was a regain of weight between the 1(st) and 2(nd) year, followed by a sustained weight loss achieving 44.8% EWL at 3 years and 60% at the end of 5 years (only two patients followed up at 5 years). Similar results were found in syndromic patients. Among the four diabetic patients, three had complete resolution and one had improvement in diabetes status. Among the three patients with obstructive sleep apnoea, two patients had complete resolution, while one patient had improvement in symptoms. One patient with hypocortisolism improved after surgery with a decrease in the steroid requirement. Among the hypothyroid patients, one patient had a complete resolution, one patient had improvement in hypothyroid status while two patients had no change. Conclusion: Bariatric surgery is effective for morbidly obese adolescents, leading to significant resolutions of comorbid illness.

AB  - Background: The Indian HIPEC registry is a self-funded registry instituted by a group of Indian surgeons for patients with peritoneal metastases (PM) undergoing surgical treatment. This work was performed to center dot Evaluate outcomes of cytoreductive surgery +/- HIPEC in patients enrolled in the registry. center dot Identify operational problems. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patients enrolled in the registry from March 2016 to September 2017 was performed. An online survey was performed to study the surgeons' attitudes and existing practices pertaining to the registry and identify operational problems. Results: During the study period, 332 patients were enrolled in 8 participating centres. The common indication was ovarian cancer for three centres and pseudomyxoma peritonei for three others. The median PCI ranged from 3 to 23. A CC-0/1 resection was obtained in 94.7%. There was no significant difference in the morbidity (p = .25) and mortality (p = .19) rates between different centres. There was a high rate of failure-to-rescue (19.3%) patients with complications and the survival in patients with colorectal PM was inferior. A lack of dedicated personnel for data collection and entry was the main reason for only 10/43 surgeons contributing data. The other problem was the lack of complete electronic medical record systems at all centres. Conclusions: These results validate existing practices and identify country-specific problems that need to be addressed. Despite operational problems, the registry is an invaluable tool for audit and research. It shows the feasibility of fruitful collaboration between surgeons in the absence of any regulatory body or funding for the project.

AB  - Purpose: Long standing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) causes cerebral insult and results in elevated brain injury biomarkers, S100b and neuron specific enolase (NSE). Surgery for TLE, has the potential to cause additional cerebral insult. Dexmedetomidine is postulated to have neuroprotective effects. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on S100b and NSE during TLE surgery.
   Materials and Methods: 19 consenting adult patients with TLE undergoing anteromedial temporal lobectomy were enrolled and divided into two groups. Patients in Group D (n = 9) received dexmedetomidine whereas patients in Group C (n = 10) received saline as placebo in addition to the standard anaesthesia technique. Blood samples of these patients were drawn, before induction of anaesthesia, at the end of surgery, as well at 24 hours and 48 hours postoperatively, and analysed for serum S100b and NSE.
   Results: The demographic and clinical profile was comparable in both the groups. The baseline S100b in group C and group D was 66.7 +/- 26.5 pg/ml and 34.3 +/- 21.7 pg/ml (P = 0.013) respectively. After adjustment for the baseline, the overall value of S100b was 71.0 +/- 39.8 pg/ml and 40.5 +/- 22.5 pg/ml (P = 0.002) in the control and study group, respectively. The values of S100b (79.3 +/- 53.6 pg/ml) [P = 0.017] were highest at 24 hours postoperatively. The mean value of NSE in the control and study group was 32.8 +/- 43.4 ng/ml (log 3.0 +/- 0.1) and 13.51 +/- 9.12 ng/ml (log 2.42 +/- 0.60), respectively. The value of NSE in both the groups was comparable at different time points.
   Conclusions: Lower perioperative values of S100b were observed in patients who received intraoperative dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine may play a role in cerebroprotection during epilepsy surgery.

AB  - Background The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is alarming worldwide causing serious infections. Rapid and accurate identification of CRE is crucial to reduce the mortality and morbidity. In this study, we tried to develop an in-house Carba NP test for detection of CRE and evaluate its performance with others. Methods A prospective study was conducted with 40 nonrepeating Enterobacteriaceae isolates over a period of 3 months. All the isolates were screened for carbapenem resistance as per CLSI 2016 guidelines followed by PCR for blaNDM-1, blaOXA-48, blaKPC, blaVIM, and blaIMP genes. All the isolates were subjected to five phenotypic tests, that is, in-house Carba NP (iCarba NP), commercial Carba NP (cCarba NP), Blue-Carba, modified Hodge test (MHT), and CHROMagar. Results Among the 40 isolates, 87.5% were identified as Escherichia coli, 7.5% were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2.5% were Enterobacter cloacae, and 2.5% were Citrobacter freundii. Thirty-three of 40 (82.5%) isolates were found to harbor one or more resistant genes. Considering PCR to be the gold standard test, sensitivity of the phenotypic methods for CRE detection ranged from 63.6% (MHT) to 96.9% (CHROMagar). Both cCarba NP and iCarba NP observed to have highest specificity. The performance of iCarba NP was found comparable with cCarba NP by kappa score 1 and found approximately 10 times less expensive than cCarba NP. Conclusion CHROMagar was observed most sensitive assay for detection of CRE followed by both Carba NP tests. iCarba NP was proved cheaper and equally good as cCarba NP for detection of CRE.

AB  - Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare pediatric brain tumor. A 16-year-old female patient presented to the clinic with complaints of multiple episodes of generalized tonic clonic seizures, nystagmus, and weakness on the left side of the body for 3 weeks. She had similar symptoms, waxing and waning for the last 2 years, responding to corticosteroids. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple areas of signal abnormalities involving the left temporal lobe, the basal ganglion, the thalamus, and the right frontal and occipital lobes with contrast enhancement in bitemporal lesions. With a clinico-radiological diagnosis of demyelinating disorder, she underwent an image-guided right frontal lobe biopsy, which revealed sheets of atypical lymphoid cells diffusely immunopositive for CD20 but negative for CD3, CD10, BCL-6, and MUM-1, suggesting diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, germinal center B-cell subtype. The systemic lymphoma workup was essentially normal. She received 5 cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab, high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), vincristine, and procarbazine and had a complete radiological response (CR). This was followed by whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) to a dose of 36 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks. Subsequently she received 2 cycles of consolidation chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab and high-dose cytarabine. Serial brain MRI done 1, 4, and 8 months after completion of treatment showed persistence of the CR. At the last follow-up visit, 15 months from the date of diagnosis, she was disease free and asymptomatic. This report underlines the fact that PCNSL in adolescents may be effectively treated with a combination of HDMTX-and rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy followed by consolidation with WBRT.

TI  - Case Report: Cardiac Tamponade in Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever: An Unusual Manifestation of a Common Disease
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
KW  - COMPLICATIONS
AB  - Dengue hemorrhagic fever is one of the most commonly encountered mosquito-borne viral infections of humans worldwide with multiple reported outbreaks. Cardiac involvement is a known manifestation of the disease usually presenting as rhythm abnormalities, myocarditis, or pericardial effusion, which may be clinically asymptomatic. We describe a case of a 30-year-old woman who presented to us with high-grade fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, generalized maculopapular rash with bilateral pleural effusion, and hypotension. Dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and IgM antibodies were positive on admission, supporting a diagnosis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Cardiac troponin-I was elevated on admission (65 ng/L) with diffuse convex ST segment elevations on electrocardiogram, suggestive of possible myopericarditis. Echocardiogram on admission revealed minimal pericardial effusion with preserved ejection fraction. Despite administration of fluids and inotrope use, the patient's hypotension progressively deteriorated over the next 6 hours, associated with decreased urine output and worsening sensorium. Clinical examination revealed muffled heart sounds and raised jugular venous pressure. A repeat echocardiogram confirmed an increase in the pericardial effusion manifesting as cardiac tamponade. Ultrasound-guided pigtail catheter insertion led to a prompt removal of the excessive pericardial fluid and correction of hypotension. Early identification of this uncommon but important complication of dengue hemorrhagic fever led to a good outcome in our case.

AB  - Decellularized corneas obtained from other species have gained intense popularity in the field of tissue engineering due to its role to serve as an alternative to the limited availability of high-quality donor tissues. However, the decellularized cornea is found to evoke an immune response inspite of the removal of the cellular contents and antigens due to the distortion of the collagen fibrils that exposes certain antigenic sites, which often lead to graft rejection. Therefore, in this study we tested the hypothesis that cross-linking the decellularized corneas with chondroitin sulfate may help in restoring the distorted conformationation changes of fibrous matrix and thus help in reducing the occurrence of graft rejection. Cross-linking of the decellularized cornea with oxidized chondroitin sulfate was validated by ATR-FTIR analysis. An in vitro immune response study involving healthy monocytes and differentiated macrophages with their surface marker analysis by pHrodo red, Lysotracker red, ER tracker, and CD63, LAMP-2 antibodies confirmed that the cross-linked decellularized matrices elicited the least immune response compared to the decellularized ones. We implanted three sets of corneal scaffolds obtained from goat, i.e., native, decellularized, and decellularized corneas conjugated with chondroitin sulfate into the rabbit stroma. Histology analysis, three months after implantation into the rabbit corneal stromal region, confirmed the restoration of the collagen fibril conformation and the migration of cells to the implanted constructs, affirming proper graft integration. Hence we conclude that the chondroitin sulfate cross-linked decellularized corneal matrix may serve as an efficient alternative to the allograft and human cadaveric corneas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vertebral body hemangiomas with myelopathy are difficult to manage.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of intraoperative ethanol embolization, surgical decompression, and instrumented short-segment fusion in vertebral hemangioma (VH) with myelopathy and long-term outcome (>24 months).
   CLINICAL MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included symptomatic VH with cord compression with myelopathy. Pathologic fractures and deformity or multilevel pathologies were excluded from the study. Surgery consisted of intraoperative bilateral pedicular absolute alcohol (<1% hydrated ethyl alcohol) injection, laminectomy, and cord decompression at the level of pathology followed by a short-segment instrumented fusion using pedicle screws.
   RESULTS: The study included 33 patients (mean 26.9 +/- 13.2, range: 10-68 years, 18 females). The clinical features of the study were myelopathy in all patients (5 paraplegic). sphincter involvement (13). and mid back or lower back pain (7). The preoperative American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) scores were A (7), B (11), C (6). D (8), and E (1). Majority of the patients had single vertebral involvement (30) and three patients had multiple-level involvement. Six patients underwent surgery earlier (one underwent alcohol embolization). The mean surgical time was 124 +/- 39 minutes, and the average blood loss was 274 +/- 80 cc. The mean amount of absolute alcohol injected was 14.6 +/- 5.7 cc (two patients required 20 and 25 cc). Immediate embolization was achieved in all patients, allowing laminectomy and easy removal of soft-tissue hemangioma. Post surgery, one patient had transient deterioration, and the condition of the rest of the patients improved (sphincters improved in nine patients) at a follow-up ranging 28-103 months (mean 47.6 +/- 22.3). Follow-up ASIA scores were E (26), D (4), B (2), and C (1). All patients showed evidence of bone sclerosis and relief of cord compression on follow-up imaging.
   CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study in literature showing excellent improvement, low reoperation rates after ethanol embolization, and short-segment fixation. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: With demographic shifts, there is an unprecedented increase in noncommunicable diseases, multimorbidity, and geriatric syndromes among older adults, especially in economically weaker sectors. However, there is no socioculturally appropriate tool to screen older adults for age-related health needs, multimorbidity, and geriatric syndromes at their doorstep. Objective: Our objective was to create a self-assessment tool, "integrated care tool" (ICT), and to assess its psychometric properties by applying it on older adults from multiple settings such as hospital, community, and old-age home (assisted living services). Methods: A new questionnaire was developed using standardized procedure including item development, pilot testing, and psychometric validation. After obtaining the institutional ethics committee clearance, data were collected from consenting respondents attending the Outpatient Department of Geriatric Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, community settings through health camps, and long-term care center, between May 2016 and February 2017. Data were computerized and analyzed by principal component analysis as extraction method and orthogonal varimax as rotation method. Results: The final 30-item questionnaire was arranged into various domains as per rotated component matrix analysis. Overall internal consistency of the final questionnaire, as calculated by Cronbach's alpha, was 0.79, and the measure of sampling adequacy was 0.79. Conclusion: ICT-BRIEF is a simple, self-assessment/caregiver-assisted tool to screen the health needs of older adults. This tool can be validated for developing risk score and scaled up to generate a large database to create elderly centered care plans.

AB  - Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) after myocardial infarction is highly effective. It is unavailable in public hospitals in India due to limited resources. Our objective was to develop a scalable model of CR for India based on yoga, which could also appeal to some groups with low uptake of CR (e.g., ethnic minorities, women, and older people) globally. The intervention was developed using a structured process. A literature review and consultations with yoga experts, CR experts, and postmyocardial infarction patients were conducted to systematically identify and shortlist appropriate yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, meditation and relaxation practices, and lifestyle changes, which were incorporated into a conventional CR framework. The draft intervention was further refined based on the feedback from an internal stakeholder group and an external panel of international experts, before being piloted with yoga instructors and patients with myocardial infarction. A four-phase yoga-based CR (Yoga-CaRe) programme was developed for delivery by a single yoga instructor with basic training. The programme consists of a total of 13 instructor-led sessions (2 individual and 11 group) over a 3-month period. Group sessions include guided practice of yoga exercises and postures, breathing exercises, and meditation and relaxation practices, and support for the lifestyle change and coping through a moderated discussion. Patients are encouraged to self-practice daily at home and continue long-term with the help of a booklet and digital video disc (DVD). Family members/carers are encouraged to join throughout. In conclusion, a novel yoga-based CR programme has been developed, which promises to provide a scalable CR solution for India and an alternative choice for CR globally. It is currently being evaluated in a large multicentre randomised controlled trial across India.

AB  - Background: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most devastating manifestation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis. About 33% of TBM patients die due to very late diagnosis of the disease. Conventional diagnostic methods based on signs and symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) smear microscopy or liquid culture suffer from either poor sensitivity or long turnaround time (up to 8 weeks). Therefore, in order to manage the disease efficiently, there is an urgent and unmet need for a rapid and reliable diagnostic test.
   Methods: In the current study, to address the diagnostic challenge of TBM, a highly rapid and sensitive structural switching electrochemical aptasensor was developed by combining the electrochemical property of methylene blue (MB) with the molecular recognition ability of a ssDNA aptamer. To demonstrate the clinical diagnostic utility of the developed aptasensor, a blinded study was performed on 81 archived CSF specimens using differential pulse voltammetry.
   Results: The electrochemical aptasensor developed in the current study can detect as low as 10 pg HspX in CSF background and yields a highly discriminatory response (P<0.0001) for TBM and not-TBM categories with similar to 95% sensitivity and similar to 97.5% specificity and has the ability to deliver sample-to-answer in <30 minutes.
   Conclusion: In summary, we demonstrate a new aptamer-based electrochemical biosensing strategy by exploiting the target-induced structural switching of H63 SL-2 M6 aptamer and electroactivity of aptamer-tagged MB for the detection of HspX in CSF samples for the diagnosis of TBM. Further, the clinical utility of this sensor could be extended for the diagnosis of other forms of tuberculosis in the near future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Choroid plexus tumors (CPTs) are rare tumors characterized by papillary and intraventricular growth. The young age of presentation of such tumors, especially in infants, and the lack of consensus on adjuvant therapy in case of atypical choroid plexus papilloma (aCPP) and choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) create dilemma for the management of such tumors. We discuss the presentation, management, complications, and outcome in 15 patients (children 4 years of age and younger) and review pertinent literature.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the case records of all patients with CPTs who were operated in our institute from January 2010 to March 2018. We found 15 patients in the age group of 0-4 years of age. The variables analyzed include age, sex, presentation, location, surgical approach, extent of resection, intraoperative blood loss, percentage of blood loss, blood transfused, histopathology, postoperative complications, and outcome. Images were obtained from picture archiving and communication system, and patient details and follow-up were obtained from discharge summary, operative notes, and hospital records.
   RESULTS: Ten patients had choroid plexus papilloma (CPP), 2 patients had aCPP, and 3 patients had CPC. The mean age was 15.2 months, whereas the median age was 8 months (range, 40 dayse4 years). The mean blood loss was 329 mL, whereas the median blood loss was 175 mL. There were a total of 5 deaths, including 3 patients with CPC and 1 each with aCPP and CPP.
   CONCLUSIONS: CPTs are challenging tumors in infants and very young children because of the potential for massive blood loss. CPP is associated with lesser blood loss and favorable outcome compared with aCPP and CPC. Massive blood loss in CPC and aCPP can be life threatening as has been shown in our series. CPC has a rapid proliferation potential as shown in one of our cases. Attempts at decreasing vascularization of such tumors should be made by various methods, including preoperative embolization and neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, a consensus on this is lacking.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the death of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. To develop therapeutic strategies to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process, it is imperative that we understand the pathogenesis of PD. With the current state of knowledge, multiple pathological pathways such as oxidative stress, inflammation due to microglial activation, apoptotic pathway activation via Abelson (c-Abl)tyrosine kinase enzyme, and DA toxins have been incriminated in causing DA neuronal death in PD. In the recent times, there is growing evidence of the role of c-Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase in the pathogenesis of PD. We give a short account of the potential of c-Abl inhibitors, the currently used anticancer drugs such as nilotinib in preventing the neurodegenerative process in PD.

AB  - We aimed to study the proportion of patients with movement disorders in seropositive autoimmune encephalitis of non-neoplastic aetiology and also to describe the spectrum of movement disorders in them.
   We prospectively screened 362 patients of age >12 years with encephalitis of unknown aetiology for a panel of antibodies for autoimmune encephalitis. Demographic and clinical characteristics with focus on the movement disorders were recorded. We also evaluated the differences in the spectrum of movement disorder based on various age groups and antibody positivity. Patients were treated with immune modulating drugs and were followed up for 6 months.
   Out of the 41 patients, 21 (51.2%) patients presented with movement disorder as a part of their clinical presentation. The commonest movement disorder encountered in our cohort was orofaciolingual dyskinesia (OFLD) 57.1% followed by tremor (38.1%), choreoathetosis (33.3%), paroxysmal dyskinesia (23.8%) stereotypies (14.3%), bradykinesia (13.1%), followed by dystonia (13.1%), catatonia (4.7%), neuromyotonia (4.7%) ballism (4.7%), ataxia (4.7%) and stiff person phenotype (4.7%). The hyperkinetic movement disorders were more commonly seen compared to hypokinetic disorders. All patients received immunomodulatory therapy. On follow, 17 (80.1%) patients had good response with total remission of the movement disorder. Four patients did not have total remission but significant improvement in the symptoms after 6 months of follow up.
   Our study shows that >50% of patients with antibody positive autoimmune encephalitis have movement disorder as a part of their clinical feature. Timely institution of immunotherapy leads to good outcome in majority of patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Here, a novel, simple, cost-effective, environment-friendly, non-invasive and mediator free, reduced graphene oxide (RGO) modified paper-based biosensing platform was reported. A conductive platform was generated over the ivory paper sheet via in-situ reduction of graphene oxide. The conductivity of the RGO paper was found as 0.86 S cm(-1). This substrate was used for deposition of cysteine capped gold nanoparticles (Cys-AuNPs) using electrophoretic deposition technique at 60 V for biosensing application. Scanning electron microscopic images show the deposition of Cys-AuNPs in the spherical bunch on the RGO paper. The Cys-AuNPs deposition on RGO paper was confirmed by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and used for immobilization of monoclonal antibodies. This paper-based immunosensor based on chronoamperometry technique has the ability of direct electron transfer without using any mediator. This platform can replace commercially available electrodes [Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)] coated glass substrate, glassy carbon and gold] for electronic and electrochemical applications including point-of-care (POC) devices.

Possible idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis 16 (36.4%), post infectious complications 11 (25%), immune mediated disorders 8 (18.2%), cardiac and vascular disorders 7 (15.9%), and airway pathologies 2 (4.5%) were the etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage. Treatment options like medications, bronchial artery embolization and surgical resections were offered according to the etiology. Children with idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and those with immune mediated diseases were treated with systemic steroids and steroid sparing agents; the latter group took longer time to respond and had more relapses.Conclusions Identification of main etiological categories of pulmonary hemorrhage in children could be useful to plan investigations and management of wide range of causes in more practical way.

AB  - Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common salivary gland tumor. Pseudopodia are finger-like projections extending beyond the tumor capsule, seen in pleomorphic adenoma. If not resected completely, these pseudopodia may increase the risk of recurrence after excision of pleomorphic adenoma. While performing a total conservative parotidectomy for the pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland, we encountered tumor in the Stensen's duct. On pathological examination, the tumor was not involving the wall of the duct but was passing through the lumen, like a pseudopod. During parotidectomy, the surgeon should inspect the lumen of parotid duct for the presence of any tumor. Pseudopodia of pleomorphic adenoma may extend into the lumen and if not addressed adequately may lead to recurrence of the tumor.

AB  - Background. One-third of individuals report limitations in activities of daily living even 6 months after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Moderate-quality evidence exists for several sociodemographic and clinical predictors of patient-reported outcome measures of perceived functionality. Objectively measured performance-based measures (PBMs) provide a less subjective approach to informing patient treatment after TKA; however, information about predictors of functionally relevant PBMs is scarce.
   Purpose. This systematic review synthesized the available research on preoperative predictors of PBMs after primary TKA for osteoarthritis.
   Data Sources. In June 2016 and January 2017, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched.
   Study Selection. Cohort studies exploring preoperative predictors of stair climbing, walking speed, and gait speed measured >= 6 months after primary TKA were included. Screening of abstracts and selection of full texts were undertaken by 2 independent reviewers.
   Data Extraction. Information on study design, patient characteristics, analysis, and results was extracted using pilot-tested forms. Two independent reviewers assessed risk of bias using modified Quality in Prognostic Studies criteria.
   Data Synthesis. Of the eligible 12 studies involving 6 prospective cohorts, 10 studies reported information on baseline predictors. Meta-analysis of predictors was not possible because of missing information on effect size or standard errors. Narrative synthesis of evidence of predictors was therefore performed.
   Limitations. The quality of evidence was low because of the risk of bias and heterogeneity of included studies as well as nonreporting of measures of effect.
   Conclusions. Low-quality evidence exists for an association of preoperative functional ability and quadriceps muscle strength with functionality at 6 months after TKA. Improved reporting of predictor analyses is needed to enable evidence generation for clinical management.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer in world and third largest cause of cancer-related deaths. The last few decades have witnessed the emergence of non-viral causes of HCC, the most important being non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis in the absence of excessive alcohol intake to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without cirrhosis. About 3-15 per cent of the obese patients with NASH progress to cirrhosis and about 4-27 per cent of NASH with cirrhosis patients transform to HCC. It is also known that HCC can develop de now' in patients with NASH without the presence of cirrhosis. Yearly cumulative incidence of NASH-related HCC is low (2.6%) compared to four per cent of viral-HCC. NAFLD has been associated with risk factors such as metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, altered gut flora and persistent inflammation. Due to alarming rise in metabolic diseases, both in the developing as well as the developed world, it is expected that the incidence of NAFLD/NASH-HCC would rise manifold in future. No definite guidelines have been drawn for surveillance and management of NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC. It is thus important to discuss the entity of HCC in NAFLD at length with special focus on its epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, diagnosis, clinical presentation and prevention.

TI  - Analysis of the Phenotypes in the Rett Networked Database
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENOMICS
AB  - Rett spectrum disorder is a progressive neurological disease and the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability in females. MECP2 is the major causative gene. In addition, CDKL5 and FOXG1 mutations have been reported in Rett patients, especially with the atypical presentation. Each gene and different mutations within each gene contribute to variability in clinical presentation, and several groups worldwide performed genotype-phenotype correlation studies using cohorts of patients with classic and atypical forms of Rett spectrum disorder. The Rett Networked Database is a unified registry of clinical and molecular data of Rett patients, and it is currently one of the largest Rett registries worldwide with several hundred records provided by Rett expert clinicians from 13 countries. Collected data revealed that the majority of MECP2-mutated patients present with the classic form, the majority of CDKL5-mutated patients with the early-onset seizure variant, and the majority of FOXG1-mutated patients with the congenital form. A computation of severity scores further revealed significant differences between groups of patients and correlation with mutation types. The highly detailed phenotypic information contained in the Rett Networked Database allows the grouping of patients presenting specific clinical and genetic characteristics for studies by the Rett community and beyond. These data will also serve for the development of clinical trials involving homogeneous groups of patients.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study is to commission and validate the portal dosimetry (PD) system using an indirect method for flattening filter free (FFF) photon beam of the upgraded c-series linear accelerator.
   Background: Varian Medical System clinacs with amorphous-silicon portal imager panel (aSi-1000) do not have PD for FFF beams. Recently, our c-series linear accelerator was upgraded to deliver 6MV FFF (6MVFFF) photon beam with the highest dose rate of 1400 monitor unit (MU)/min. The study, therefore, focuses on the commissioning and validation of PD for the 6MVFFF beam.
   Materials and Methods: An indirect method was implemented to predict the portal dose for FFF beam in Eclipse as the treatment planning system does not have direct prediction algorithm for FFF beam (version. 11). Dosimetrical characteristics of aSi-electronic portal imaging device (EPID) were evaluated for 6MVFFF beam and validation of PD for 6MVFFF beam was performed for open fields along with pretreatment quality assurance of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) techniques for 30 patients planned with 6MVFFF beam.
   Results: ASi-EPID saturates between 100 and 130 cm source to detector distance (SDD) for 6MVFFF beam and resolved at more than 140 cm SDD. The squared correlation coefficient (R-2) for MU linearity was found to be 1 (R-2 = 1), and instantaneous dose response linearity at different SDD's was found to be 0.999 (R-2 = 0.999) for the 6MVFFF beam. Maximum gamma area index (GAI) for 3% dose difference and 3 mm distance-to-agreement criteria for IMRT, VMAT, and SRS/stereotactic radiotherapy plans was 97.9% +/- 0.3%, 96.3% +/- 0.5%, and 98.2% +/- 0.2%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The results reveal that this novel method can be used to commission portal dosimetry for 6MVFFF beam as it is a convenient, faster, and accurate method.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Differentiating between neurocysticercosis (NCC) and neurotuberculosis has serious therapeutic implications and this distinction relies heavily on neuroimaging. Few case reports discuss the conglomeration of ring-enhancing lesions (RELs) in patients with solitary NCC. The aim of our study is to describe the imaging findings of conglomerate RELs in a cohort of patients with solitary NCC, emphasizing the frequency of conglomeration. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 100 patients with solitary NCC. Two neuroradiologists analyzed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images regarding morphology, enhancement pattern, location, number of lesions, and degree of perilesional edema. The solitary lesions were classified as solitary discrete RELs (SD-RELs) when a well-defined lesion was seen and solitary conglomerate RELs (SC-RELs) when two or more ring lesions or ring/rings plus disc lesions were present contiguously. Follow-up CT scans were evaluated for the resolution of lesions and surrounding edema. Results: Out of 100 patients, 42 were SD-RELs and 58 were SC-RELs. No statistically significant difference was found between both groups in terms of age of presentation, clinical presentation, lesion size and location, and degree of perilesional edema. Larger lesions (>10 mm) were more likely to show scolex and were associated with greater degree of edema in both subgroups. During follow-up, 13 patients had new lesions (SD-RELs-5, SC-RELs-8). In SD-RELs, follow-up lesions were in the same location in four patients and new location in one; and in SC-RELs, lesions were in the same location in seven and in new location in one case. Conclusion: Conglomeration of RELs is a common finding in patients with solitary NCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spinal deformities are very challenging to treat and have a great risk of neurologic complications because of hardware placement during corrective surgery. Various techniques have been introduced to ensure safe and accurate placement of pedicle screws. Patient-specific screw guides with predrawn and prevalidated trajectory seem to be an attractive option.
   PURPOSE: We have focused on developing three-dimensional (3D) printing technique for complex spinal deformities in India. This study also aimed to compare the placement of pedicle screw with 3D printing and freehand technique.
   STUDY DESIGN/SETTINGS: This is a retrospective comparative clinical study in an academic institutional setting.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 20 patients were enrolled during the study: 10 were operated on with the help of 3D printing (Group 1) and 10 were operated on with freehand technique (Group 2). Group 1 included six patients with congenital scoliosis, three patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), and one patient with post-tubercular kyphosis, and Group 2 included five patients with congenital scoliosis. four patients with AIS, and one patient with post-tubercular kyphosis.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were measured in terms of screw violation, and secondary outcomes were measured in terms of surgical time, blood loss, radiation exposure (number of shoots required), and complications.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: MIMICS Base v18.0 software was used for 3D reconstruction from computed tomography scan images of all the patients. 3-Matic software was used to create a drill guide. A 3D printer from Stratasys Mojo with ABS P430 model material cartilage (a thermoplastic material) was used for the printing of the vertebra model and jigs. A two-sample test of proportion was used to compare correctly and wrongly placed pedicle screws with 3D printing and freehand technique. t Test with equal variance was used for operating surgical time and blood loss.
   RESULTS: No superior or inferior screw violation was observed in any of our patients in either group. We found a significant difference (p=.03) between the two groups regarding perfect screw placement in favor of 3D printing. There were 13 Grade 2 medial perforations in the freehand group and 3 in the 31) printing group. There was no Grade 3 medial perforation in either group. Six Grade 2 lateral perforations in the freehand group and seven in the 3D printing group were observed. Three Grade 3 lateral perforations in the freehand group and two in 3D printing group were observed. Analysis showed a statistically significant (p=.005) medial violation in the freehand group. Surgical time was significantly less (p=.03) in the 3D printing group compared with the freehand group. Mean blood loss was higher in the freehand group but was not statistically significant (p=.3) in the 3D printing group. Fluoroscopic shots required were less in number in the 3D printing group compared with the freehand group. There was no neurologic deficit in any of the patients in the two groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our study, focusing on spinal deformities with statistically significant higher rates of accurate screw positioning and higher numbers of inserted screws with 3D printing was possible because of enhanced safety, particularly at apical levels. As such, spinal deformities are difficult to treat worldwide. In India. these deformities are often neglected and present at a very late and a much more deformed state when their treatment becomes even more challenging. Developing these patient-specific drill templates will enable an average spine surgeon to treat these patients with much ease and safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F18-FDG PET/CT) can be used to assess changes in the metabolism of an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) graft as it is undergoing "ligamentization." Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is the preferred modality for noninvasive assessment of graft structure and graft vascularity. Purpose: To compare the use of F18-FDG PET/CT and DCE-MRI to assess ligamentization within the ACL graft and correlate the results with clinical tests. Study Design: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Methods: Among 30 recruited patients, 27 patients (3 females and 24 males) completed 2 follow-up assessments at a mean of 125 +/- 22 days and 259 +/- 38 days after arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. At both assessments, anterior drawer test, Lachman test, and Lysholm scoring (LS) were conducted. Images from F18-FDG PET/CT and MRI were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively (maximum standardized uptake value [SUVmax], SUVmax ratio to the contralateral side [SUVmax CL], normalized enhancement [NE]) in 3 zones: femoral, intra-articular (IA), and tibial. Of the 27 recruited patients, 1 patient had reinjury due to a fall. Therefore, 26 patients were considered for the final analysis. Results: A significant improvement (P = .0001) was found in median LS, from 78.5 (range, 62-90) to 94.5 (range, 84-100), at the second follow-up. All grafts were found to be viable on PET/CT and vascularized on MRI. All grafts were seen as continuous on MRI, with exception of 1 graft at the second follow-up. Dynamic MRI identified single-vessel supply to all of the grafts at the first follow-up and multiple-vessel supply in 10 patients at the second follow-up. Reduction in the median SUVmax, SUVmax CL, and NE at second follow-up was seen in all 3 zones. Only SUVmax CL in the IA zone showed a significant reduction (P = .032); patients with excellent LS at the second follow-up showed significantly higher reduction (P = .005) than patients with good LS. NE in the IA zone was correlated (0.39; P = .048) with LS only at the first follow-up, whereas SUVmax CL (-0.52; P = .006) and SUVmax (-0.49, P = .010) in the IA zone negatively correlated with LS at the second follow-up only. No correlation was observed between PET/CT and MRI parameters. Conclusion: Glucose metabolism and vascularity in the graft tissue can be used to assess ligamentization of ACL graft. A viable and vascularized graft at first follow-up is associated with good to excellent final outcome, regardless of LS at this stage. Since no correlation was observed between PET/CT and MRI parameters, they may be assessing different domains of the same process. Higher NE in the IA zone at the first follow-up and lower SUVmax CL in the same region at second follow-up are associated with better outcome.

AB  - Historical specimens collected from hospitalized children were tested for the following 13 viruses: influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses 1u3; human metapneumovirus; rhinovirus; coronaviruses 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1 and Adenovirus using monoplex real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). They were retested using TaqMan Array Card (TAC), a micro-fluidic system, capable of simultaneous multi-pathogen testing, to evaluate its sensitivity and specificity against monoplex rRT-PCR. TAC showed high sensitivity (71%u100%) and specificity (98%u100%) for these viruses in comparison to monoplex rRT-PCR. Multi-specimen detection with high sensitivity and specificity makes TAC a potentially useful tool for both surveillance and outbreak investigations.

AB  - Duane retraction (or co-contraction) syndrome is a congenital restrictive strabismus which can occur either as an isolated entity or in conjunction with other congenital anomalies and is now listed as a congenital cranial dysinnervation disorder. It is characterized by co-contraction of horizontal recti on attempted adduction causing globe retraction along with variable amounts of upshoots or downshoots. It may have limited abduction or adduction or both and present as esotropic, exotropic, or orthotropic Duane. The diagnosis of this disease is usually clinical. However, recent research has provided a greater insight into the genetic basis of this disease paving a way for a greater role of genetics in the diagnosis and management. This disease can have a varied presentation and hence the treatment plan should be tailor-made for every patient. The indications for surgery are abnormal head posture, deviations in the primary position, retraction and narrowing of palpebral aperture and up-or downshoots during adduction, and sometimes also to improve abduction. The arrival of newer surgical techniques of periosteal fixation (PF) of lateral rectus (LR), partial vertical rectus transposition, or superior or inferior rectus transposition in addition to LR recession with Y-split has vastly improved the management outcomes, providing not only primary position orthophoria but also increased binocular visual fields as well.

AB  - Background: Despite significant pain relief following total hip arthroplasty (THA) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, a small subset of patients presenting with extra-articular extension contracture of hips remains unsatisfied.
   Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the patients with ankylosing spondylitis who underwent simultaneous bilateral THA and had extensor tightness of both hips preoperatively. They were managed with modified Z-plasty of iliotibial band. Patients with windswept deformity, commonly seen in bilateral hip arthritis caused by ankylosing spondylitis, were excluded.
   Results: Between July 2011 and June 2015, out of 148 patients with bilateral hip involvement, 10 patients (20 hips) had extension contracture of both hips that was addressed during surgery. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 2 years. They could sit comfortably on a chair of height 18 inches with hips and knees flexed to at least 90 degrees. The mean postoperative sum range of motionwas 144.6 degrees with an average hip flexion of 95 degrees (range, 90 degrees - 105 degrees). None of them had recurrence of extension contracture. There was significant improvement in range of motion and hence ambulation and function. No radiolucent lines exceeding 2 mm were seen in any of the zones around either of the components as evaluated in latest Xrays.
   Conclusion: Extension contracture of hip although rare is a noticeable problem and needs to be addressed during THA. Modified Z-plasty technique of iliotibial band is a reliable method in managing these patients. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Recovery of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) depends on several physical and psychological factors, besides pharmacological treatment. Co-morbid depression adversely affects the outcome in RA. Usual medical therapies have a limited scope and fail to cure the psychological component of the disease. With advanced therapeutic options, achieving a state of remission has become the treatment goal, yoga based mind body intervention (MBI) may provide a holistic approach in its treatment dimension. Hence, MBIs are the need of hour as majority of diseases have a psychosomatic component.
   Objective: To explore the effect of Yoga based MBI on disease specific inflammatory markers and depression severity in active RA patients on routine disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) therapy.
   Methods: A total of 72 RA patients were randomized into 2 groups: yoga group (yoga with DMARDs) and control group (DMARDs only). Blood samples were collected pre and post intervention for primary outcome measurements of systemic biomarkers. Disease activity score 28, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28ESR) and health assessment questionnaire disability index (HAQ-DI) were used to assess disease activity and functional status respectively at pre and post intervention time-points. Secondary outcome, depression severity, was assessed by Beck Depression Inventory II scale (BDI-II) at 2 weekly intervals during 8 weeks of the study interventional plan.
   Results: After 8 weeks of yoga based MBI, there was significant decrease in the severity of RA as seen by reduction in levels of various systemic inflammatory markers as well as in DAS28ESR (p-value <0.0001; effect size = 0.210) and HAQDI (p-value 0.001; effect size = 0.159). Also, yoga group experienced a statistically significant time dependent step-wise decline in depression symptoms over the period of 8 weeks as compared to control group (p-value <0.0001; effect size = 0.5). Regression analysis showed greater reduction in the scores of BDI-II with DAS28ESR (R-2 = 0.426; p < 0.0001) and HAQ-DI (R-2 = 0.236; p = 0.003) in yoga group.
   Conclusions: Yoga, a mind body intervention re-established immunological tolerance by aiding remission at molecular and cellular level along with significant reduction in depression. Thus in this severe autoimmune inflammatory arthritis with a major psychosomatic component, yoga can be used as a complementary/adjunct therapy.

AB  - Objectives: With much hype about artificial intelligence (AI) rendering radiologists redundant, a simple radiologist-augmented AI workflow is evaluated; the premise is that inclusion of a radiologist's opinion into an AI algorithm would make the algorithm achieve better accuracy than an algorithm trained on imaging parameters alone. Open-source BI-RADS data sets were evaluated to see whether inclusion of a radiologist's opinion (in the form of BI-RADS classification) in addition to image parameters improved the accuracy of prediction of histology using three machine learning algorithms vis-a-vis algorithms using image parameters alone.
   Materials and Methods: BI-RADS data sets were obtained from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository (data set 1) and the Digital Database for Screening Mammography repository (data set 2); three machine learning algorithms were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. Two sets of models were trained: M1, using lesion shape, margin, density, and patient age for data set 1 and image texture parameters for data set 2, and M2, using the previous image parameters and the BI-RADS classification provided by radiologists. The area under the curve and the Gini coefficient for M1 and M2 were compared for the validation data set.
   Results: The models using the radiologist-provided BI-RADS classification performed significantly better than the models not using them (P < .0001).
   Conclusion: AI and radiologist working together can achieve better results, helping in case-based decision making. Further evaluation of the metrics involved in predictor handling by AI algorithms will provide newer insights into imaging.

AB  - This research presents an independent stand-alone graphical computational tool which functions as a neurological disease prediction framework for diagnosis of neurological disorders to assist neurologists or researchers in the field to perform automatic segmentation of gray and white matter regions in brain MRI images. The tool was built in collaboration with neurologists and neurosurgeons and many of the features are based on their feedback. This tool provides the user automatized functionality to perform automatic segmentation and extract the gray and white matter regions of patient brain image data using an algorithm called adapted fuzzy c-means (FCM) membership-based clustering with preprocessing using the elliptical Hough transform and postprocessing using connected region analysis. Dice coefficients for several patient brain MRI images were calculated to measure the similarity between the manual tracings by experts and automatic segmentations obtained in this research. The average Dice coefficients are 0.86 for gray matter, 0.88 for white matter, and 0.87 for total cortical matter. Dice coefficients of the proposed algorithm were also the highest when compared with previously published standard state-of-the-art brain MRI segmentation algorithms in terms of accuracy in segmenting the gray matter, white matter, and total cortical matter.

AB  - Background: Transverse sections of scalp biopsies are performed for the assessment of alopecias and are considered advantageous over vertical sections. Aim: The aim was to study the histopathological features of alopecias on transverse sections of scalp biopsies. Methods: It was a descriptive study. Clinically confirmed cases of noncicatricial and cicatricial alopecias were subjected to 4 mm scalp biopsies, which were sectioned transversely and analyzed. Biopsies obtained from occipital region of androgenetic alopecia (AGA) cases were taken as controls. Results: Biopsies from 41 cases were assessed, including male and female AGA, alopecia areata (AA), trichotillomania, lichen planopilaris (LPP), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), and folliculitis decalvans (FD). Normal scalp (control) biopsies showed the median total number of hair follicles of 35 (32-37), anagen: telogen/catagen ratio of 17.5 (16.5-31), and terminal:vellus ratio of 15 (10.7-17.5). In AGA and AA, miniaturization and shift toward telogen and catagen hair were consistently observed. Peribulbar inflammation was seen in two-third of AA. Trichotillomania showed increased catagen hair and numerous pigment casts. In DLE, besides perifollicular inflammation, prominent peri-arrector pili and peri-eccrine inflammation were observed. Type of inflammatory infiltrate was similar in DLE and LPP (lymphocytic), whereas FD showed neutrophilic and plasma cell infiltrate, both around follicles and interstitially. Basal cell damage in the follicles and pigment incontinence were seen in majority of DLE and LPP patients. DLE also showed basement membrane thickening, mucin deposition, and telangiectasia. Reduction/absence of sebaceous glands and perifollicular fibrosis were observed in almost all cicatricial alopecias. Conclusion: Transverse sectioning may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of alopecias.

AB  - Introduction: Tubercular meningitis (TBM) is a common cause of chronic meningitis in India; however, there is a paucity of literature on optimum duration and choice of drug therapy. Materials and Methods: This was an ambispective cohort study. Results: Two hundred and forty-four patients of central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS TB) who were seronegative for HIV were studied of whom 198 had TBM and 46 patients had tuberculoma without meningitis. Before completion of treatment, 84% of TBM patients underwent imaging. There was no difference in disability or mortality in patients, who were treated with various drug regimens in terms of duration of therapy or number of drugs at initiation of treatment. However when patients developed new complications, adding more drugs improved survival. Prolonging corticosteroid administration in patients with nonsatisfactory improvement at 8 weeks was not associated with prevention of disability. Conclusions: CNS TB is treated by neurologists and physicians in India, as per their experience due to different recommendations in various guidelines. There is a tendency to decide when to stop treatment based on neuroimaging given the fear of poor outcomes associated with recurrence of the disease. The duration of treatment or choice of drugs at the start of treatment did not affect disability.

AB  - Background
   Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease worldwide, with pulmonary tuberculosis being the most common form. Standard first-line treatment for drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis for six months comprises isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (HRZE) for two months, followed by HRE (in areas of high TB drug resistance) or HR, given over a four-month continuation phase. Many people do not complete this full course. Shortened treatment regimens that are equally effective and safe could improve treatment success.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of shortened treatment regimens versus the standard six-month treatment regimen for individuals with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis.
   Search methods
   We searched the following databases up to 10 July 2019: the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (PubMed); Embase; the Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS); Science Citation Index-Expanded; Indian Medlars Center; and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials. We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Clinical Trials Unit of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, the UK Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit, and the Clinical Trials Registry India for ongoing trials. We checked the reference lists of identified articles to find additional relevant studies.
   Selection criteria
   We searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared shorter-duration regimens (less than six months) versus the standard six-month regimen for people of all ages, irrespective of HIV status, who were newly diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis by positive sputum culture or GeneXpert, and with presumed or proven drug-sensitive tuberculosis. The primary outcome of interest was relapse within two years of completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT).
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for the included trials. For dichotomous outcomes, we used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When appropriate, we pooled data from the included trials in meta-analyses. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.
   Main results
   We included five randomized trials that compared fluoroquinolone-containing four-month ATT regimens versus standard six-month ATT regimens and recruited 5825 adults with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis from 14 countries with high tuberculosis transmission in Asia, Africa, and Latin Ameria. Three were multi-country trials that included a total of 572 HIV-positive people. These trials excluded children, pregnant or lactating women, people with serious comorbid conditions, and those with diabetes mellitus. Four trials had multiple treatment arms.
   Moxifloxacin replaced ethambutol in standard four-month, daily or thrice-weekly ATT regimens in two trials; moxifloxacin replaced isoniazid in four-month ATT regimens in two trials, was given daily in one trial, and was given with rifapentine instead of rifampicin daily for two months and twice weekly for two months in one trial. Moxifloxacin was added to standard ATT drugs for three to four months in one ongoing trial that reported interim results. Gatifloxacin replaced ethambutol in standard ATT regimens given daily or thrice weekly for four months in two trials. Follow-up ranged from 12 months to 24 months after treatment completion for the majority of participants.
   Moxifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens
   Moxifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens that replaced ethambutol or isoniazid probably increased the proportions who experienced relapse after successful treatment compared to standard ATT regimens (RR 3.56, 95% CI 2.37 to 5.37; 2265 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). For death from any cause, there was probably little or no difference between the two regimens (2760 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment failure was rare, and there was probably little or no difference in proportions with treatment failure between ATT regimens (2282 participants, 3 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). None of the participants given moxifloxacin-containing regimens developed resistance to rifampicin, and these regimens may not increase the risk of acquired resistance (2282 participants, 3 trials; low-certainty evidence). Severe adverse events were probably little or no different with moxifloxacin-containing four-month regimens that replaced ethambutol or isoniazid, and with three- to four-month regimens that augmented standard ATT with moxifloxacin, when compared to standard six-month ATT regimens (3548 participants, 4 trials; moderate-certainty evidence).
   Gatifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens
   Gatifloxacin-containing four-month ATT regimens that replaced ethambutol probably increased relapse compared to standard six-month ATT regimens in adults with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.84; 1633 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). The four-month regimen probably made little or no difference in death compared to the six-month regimen (1886 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Treatment failure was uncommon and was probably little or no different between the four-month and six-month regimens (1657 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence). Acquired resistance to isoniazid or rifampicin was not detected in those given the gatifloxacin-containing shortened ATT regimen, but we are uncertain whether acquired drug resistance is any different in the four- and six-month regimens (429 participants, 1 trial; very low-certainty evidence). Serious adverse events were probably no different with either regimen (1993 participants, 2 trials; moderate-certainty evidence).
   Authors' conclusions
   Evidence to date does not support the use of shortened ATT regimens in adults with newly diagnosed drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Four-month ATT regimens that replace ethambutol with moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin, or isoniazid with moxifloxacin, increase relapse substantially compared to standard six-month ATT regimens, although treatment success and serious adverse events are little or no different. The results of six large ongoing trials will help inform decisions on whether shortened ATT regimens can replace standard six-month ATT regimens.

AB  - ObjectiveTo document clinical features and outcome of children with sarcoidosis.MethodsCase records of 18 children (mean (SD) age 9 (2.2) years) diagnosed with sarcoidosis between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed. All children were followed up every 2-3 months and monitored for clinical and laboratory parameters. Their treatment and outcome were recorded.ResultsClinical features at the time of diagnosis were fever (83%), uveitis (50%), difficulty in breathing (44%), hepatosplenomegaly, weight loss, arthritis and peripheral adenopathy. Imaging findings included: hilar adenopathy (94%), abdominal nodes (50%) and pulmonary infiltrates (44%). All children were treated with steroids (range 6-12 months) and weekly low dose oral methotrexate. All patients showed significant improvement over a mean (SD) duration of follow-up of 3.1 (0.9) years, as assessed by resolution of clinical symptoms, and improvement in spirometry parameters, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels.ConclusionsChildren with sarcoidosis seem to respond well to systemic steroids and low dose methotrexate. Delayed diagnosis and ocular involvement are probably associated with poor outcome.

AB  - Objectives: Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia are clinical scenarios that occur due to dopaminergic deficit and hyperactivity in the midbrain, respectively. Current pharmacological interventions for these two diseases therefore aim to restore normal dopamine levels in the midbrain. But during therapy, there is a overshooting of dopamine concentrations that result in hallucinations in Parkinson's disease patients and extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenic patients. This causes a lot of inconvenience to the patents and the clinicians. There are no tests currently available to monitor drug efficacy in these two neuropsychiatric diseases.
   Materials and methods: Parkinson's disease and schizophrenic naive patients were recruited. Serum proteins isolated from these two clinical phenotypes were labeled with fluorescent cyanine dyes and analyzed by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis proteomic experiment. Differentially expressed spots that had consistent expression pattern across five sets of biological replicate gels were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis for protein identification. Validation experiments were done for the identified proteins using antibody-based assay on a patient cohort that included naive, treated, and those who had side effects.
   Results: Serum alpha- and beta-globin chains were identified as differentially expressed proteins having threefold higher expressions in Parkinson's patients as compared to schizophrenia. Interestingly, concentrations of these two proteins had an inverse correlation across clinical phenotypes in the dopaminergic spectrum. RBC contamination as a source for these proteins was ruled out.
   Conclusion: There is a clear association of free serum globin with dopaminergic clinical states. This lays a platform for protein biomarker-based monitoring of pharmacological efficacy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

AB  - Background and objective: Dopamine plays an important role in the disease pathology of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. These two neuropsychiatric disorders represent disease end points of the dopaminergic spectrum where Parkinson's disease represents dopamine deficit and schizophrenia represents dopamine hyperactivity in the mid-brain. Therefore, current treatment strategies aim to restore normal dopamine levels. However, during treatment patients develop adverse effects due to overshooting of physiological levels of dopamine leading to psychosis in Parkinson's disease, and extrapyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia. Absence of any laboratory tests hampers modulation of pharmacotherapy. Apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein have an important role in the neuropathology of these two diseases. The objective of this study was to evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein in patients with these two diseases so that they may serve as biomarkers to monitor therapy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.
   Methods: Drug-naive Parkinson's disease patients and Parkinson's disease patients treated with dopaminergic therapy, neurological controls, schizophrenic patients treated with antidopaminergic therapy, and drug-naive schizophrenic patients were recruited for the study and CSF was collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out to estimate the concentrations of apolipoprotein E and alpha-synuclein. Pathway analysis was done to establish a possible role of these two proteins in various pathways in these two dopamine dictated diseases.
   Results: Apolipoprotein E and a-synuclein CSF concentrations have an inverse correlation along the entire dopaminergic clinical spectrum. Pathway analysis convincingly establishes a plausible hypothesis for their co-regulation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Each protein by itself or as a combination has encouraging sensitivity and specificity values of more than 55%.
   Conclusion: The dynamic variation of these two proteins along the spectrum is ideal for them to be pursued as pharmacotherapeutic biomarkers in CSF to monitor pharmacological efficacy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

AB  - Aim: Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia are clinical end points of dopaminergic deficit and excess, respectively, in the mid-brain. In accordance, current pharmacological interventions aim to restore normal dopamine levels, the overshooting of which culminates in adverse effects which results in psychotic symptoms in Parkinson's disease and extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenia. Currently, there are no laboratory assays to assist treatment decisions or help foresee these drug side-effect outcomes. Therefore, the aim was to discover a protein biomarker that had a varying linear expression across the clinical dopaminergic spectrum.
   Materials and methods: iTRAQ-based proteomic experiments along with mass spectrometric analysis was used for comparative proteomics using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF fluid was collected from 36 patients with Parkinson's disease, 15 patients with urological diseases that served as neurological controls, and seven schizophrenic patients with hallucinations. Validation included ELISA and pathway analysis to highlight the varying expression and provide plausible molecular pathways for differentially expressed proteins in the three clinical phenotypes.
   Results: Protein profiles were delineated in CSF from Parkinson's disease patients, neurological control and schizophrenia, respectively. Ten of the proteins that were identified had a linear relationship across the dopaminergic spectrum. alpha-2-Macroglobulin showed to be having high statistical significance on inter-group comparison on validation studies using ELISA.
   Conclusions: Non-gel-based proteomic experiments are an ideal platform to discover potential biomarkers that can be used to monitor pharmaco-therapeutic efficacy in dopamine-dictated clinical scenarios. alpha-2 Macroglobulin is a potential biomarker to monitor pharmacological therapy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.

AB  - PurposeThere is a theoretical risk of injury to neurovascular structures during inside-out meniscal repair without a safety incision, although there are limited studies assessing this risk. This simulation study on archival MRI films was performed to assess the risk for the popliteal neurovascular bundle and the peroneal nerve during passage of needles for inside-out meniscus repair without a safety incision, thereby defining a safe zone of the menisci that can be safely repaired using this technique.MethodsArchival MRI scans (n=50) were retrieved and axial sections through the menisci were used for simulation. The needle passage was simulated for different points on the posterior horn and body of lateral and medial menisci at half-hour intervals using clock method (15 degrees intervals) with three different portals and two different needle cannulas, resulting in six different scenarios of needle passage for each point on the meniscus. The distance of the needle in each scenario was measured from popliteal vessels (n=50) and peroneal nerve (n=10). The value mean-3SD was calculated for positive means and Mean+3SD was calculated if the mean was negative. An additional 2mm was defined as safe distance. Thus, simulation models in which the mean-3SD was less than 2mm (or mean+3SD was greater than -2mm for negative means) were labelled as unsafe.ResultsNeedle passage through medial meniscus at and medial to 1 o'clock position for a right knee (or 11 o'clock position for a left knee) was safe, irrespective of the portal and needle type. For the lateral meniscus, only the equatorial region was found to be safe with this method.ConclusionsThe popliteal neurovascular bundle is safe during the inside-out medial meniscal repair without a safety incision. For the terminal-most part of the posterior horn, the AM portal and the straight cannula should be avoided. However, this method without safety incision cannot be recommended for lateral meniscus because of the risk to the popliteal vessels and the peroneal nerve. Instead, the inside-out method with a safety incision, or an all-inside method should be used for lateral meniscus.Level of evidenceIII.

AB  - Opium has been used in India since ancient times for social, recreational, religious and medicinal purposes. Opium users seem to constitute a distinct sub-population among opioid users, who have minimal complications, better functioning and socio-cultural acceptance. Prominent levels of stigma have been reported against people who use opioid drugs, but the same cannot be extrapolated to opium users. There is a vast number of opium users in India, and it is prudent to understand the stigma faced by them to better address their problems. Hence, in the current study we aimed to assess the internalized stigma and its correlates among opium users who seek treatment at a tertiary care drug treatment centre in North India. 117 adult male participants having opioid dependence (opium being the most common opioid in last 3 months) were assessed using Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) scale - Hindi version. The stigma scores were in the mild to moderate range, which was less than that found in previous studies among heroin and alcohol users in similar setting. Moreover, higher stigma scores were associated with lower educational status and higher proportions of income spent on substances. This is the first study to document stigma among opium users. Further research needs to be conducted to understand the determinants of stigma in this population.

AB  - We describe a modified sewing machine technique that is ab interno and minimally invasive. The single-suture, single-knot endocyclopexy (internal suture fixation) is performed to correct cyclodialysis. This inside-out technique is an alternative to existing standard cleft repair procedures, such as external direct/indirect cyclopexy and endocyclotamponade (internal mechanical tamponade using extraneous agents). Results in 1 case indicate that the modified technique can be used as a primary procedure and in eyes in which previous cyclopexy failed. (C) 2018 ASCRS and ESCRS

TI  - Aluminium utensils: Is it a concern?
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - HEALTH-RISK
KW  - COOKWARE
AB  - Aluminium utensils are ubiquitous in Indian households and other developing countries. Concerns have recently been raised on the pathological effects of aluminium on the human body, due to its leaching from utensils with long-term use, which has been associated with certain clinical conditions such as anaemia, dementia and osteo-malacia. While some studies suggest that cooking in utensils or aluminium foils is safe, others suggest that it may lead to toxic levels of aluminium in the body. However, studies have shown that leaching of aluminium from cooking utensils depends on many factors such as pH, temperature and cooking medium. In healthy controls, 0.01%-1% of orally ingested aluminium is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is eliminated by the kidney. Although the metal has a tendency to accumulate in tissues and may result in their dysfunction, the literature suggests that the apprehension is more apt in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. This article offers solutions to mitigate the risk of aluminium toxicity

AB  - The present study was conducted to determine the prognostic significance of I655V SNP (rs1136201) is a genetic one in HER-2 oncoprotein in cases of colorectal cancer (CRC). We conducted a case-control study analysing 83 subjects (naive primary CRC cases) who underwent CRC biopsy/colectomy and included 57 healthy control subjects. Analysis of HER-2 polymorphism was done by PCR-RFLP technique. The mean age was found to be 55.9 years; median age was 56years and mode age was 54years with a range of 43 (30-73). Males constitute 63 (75.9%) and females constitute 20 (24.1%) of patient population. According to gradewise distribution, 12 (14.45%) patients were of Grade I, 53 (63.85%) of Grade II, and 18 (21.68%) were of Grade III. We found out that out of 83 patients, 52 (62.65%) were of homozygous wild type (A/A; Ile/Ile); 27 (32.53%) were of heterozygous type (A/G; Ile/Val) and 4 (4.81%) were of homozygous mutant type (G/G; Val/Val). Allelic frequency of Ile (A) was found out to be 0.79 and that of Val (G) is 0.21 and were not significantly different from the healthy control population. Fischer's exact p value obtained was 0.86.

AB  - Asia-Pacific region bears a significant global burden of retinoblastoma (RB), therefore understanding RB in Asia-Pacific region is important. Based on the year 2013 population estimates, 43% (3452 of 8099 children) of the global burden of RB lives in 6 countries of Asia-Pacific region: 1486 children in India, 1103 children in China, 277 children in Indonesia, 260 children in Pakistan, 184 children in Bangladesh, 142 children in Philippines. There exists a wide disparity, technological and socio-economical, within countries in this region resulting in a varied pattern of clinical presentation and survival varies. Challenges in developing nations are not just technological, but also social. Opportunities emerge for research to study and understand the socio-economical aspects of the disease to develop interventions that are relevant culturally and feasible economically. Possible steps include disease education and counselling, universal screening, highly subsidized/ free of cost treatment for low socioeconomic strata, raising funds through the government and non-governmental organizations, sensitization and training of man-power in screening, diagnosis and treatment, and developing new specialized centers with tele-ophthalmology services.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, drug testing in body fluids has gained popularity for validating self-reported drug use. The storage and transportation of urine specimens is a major concern for remote areas where the facilities for performing drug abuse testing are lacking.
   AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to develop an efficient method for testing opiate in dried urine spots (DUS) and to evaluate its clinical applicability.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methodology involved optimization of conditions for extraction, recovery, short-, and long-term stability (room temperature, 4 degrees C,-20 degrees C) for detection of opiate from dried urine spots. Further, the extraction efficiency from dried urine spots was compared with the conventional drug testing methodology. The screening was done by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, and confirmation was achieved by gas chromatography equipped with nitrogen phosphorus detector.
   RESULTS: Deionized water was found to be a suitable extracting solvent compare to bi-carbonate buffer (pH 9.2) and saline. Primary screening was achieved by 2 punches taken from a 20-mu l(diameter 1.3 cm) spotted urine samples, whereas confirmation was achieved by 2 complete circles each of 20 mu l sample volume. The recovery was found to be 99.41% in water. No sign of significant degradation was seen among all storage conditions.
   CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, DUS has achieved the same level of precision and reproducibility as that of standard methods used for drug testing in urine. Hence, the DUS sampling appears to have potential to detect opiate among drug users in a clinical setting.

AB  - Acute severe ulcerative colitis is a life-threatening medical emergency, which can be associated with significant morbidity and is preventable through prompt and effective management. Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of initial therapy, although a third of patients will not respond. Further management hinges on timely decisions with use of rescue therapy with ciclosporin or infliximab, without compromising the health or safety of the patient, or timely surgery. Although such patients need specialist care, it is imperative that emergency care physicians are aware of the important principles of management of this condition to achieve successful outcomes. Risk stratification and the use of predictive models using clinical parameters have reduced the morbidity associated with this condition. We discuss current evidence and present a clinical approach to clinicians involved in the emergency care of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis in this review.

AB  - Background
   Acute bronchiolitis is one of themost frequent causes of emergency department visits and hospitalisation in children. There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis except for supportive treatment, which includes ensuring adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) aims to widen the lungs' peripheral airways, enabling deflation of overdistended lungs in bronchiolitis. Increased airway pressure also prevents the collapse of poorly supported peripheral small airways during expiration. Observational studies report that CPAP is beneficial for children with acute bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review first published in 2015.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of CPAP compared to no CPAP or sham CPAP in infants and children up to three years of age with acute bronchiolitis.
   Search methods
   We conducted searches of CENTRAL (2017, Issue 12), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 toDecember, 2017), Embase (1974 toDecember 2017), CINAHL (1981 toDecember 2017), and LILACS (1982 to December 2017) in January 2018.
   Selection criteria
   We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cross-over RCTs, and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data using a structured pro forma, analysed data, and performed meta-analyses.
   Main results
   We included three studies with a total of 122 children (62/60 in intervention/control arms) aged up to 12 months that investigated nasal CPAP compared with supportive (or "standard") therapy. We included one new trial (72 children) that contributed data to the assessment of respiratory rate and need for mechanical ventilation for this update. The included studies were single-centre trials conducted in France, the UK, and India. Two studies were parallel-group RCTs and one was a cross-over RCT. The evidence provided by the included studies was low quality; we assessed high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting, and confidence intervals were wide.
   The effect of CPAP on the need formechanical ventilation in children with acute bronchiolitis was uncertain due to imprecision around the effect estimate (3 RCTs, 122 children; risk ratio (RR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 3.36; low-quality evidence). None of the trials measured time to recovery. Limited, low-quality evidence indicated that CPAP decreased respiratory rate (2 RCTs, 91 children; mean difference (MD) -3.81, 95% CI -5.78 to -1.84). Only one trial measured change in arterial oxygen saturation, and the results were imprecise (19 children; MD -1.70%, 95% CI -3.76 to 0.36). The effect of CPAP on change in arterial partial
   carbon dioxide pressure (pCO) was imprecise (2 RCTs, 50 children; MD-2.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.29 to 0.05; low-quality evidence). Duration of hospital stay was similar in both CPAP and supportive care groups (2 RCTs, 50 children; MD 0.07 days, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.50; low-quality evidence). Two studies did not report about pneumothorax, but pneumothorax did not occur in one study. No studies reported occurrences of deaths. Several outcomes (change in partial oxygen pressure, hospital admission rate (from emergency department to hospital), duration of emergency department stay, and need for intensive care unit admission) were not reported in the included studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   Limited, low-quality evidence suggests that breathing improved (a decreased respiratory rate) in children with bronchiolitis who received CPAP; this finding is unchanged fromthe 2015 review. Further evidence for this outcome was provided by the inclusion of a low-quality study for the 2018 update. Due to the limited available evidence, the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis is uncertain for other outcomes. Larger, adequately powered trials are needed to evaluate the effect of CPAP for children with acute bronchiolitis.

AB  - A significant proportion of sinonasal malignancies comprise poorly differentiated/undifferentiated carcinomas that defy accurate histologic classification and behave aggressively. Recent years have seen a refinement of this spectrum by inclusion of novel entities harboring specific genetic alterations, including SMARCB1 (INI1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma (SDSC), characterized by inactivating alterations in SMARCB1 gene, as demonstrated by loss of INI1 immunoexpression. Cyclin D1 is a cell-cycle regulatory protein downstream of INI1. Loss of INI1 leads to derepression of cyclin D1 transcription, suggesting its role as a putative therapeutic target. However, cyclin D1 expression has not been assessed in SDSCs. We retrieved all sinonasal carcinomas, including sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Histopathologic features were reviewed. INI1 immunohistochemistry was performed. Cyclin D1 was performed in cases showing INI1 loss. Loss of INI1 staining was seen in 13 cases (5.8%), including 11 males and 2 females (age range, 11-65 years). Original diagnoses included SDSC (3/13), sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (3/13), adenocarcinoma (3/13), poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (2/13), and poorly differentiated carcinoma (2/13). Tumors were predominantly basaloid in 6 cases and plasmacytoid/rhabdoid in 5 cases. We identified 2 cases having oncocytoid cells arranged in a gland-like pattern. Significant cyclin D1 immunoexpression was absent. SDSC is a rare, emerging entity that resembles a poorly differentiated carcinoma. Histomorphologic spectrum of these tumors is evolving. In addition to basaloid and plasmacytoid/rhabdoid cells, oncocytoid/adenocarcinoma-like pattern can also be seen in SDSC and predicts INI1 loss. These histologic patterns can further be subjected to INI1 immunohistochemistry for correct diagnosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A well-known tissue marker of ovarian cancer, Human Epididymis protein 4 (HE4) is the member of whey acidic four-disulfide core proteins family. Purified from human seminal plasma and characterized as a cross-class protease inhibitor, HE4 was proposed to shield spermatozoa against pro-teolytic factors. However, its exact biological function is unknown. Proteins usually function in conjunction with other proteins in the system and thus, identification and analysis of protein networks become essential to decode protein functions.
   Objective: This study was performed to explore possible role(s) of HE4 in reproductive physiology via identification of its interactome in human seminal plasma.
   Methods: HE4 binding proteins were identified through co-immunoprecipitation and MALDI-TOF/MS analysis. Also, HE4 was quantified by ELISA in fertile and infertile human seminal plasma samples.
   Results: Ten HE4 binding proteins were identified, viz. protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 21, protein kinase CLK3, Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein36A, prostatic acid phosphatase, KIF5C, Spectrin repeat containing, nuclear envelope 1, isoform CRAf, tropomyosin 4, vezatin, utrophin and fibronectin1. This interaction network suggests that HE4 plays multiple roles, specifically in capacitation, sperm motility and maturation. Further, HE4 concentration in human seminal plasma samples was determined by Elisa. Higher HE4 expression in normozoospermia compared to azoospermia and asthenozoospermia affirms its importance in fertilization.
   Conclusion: Based on identified interactome, it is plausible that HE4 plays a crucial role in fertilization, specifically in sperm maturation, motility and capacitation.

AB  - Complex Chromosomal Rearrangements (CCRs) are increasingly being reported as genetic risk factors of clinical significance in cancer owing to their identification using high resolution whole genome profiling technologies. This study employed high resolution CGH+ SNP microarrays for whole genome copy number variations (CNV) profiling and identified CCRs in 11/107(10%) newly diagnosed Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients. Six patients exhibited Chromothripsis (CTH) among seven chromosomes that were confirmed with automated CTLPscanner web tool and; five cases displayed chromoplexy (CPL) which involved multiple chromosomes. Presence of chromothripsis in chromosome 17 in three out of six patients indicate a link between TP53 aberrations and incidence of CTH. Multivariable Cox regression model demonstrated a significant association of CTH with poor PFS (HR=3.09, p=0.010) and OS (HR=3.31, p=0.024) which suggests that CTH is an additional independent prognostic marker in multiple myeloma. Addition of CTH in risk stratification models in clinical setting in multiple myeloma may help in upfront identification of high risk patients for suitable customized therapy.

AB  - PurposeTo analyze and compare the total proteome of aqueous humor (AH) from patients having primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and age-related cataract.Materials and methodologyAqueous humor was collected from age-matched PACG, POAG and cataract patients who underwent surgery, and it was immediately stored at -80 degrees C until analysis. From each sample, 25 mu g of total protein was subjected to trypsin digestion and subsequently LC-MS/MS analysis was performed for the deep proteome analysis. The data acquired after the LC-MS/MS analysis were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer 1.4. The identified peptide matches were validated using percolator, at less than 1% false discovery rates.ResultsA total of 625, 594 and 636 proteins were identified in PACG, POAG and cataract groups, respectively (n=9 in each group). The inter-group comparison among all these groups showed that 246 proteins were identified in all the three groups. An average of 23642, 218 +/- 40 and 214 +/- 62 proteins from each AH sample of PACG, POAG and cataract, respectively, was identified. There were 53 proteins commonly found in all 9 PACG AH, 59 proteins in POAG AH and 42 proteins in 9 cataracts AH samples. In the individual analysis, there were 28 proteins found in all the samples analyzed representing the constitutive AH proteome. Spectral counting analysis of 246 proteins identified in all three group types showed significant differences in protein abundance. In proteins unique to PACG AH, 7 proteins viz. ARHGEF12, APC2, WAS, PIK3CG, ITGB1, MSN and PFN1 out of 226 were found in Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton pathway, whereas in POAG 5 out of 206proteins viz. ADCY2, ITPR1, MAPK3, MAP3K2 and TUBB1 were found in Gap Junction pathway.Conclusions A qualitative as well as a quantitative comparison of proteomes of AH from PACG, POAG and age-related cataract eyes showed significant differences, thus providing clues to the disease pathophysiology.

AB  - Objective A preliminary study to determine collagen fibril diameter (CF-ED) distribution on medial and lateral sides of cleft lip (CL). Material and Methods Tissue samples from medial and lateral sides of CL were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Araldite CY212 resin for transmission electron microscopy. The analysis of CF-ED was performed using the ImageJ program. To characterize the packaging of collagen fibrils (CFs) in the two tissues, we estimated the collagen number density (CF-ND) and fibril-area-fraction (FAF). Differences in measurements across the two sides were calculated using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results The CF-ED was statistically significantly (p < 0.001) smaller on the medial side (45.69 +/- 7.89 nm) than on the lateral side (54.18 +/- 7.62 nm). The medial side had a higher CF-ND and a higher percentage of FAF than the lateral side. Conclusion Our finding of a smaller CF-ED and higher CF-ND and FAF for the medial side suggests possible differences in size and distribution of CFs between medial and lateral sides of CL. This finding provides knowledge toward underlying tissue biomechanics that may help reconstruction of perioral tissue scaffolds, ultimately resulting in better treatment of patients with oral clefts.

AB  - Background: The pancreatobiliary carcinomas are characterized by presence of desmoplastic stroma. Overexpression of secreted protein acid and rich in cysteine (SPARC), a matrix producing agent has been documented in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, with survival benefits. This study was targeted to see if SPARC expression in pancreatobiliary carcinomas is responsible for stromal desmoplasia and its prognostic significance.
   Methods: In this retrospective study 48 cases of pancreatic cancer and 27 cases of cholangiocarcinoma were analyzed. The expression pattern of SPARC and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (angiogenic factors) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues. Immunoreactivity was scored semi quantitatively based on stain intensity and stain distribution. SPARC expression was correlated with tumor histology, stromal desmoplasia, VEGF expression, various histological parameters and overall survival in patients. Real time polymerase chain reaction was performed in few cases to validate the immunohistochemistry expression pattern.
   Results: SPARC expression was high in peritumoral stroma in pancreatic carcinoma than in pancreatic controls; however, SPARC expression pattern was not grossly different in desmoplastic and non-desmoplastic pancreatobiliary carcinomas and in cholangiocarcinomas. No definite correlation was noted between SPARC expression and histological markers of severity and overall survival data.
   Conclusions: The relevance of SPARC expression in pancreato-biliary carcinomas though may still be important for therapeutic decision making, it is not responsible for peritumoral stromal desmoplasia in these tumors and it does not have any significant prognostic implication.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Objective: To identify important qualitative and quantitative clinical and imaging features that could potentially differentiate renal primitiveneuroectodermal tumor (PNET) from various subtypes of renalcell carcinoma (RCC).
   Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 164 patients, 143 with pathologically proven RCC and 21 with pathologically proven renal PNET. Univariate analysis of each parameter was performed. In order to differentiate renal PNET from RCC subtypes and overall RCC as a group, we generated ROC curves and determined cutoff values for mean attenuation of the lesion, mass to aorta attenuation ratio and mass to renal parenchyma attenuation ratio in the nephrographic phase.
   Results: Univariate analysis revealed 11 significant parameters for differentiating renal PNET from clear cell RCC (age, p = <0.001; size, p =< 0.001; endophytic growth pattern, p < 0.001;margin of lesion, p =< 0.001; septa within the lesion, p =< 0.001; renal vein invasion, p =< 0.001; inferior vena cava involvement, p = 0.014; enhancement of lesion less than the renal parenchyma, p = 0.008; attenuation of the lesion, p = 0.002; mass to aorta attenuation ratio, p =< 0.001; and mass to renal parenchyma attenuation ratio, p =< 0.001). Univariate analysis also revealed seven significant parameters for differentiating renal PNET from papillary RCC. For differentiating renal PNET from overall RCCs as a group, when 77.3 Hounsfield unit was used as cutoff value in nephrographic phase, the sensitivity and specificity were 71.83 and 76.92 % respectively. For differentiating renal PNET from overall RCCs as a group, when 0.57 was used as cutoff for mass to aorta enhancement ratio in nephrographic phase, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.28 and 84.62 % respectively.
   Conclusion: Specific qualitative and quantitative features can potentially differentiate renal PNET from various subtypes of RCC.
   Advances In knowledge: The study underscores the utility of combined demographic and CT findings to potentially differentiate renal PNET from the much commoner renal neoplasm, i.e. RCC. It has management implications as if RCC is suspected, surgeons proceed with resection without need for confirmatory biopsy. On the contrary, a suspected renal PNET should proceed with biopsy followed by chemoradiotherapy, thus obviating the unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bauhinia purpurea (BP) Linn. (Caesalpiniaceae) is a plant of great medicinal importance and has been used since ancient times for treating many inflammatory conditions including arthritis. This study investigates the anti-arthritic potential of the hydroalcoholic extract from the stem bark of BP.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic activity of BP at various doses was used to evaluate its anti-inflammatory activity and anti-arthritic activity. Serum of arthritic rats was collected at day 21 for detecting serum cytokines level and to evaluate the effect of BP on its serum level. Furthermore, the safety of BP was evaluated in acute (5 days) and subacute (28 days) toxicity study in rats.
   RESULTS: There was a significant inhibition (P < 0.01) in paw edema at a different time scale with different doses of BP (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg). BP also demonstrated dose-dependent anti-arthritic activity on all observation days (3, 7, 14, and 21). In addition, there was also a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in oxidative stress markers, circulating pro-inflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor alpha from 45.91 to 37.44, interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta from 18.24 to 16.06, and IL-6 from 69.77 to 58.44) and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 from 8.07 to 12.07) levels. BP was found to be safe with an oral LD(50 )value of >2 g/kg in acute toxicity study and also no toxicological effect was observed in the oral subacute toxicity study.
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that BP bark possesses anti-arthritic activity potential and confirm its folklore use in the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Calotropis procera, a latex producing plant is known to possess medicinal properties including its beneficial effect in gastrointestinal disorders. The anti-inflammatory effect of its latex in various experimental models is noteworthy and in light of this the present study was carried out with an objective to evaluate its efficacy in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory condition of the colon. Colitis was induced in rats by acetic acid and the rats were divided into four groups where one group served as experimental control and the other groups were treated with two doses of methanol extract of dried latex of C. procera (MeDL; 50 and 150 mg/kg) and mesalazine (MSZ; 300 mg/kg). The study also included normal control (NC) group for comparison of various parameters related to colon like macroscopic changes, ulcer score, adherent mucus content, weight/length ratio, small intestinal transit, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, tissue histology and immunoreactivity of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF kappa B) subunit p65. Treatment of colitic rats with MeDL produced a significant reduction in colonic mucosal damage as revealed by macroscopic and microscopic evaluation and normalization of tissue levels of oxidative stress markers and pro-inflammatory mediators. The protection afforded by MeDL was also evident from its restorative effect on tissue histology and expression of COX-2, iNOS and NF kappa B(p65). This study shows that by targeting oxidative stress and NF kappa B(p65) mediated pro-inflammatory signaling, the latex of C. procera affords protection in colitis and its effect was comparable to that of mesalazine. This study suggests that latex of C. procera could serve as a promising therapeutic option for treating inflammatory conditions of the colon.

AB  - Pleural tuberculosis (pTB) is diagnosed by using a composite reference standard (CRS) since microbiological methods are grossly inadequate and an accurate diagnostic test remains an unmet need. The present study aimed to evaluate the utility of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigen and DNA-based tests for pTB diagnosis. Patients were classified as 'Definite TB', 'Probable TB' and 'Non-TB' disease according to the CRS. We assessed the performance of in-house antigen detection assays, namely antibody-based Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) and aptamer-based Aptamer-Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA), targeting Mtb HspX protein and DNA-based tests namely, Xpert MTB/RIF and in-house devR-qPCR. ROC curves were generated for the combined group of 'Definite TB' and 'Probable TB' vs. 'Non-TB' disease group and cut-off values were derived to provide specificity of >= 98%. The sensitivity of ALISA was similar to 93% vs. similar to 24% of ELISA (p-value <= 0.0001). devR-qPCR exhibited a sensitivity of 50% vs. similar to 22% of Xpert (p-value <= 0.01). This novel aptamer-based ALISA test surpasses the sensitivity criterion and matches the specificity requirement spelt out in the 'Target product profile' for extrapulmonary tuberculosis samples by Unitaid (Sensitivity >= 80%, Specificity 98%). The superior performance of the aptamer-based ALISA test indicates its translational potential to bridge the existing gap in pTB diagnosis.

AB  - The peripheral corneal thinning disorders are associated with degenerative, autoimmune, or infective causes. Corneal thinning can subsequently affect the visual acuity either by inducing severe astigmatism or by progressive involvement of the central cornea. In addition to this, the integrity of the eye is at risk. Medical management is necessary to address the underlying inflammatory or infectious causes; however, most of the cases require surgical intervention for tectonic support or for visual rehabilitation in patients with severe astigmatism. Preoperative investigations help in mapping the corneal curvature and thickness, thereby facilitating planning of treatment. Routine corneal transplantation techniques do not yield good results in peripheral corneal thinning disorders. Various surgical modifications have been described to manage these challenging cases. We review the available literature on causes and management of peripheral corneal thinning disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Brachytherapy (BT) for locally advanced cervical cancer is vital for optimal outcomes. There is heterogeneity in brachytherapy treatment practice for cervical cancer across India. In an attempt to standardize various processes involved in cervical cancer brachytherapy, the expert members of the Indian Brachytherapy Society (IBS) developed a document related to radiation therapy treatment of cervical cancer with special emphasis on brachytherapy. The guidelines are based on high quality clinical evidence, expert opinion and consensus wherever evidence was lacking. The document provides a guide for external beam radiation and details of all the processes involved in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy including patient selection, preparation, principles and technique of BT applications, target and normal tissue definition, dose prescriptions, BT planning, reporting parameters, common complications of BT and their management, scope for research, etc. In summary, we present here practical tips and tricks, recording and reporting of cervical cancer brachytherapy, which can be implemented in various clinical environments and forms the basis of this report.

AB  - ObjectivesTo compare parent reported sleep behaviors of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and normal healthy controls and to examine the association of sleep disturbances with daytime behavioral difficulties in children with ASD.MethodsSixty ASD children (85% boys) (Mean age=6.1 y, SD=2.4) were recruited from the Psychology unit of the Department of Pediatrics of a tertiary care hospital. An age and socio-economic status matched group of typically developing (TD) children (N=60) were also recruited. The Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) was used to measure sleep problems. The Childhood Psychopathology Measurement Schedule was used to measure day time behavioral difficulties.ResultsSleep problems were nearly two times more prevalent among children with ASD (88.3%) as compared to the TD group (46.7%) ((2)=23.74, P=0.0001). The total CSHQ and 6 out of the 8 subscales scores of the ASD group were also significantly higher than the TD group. Overall, children with ASD displayed significant more bedtime resistance than controls (t= 3.95, P=0.001). The sleep duration subscale showed that children with ASD, relative to the TD group, slept too little ((2)=23.08, P=0.0001), did not sleep the right amount of time ((2)= 11.86, P=0.003), and displayed significant variation in the duration of time slept ((2)=11.96, P=0.003). In addition, parent reported sleep dysfunction had a significant relationship with daytime reported behavior difficulties (r=0.53, P=0.01) in children with ASD. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that 30% of the variance in number of daytime behavioral problems was explained by only two variables: total CSHQ scores and duration of night awake time (F=11.18, P=0.001).ConclusionsChildren with ASD are at a high risk for sleep problems and this is associated with daytime behavior disturbances. Pediatricians should routinely screen ASD children for sleep problems and initiate timely and appropriate interventions.

AB  - The five-year survival rate of esophageal cancer patients is less than 20%. This may be due to increased resistance (acquired or intrinsic) of tumor cells to chemo/radiotherapies, often caused by aberrant cell cycle, deregulated apoptosis, increases in growth factor signaling pathways, and/or changes in the proteome network. In addition, deregulation in non-coding RNA-mediated signaling pathways may contribute to resistance to therapies. At the molecular level, these resistance factors have now been linked to various microRNA (miRNAs), which have recently been shown to control cell development, differentiation and neoplasia. The increased stability and dysregulated expression of miRNAs have been associated with increased resistance to various therapies in several cancers, including esophageal cancer. Therefore, miRNAs represent the next generation of molecules with tremendous potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, detailed studies on miRNA-based therapeutic interventions are still in their infancy. Hence, in this review, we have summarized the current status of microRNAs in dictating the resistance/sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition, we have discussed various strategies to increase radiosensitivity, including targeted therapy, and the use of miRNAs as radiosensitive/radioresistance biomarkers for esophageal cancer in the clinical setting.

In India, tobacco-related cancers (TRCs) contribute nearly half of the total cancers in males and one-fifth in females. Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate 25-year trends and projection of TRCs for 2018-2022. Methods: Joinpoint analysis was performed to assess the trends of TRCs on world age-adjusted rates. Age-period-cohort model with power link function was performed to project the future incidence burden of TRCs in urban Delhi. Results: During the 25 years, a total of 67,129 TRCs (53,125 males and 14,004 females) were registered which was 25.4% of total cancer cases registered. Males contributed 39. 1% and females 10.8% of total cases. In males, TRCs declined significantly from 1988 to 2003 with estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = -0.91% and thereafter increasing trend was observed with EAPC = 3.42%, while in females, the EAPC values were 2.2% and 3.54% respectively for the same period. The total burden of TRCs will be doubled in 2018-2022 with around 46% change due to cancer risk and around 54% due to population age and size in both the genders. The average annual count in males will be 7310 in 2018-2022 as compared to 3571 in 2008-2012 while in females this count will be increased to 2066 from 955 based on recent slope. Conclusion: The incidence of TRCs is increasing due to increase in population age, size, and factors other than population. TRCs are the preventable cancers, and load of these cancers can be controlled with strictly adhering the policy and acts.

AB  - Background: Bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on the surface of biomaterials can often lead to implant-related infections, which may vary depending on the species of microorganisms, type of biomaterial used, and physical characteristics of implant surfaces. However, there are limited studies specifically comparing biofilm formation between commonly used metallic orthopaedic implant materials and different bacterial strains. This in vitro study is to evaluate the ability of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to adhere to and to form biofilms on the surface of five orthopaedic biomaterials, viz., cobalt and chromium, highly cross-linked polyethylene, stainless steel, trabecular metal, and titanium alloy. Materials and Methods: Bacterial adherence and bacterial biofilm-formation assays were performed by culturing S. aureus ATCC 29213, S. epidermidis ATCC 35984, E. coli ATCC 35218, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 for 48 h on five different biomaterials. Quantitative bacterial adherence and biofilm formation were analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. Results: The highest level of adherence was observed on highly cross-linked polyethylene, followed by titanium, stainless steel, and trabecular metal, with the lowest occurring on the cobalt-chromium alloy. Among the bacterial strains tested, the ability for high adherence was observed with S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae followed by P. aeruginosa and E. coli, whereas S. aureus showed the least adherence. Conclusion: Cobalt-chromium was observed to have the lowest proclivity towards bacterial adherence compared to the other biomaterials tested. However, bacterial adhesion occurred with all the materials. Hence, it is necessary to further evaluate newer biomaterials that are resistant to bacterial adherence.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The actual cause of AD is still unknown. Oxidative stress is believed to be important player in AD pathology. Glutathione (GSH) is a major antioxidant, and it is already known that GSH is depleted significantly in the hippocampal regions in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients compared to healthy old subjects. Hence there is a serious discussion to improve the brain GSH level by supplementation. This editorial highlights the need for GSH supplementation for the cognitive enhancement in MCI and AD.

AB  - Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in paediatric leukaemias. Antifungal combinations to treat these patients are being explored. Fourteen children with leukaemias and IFIs were treated with a combination of antifungal agents at our centre. The first antifungal was amphotericin-B in 13 children and voriconazole in one child. In view of no improvement and clinical deterioration, in nine patients, voriconazole was added as the second antifungal agent and in four, it was caspofungin. All patients completed 4u6 weeks of antifungal therapy. The overall mortality attributable to IFI for the cohort was 4/14 (28%).

AB  - Background Endophthalmitis, a sight-threatening intraocular infection, can be of postsurgical, post-traumatic or endogenous origin. Laboratory diagnosis-based appropriate therapy can be vision-saving. Conventional culture-based laboratory diagnosis takes time and lacks sensitivity. In this study a broad-range PCR assay was assessed against conventional and automated culture methods in vitreous specimens for accurate microbiological diagnosis.
   Aims To use broad-range PCR assay targeting 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) region of bacteria and to assess its performance vis-a-vis conventional and automated culture methods in the laboratory diagnosis of endophthalmitis.
   Methods Vitreous specimens from 195 patients with clinically diagnosed endophthalmitis were processed for classical and automated culture methods, antimicrobial sensitivity and broad-range PCR assay targeting 762 bp region of 16S rRNA followed by nucleotide sequencing by Sanger's method. Causative agents were identified from the nucleotide sequences analysed against the GenBank database, and organisms were identified using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) MM18A guidelines.
   Results Bacteria could be detected from 127 (65.13%) of the 195 vitreous specimens by broad-range PCR assay; bacterial isolation was possible from 17 (8.7%) and 60 (30.76%) of these specimens by conventional and automated culture methods, respectively (p<0.0001). PCR assay could detect two uncultured bacterium, and in five cases the bacterial identity could not be determined from NCBI database matching.
   Conclusion Broad-range PCR assay could provide definitive microbial diagnosis within 24 hours in significantly more patients (p<0.0001). Some rare organisms could be detected, useful in treatment modalities. Automated culture was significantly more sensitive than conventional culture.

AB  - Objectives: To measure difference in median time to antibiotic administration in severe sepsis before and after making process changes and clinical outcomes such as duration of hospitalization and mortality.
   Methods: The study was carried out in the emergency department in children <17 years of age with severe sepsis/septic shock. In phase 1, data were collected and reasons for delayed antibiotic administration were identified. Following this, process changes like creating a triage tool, re-enforcing the severe sepsis protocol and increasing the number of nurses were made to correct the delay. In phase 2, we measured outcomes to compare the effect of the process changes.
   Results: A total of 28 and 13 children each were included during phase 1 and phase 2 of the study respectively. The median interquartile range time to administration of antibiotics from the time of admission decreased significantly from 50 minutes (18, 65) to 20 minutes (15, 20) (p = .02). Duration of hospital stay was longer in phase 1 as compared to phase 2 (12 days vs. 6 days). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p = .1).
   Conclusions: Use of a triage tool, severe sepsis protocol, and increasing the number of nurses resulted in earlier recognition and administration of first dose of antibiotics in children with severe sepsis.

TI  - Microteaching enhances teaching skills of resident doctors in India: A pilot study
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - PROGRAM
AB  - Background. The Medical Council of India has recommended microteaching for training medical graduates to improve their teaching efficiency. We assessed the effectiveness of microteaching on teaching skills of resident doctors through objective and subjective methods.
   Methods. We obtained data from three microteaching sessions in which 10 resident doctors participated. Seven core teaching skills of the participants were compared between two training sessions using the paired t-test. Only 4 residents who had participated in the training sessions appeared for the semester examination. We compared the performance of the 'trained' residents (n = 4) with the 'naive' residents (n=6) who were getting exposed to microteaching for the first time during the semester examination using the Mann-Whitney test.
   Results. Participants scored significantly high in the second training session compared to the first one. All the participants perceived the training sessions to have a positive effect on their teaching skills. In the semester examination, 'trained' residents performed significantly better than their 'naive' counterparts.
   Conclusions. Microteaching not only improved the teaching skills of the residents but also helped them perform well in their semester examination held 10 months later. Our results indicate that microteaching can be an effective teacher training technique for residents.

AB  - Photosynthetic fixation of CO2 is more efficient in C-4 than in C-3 plants. Rice is a C-3 plant and a potential target for genetic engineering of the C-4 pathway. It is known that genes encoding C-4 enzymes are present in C-3 plants. However, no systematic analysis has been conducted to determine if these C-4 gene family members are expressed in diverse rice genotypes. In this study, we identified 15 genes belonging to the five C-4 gene families in rice genome through BLAST search using known maize C-4 photosynthetic pathway genes. Phylogenetic relationship of rice C-4 photosynthetic pathway genes and their isoforms with other grass genomes (Brachypodium, maize, Sorghum and Setaria), showed that these genes were highly conserved across grass genomes. Spatiotemporal, hormone, and abiotic stress specific expression pattern of the identified genes revealed constitutive as well as inductive responses of the C-4 photosynthetic pathway in different tissues and developmental stages of rice. Expression levels of C-4 specific gene family members in flag leaf during tillering stage were quantitatively analyzed in five rice genotypes covering three species, viz. Oryza sativa, ssp. japonica (cv. Nipponbare), Oryza sativa, ssp. indica (cv IR64, Swarna), and two wild species Oryza barthii and Oryza australiensis. The results showed that all the identified genes expressed in rice and exhibited differential expression pattern during different growth stages, and in response to biotic and abiotic stress conditions and hormone treatments. Our study concludes that C-4 photosynthetic pathway genes present in rice play a crucial role in stress regulation and might act as targets for C-4 pathway engineering via CRISPR-mediated breeding.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) is associated with retinal aging and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In both cases there are reports for the presence of markers of lipid peroxidation in retinal cells. We investigated if nitrosative stress also occurs in the human retina with aging. We examined the cellular localization of nitro-tyrosine, a biomarker of protein tyrosine nitration, in human donor retina (17-91 years; N= 15) by immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity (IR) to nitro-tyrosine was present in ten retinas and absent in five retinas. It was predominant in photoreceptor inner segments, cell bodies and axons. In six retinas, IR was present in abnormal, swollen axons of macular and peripheral cones. In the inner retina, weak immunoreactivity was detected in the outer and inner plexiform layer. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a variable degree of microtubule disorganization, abnormal outgrowth from the swollen macular axons (as the fibers of Henle) and few dead axons.

AB  - Background Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is the primary modality for mediastinal lymph node staging in lung carcinoma. We aimed to evaluate its utility in extra-pulmonary malignancies (EPM). Methods Database search of EBUS-TBNA aspirations (2013-2017) done in patients with known/suspected EPMs and mediastinal lymphadenopathy/masses was performed. All archived cytology/histology material was reviewed and categorised as positive, negative and unsatisfactory. Results The selected 139 patients included 100 patients with known EPMs, 11 patients with known lymphoma, and 28 patients with suspected EPM of unknown primary. EBUS-TBNA was adequate in 110 patients (79%), including 21 patients who yielded only reactive lymphoid tissue. Satisfactory blood clot cores were obtained in 34 patients and contributed significantly to diagnosis and ancillary testing. Metastasis was detected in 45 patients with known EPM, predominantly originating from a known primary in the breast in females (56%) and squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck in males (60%). Granulomatous lymphadenopathy was identified in 16 patients with known EPM (16%). Lymphoma relapse and granulomatous lymphadenopathy were identified in three and four patients with known lymphoma, respectively. In patients with suspected EPM of unknown primary site, malignancy was confirmed in 21 patients, predominantly representing metastatic adenocarcinomas (n = 5) and neuroendocrine neoplasms (n = 5). Immunocytochemistry was performed in 16 of these cases and aided in characterisation of primary site/type of tumour in 12 cases. Conclusion EBUS-TBNA is efficient for screening mediastinal lymph nodes/masses for malignancy in EPMs. Procuring sufficient material for ancillary testing would improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce need for resampling.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effect of early total enteral feeding (ETEF) when compared with conventional enteral feeding (CEF) in stable very-low-birth-weight (VLBW; 1,000-1,499 g) infants on the postnatal age (in days) at attaining full enteral feeds. Methods: In this unblinded randomised controlled trial, 180 infants were allocated to an ETEF (n = 91) or a CEF group (n = 89). Feeds were initiated as total enteral feeds in the ETEF group and as minimal enteral nutrition (20 mL/kg) in the CEF group. The rest of the day's requirement in the CEF group was provided as parenteral fluids. The primary outcome was postnatal age at attaining full enteral feeds. The secondary outcomes included episodes of feed intolerance, incidence of sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), and duration of hospital stay. Results: The baseline variables including birth weight and gestational age were similar in the two groups. The infants of the ETEF group attained full enteral feeds earlier than those of the CEF group (6.5 +/- 1.5 vs. 10.1 +/- 4.1 days postnatal age; mean difference -3.6 [-4.5 to -2.7]; p < 0.001). Total episodes of feed intolerance and clinical sepsis were fewer, with a shorter duration of hospital stay, in the ETEF group (15.5 vs. 19.6 days) (p = 0.01). The incidence of NEC was similar in the two groups. Conclusion: ETEF in stable VLBW infants results in earlier attainment of full feeds and decreases the duration of hospital stay without any increased risk of feed intolerance or NEC. (C) 2019 S.

AB  - In the present investigation, the potential of a novel, self-assembled, biocompatible, and redox-sensitive copolymer system with disulfide bond was explored for doxorubicin (DOX) delivery through polymersome nanostructures of similar to 120 nm. The polymer system was synthesized with less steps, providing a high yield of 86%. The developed polymersomes showed admirable biocompatibility with high dose tolerability in vitro and in vivo. The colloidal stability of DOX-loaded polymersomes depicted a stable and uniform particle size over a period of 72 h. The cellular internalization of polymersomes was assessed in HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, where enhanced cellular internalization was observed. The dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed for DOX-loaded polymersomes by MTT cytotoxicity assay in the above cell lines. The tumor suppression studies were assessed in Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) carrying Swiss albino mice, where polymersomes exhibited a 7.16-fold reduction in tumor volume correlated with control and 5.39-fold higher tumor inhibition capacity compared to conventional chemotherapy (free DOX treatment). The developed polymersomes gave safer insights concerning DOX associated toxicities by histopathology and serum biochemistry analysis. Thus, results focus on the potential of redox responsive polymersomes for efficacious and improved DOX therapy with enhanced antitumor activity and insignificant cardiotoxicity which can be translated to clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Activated platelets release cytokines/proteins including CXCL4 (PF4), CCL5 and fibrinopeptides, which regulate infection of several pathogenic viruses such as HIV, H1N1 and HCV in human. Since platelet activation is the hallmark of Dengue virus (DV) infection, we investigated the role of platelets in DV replication and also in a closely related Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV).
   Methods and findings: Microscopy and PCR analysis revealed a 4-fold increase in DV replication in primary monocytes or monocytic THP-1 cells in vitro upon incubation with either DV-activated platelets or supernatant from DV-activated platelets. The mass spectrometry based proteomic data from extra-nuclear fraction of above THP-1 lysate showed the crucial association of PF4 with enhanced DV replication. Our cytokine analysis and immunoblot assay showed significant inhibition of IFN-alpha production in monocytes via p38MAPK-STAT2-IRF9 axis. Blocking PF4 through antibodies or its receptor CXCR3 through inhibitor i.e. AMG487, significantly rescued production of IFN-a resulting in potent inhibition of DV replication inmonocytes. Further, flow cytometry and ELISA data showed the direct correlation between elevated plasma PF4 with increased viral NS1 in circulating monocytes in febrile DV patients at day-3 of fever than day-9. Similarly, PF4 also showed direct effects in promoting the JEV replication in monocytes and microglia cells in vitro. The in vitro results were also validated in mice, where AMG487 treatment significantly improved the survival of JEV infected animals.
   Interpretation: Our study suggests that PF4-CXCR3-IFN axis is a potential target for developing treatment regimen against viral infections including JEV and DV. (c) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of peripheral inserted central catheter (PICC) tip malposition when the catheter is inserted under real-time ultrasound (RTUS) guidance when compared with conventional landmark (CL) technique in neonates. Additional objectives were to evaluate the PICC longevity and central line associated blood stream infections (CLABSI).
   Study design In this randomised controlled trial, neonates were randomised to 'RTUS' (n = 40) or 'CL' (n = 40) groups. PICC tip was placed under ultrasound guidance in lower third of superior vena cava in the RTUS group. In 'CL' group, PICC was inserted as calculated by anatomical landmarks.
   Results The birth weight (1286 (926, 1662) vs. 1061 (889, 1636) g) and gestation (31.12 (3.1) vs. 31.4 (3.6) wks) were comparable among the groups. RTUS guidance during PICC insertion reduced incidence of tip malposition by 52% (67.5 vs. 32.5%; RR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.29-0.79). The longevity of PICC and episodes of CLABSI were however similar in the two groups.
   Conclusions Real-time ultrasound guidance during PICC placement reduces the incidence of tip malposition.

AB  - AML, the second most common childhood leukemia is also one of the deadliest cancers. High mortality rate in AML is due to high incidence of relapse after complete remission with chemotherapy and inadequate prognostic assessment of patients. Moreover, there is dearth of therapeutic targets for treatment of this malignancy. Previous pilot study (n = 24) by our group revealed strong association between cathepsin B (CTSB) overexpression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and poor survival outcome in pediatric AML patients. To further explore the clinical utility and role of this protease in pediatric AML, we measured its enzymatic activity and mRNA expression in PBMCs as well as bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of patients (n = 101) and PBMCs of healthy controls. Our results revealed elevated CTSB activity (P < 0.01) and overexpression of its mRNA (P < 0.01) in AML patients. Interestingly CTSB in BMMCs of patients emerged as an independent prognostic marker when compared with other known risk factors. Moreover, chemical inhibition of CTSB activity compromised survival, and induced apoptosis in an AML cell line THP-1. We further demonstrate the inhibition of CTSB activity by chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin in these cells. Docking and simulation studies suggested the binding of doxorubicin to CTSB with higher affinity than its known specific inhibitor CA-074 Me, thereby indicating that cell death induced by this drug may at least partly be mediated by CTSB inhibition. CTSB, therefore, may serve as a prognostic marker and an attractive chemotherapeutic target in pediatric AML.

AB  - Introduction: In sickle cell disease (SCD) patients, among the predictors of survival, HbF levels play a significant role in lowering the morbidity and mortality. Coinheritance of delta beta thalassemia and hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) may contribute to variable HbF levels in SCD patients, thus influencing their clinicopathological profile. Such cases are sparsely documented in the literature and thus, we screened the presence of delta beta thalassemia and HPFH in 126 cases of SCD with high HbF. Material and methods: A total 126 SCD individuals with raised HbF levels were the study subject. Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) was done for the quantitative assessment of hemoglobin variants. HbSC, HbSD, HbAS and HbSE cases were excluded. Asian Indian G gamma(A gamma delta beta)0-thal, delta beta 0-thal (Sicilian, 13.4 kb), (Chinese, 100 kb), HPFH-1 (Black, 106 kb), HPFH-2 (Ghanaian, 105 kb), HPFH-3 (Indian, 48.5 kb) were done by GAP-PCR. Results: Out of 126, 78 cases (62%) were homozygous for SCD. The remaining 48 cases suspected to be heterozygous were furthered screened and 6/48 cases (12.5%) were found to be compound heterozygous. Out of these 6 cases,4(66.66%) had HbS/ delta beta- G gamma(A gamma delta beta)0 and 2(33%) had HbS/HPFH compound heterozygous condition. None of the patients had delta beta 0-thal (Sicilian, 13.4 kb), (Chinese, 100 kb), HPFH-1 (Black, 106 kb), HPFH-2 (Ghanaian, 105 kb). Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of understanding the complex patho-physiology of compound heterozygous cases of HbS/HPFH and HbS/delta beta thalassemia, as these infrequent conditions lead to change in phenotype and clinical severity of the disease. Insight into more such cases will open the window to better analyze the disease pathogenesis in these rare compound heterozygous conditions, as this will be beneficial to formulate proper management protocol in these patients.

AB  - Viscero-atrial situs encompasses the laterality, relative position and configuration of the abdominal viscera, the atria of the heart and the tracheobronchial tree. Determining the situs and cardiac position is the first step in the commonly used sequential, segmental approach to the imaging evaluation of congenital heart defects (CHD). Abnormalities of visceroatrial situs and cardiac position are frequently associated with the presence of complex CHDs and accurate assessment of situs abnormalities can help predict the probability and type of the defect. Multidetector CT (MDCT) angiography, with its multiplanar reformatting and volume rendering techniques, offers accurate information about the morphology and three-dimensional relationships of the various cardiac and extra cardiac structures. In this pictorial essay, we present the MDCT imaging findings of the spectrum of abnormalities of visceroatrial situs and cardiac position, using a third generation dual source CT scanner.

AB  - The MDS/MPN overlap syndromes are recently evolved entities that have been quite difficult to define since their discovery. They have overlapping features with other myeloid neoplasms such as MDS and MPN, which further complicates the task of their diagnosis. The unravelling of their molecular pathogenesis by recent diagnostic innovations was of paramount significance in understanding the mechanism of these syndromes. The identification of the major genetic pathways implicated in their pathogenesis not only will help in their diagnosis, but also will enable development of targeted molecular therapy as well as prognostic markers. This review discus the basic molecular aberrations in MDS/MPN overlap syndromes and their possible future implications.

AB  - Aims: To confirm non-inferiority of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) once-daily (OD) versus insulin glargine (IGlar) U100 OD + insulin aspart (IAsp) OD for HbA(1c) after 26 weeks, and compare efficacy and safety between groups at W26 + W38.
   Methods: A 38-week, randomised, open-label, treat-to-target (HbA(1c) < 7.0%) trial in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (on basal insulin +/- oral antidiabetic drugs; HbA(1c) 7.0-10.0%). Randomisation (1:1): IDegAsp or IGlar U100 + IAsp. Intensification to IDegAsp twice daily (BID) was permitted at W26 + W32, or with additional IAsp injections at W26 (maximum IAsp BID) or W32 (maximum IAsp three-times daily).
   Results: For W0-W26, mean percentage-change (standard deviation) HbA(1c) was: IDegAsp, -1.1 (0.9); IGlar U100 + IAsp, -1.1 (0.8); estimated treatment difference: 0.07% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.06; 0.21) confirmed non-inferiority. At W26 and W38, target HbA(1c) achievement, and mean fasting and postprandial glucose were similar across groups. At W38, more subjects achieved target HbA(1c) without hypoglycaemia with IDegAsp (22.5%) than with IGlar U100 + IAsp (21.1%), with significantly fewer nocturnal episodes (W0-W38, estimated rate ratio: 0.61 [95% CI: 0.40; 0.93]). Safety profiles were similar across treatment groups throughout.
   Conclusions: IDegAsp OD/BID are effective treatment intensification options versus multiple injection basal-bolus therapies, achieving similar glycaemic control, with significantly less nocturnal hypoglycaemia.

TI  - Pathomechanism of iris sphincter tear
T2  - MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
AB  - Traumatic iris sphincter tear has been thought to occur secondary to anteroposterior compression of the globe with defined forces lead to equatorial expansion and active pull along the corneoscleral junction and sphincter tear. However, here in this report, we elaborate the additional forces involved in the traumatic rupture of the sphincter pupillae muscle. During the anteroposterior compressive forces along the globe, the corneal deformation beyond certain limits leads to the development of sudden displacement forces within the anterior chamber. Aqueous within it which is in continuous circulation with a posterior narrow pupillary aperture as its entrance, find the path of least resistance that is along the pupillary orifices leading to an expulsive drive to displace the fluid through this small aperture. During this process, the horizontally oriented mechanical stretching forces appear to be the main cause of pupillary sphincter tear.

AB  - Background: Acute ischemic stroke therapy is time sensitive, and optimum treatment is missed due to pre-hospital and/or in-hospital delay.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective observational (before and after) study was conducted for 1 year. The study period was defined as phase-I or pre-education phase, phase-II or immediate post-education phase, and phase-III or delayed post-education phase, with each phase lasting for 4months. All consecutive stroke patients presenting within 12 hours of stroke onset were enrolled. Baseline and outcome data including acute stroke care quality matrices and functional outcomes were collected.
   Results: A total of 264 patients were enrolled. All acute stroke care quality matrices improved significantly (P <= 0.01) with a median door to imaging time (DTI) of 114, 35, and 47 minutes in the three phases consecutively. In phase-II, proportions of patients imaged within 25 minutes of arrival increased by 35%. Mean door to needle (DTN) time were 142 +/- 49.7,63.7 +/- 25.1, and 83.9 +/- 38.1 minutes in the three consecutive phases. Patients with DTN < 60 minutes of arrival increased by 63%. Modified Rankin score (mRS) at 3 months improved significantly in all ischemic stroke patients (P = 0.04) and patients with mRS of 0-2 increased by 22%.
   Conclusions: Stroke education to emergency department (ED) staff is an effective method to improve acute stroke care.

AB  - Objective: To delineate the metabolism involved in oral submucous fibrosis progression towards carcinogenesis by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
   Methods: The proposed study was designed using H-1-NMR by comparing the metabolites in the serum sample of oral suhrnmenoc fihrncic (n = 911) compared to the normal group (n = 20) using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Various statistical analysis like multivariate statistical analysis, Principle component analysis, Partial least squares Discriminant Analysis, Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to analyze potential serum metabolites.
   Results: The results generated from the principle component analysis, partial least squares discriminant analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis are sufficient to distinguish between oral submucous fibrosis group and normal group. A total of 15 significant metabolites associated with main pathways were identified, which correlated with the progression of cancer. Up-regulation of glucose metabolism-related metabolites indicated the high energy demand due to enhanced cell division rate in the oral submucous fibrosis group. A significant increase in lipid metabolism-related metabolites revealed the reprogramming of the fatty acids metabolic pathway to fulfilling the need for cell membrane formation in cancer cells. On the other hand, metabolites related to choline phosphocholine, the metabolic pathway was also altered.
   Conclusion: Our findings could identify the differentiating metabolites in the oral submucous fibrosis group. Significant alteration in metabolites in the oral submucous fibrosis group exhibited deregulation in metabolic events. The findings reported in the study can be beneficial to further explain the molecular aspects that lead to the progression of oral submucous fibrosis towards carcinogenesis.

AB  - Purpose: Most people with epilepsy live in low- or middle-income countries (LMICs) where there are relatively few doctors. Over 50% of people with epilepsy in these countries are untreated so other models of care are needed. In this report we evaluate a novel model of care.
   Methods: We trained four residents of Myagdi, a rural district in Nepal as epilepsy field workers (EFWs). They provided epilepsy awareness to their communities. When they identified someone with possible epilepsy they used a smartphone application (app) to determine the probability score for an episode being epileptic and contacted an epilepsy specialist by phone. If the specialist thought treatment was indicated this was arranged by the EFW. We recorded mortality, change of diagnosis at face-to-face consultation and drug-related events as measures of safety. Seizure frequency and general wellbeing were also recorded, and a questionnaire was devised to measure satisfaction.
   Results: 112 patients with app scores suggesting epileptic seizures were identified and managed in 18 months, of whom 15 had provoked seizures. Forty-three percent of epilepsy patients were untreated. At follow-up one had died of a cause other than epilepsy. Diagnostic agreement at face-to-face assessment was 93%. Overall 5% had side-effects of medication. Seizures were stopped in 33% and reduced in 57%. Ninety-six percent of patients preferred this service to travelling to other doctors.
   Conclusion: This novel service met all criteria of safety and was effective in reducing frequency of seizures. Patients preferred it to conventional services. It should be transferable to other LMICs.

AB  - Introduction: Blindly administered bilateral (B/L) superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) blocks, have been used to decrease the perioperative stress response of endoscopic laryngosurgeries. Use of ultrasound (USG) for giving these blocks is more likely to be successful, with fewer complications. We evaluated the efficacy of USG guided B/L SLN block in decreasing perioperative cough, sore-throat and hoarseness of voice.
   Material and methods: This study was conducted on forty patients undergoing endoscopic laryngosurgery under GA. Patients were randomized into two groups of 20 patients each. Patients in group C received GA, whereas those in group L received USG-guided SLN block bilaterally with 2.5 ml of 2% lignocaine, along with GA. Postoperative cough, sore throat and hoarseness of voice was measured at 30 min, 2 h, 4 h and 24 h following transfer to post-anesthesia care unit.
   Results: Patients receiving SLN block had significantly lower incidence of perioperative cough (20% in group L vs 90% in group C; p value - 0.0001) as well as sore throat (5% in group L vs 95% in group C; p value - 0.0001). In these patients, severity of hoarseness of voice was greater in the early postoperative period (100% in group L vs 70% in group C; p value - 0.027), while it decreased significantly at 24 h postoperatively(0.0% in group L vs 30% in group C; p value - 0.027).
   Conclusion: USG guided SLN block as an adjuvant to GA resulted in better recovery profile of the patients with significant reduction in postoperative cough, sore throat and hoarseness of voice.

AB  - Introduction: The incidence of arsenic (As)-induced toxicity is increasing steadily all over the globe. Consumption of As-contaminated water is the chief source of exposure to As. Kidneys are important organs involved in the excretion of the final metabolized products of inorganic As (iAs) and organic As, thus becoming highly vulnerable to As-induced adverse effects. The functional and morphological maturation of kidneys during the gestational period continues to a variable extent into the early postnatal period and accordingly, the vulnerability to As exposure is increased manifold during postnatal period. Material and Methods: The present study aimed to assess the function and morphology of the developing kidney of rats exposed to sodium arsenite (Na As O2) (1.5 mg/kg body weight [bwt] intraperitoneally) from postnatal day 1-28. On day 29, the perfusion fixed kidney tissue was processed for paraffin embedding, whereas fresh kidney tissue was processed for biochemical estimation of reduced glutathione (GSH). Blood samples were collected intracardially for the assessment of serum urea and creatinine levels. Results: Functional deficits were reflected by increased levels of serum urea and creatinine levels in iAs-exposed animals. The GSH levels in the renal tissue of experimental animals showed a significant decrease (81.20 +/- 26.79 mu g/g) as against GSH levels in controls (122.45 +/- 30.97 mu g/g). Microscopic observations revealed obliterated Bowman's capsular space with increased cellularity in the experimental group. In addition, decrease in the number as well as size of glomeruli was noted in iAs alone-treated animals. Discussion and Conclusion: The adverse effects of As have been widely studied in various organ systems in adults. Our data showed a significant alteration in kidney parameters (structural and functional) of rats exposed to Na As O2 during early postnatal period, suggesting thereby increased vulnerability of the developing kidney to As exposure. Postnatal exposure of neonatal rats to sodium arsenite induces adverse effects on developing kidney.

TI  - Knowledge and attitude towards eye donation among health professionals of northern India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. We aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of health professionals towards eye donation at an apex tertiary care centre of northern India.
   Methods. We interviewed 600 health professionals, comprising doctors, nurses, medical as well as nursing students, social workers and allied paramedical staff. A structured questionnaire (12 questions for assessing knowledge and 5 questions for assessing attitude) was used to estimate the awareness of eye donation and willingness to pledge eyes for donation. The responses pertaining to knowledge were graded as 'excellent', 'good' and 'poor' and those pertaining to attitude were grouped into 'positive' and 'negative'.
   Results. Of the 600 participants, 138 participants (23%) had 'excellent' knowledge and 234 participants (39%) had 'good' knowledge about eye donation. Awareness of eye donation was positively related to the level of literacy (odds ratio [OR] 8.5 [2.30-31.2]; p<0.001). Medical social workers and health supervisors had better knowledge about eye donation (OR 2.01 [1.08-3.72]; p = 0.026) than other professional groups. Knowledge of eye donation had no significant association with age, gender, religion, family type and marital status of the respondent. Willingness to pledge eyes for donation was observed in only 6% of the participating health professionals. Pledging of eyes for donation was higher amongolder participants (OR 7.8 [2.67-22.77]; p <0.001).
   Conclusion. Our study shows that there is sufficient knowledge about eye donation, but an alarmingly low willingness to pledge eyes for donation among health professionals. Concerted efforts are required to alter their attitude to strengthen the Hospital Cornea Retrieval Programme.

AB  - Background: Alcohol dependence (AD), characterized by profound disruptions in specific circuits of the brain is influenced by both environmental, which play a significant role in developing addiction and genetic factors, which make some individuals more susceptible to disruptions. Various polymorphisms in the neurotransmitter genes are reported to increase the risk of developing dependence. The present study aimed to identify association of serotonin and GABA polymorphisms with AD in Indian subjects.
   Method: The study group comprised of 141 AD cases recruited as per DSM IV TR criteria from the outpatient Department of Psychiatry and 110 volunteers from the general population. Clinical and family history was noted and 5 ml blood drawn for genetic studies. Polymorphisms 5-HTTLPR and STin2 of serotonin and rs2279020 and rs3219151 of the GABA pathway were analyzed and results correlated with age at first use quantity consumed, duration of use, dependence and age at onset of dependence.
   Results: The marker frequencies were similar between cases and controls except for rs3219151. 5-HTTLPR was significantly associated with high AUDIT scores and alcohol intake (p < 0.0001), GABA A rs2279020 and rs3219151 with age at first use (p < 0.0001); rs2279020 with higher AUDIT score (p = 0.002) and rs3219151 with quantity (p = 0.0001). High frequency of GABRA6 rs3219151 TT genotype in AD and its association with lower age at first use, higher intake/day, and higher duration of dependence appears to confer risk.
   Conclusions: This preliminary study, though on a smaller sample size, suggests an association of 5-HTTLPR and GABA A receptor polymorphisms with AD in our population.

KW  - Dermal cell suspension
KW  - dermal mesenchymal stem cells
KW  - volume restoration
KW  - THERAPY
KW  - SKIN
AB  - Background: Available options for correction of facial volume loss, such as synthetic fillers, autologous fat and cultured fibroblasts, have limitations viz. temporary effect and high cost.
   Aim: To assess the use of a novel technique, autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension transplantation, for correction of localized facial volume loss due to inflammatory pathologies.
   Methods: It was a pilot study conducted in the Dermatology Outpatient Department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. Autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension was transplanted in a total of 10 patients, out of which 5 had predominantly dermal loss and the rest had predominantly lipoatrophy. The donor tissue from the gluteal region was digested into a single cell suspension using collagenase-1 and injected into the recipient area. The outcome was assessed subjectively by patients and investigators and objectively using ultrasonography. Cell count, viability testing and measurement of mesenchymal stem cells were also done.
   Results: On assessment of patients, the median improvement in the predominantly dermal atrophy group at 3 and 6 months was 70% (range: 10-90%) and 80% (range: 0-90%), respectively, and in the predominantly lipoatrophy group, 0% (range: 0-40) and 0% (range: 0-50), respectively. Mean thickness of dermis + subcutis at the baseline was 1.835 mm (range: 0.89-6.04 mm), which increased to 2.912 mm (range: 0.88-7.07 mm, P = 0.03) at 6 months.
   Limitations: Our pilot study has some limitations such as small sample size and heterogeneity of the recruited patients.
   Conclusions: Autologous non-cultured dermal cell suspension transplantation appears to be safe and effective in localized facial dermal defects because of inflammatory pathologies, but not effective in deeper defects.

AB  - Purpose
   The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) play a crucial role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and over-expression of it increase cytokines which promote cancer. Among four isoforms, p38 alpha has been well studied in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other cancers as a therapeutic target p38 delta has recently emerged as a potential disease-specific drug target. Elevated serum p38 alpha level in HNSCC was reported earlier from our lab. This study aims to estimate the levels of p38 MAPK-isoforms in the serum of HNSCC and design peptide inhibitor targeting the same.
   Materials and Methods
   Levels of p38 MAPK isoforms in the serum of HNSCC and healthy controls were quantified by surface plasmon resonance technology. The peptide inhibitor for p38 MAPK was designed by molecular modeling using Grid-based Ligand Docking with Energetics tools and compared with known specific inhibitors.
   Results
   We have observed highly elevated levels of all four isoforms of p38 MAPK in serum of HNSCC patients compared to the control group. Further, serum p38 alpha, p38 beta, and p38 delta levels were down regulated after therapy in follow-up patients, while p38 gamma showed no response to the therapy. Present study screened designed peptide WFYH as a specific inhibitor against p38 delta. The specific inhibitor of p38 delta was found to have no effect on p38 alpha due to great structural difference at ATP binding pocket.
   Conclusion
   In this study, first time estimated the levels of p38 MAPK isoforms in the serum of HNSCC. It can be concluded that p38 MAPK isoforms can be a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HNSCC and p38 delta as a therapeutic target.

AB  - Background: The goal of surgery in case of a large vestibular schwannoma is complete excision of tumor and preservation of facial nerve function. The identification and preservation of facial nerve is very difficult during surgery, particularly in case of large tumors. This prospective randomized study was conducted to find out the effectiveness of preoperative facial nerve diffusion tensor imaging tractography (DTI) to predict location of the nerve and preservation of facial nerve function in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas.
   Materials and Methods: In this prospective randomized study, we recruited 100 patients with a large vestibular schwannoma(>3cm). After initial scrutiny, 94 patients were randomized based on a computer generated chart. In group I, preoperative DTI was done and the operating surgeon was informed about the position of facial nerve preoperatively. In group II, DTI was not done. The facial nerve preservation rates and clinical outcome at follow up was compared between the two groups.
   Results: Out of 94 patients, there were 47 patients in group I (DTI group) and 47 patients in group II (Non DTI group). In DTI group, 40 patients were left for comparison after the exclusion criteria was applied. Preoperative DTI predicted that the facial nerve position was concordant with its intraoperative position in 39 patients (97.5% concordance). Facial nerve preservation rates were statistically significant in group I (DTI group) (P value = 0.002).
   Conclusion: The study establishes the role of preoperative DTI tractography for better facial nerve preservation in surgery for large vestibular schwannomas (>3 cm).

AB  - Introduction: Recent advances in the molecular biology of adult diffuse gliomas have brought about a paradigm shift in their diagnostic criteria, as witnessed in the World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 guidelines for central nervous system tumors. It is now mandatory to perform several molecular tests to reach a definitive integrated diagnosis in most of the cases. This comes with additional cost and higher turnaround time, which is not always affordable in developing countries like India. In addition, the non-uniform distribution of advanced research and diagnostic testing centers adds to the difficulty.
   Methods: The Indian Society of Neuro-oncology (ISNO) multidisciplinary expert panel consisting of neuropathologists, neurosurgeons, and radiation/medical oncologists convened to prepare the national consensus guidelines for approach to diagnosis of adult diffuse gliomas.
   Results: Algorithms for arriving at an integrated diagnosis of adult diffuse gliomas predominantly using immunohistochemistry and with minimum possible additional molecular testing were agreed upon, thus addressing the problems of cost, accessibility, and turnaround time. Mandatory and optional tests were proposed for each case scenario.
   Conclusion: This document represents the consensus of the various neuro-oncology disciplines involved in diagnosis and management of patients with adult diffuse gliomas. The article reflects a practical adaptation of the WHO recommendations to suit a resource constrained setup.

AB  - The allelic family of HLA-A*02 with a repertoire of approximately 1022 alleles represents the predominant and most heterogeneous group at the HLA-A locus. This remarkable diversity signifies its evolutionary relevance. Its population-specific diversity is attributed to environmental factors and pathogen pressure and can be harnessed in biology and medicine, particularly in disease association and for HLA-based vaccination approaches. We therefore investigated the HLA-A*02 repertoire in two North Indian caste populations, viz Punjabi Khatries (PK, N = 250), Kashmiri Brahmins (KB, N = 160) and a Central Indian tribe Sahariya (ST, N = 100) using Luminex-based high-resolution rSSO method. When required, results were confirmed with high-resolution PCR-SSP and/or next-generation sequencing (NGS). In the three populations evaluated, HLA-A*02 was observed with an overall high phenotypic/allelic frequency, however, A*02 repertoire differed among them. A total of six alleles were observed (A*02: 01,*02: 03,*02: 05,*02: 06,*02: 07 and*02: 11) in the caste groups, compared with four (except*02: 05 and*02: 07) in the tribals. Our striking observation was the high occurrence of A*02: 11 at the repertoire level (80.6% in ST, 39% in PK, 31.8% in KB). Globally, this allele is rare, observed with low frequencies in limited ethnic groups. The primordial A*02: 01 allele, representative A*02 allele in most ethnicities was observed as the second predominant allele (PK = 27.3%, KB = 31.8% and ST = 11.9%). Extremely high occurrence of A*02: 11 in ST may be representation of ancient Austro-Asiatic genetic pool. In caste populations, the observed A*02 repertoire may be a consequence of natural selection and/or admixture from different populations.

AB  - Coronary artery fistulas are rare cardiac conditions which constitute a subgroup of anomalies of the coronary arteries. Though majority are asymptomatic, they may be associated with high prevalence of late symptoms and complications. Accurate identification of the fistulas, their hemodynamic significance and associated conditions generally influence management strategies. Dual source computed tomographic evaluation is valuable in delineating its precise morphology with identification and characterization of associated anomalies, thereby assisting in mapping the ideal treatment option.

AB  - The treatment of choice for cases of comeal opacity with significant cataract is often a triple procedure. However, in certain situations the chances of graft survival are poor, for example in cases with deep vascularization, secondary glaucoma, and healed viral keratitis. Under these circumstances, performing cataract surgery only might improve the visual acuity enough to maintain the patient's day-to-day activities. Performing cataract surgery, especially phacoemulsification, in these cases is challenging. Proper case selection, choosing the right technique, and a thorough idea about the difficulties and methods of tackling such cases is paramount to achieving optimum visual outcomes. In this review, we discuss the case selection and surgical modifications of performing phacoemulsification in cases with coexisting corneal opacities. (C) 2018 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Background and Aim While the prevalence of celiac disease (CD) is increasing globally, the prevalence of tropical sprue (TS) is declining. Still, there are certain regions in the world where both patients with CD and TS exist and differentiation between them is a challenging task. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to find out differentiating clinical, endoscopic, and histological characteristics between CD and TS. Methods Medline, PubMed, and EMBASE databases were searched for keywords: celiac disease, coeliac, celiac, tropical sprue, sprue, clinical presentation, endoscopy, and histology. Studies published between August 1960 and January 2018 were reviewed. Out of 1063 articles available, 12 articles were included in the final analysis. Results Between the patients with CD and TS, there was no difference in the prevalence and duration of chronic diarrhea, abdominal distension, weight loss, extent of abnormal fecal fat content, and density of intestinal inflammation. The following features were more common in CD: short stature, vomiting/dyspepsia, endoscopic scalloping/attenuation of duodenal folds, histological high modified Marsh changes, crescendo type of IELosis, surface epithelial denudation, surface mucosal flattening, thickening of subepithelial basement membrane and celiac seropositivity; while those in TS include anemia, abnormal urinary D-xylose test, endoscopic either normal duodenal folds or mild attenuation, histologically decrescendo type of IELosis, low modified Marsh changes, patchy mucosal changes, and mucosal eosinophilia. Conclusions Both patients with CD and TS have overlapping clinical, endoscopic, and histological characteristics, and there is no single diagnostic feature for differentiating CD from TS except for celiac specific serological tests.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (AI) is based on the basal and stimulated levels of serum cortisol in response to the short Synacthen test (SST). In patients with secondary AI (SAI) due to hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis defects, the SST has been validated against the insulin tolerance test (ITT), which is the gold standard. However, injection Synacthen is not easily available in some countries, and endocrinologists often use Acton-Prolongatum (intramuscular [IM] long-acting adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]) in place of Synacthen. There are no studies validating the use of IM-ACTH in children with suspected AI. We evaluated the diagnostic value of the IM-ACTH test against the ITT for the diagnosis of SAI in children.
   Methods: All children with suspected growth hormone deficiency (GHD) undergoing a routine ITT were evaluated using the IM-ACTH test within 1 week.
   Results: Forty-eight patients (36 boys/12 girls, age range: 5-14 years) were evaluated using both the ITT and the IM-ACTH test. Twenty-eight patients had a normal cortisol response (>= 18 mu g/dL, 500 nmol/L) in the ITT and 20 had low values. In patients with a normal cortisol response on the ITT, the peak value obtained after the IM-ACTH test was higher than that on the ITT (28.7 mu g/dL [+/- 8.8] vs. 23.8 mu g/dL [+/- 4.54], respectively; p = 0.0012). Compared to the ITT, the sensitivity and specificity of the IM-ACTH test for the diagnosis of SAI at cortisol cut-offs <18 mu g/dL (500 nmol/L) and <22 mu g/dL (600 nmol/L) were 57.1% and 92.8%, and 100% and 73.5%, respectively.
   Conclusions: A peak cortisol value <18 mu g/dL on the IM-ACTH test is highly suggestive of SAL whereas a value >22 mu g/dL rules out SAI.

AB  - Background & objectives: The fluoroquinolones (FQs) group of antibiotics is the backbone drugs for the management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). In routine clinical practice, drug susceptibility testing (DST) for FQs is not performed, and the patients are empirically treated. A limited information exists regarding FQs resistance among pulmonary TB cases. The present study was conducted to determine the FQs resistance among drug sensitive and drug-resistant pulmonary TB patients in a tertiary care centre in north India.
   Methods: A total of 1619 sputum/smear-positive specimens of pulmonary TB patients were subjected to DST for first-line drugs (FLDs) and second-line drugs. In addition, FQs DST was also performed using automated Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube-960 liquid culture technique. The immuno-chromatographic assay was performed to distinguish Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) from non-MTBC.
   Results: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) was isolated in 1499 sputum specimens; 1099 culture specimens were sensitive to FLDs, 249 grew as multidrug-resistant (MDR) Mtb and the remaining 151 isolates revealed any drug resistance to FLDs. While FQs monoresistance among the FLD sensitive isolates was 3.1 per cent (35/1099), 27.3 per cent (68/249) among MDR AIM isolates had additional FQs resistance.
   Interpretation & conclusions: FQs resistance among drug sensitive and MDR Mtb isolates was high in Delhi, India. Based on these findings, it is recommended that the DST for FQs should he routinely performed to avoid further amplification of drug resistance.

AB  - Since emergence of the Nipah virus (NiV) in 1998 from Malaysia, the NiV virus has reappeared on different occasions causing severe infections in human population associated with high rate of mortality. NiV has been placed along with Hendra virus in genus Henipavirus of family Paramyxoviridae. Fruit bats (Genus Pteropus) are known to be natural host and reservoir of NiV. During the outbreaks from Malaysia and Singapore, the roles of pigs as intermediate host were confirmed. The infection transmitted from bats to pigs and subsequently from pigs to humans. Severe encephalitis was reported in NiV infection often associated with neurological disorders. First NiV outbreak in India occurred in Siliguri district of West Bengal in 2001, where direct transmission of the NiV virus from bats-to-human and human-to-human was reported in contrast to the role of pigs in the Malaysian NiV outbreak. Regular NiV outbreaks have been reported from Bangladesh since 2001 to 2015. The latest outbreak of NiV has been recorded in May, 2018 from Kerala, India which resulted in the death of 17 individuals. Due to lack of vaccines and effective antivirals, Nipah encephalitis poses a great threat to public health. Routine surveillance studies in the infected areas can be useful in detecting early signs of infection and help in containment of these outbreaks.

KW  - treatment outcome
KW  - community-based active case finding
AB  - Background: Community-based active case finding (ACF) for tuberculosis (TB) implemented among marginalised and vulnerable populations in 285 districts of India resulted in reduction of diagnosis delay and prevalence of catastrophic costs due to TB diagnosis. We were interested to know whether this translated into improved treatment outcomes. Globally, there is limited published literature from marginalised and vulnerable populations on the independent effect of community-based ACF on treatment outcomes when compared to passive case finding (PCF). Objectives: To determine the relative differences in unfavourable treatment outcomes (death, loss-to-follow-up, failure, not evaluated) of ACF and PCF-diagnosed people. Methods: Cohort study involving record reviews and interviews in 18 randomly selected districts. We enrolled all ACF-diagnosed people with new smear-positive pulmonary TB, registered under the national TB programme between March 2016 and February 2017, and an equal number of randomly selected PCF-diagnosed people in the same settings. We used log binomial models to adjust for confounders. Results: Of 572 enrolled, 275 belonged to the ACF and 297 to the PCF group. The proportion of unfavourable outcomes were 10.2% (95% CI: 7.1%, 14.3%) in the ACF and 12.5% (95% CI: 9.2%, 16.7%) in the PCF group (p = 0.468). The association between ACF and unfavourable outcomes remained non-significant after adjusting for confounders available from records [aRR: 0.83 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.21)]. Due to patient non-availability at their residence, interviews were conducted for 465 (81.3%). In the 465 cohort too, there was no association after adjusting for confounders from records and interviews [aRR: 1.05 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.77)]. Conclusion: We did not find significant differences in the treatment outcomes. Due to the wide CIs, studies with larger sample sizes are urgently required. Studies are required to understand how to translate the benefits of ACF to improved treatment outcomes.

AB  - Adipocere formation depends upon multiple environmental factors. In comparison with temperate countries, it usually develops early in the subtropical climate. We have studied a retrospective data of 31 cases with adipocere formation at Department of Forensic Medicine at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Most of the cases were recovered during the month of May to October from closed rooms at home, open grounds, open forest areas, various water sources, and riverbanks. The time duration of recovery from the time of death was from 12 h to 7 days 12 h. In 10 cases, adipocere formation was seen within 2 days, and in four male cases among them, the adipocere formed within a day. Most of the bodies showing adipocere formation within 2 days were recovered from land. These facts showed that subtropical climate having hot and humid weather promotes early adipocere formation compared to temperate climate.

AB  - Fluorosis is a major health concern for people inhabiting areas with high levels of the fluoride ion (F) in the drinking water. Although the exact mechanism of F-induced pathogenesis is not clear, the role of free radicals and lipid peroxidation has been well established by various studies. The highly toxic lipid peroxidation end-product, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), is a nonprotein mediator of apoptosis and has been found to be involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. HNE binds with proteins and forms HNE-protein adducts. These adducts (products resulting from the direct addition of two or more distinct molecules) accumulate in the cellular compartments, especially the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to the disruption of various physiological functions. F is known to cause lipid peroxidation and ER stress, and we therefore hypothesized that F-induced lipid peroxidation end products may bind with proteins and, in turn, induce abnormalities in cellular function. We attempted to localize the HNE modified proteins in the F-exposed cells using immunogold labelling for transmission electron microscopy. Dietary antioxidants are recommended as a part of the recovery management programs for fluorosis and we therefore co-treated the cells with dietary antioxidants, namely ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), to investigate the protective role of these antioxidants. Our study confirmed the abundant presence of HNE conjugated proteins in the F-treated cells. Further, we found that co-treatment with the combination of the dietary antioxidants vitamins C and E was effective in protecting the cells and reducing the F-induced burden of HNE modified proteins in the cells. Our study suggests that HNE is one of the mediators of F toxicity.

TI  - Respiratory Disorders among Dust Exposed Workers
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEPAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
KW  - dust exposure
KW  - peak expiratory flow rate
KW  - respiratory disorder
AB  - Introduction: Exposure to dusts and hard physical work is common in developing industrialized countries. Acute and chronic respiratory illnesses are highly been reported from jute and textile industry. This study was undertaken to explore status of respiratory health among the workers of jute and textile industries.
   Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study enrolled 315 workers from each of textile and jute industry of Eastern Nepal. Almost all the workers were selected from the textile industry whereas those from dust prone areas of jute industry. Workers were interviewed using pre-tested questionnaires. Measurement of height, weight and peak expiratory flow rate was done.
   Results: Majority were non-smokers in both the industries 230 (73%) in jute vs. 223 (70.8%) in Textile. Most of the workers had the working experience of less than five years; jute 134 (42.5%) vs. textile 180 (57.1%). Upper respiratory disorder was found in more than 1/5 of workers (68) in jute vs. 1/20 of workers (18) in textile industry. One and two workers suffered from chronic bronchitis in the jute and the textile industry respectively. Chest tightness was reported among 4 (1.3%) in jute vs. 17 (5.4%) in textile workers, cough symptoms among 86 (27.3%) in jute vs. 26 (8.3%) in textile industry. Low practice of personal protective measure was seen in both industries. The mean score of PEFR of workers in jute mill was lower than the workers in textile industry.
   Conclusions: Workers with acute respiratory disorders were more in the jute industry while chest tightness was more in the textile industry. Chronic respiratory problems did not appear to be alarming in both the industries. Use of personal protective measures should be promoted among the dust exposed workers.

TI  - Absence of Nonclassical Monocytes in Hemolytic Patients: Free Hb and NO-Mediated Mechanism
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH
AB  - In a recent work, we have described the kinetics among the monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of hemolytic patients including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and sickle cell disease (SCD). After engulfing Hb-activated platelets, classical monocytes (CD14(+)CD16(-)) significantly transformed into highly inflammatory (CD14(+)CD16(hi)) subsets in vitro. An estimated 40% of total circulating monocytes in PNH and 70% in SCD patients existed as CD14(+)CD16(hi) subsets. In this study, we show that the nonclassical (CD14(dim)CD16(+)) monocyte subsets are nearly absent in patients with PNH or SCD, compared to 10-12% cells in healthy individuals. In mechanism, we have described the unique role of both free Hb and nitric oxide (NO) in reducing number of nonclassical subsets more than classical monocytes. After engulfing Hb-activated platelets, the monocytes including nonclassical subsets acquired rapid cell death within 12h in vitro. Further, the treatment to monocytes either with the secretome of Hb-activated platelets containing NO and free Hb or purified free Hb along with GSNO (a physiological NO donor) enhanced rapid cell death. Besides, our data from both PNH and SCD patients exhibited a direct correlation between intracellular NO and cell death marker 7AAD in monocytes from the peripheral blood. Our data together suggest that due to the immune surveillance nature, the nonclassical or patrolling monocytes are encountered frequently by Hb-activated platelets, free Hb, and NO in the circulation of hemolytic patients and are predisposed to die rapidly.

AB  - Both levamisole and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) prevent relapses in patients with frequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome; however, their efficacy has not been compared prospectively. This single-center, randomized, open-label trial enrolled 149 children ages 6-18 years with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome. Participants were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive therapy with MMF (750-1000 mg/m(2) daily) or levamisole (2-2.5 mg/kg on alternate days) for 1 year; prednisolone was discontinued by 2-3 months. In intention-to-treat analyses, the frequency of relapse was similar between participants treated with MMF and levamisole (mean difference -0.29 relapses/patient-year; 95% confidence interval -0.65, 0.08). Relapse rates declined to almost one-third of baseline for both treatment groups. Therapy with MMF was not superior to levamisole in terms of the proportions of participants with sustained remission (40.8% vs. 34.2%), frequent relapses (14.5% vs. 16.4%), or treatment failure, a composite outcome of frequent relapses, steroid resistance, or significant steroid toxicity (15.8% vs. 20.6%). These outcomes were also similar in time to event analyses. Changes in anthropometry and blood pressure were similar between the groups, and the rates of adverse effects were low in both groups. Flow cytometry in 32 participants demonstrated similar proportions of B cells and CD4+, CD8+, T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, and T regulatory (Treg) cells during follow-up. Therapy with MMF was not superior to levamisole in the frequency of relapses, likelihood of sustained remission or corticosteroid sparing in children with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Introduction: There have been a number of studies reporting on psychopathology of schizophrenia from South Asia, with the last study being reported about twenty five years back. The present study reports the clinical profile and frequency of symptoms in patients with schizophrenia and discusses the changing trends in psychopathology.
   Material and Method: Three hundred and thirty two patients with schizophrenia, aged 16-55, diagnosed as per DSM-IV-TR, were assessed for psychopathology on operational criteria OPCRIT checklist. The findings were compared with the previous studies on psychopathology of schizophrenia reported from South Asia.
   Results: Delusions (82.8%) followed by hallucinations (69.9%) were the most frequent psychopathology. First rank symptoms (FRS) were present in about three fourth of the subjects. Third person auditory hallucinations (68.6%) were the most common and thought echo (2.9%) was the least common FRS. One FRS was present in 31.7%, two in 24.7%, three in 17.7% and four in 6.8% of the subjects having FRS. A comparison with studies A comparison revealed that the prevalence of FRS were inbetween those reported in studies from Pakistan and India but higher than in the samples evaluated in Sri Lanka.
   Conclusion: Delusions and hallucinations with persecutory themes and FRS continue to be a common symptom in patients with schizophrenia.

TI  - Smokeless Tobacco Use is "Replacing" the Smoking Epidemic in the South-East Asia Region
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Background The sustained anti-tobacco campaign initiated in response to the mounting evidence against tobacco smoking has driven tobacco companies and smokers to look for alternative choices, such as smokeless tobacco (SLT) products. If this strategy advances, it could undermine several gains made by the campaign over the years. Our objective was to examine the trends in the prevalence of different tobacco types in three countries (Bangladesh, India, and Nepal) of South-East Asia.
   Methods Data from national surveys were used to estimate the trends of weighted and age-standardized prevalence (along with 95% CI) of different tobacco products. The share of each tobacco type was then calculated as a percentage of total tobacco use for each time point and country.
   Results In all the three countries, smoking prevalence declined (by 6% in Bangladesh, 3% in India, and 7% in Nepal) but SLT use increased (by 3% in Bangladesh, 6% in India, and 4% in Nepal) over the study period. SLT use increased irrespective of whether the total tobacco use increased or decreased. The share of SLT as a percentage of total tobacco use increased from 15% to 19% among Bangladeshi men, from 46% to 61% in India, and from 29% to 41% in Nepal.
   Conclusions In South-East Asia, a clear shift in the product preference from smoking to SLT was noted. Misleading advertising by tobacco companies may be responsible for the increase in the SLT prevalence, which is as harmful as smoking. Countries should strengthen policies to restrict SLT usage and prevent the rise of its use.
   Implications It has been documented that the smoking prevalence has been declining in most countries of the South-East Asia region where effective anti-tobacco laws have been implemented. But, due to a number of factors, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco has been increasing steadily, making the entire anti-tobacco movement less effective in terms of reducing the tobacco-attributable disease burden. In this context, this study has provided a detailed comparative analysis of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use and smoking in three countries of the SEAR where such data were available. It can be clearly seen that the preference for smoking has shifted towards the smokeless tobacco in all the three study countries. This study recommends that tobacco control interventions should be aligned with the changing dynamics of the tobacco epidemic, and the need of the hour is placing restrictions of smokeless tobacco use so as to drive forward the gains of the anti-tobacco movement.

AB  - Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery was performed in a case of posttraumatic cataract with six clock hours subluxation and vitreous in the anterior chamber (AC). Femtosecond laser pretreatment allowed a closed-chamber creation of corneal incisions, capsulotomy, and lens fragmentation with minimal sudden lens-diaphragm movements and zonular stress. Integrated imaging systems allowed customization of the size and position of capsulotomy and nuclear fragmentation, based on the extent and site of subluxation. Presence of vitreous in AC did not hamper femtosecond laser application. Triamcinolone-assisted vitrectomy was performed before phacoemulsification and after implanting the intraocular lens (IOL). Postoperative uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 with a stable IOL.

AB  - The infarct size-limiting effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) is abrogated by hyperlipidaemia. Previously, it has been shown that statins restore the early effect of IPC which may be due to the increased level of adenosine whereas the late effect of IPC with statin treatment in hyperlipidaemic subjects is not known. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effect of pravastatin on myocardial infarct size limiting response of the late phase of preconditioning in hyperlipidaemic rats. In present study, the cardioprotective effect of late phase of IPC was abolished by hyperlipidaemia which is restored by the pravastatin treatment. However, this observed cardioprotection was significantly attenuated by the CPDX, adenosine A1 antagonist noted in terms of increase in myocardial injury. Thus, it is suggested that pravastatin restores the cardioprotective effect of late phase of IPC in hyperlipidaemic heart which may be due to the increased endogenous production of adenosine.

AB  - Background & objectives: Microsurgical reconstruction for idiopathic obstructive azoospermia is a challenging procedure, and selection of appropriate patients is important for successful outcomes. This prospective study was done to evaluate the ability of scrotal ultrasound measurements to predict the surgical feasibility and determine factors that could predict a patent anastomosis following vaso-epididymal anastomosis (VE) in men with idiopathic obstructive azoospermia.
   Methods: In this prospective study, men diagnosed with idiopathic obstructive azoospermia, scheduled for a longitudinal intussusception VE, underwent a scrotal ultrasound measurement of testicular and epididymal dimensions. During surgery, site and type of anastomosis, presence of sperms in the epididymal fluid and technical satisfaction with the anastomosis were recorded. All men where VE could be performed were followed up for appearance of sperms in the ejaculate. Ultrasound parameters were compared between men who had a YE versus those with negative exploration. Predictive factors were compared between men with or without a patent anastomosis.
   Results: Thirty four patients were included in the study conducted between September 2014 and August 2016 and a VE was possible in only 19 (55%) patients. Of these 19 patients, six had a patent anastomosis with one pregnancy. Preoperative ultrasound measurements could not identify patients where a VE could not be performed. Motile sperm in the epididymal fluid was the only significant predictor of a successful anastomosis.
   Interpretation & conclusion: Forty five per cent of men planned for a VE for idiopathic obstructive azoospermia could not undergo a reconstruction. Ultrasound assessment of testicular and epididymal dimensions could not predict the feasibility of performing a VE. The presence of motile sperms in the epididymal fluid was the only significant predictor of a patent VE in our study.

AB  - Objective: Factor VII deficiency is the commonest of the rare bleeding disorders with limited knowledge on clinical profile. The objective of this study was to study the prevalence and clinico-hematological profile of factor VII-deficient patients. Methods: It is a retrospective observational study of probable inherited factor VII deficiency covering 18 months. Their clinical profile, family history, investigation and treatment records were studied in detail. Results: The study group comprised of total 12 factor VII deficiency cases with mean age of 17.5 years of onset of symptoms. The commonest symptom was menorrhagia (41.6%) followed by epistaxis (25%) and easy bruisability (16.6%). These 12 patients when categorized according to bleeding severity: severe bleeding - 2, moderate bleeding - 3, mild bleeding - 6 and asymptomatic - 1. All cases had prolonged prothrombin time (PT) with mean PT of 35.4 & seconds (range 18-50 & seconds) and mean prolongation of PT from upper limit of normal - 19.4 & seconds (range 2-34 & seconds). Factor VII levels ranged from < 1-40% in these patients. Clinical symptoms were not in concordance with factor levels. Of 12 patients, required treatment other than local measures. Discussion and Conclusion: Inherited factor VII deficiency is the commonest autosomally inherited factor deficiency with marked variation in the age of presentation and clinical symptoms. The laboratory results in form of PT and factor VII levels do not correlate with the severity of clinical presentation. A comprehensive evaluation to exclude acquired causes of factor VII deficiency, e.g. obesity, liver diseases, vitamin K deficiency and acquired inhibitors is required before labeling it as inherited in the absence of family history and molecular studies.

AB  - Retinal angiomas are rare tumors that develop within the vascular bed of the retina. Their occurrence may be sporadic or as part of the multisystem disorder called von Hippel-Lindau disease. It is well established in literature that retinal angiomas have a natural history of evolving as small aneurysmal dilatations and progressing to vision-threatening retinal detachments. Several approaches to the management of these angiomas have been reported in the literature, but it is difficult to decipher which modality is best suited for which type of angioma. A classification of retinal angiomas is proposed herein. A classification system may help in developing future guidelines for the study, screening, treatment, and prognostication of patients with retinal angiomas. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - People suffering from malnutrition become susceptible to the infection like Leishmania sp., as it results in a compromised immune response. Retinoic acid (RA), an important constituent of nutrition, shows an immune-modulatory activity. However, its role in the containment of infection is not yet ascertained, particularly in case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL patients (n=10) and healthy endemic controls (n=9) were recruited to measure the serum levels of RA. An in vitro model of Leishmania infection using the murine m cell line J774.1 was used to investigate the RA-synthesizing enzymes (RALDH-1 and RALDH-2). Parasite loads among infected m were measured by quantitative expression of kDNA in the presence of an inhibitor of the RALDH-2 enzyme. We found a significant decrease in the serum levels of RA in VL cases. Importantly, we observed decreased levels of RALDH-1 and RALDH-2 among L. donovani-infected m phi along with simultaneous decrease as well as increase in the Th-1 and Th-2-associated factors, respectively. Furthermore, the pretreatment of m phi with an RALDH-2 inhibitor improved parasite in vitro infection. Our findings show impaired RA pathway among infected m phi and indicate that an intact RA pathway is critical for anti-Leishmania immune response.

AB  - Purpose: Adipose tissue dysfunction is at the center of metabolic dysfunctions associated with obesity. Through studies in isolated adipocytes and mouse models, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in the adipose tissue has been shown to regulate high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels in the circulation and insulin sensitivity at both adipose tissue and whole-body levels. We aimed to explore the possible link between ABCA1 expression in the adipose tissue and metabolic derangements associated with obesity in humans.
   Patients and methods: This exploratory study among individuals who were lean (body mass index [BMI]: 22.3 +/- 0.34 kg/m(2), n=28) and obese (BMI: 44.48 +/- 5.3 kg/m(2), n=34) compared the expression of ABCA1, adiponectin and GLUT4 (SLC2A4) in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and adipose tissue insulin resistance (adipo-IR) were used as insulin resistance markers.
   Results: Visceral adipose tissue from individuals who were obese had significantly lower ABCA1 (P=0.04 for mRNA and protein) and adiponectin (P=0.001 for mRNA) expression compared to that from lean individuals. Subcutaneous adipose tissue did not show any significant difference in the expression. When individuals were divided into insulin-sensitive (IS) and insulin-resistant (IR) groups based on HOMA-IR, IR individuals had lower ABCA1 (P=0.0001 for mRNA and P=0.009 for protein) expression compared to IS individuals in visceral adipose tissue, but not in subcutaneous adipose tissue. The difference was significant after adjusting for age, gender and BMI. ABCA1 mRNA expression in visceral adipose tissue correlated negatively with both HOMA-IR (r=-0.44, P=0.0003) and adipo-IR (r=-0.35, P=0.005) after adjusting for age, gender and BMI. ABCA1 expression in either visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue did not have any significant correlation with HDL cholesterol levels or mean adipocyte area.
   Conclusion: Obesity and insulin resistance are associated with lower expression of ABCA1 in visceral adipose tissue in humans.

AB  - Vascular neurology is witnessing unprecedented innovations in the management of acute ischemic stroke, especially in reperfusion strategies. The emergence of mechanical thrombectomy with new generation devices has revolutionized the treatment of acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion. The reperfusion strategies are evolving with the extension of the window period for thrombolysis and endovascular therapy through the concept of "tissue clock" in addition to the established "time clock." The newer generation of thrombolytic drugs like tenecteplase are promising exciting times ahead in acute stroke care. In this "viewpoint,'" the evolution of reperfusion therapy in acute ischemic stroke will be discussed followed by recent innovations in reperfusion strategies.

AB  - Background: Salt fortification with iron is a potential strategy to increase population-level iron intake. The current evidence regarding double-fortified salt (DFS) in improving iron nutrition status is equivocal. Objective: To study the efficacy of DFS as compared to iodine fortified salt (IS) in improving iron nutrition status. Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing DFS and IS until August 2016 were systematically searched across multiple databases to assess for change in mean hemoglobin (Hb), prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency (ID), ID anemia (IDA), serum ferritin, and serum transferrin receptor (TfR). Meta-analysis was performed using R software. Results: Of the initial 215 articles retrieved using the predetermined search strategy, data from 10 comparisons of DFS and IS across 8 randomized controlled trials are included. There was significant heterogeneity across included studies and the studies were of low to very low quality as per GRADE criteria. DFS significantly increased mean Hb by 0.44 g/dl (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.16, 0.71) and significantly decreased anemia (risk difference -0.16; 95% CI: -0.26, -0.06) and ID (risk difference -0.20; 95% CI: -0.32, -0.08) as compared to IS. There was no statistically significant difference in change in ferritin levels (mean difference 0.62 mu g/L; 95% CI: 0.12, 1.37), serum TfR levels (mean difference -0.23 mg/dL; 95% CI: -0.85, 0.38), and IDA (risk difference -0.08; 95% CI: -0.28, 0.11). Conclusion: DFS is a potentially efficacious strategy of addressing anemia as a public health problem at population level. There is a need for effectiveness trials before DFS can be scaled up in program mode at population level.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary training in any surgical practice starts with tissue handling and effective hemostasis. Neurosurgical procedures start with an incision in the scalp and require summative use of mechanical hemostats and bipolar coagulation to achieve hemostasis. Though Raney clips are the most popular and effective in maintaining hemostasis, their high cost and nonreusability become deterrents for routine use in resource-stricken environments. -
   METHODS: We have compared stationery binder clips of different sizes with Raney clips on the parameters of effectiveness, availability, and cost. Binder clips were also used in intraoperative settings for scalp hemostasis. The comparative efficacy, additional usage of cautery, and need for sterilization are also discussed.
   RESULTS: We describe our experience with simple stationery metal binder clips in maintaining effective hemostasis in a cost-effective manner. The 25-mm size binder clip exerts same force as a Raney clip without any tissue injury. Practical application revealed effective scalp hemostasis up to blood pressure of 150 mm Hg.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stationery binder clips are a cost-effective, ready-to-use alternative for standard Raney clips.
