AB  - Introduction: Extraventricular neurocytoma is a rare neuronal tumor arising outside the ventricles. However, because of its rarity, its optimum treatment remains undefined.
   Materials and Methods: We intended to perform an individual patient data analysis to examine the patterns of care and prognostic factors involved in the treatment of extraventricular neurocytomas. PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were searched with the following MeSH terms: "Neurocytoma, Extra ventricular neurocytoma, Spinal neurocytoma AND treatment, Survival" to find all possible publications pertaining to EVN.
   Results: From 108 publications, we retrieved 201 patients of extraventricular neurocytoma. Their median age was 30 years (range: 0.6-78 years). Sixty seven patients were in the pediatric (age <= 20 years) age group. There was a bimodal age distribution. Surgical details were available for 132 cases, and 51.5% underwent a gross total resection whereas 41.7% underwent a subtotal resection. Adjuvant radiation was used in 40% cases. For the entire cohort, the median progression free survival was 77 months (53.3-100.7). However, we could not find an impact of any of the prognostic factors on survival.
   Conclusion: An extraventricular neurocytoma is a very rare disease with varied presentations and different sites of origin. Gross total resection remains the standard of care. Adjuvant radiation may be used for salvage. However, radiation therapy after subtotal resection of an atypical neurocytoma may be administered.

AB  - Background: There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in India. Molecular mechanisms suggest a strong relationship between vitamin D and growth factors. However, there is a paucity of literature with regard to a relationship between insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and vitamin D particularly in subjects with VDD. The objective of the study was to assess the relationship between growth factors and serum vitamin D-parathormone (PTH) status in school girls and study the impact of vitamin D supplementation on growth factors in pre-pubertal girls with VDD.
   Methods: Our study subjects were apparently healthy school girls aged 6-18 years. The baseline height, weight, body mass index (BMI), pubertal status, serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD), PTH, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were assessed in 847 girls aged 6-18 years and in 190 pre-pubertal girls with VDD following supplementation.
   Results: The mean age, BMI and serum 25OHD of girls were 11.5 +/- 3.2 years, 18.7 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2) and 9.9 +/- 5.6 ng/mL, respectively. VDD was observed in 94.6% of girls. Unadjusted serum IGF-1 levels and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio were significantly higher in girls with severe VDD as compared to girls with mild-to-moderate VDD. However, these differences disappeared when adjusted for age, height or sexual maturation. The serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels increased-significantly post supplementation with vitamin D.
   Conclusions: There were no differences in serum IGF-1 levels and the IGF-1/IGFBP-3 molar ratio among VDD categories when adjusted for age, height and sexual maturation in girls. Vitamin D supplementation resulted in a significant increase in serum IGF-1 levels in VDD pre-pubertal girls.

KW  - ORAL-HEALTH
AB  - Dental caries is one of the most prevalent disease (about 50%) in children across the globe. If not treated in time, it can affect not only the mastication function but also the speech, smile and psychosocial environment and the quality of life of the child and the family. The treatment of dental diseases is very expensive in all countries and prevention is very simple and effective. The caries in children below 6 y is called early childhood caries (ECC). It is most commonly caused by milk bottle or mother's feed during night. The ECC spreads very fast and can cause severe pain, abscess, swelling, fever and psychological disturbances in children. The treatment of ECC requires multiple appointments and still the prognosis is not very promising in mutilated dentitions. A physician or pediatrician can easily identify early caries and habits of parents leading to caries and can counsel them for prevention and refer them to the specialist. Good oral hygiene, dietary modification with respect to use of sugar and sticky food and healthy diet can help in preventing this disease in children. The need of the time is to appraise all on the methods of dental caries prevention.

AB  - Background An understanding of the trends in tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality is crucial to tracking of the success of tuberculosis control programmes and identification of remaining challenges. We assessed trends in the fatal and non-fatal burden of tuberculosis over the past 25 years for 195 countries and territories.
   Methods We analysed 10 691 site-years of vital registration data, 768 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 361 site-years of mortality surveillance data using the Cause of Death Ensemble model to estimate tuberculosis mortality rates. We analysed all available age-specific and sex-specific data sources, including annual case notifications, prevalence surveys, and estimated cause-specific mortality, to generate internally consistent estimates of incidence, prevalence, and mortality using DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. We assessed how observed tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality differed from expected trends as predicted by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite indicator based on income per capita, average years of schooling, and total fertility rate. We also estimated tuberculosis mortality and disability-adjusted life-years attributable to the independent effects of risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes.
   Findings Globally, in 2015, the number of tuberculosis incident cases (including new and relapse cases) was 10.2 million (95% uncertainty interval 9.2 million to 11.5 million), the number of prevalent cases was 10.1 million (9.2 million to 11.1 million), and the number of deaths was 1.3 million (1.1 million to 1.6 million). Among individuals who were HIV negative, the number of incident cases was 8.8 million (8.0 million to 9.9 million), the number of prevalent cases was 8.9 million (8.1 million to 9.7 million), and the number of deaths was 1.1 million (0.9 million to 1.4 million). Annualised rates of change from 2005 to 2015 showed a faster decline in mortality (-4.1% [-5.0 to -3.4]) than in incidence (-1.6% [-1.9 to -1.2]) and prevalence (-0.7% [-1.0 to -0.5]) among HIV-negative individuals. The SDI was inversely associated with HIV-negative mortality rates but did not show a clear gradient for incidence and prevalence. Most of Asia, eastern Europe, and sub-Saharan Africa had higher rates of HIV-negative tuberculosis burden than expected given their SDI. Alcohol use accounted for 11.4% (9.3-13.0) of global tuberculosis deaths among HIV-negative individuals in 2015, diabetes accounted for 10.6% (6.8-14.8), and smoking accounted for 7.8% (3.8-12.0).
   Interpretation Despite a concerted global effort to reduce the burden of tuberculosis, it still causes a large disease burden globally. Strengthening of health systems for early detection of tuberculosis and improvement of the quality of tuberculosis care, including prompt and accurate diagnosis, early initiation of treatment, and regular follow-up, are priorities. Countries with higher than expected tuberculosis rates for their level of sociodemographic development should investigate the reasons for lagging behind and take remedial action. Efforts to prevent smoking, alcohol use, and diabetes could also substantially reduce the burden of tuberculosis. Copyright (c) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The cell and extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions play a very important role during angiogenesis. Remodeling of the extracellular matrix along with pro-angiogenic/anti-angiogenic factors, and matrix degrading proteases, accounts for endothelial cell growth, migration, and tube formation. However, for studying angiogenesis, only limited and expensive biomaterials are available. Despite being biocompatible, inexpensive, and easy availability; the potential of goat tendon collagen (GTC) has never been explored for vascular tissue engineering applications. Hence, the current investigation was focused on evaluating GTC as an alternative matrix for HUVEC microtissue-based angiogenesis. HUVEC microtissues (MTs), synthesized via hanging drop method, were subjected to angiogenesis in GTC-human fibrin (HF) hydrogels. Sprouting tip cells originated from the MTs within 24 h. Further, comprehensive in vitro study and in vivo validation revealed that, endothelial media with FBS and growth factors, 24 h old HUVEC MTs of 500 cells, seeded at 200 aggregates/cm(3) in GTC-HF gel of 100 Pa elastic modulus, resulted in most optimal angiogenesis with intact lumen that was stable up to a week, without any supporting cells. Although early to predict, GTC-HF matrix may serve as a potential ECM for engineering complex and functional tissues of clinical relevance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Study objective: To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided combined pectoral nerve blocks land II in patients scheduled for surgery for breast cancer.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, control trial.
   Setting: Operating rooms in a tertiary care hospital of Northern India.
   Patients: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to II adult women, aged 18-70 years were enrolled in this study.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized into two groups (30 patients in each group), PECS (P) group and control (C) group. In group P, patients received both general anesthesia and ultrasound guided combined pectoral nerve blocks (PECS land II). In group C, patients received only general anesthesia.
   Measurements: We noted pain intensity at rest and during abduction of the ipsilateral upper limb, incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting; patient's satisfaction with postoperative analgesia and maximal painless abduction at different time intervals in both groups.
   Main results: There was significant decrease in the total amount of fentanyl requirement in the in P group {(140.66 +/- 31.80 mu g) and (438 +/- 71.74 mu g)} in comparison to C group {(218.33 +/- 23.93 mu g) and (609 +/- 53.00 mu g)} during intraoperative and post-operative period upto 24 h respectively. The time to first analgesic requirement was also more in P group (4433 +/- 17.65 min) in comparison to C group (10.36 +/- 4.97 min) during postoperative period. There was less limitation of shoulder movement (pain free mobilization) on the operative site at 4 hand 5 h after surgery in P group in comparison to C group. However there was no difference in the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting (22 out of 30 patients in group P and 20 out of 30 patients in group C) but patients in group P had a better satisfaction score with postoperative analgesia than C group having a p value of <0.001 (Score 1; 5 VS 20; Score 2; 12 VS 9; Score 3; 13 VS 1).
   Conclusions: Ultrasound guided combined pectoral nerve blocks are an effective modality of analgesia for patients undergoing breast surgeries during perioperative period. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mutations in the components of the minor spliceosome underlie several human diseases. A subset of patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency (IGHD) harbors mutations in the RNPC3 gene, which encodes the minor spliceosome-specific U11/U12-65K protein. Although a previous study showed that IGHD patient cells have defects in U12-type intron recognition, the biochemical effects of these mutations on the 65K protein have not been characterized. Here, we show that a proline-to-threonine missense mutation (P474T) and a nonsense mutation (R502X) in the C-terminal RNA recognition motif (C-RRM) of the 65K protein impair the binding of 65K to U12 and U6atac snRNAs. We further show that the nonsense allele is targeted to the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, but in an isoform-specific manner, with the nuclear-retained 65K long-3'UTR isoform escaping the NMD pathway. In contrast, the missense P474T mutation leads, in addition to the RNA-binding defect, to a partial defect in the folding of the C-RRM and reduced stability of the full-length protein, thus reducing the formation of U11/U12 di-snRNP complexes. We propose that both the C-RRM folding defect and NMD-mediated decrease in the levels of the U11/U12-65K protein reduce formation of the U12-type intron recognition complex and missplicing of a subset of minor introns leading to pituitary hypoplasia and a subsequent defect in growth hormone secretion.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to study the development of early and late organ failure (OF) and their differential impact on mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP).
   Methods Consecutive patients (N = 805) with acute pancreatitis were included in an observational study. Organ failure was categorized as primary if it occurred early due to pancreatitis per se and secondary if it occurred late due to infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN). Primary outcome was a relative contribution of primary OF, secondary OF, and IPN to mortality.
   Results Of the 614 patients (mean age, 38.8; standard deviation, 14.6 years; 430 males) in a derivation cohort, 274 (44.6%) developed OF, with 177 having primary OF and 97 secondary OF due to sepsis. Primary OF caused early mortality in 15.8% and was a risk factor for IPN in 76% of patients. Mortality in patients with primary OF and IPN was 49.5% versus 36% in those with IPN and secondary OF (P = 0.06) and 4% in those with IPN but without OF (P < 0.001). The results of the 191 patients in the validation cohort confirmed the relative contribution of primary and secondary OF to mortality.
   Conclusion Primary and secondary OF contributed to mortality independently and are distinct in their timing, window of opportunity for intervention, and prognosis.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel and an affordable lower limb prosthesis to enable normal gait kinematics for trans-femoral amputees. The paper details the design of a passive prosthesis with magneto-rheological (MR) damping system and electronic control. A new control approach based on plantar insole feedback was employed here. Strategically placed sensors on the plantar insole provide required information about gait cycle to a finite state controller for suitable action. A proportional integral (PI) based current controller controls the required current for necessary damping during gait. The prosthesis was designed and developed locally in India keeping in view the cost, functionality, socio-economic, and aesthetic requirements. The prototype was experimentally tested on a trans-femoral amputee and the results are presented in this work. The implementation of the proposed design and control scheme in the prototype successfully realizes the notion that normal gait kinematics can be achieved at a low cost comparable to passive prostheses. The incurring cost and power expenditure of the proposed prosthesis are evaluated against passive and active prostheses, respectively. The commercial implications for the prosthesis were explored on the basis of recommendations of ISPO Consensus Conference on Appropriate Prosthetic Technology in Developing Countries. The key objective of this work is to enable lucid design for development of an affordable prosthesis in a low-resource setting.

AB  - Telephonic Barthel Index (BI) assessment is less time-consuming and more feasible than a face-to-face interview. The aim of this study was to test the validity as well as reliability of the BI administered by telephone in comparison with face-to-face assessment in a multi-centric study. The study was conducted during the course of a randomized controlled trial in which 120 patients with subacute strokes from five teaching hospitals from different parts of India were recruited. Central telephonic follow-up and face-to-face assessment of BI and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 and 6 months were done by trained and certified blinded researchers. Kappa or weighted kappa (wK) was estimated. Sensitivity and specificity at various cutoff levels of telephonic BI were calculated. Concurrent validity of the telephonic BI was assessed by correlating it with the mRS and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scales (NIHSS) at 3 and 6 months. We observed high sensitivity and specificity at various cutoff levels of BI. Moderate to substantial agreement was observed between the two methods at 6 months wK 0.72 (95% CI 0.70-0.77). Item-wise and center-wise kappa also reflected substantial agreement. The study shows that telephonic assessment of activities of daily living with the BI in moderate to severely disabled stroke patients is valid and reliable compared to face-to-face assessment. Our study shows that telephonic assessment requires smaller sample size compared to face-to-face assessment of BI.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder seen in neurological practice, but the diagnosis and management is challenging. The diagnosis is clinical and sometimes difficult, considering a large number of motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. The medical management of PD patients is difficult, as choices of drugs are limited and levodopa is the mainstay of treatment. However, levodopa-induced dyskinesia ( LID) is commonly seen in Parkinson's disease patients treated with levodopa. This side effect is usually encountered after a long duration of treatment, but occasionally, this may be seen even after a few days or months of treatment. Different types of surgical approaches, including unilateral pallidotomy and deep brain stimulation, have given very good results in PD patients, who cannot be managed by medications alone.

AB  - Background: Pineal gland lesions usually present with central precocious puberty. Case characteristics: A 3 1/2 -yr-old boy presented with precocious puberty. Clinically and biochemically, it was gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) independent. Serum and CSF beta-hCG levels were increased. Thin section magnetic resonance imaging of brain revealed a pineal gland tumor. Outcome: He received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and responded well. Message: CSF beta-hCG should be measured in all cases of peripheral precocity, and if CSF beta-hCG is elevated, thin section magnetic resonance imaging of brain should be considered.

AB  - Context: Evidence-based research on psycho-oncology in last three decades lays emphasis upon the critical role of psychological services for better illness adjustment, improved quality of life, reduced distress and cognitive problems among the rapidly increasing pediatric cancer population.
   Justification: This review aims to summarize the evidence-based psychological interventions in childhood cancer over the two decades and addresses the wide gap that existed between intervention studies worldwide and India, thus highlighting the need for research and appropriate services.
   Evidence acquisition: We searched electronic databases such as MedLine, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Key search terms were pediatric cancer, psycho-oncology, children with cancer + psychological intervention, or multimodal treatment, psychotherapy, cognitive training, behavioral, social skills+ feasibility study, pilot, randomized controlled trial, case study, systematic reviews.
   Results: 28 full papers published between 1996 to 2016, including survivors and under-treatment children below 18 years, were reviewed. Various types of key interventions were psychosocial, physical, cognitive behavioral, cognitive, music art therapy and play therapy. Generally, intervention settings were either hospital or home, and were designed to promote psychological well-being. Psychological interventions were more in customised formats in these studies. A generic intervention module was not available for replication.
   Conclusion: Development of culture-specific generic intervention module and using the same in randomized control studies with larger effect size are needed in India for larger coverage of patients.

AB  - Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G), a non-classical, class Ib molecule, has been shown to mediate immunoregulatory functions by inducing apoptosis, inhibits cytotoxicity and differentiation by modulating cytokine secretion. Due to its immune-suppressive function, it facilitates tolerance in feto-maternal interface and transplantation. In contrary, it favours immune evasion of microbes and tumors by inhibiting immune and inflammatory responses. In Tuberculosis (TB), we previously reported differential expression of HLA-G and its receptor Ig-like transcript -2 (ILT-2) in disseminated vs. localized Tuberculosis. The present study explores the impact of HLA-G inhibition on the function of T cells and monocytes, in TB Pleural Effusion (PE), a localized form of TB. Blocking of HLA-G resulted in significant increase in IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production by CD3(+) T cells. Additionally, we observed that HLA-G influences the apoptosis and cytotoxic effect of T cells from TB-PE patients. Next, we checked the impact of interaction between HLA-G and ILT-4 receptor in monocytes derived from TB-PE patients upon blocking and observed significant increase in IFN-gamma production. The present study reveals for the first time HLA-G mediated suppression of Th1 cytokines, especially, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in TB-PE patients.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate and prompt microbiological diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is crucial for successful antimicrobial treatment. Studies have shown the diagnostic utility of sonication of explanted implants in total joint arthroplasty but all did not use consensus statements for defining PJI. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of culture of samples obtained by sonication of explanted implants compared with periprosthetic tissue cultures (PTC) for the diagnosis of PJI using Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) consensus criteria. We also assessed the utility of culture of sonicate fluid for determining the microbial profile of PJI compared with standard culture methods.
   Materials and methods: Forty consecutive revision arthroplasty cases were enrolled. Three to five periprosthetic tissue samples were obtained during each explant procedure. The 40 explanted implants were collected in sterile containers and sonicated under sterile conditions. MSIS criteria were used for the definition of PJI.
   Results: Twenty - seven patients had PJI and thirteen were aseptic failures. Of the PJI cases, there were nine cases of early PJI's, 10 of delayed PJI's and eight of late PJI's. Twenty-five (92.5%) of the twenty-seven patients with PJI, had positive cultures in the sonicate fluid of implants and in 18 (66.7%) of them cultures of the periprosthetic tissues were also positive. Both PTC and SFC cultures of implants were negative in all the 13 cases of aseptic failure. Sensitivity of sonicate fluid culture (SFC) of implants was greater than PTC (92.5% vs. 66.7%), P = .02. The specificity of both was 100%. The incidence of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was nearly equal by both methods. However, SFC showed an increased ability to detect Gram-positive pathogens which was evidenced by better recovery of coagulase-negative staphylococci.
   Conclusions: Sonication of explanted implants is a simple and valuable microbiological technique and its routine use improves the diagnostic sensitivity of PJI.

AB  - The objective of the current study was to characterize and evaluate the functional importance of the Nucleoside Transporters (NTs) in the cornea of the rabbits. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used for the molecular characterization of the NTs. Their functionality was evaluated using two substrates, ribavirin and cytarabine. Dipyridamole was used as a blocker for the study. All the treatments were given topically. Molecular characterization of NTs revealed presence of cnt1, cnt2, cnt3 and cnt3 in the cornea. The concentration vs time profile for cytarabine in Aqueous Humor (AH) exhibited a statistically significant (p < 0.05) drop at 1 h with blocker pretreatment. The mean AUC(0-2) between the treatments was also differing in a significant (p < 0.05) manner. The concentration vs time profile for ribavirin in AH also showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in its concentration at 1 h with blocker pretreatment. Dipyridamole was able to block ribavirin's entry with as low as 40 nM concentration while complete blockade was achieved at 8 mM and above. When cytarabine and ribavirin were co-administered, ribavirin at a concentration of 6.5 mM significantly inhibited (p < 0.05) the transcorneal permeation of cytarabine up to 80%. To conclude, this study showed the presence and functional importance of NTs in the transcorneal uptake of nucleoside substrates. This study further revealed the presence of concentration dependent competitive inhibition among substrates for their transcorneal permeation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study compared lower limb muscle flexibility between amateur and trained female Bharatanatyam dancers and nondancers.
   METHODS: Subjects consisted of 105 healthy female volunteers, with 70 female Bharatanatyam dancers (35 trained, 35 amateurs) and 35 controls, with a mean (+/- SD) age of 16.2 +/- 1.04 yrs, height 155.05 +/- 4.30 cm, and weight 54.54 +/- 2.77 kg. Participants were assessed for range of motion (ROM) in hip flexion, hip extension, hip abduction and adduction, hip external rotation, hip internal rotation, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle dorsiflexion (DF), and ankle plantar flexion (PF) by using a standardized goniometer. To assess for significant difference between groups, one-way ANOVA was applied, and multiple comparisons were made using Bonferroni correction.
   RESULTS: Trained dancers had a significantly greater hip flexion, extension, abduction, and external rotation ROM than amateurs and nondancers (p<0.05). Also, internal rotation and adduction were markedly less in trained dancers (p<0.05). Knee flexion, extension, and ankle DF were higher and ankle PF ROM was lesser in trained dancers. However, not much variation was found in ankle DF and PF between amateur dancers and nondancers (p>0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Results showed that there are significant differences in lower limb muscle flexibility between trained and amateur Bharatanatyam dancers and nondancers. These differences may be due to individual dance postures such as araimandi and muzhumandi.

AB  - Ocular chemical burns are an ophthalmic emergency and are responsible for 11.5%-22.1% of ocular injuries. Immediate copious irrigation is universally recommended in acute ocular burns to remove the offending agent and minimize damage. Conventional medical therapy consists of the use of agents that promote epithelialization, minimize inflammation, and prevent cicatricial complications. Biological fluids such as autologous serum, umbilical cord blood serum, platelet-rich plasma, and amniotic membrane suspension are a rich source of growth factors and promote healing when used as adjuncts to conventional therapy. Surgical treatment of acute ocular burns includes the debridement of the necrotic tissue, application of tissue adhesives, tenoplasty, and tectonic keratoplasty. Amniotic membrane transplantation is a novel surgical treatment that is increasingly being used as an adjunct to conventional treatment to promote epithelial healing, minimize pain, and restore visual acuity. Various experimental treatments that aim to promote wound healing and minimize inflammation are being evaluated such as human mesenchymal and adipose stem cells, beta-1,3 glucan, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, cultivated fibroblasts, zinc desferrioxamine, antifibrinolytic agents, antioxidants, collagen cross linking, and inhibitors of corneal neovascularization.

AB  - Background: Dyslexia is one of the common problems seen in children worldwide. There is high co-morbidity of dyslexia with attentional and behaviour problems which could have familial pattern. This study aims to compare the attentional and behavioural problems in children with dyslexia and their first-degree relatives with controls. Methods: This is a cross-sectional comparative study with single interview method in an out-patient setting. Formally diagnosed (ICD-10) cases of 30 children with specific reading disorder and 30 healthy matched controls and their first-degree relatives were assessed using scales in a single setting after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
   Results: The children with dyslexia had significantly more problems in the domains of selective attention and behavioural problems as compared to controls and the siblings of the cases had significant problems in selective attention but not in behavioural problems. Also, no difference was seen in ADHD symptoms of parents in cases and controls.
   Conclusion: The results from our study are keeping with most of the published literature. We expect that this study will help in laying a good foundation for further studies with stronger methodologies incorporating molecular genetics.

AB  - Introduction: Currently, neoplasms of the trachea and lower airway demand open transcervical approach with or without thoracotomy. We describe here a novel, minimally invasive approach for an intraluminal lesion of the thoracic trachea, called percutaneous trans-tracheal endoscopic approach (PTEA). Apart from obvious advantages over potentially morbid open procedures, this technique has certain peculiar benefits over rigid or flexible bronchoscopic approach. Materials and Methods: A 43-year-old male patient had glomus tumor of thoracic trachea. After detailed workup and informed written consent, he was taken up for percutaneous trans-tracheal excision under general anesthesia. The foremost step of the procedure is awake fiberoptic guided intubation, using the microlaryngeal tracheal tube, followed by elective tracheotomy. Subsequently, the lower end of the microlaryngeal tube was carefully pushed further inside the trachea so that the cuff of the tube lies distal to the tumor. The cuff is then inflated so that the operating area is sealed off from lower airway to aid continuous inhalational anesthesia and to prevent aspiration of blood. The surgeon sitting at the head end removed the tumor through tracheotomy under endoscopic guidance. After achieving absolute hemostasis, neck wound was closed. Results: Patient had complete removal of the tumor without any aspiration intraoperatively or in the postoperative period. The anesthetic agent could be delivered uninterrupted through the secured airway, below the operative area separated by sealed cuff of the microlaryngeal tube. Conclusions: For excision of benign luminal lesions of the lower trachea, the novel approach of PTEA has many distinct and fool proof advantages in comparison to the transoral laryngoscopic/bronchoscopic and the transcervical approaches.

AB  - Mortalin, a mitochondrial chaperone, plays a crucial role in reducing toxicity of Lewy bodies. Earlier studies had reported that Mortalin level gets downregulated in astrocytes and other brain tissue samples in Parkinson's disease (PD). This study aims to estimate the Mortalin concentration in serum and correlate with alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) in PD. The concentration of Mortalin and alpha-Syn in serum samples of 38 PD patients and 33 control group (CG) individuals was quantified by surface plasmon resonance. The receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted to develop it as blood-based protein marker. The expression of Mortalin in serum was validated by western blot. The Mortalin level was found to be declined in PD patients (1.98 +/- 0.53 ng/A mu L) in comparison with CG individuals (3.13 +/- 0.48 ng/A mu L), whereas alpha-Syn level was found to be elevated in PD patients (38.20 +/- 4.22 ng/A mu L) than CG individuals (34.31 +/- 3.23 ng/A mu L) in serum. The statistical analysis revealed the negative correlation between Mortalin and alpha-Syn. This preliminary study summarized that Mortalin plays a significant role in PD with negative correlation with alpha-Syn. This study provides a new paradigm for the development of Mortalin as a potent serum protein marker for diagnosis of PD.

AB  - BackgroundDespite a large number of studies, the ideal technique of pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ) after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) remains debatable. We compared the two most common techniques of PJ (duct-to-mucosa and dunking) in a randomized trial.
   MethodsThis open-label randomized trial was done at a tertiary care center from January 2009 to October 2015. Patients with resectable periampullary tumours with a pancreatic duct diameter 2mm, requiring PD were randomly assigned to one of the two techniques using computer generated random numbers. The primary outcome was postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) rate and secondary outcomes were frequency of other postoperative complications.
   ResultsA total of 193 patients were randomized and analyzed (intention-to-treat analysis), 97 in duct-to-mucosa and 96 in dunking group. Both groups were comparable for baseline demographic and clinical profiles. The incidence of POPF in the entire study group was 23.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (24.7% vs 22.9%, P=0.71). Similarly, the incidence of grades B and C (clinically significant) POPF was comparable (16.5% vs 13.5%, P=0.57). Both groups were comparable with respect to the secondary outcomes.
   DiscussionThe duct-to-mucosa technique of PJ after PD is not superior to the dunking technique with respect to POPF rate. (CTRI/2010/091/000531)

AB  - The human MOF (hMOF) protein belongs to the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases and plays a critical role in transcription and the DNA damage response. MOF is essential for cell proliferation; however, its role during replication and replicative stress is unknown. Here we demonstrate that cells depleted of MOF and under replicative stress induced by cisplatin, hydroxyurea, or camptothecin have reduced survival, a higher frequency of S-phase-specific chromosome damage, and increased R-loop formation. MOF depletion decreased replication fork speed and, when combined with replicative stress, also increased stalled replication forks as well as new origin firing. MOF interacted with PCNA, a key coordinator of replication and repair machinery at replication forks, and affected its ubiquitination and recruitment to the DNA damage site. Depletion of MOF, therefore, compromised the DNA damage repair response as evidenced by decreased Mre11, RPA70, Rad51, and PCNA focus formation, reduced DNA end resection, and decreased CHK1 phosphorylation in cells after exposure to hydroxyurea or cisplatin. These results support the argument that MOF plays an important role in suppressing replication stress induced by genotoxic agents at several stages during the DNA damage response.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) and dystonia are common indications for the deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure. It is very important to be diligent about target localization and execution of the procedure. The single most important predictor of a good postoperative outcome is proper patient selection. The various steps of performing DBS include taking a preoperative non - stereotactic MRI, stereotactic frame fixation, fusion of MRI with stereotactic CT scan images, planning of the target and trajectory, lead placement at target through the planned trajectory, implantation of pulse generator/battery and programming of the implanted device. Utmost care and precision are required to execute the procedure, which decide the final outcome of the surgical procedure.

AB  - The mammalian heme peroxidases including lactoperoxidase (LPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) contain a covalently linked heme moiety. Initially, it was believed that the heme group was fully cross-linked to protein molecule through at least two ester linkages involving conserved glutamate and aspartate residues with 1-methyl and 5-methyl groups of pyrrole rings A and C respectively. In MPO, an additional sulfonium ion linkage was present between 2-vinyl group of pyrrole ring A of the heme moiety and a methionine residue of the protein. These linkages were formed through a self processing mechanism. Subsequently, biochemical studies indicated that the heme moiety was partially attached to protein. The recent structural studies have shown that the covalent linkage involving glutamate and 1-methyl group of pyrrole ring of heme moiety was partially formed. When glutamate is not covalently linked to heme moiety, its side chain occupies a position in the substrate binding site on the distal heme side and blocks the substrate binding site leading to inactivation. However, an exposure to H2O2 converts it to a fully covalently linked state with heme. Thus in mammalian heme peroxidases, the Glu-heme linkage is essential for catalytic action.

AB  - PURPOSE: The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a stool management kit (SMK) for containment of fecal incontinence in hospitalized bedridden patients.
   DESIGN: A single-group quasi-experimental study.
   SUBJECTS AND SETTING: Twenty bedridden adults who had at least 1 episode of fecal incontinence in the prior 24 hours participated in the study. The study setting was the neurological unit of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi, India.
   METHODS: The study was carried out in 2 phases. The device was placed in situ for up to 24 hours in 10 patients during phase I of the study and up to 120 hours in an additional 10 patients during phase II. Participants were assessed for anorectal injury and peripheral device leakage on a 4- to 6-hourly basis. Sigmoidoscopy was performed to evaluate for any mucosal trauma or alteration of anorectal pathology after retrieval of the device.
   RESULTS: The device was successfully placed in all patients following the first attempt to place the device; 80% of patients retained the device until planned removal. The SMK diverted fecal matter without anal leakage in 174 (93.5%) out of 186 assessment points in a group of 20 patients. The devices remained in situ for 21 +/- 0.2 and 84.5 +/- 38.9 hours during phase I and phase II, respectively. None experienced anorectal bleeding, sphincter injury, or mucosal ulceration with device usage. Post- device sigmoidoscopy revealed erythema at the site of diverter placement in 2 participants.
   CONCLUSION: Study findings suggest that the SMK successfully diverted liquid to semiformed fecal exudate without peripheral device leakage in 93.5% of bedridden patients. No serious adverse events occurred. Additional research is needed to compare its effectiveness with that of currently available intrarectal balloon devices.

AB  - A surgeon's understanding of the surgical anatomy can be greatly enhanced by the dissection of preserved cadaveric specimens. A reliable and inexpensive biological model for testing and standardization of dye injection concentrations is proposed utilizing the goat's head as a biological model. The first phase was concerned with standardization of the dye by titrating its concentration and injecting various amounts into cerebral vessels of a goat's head until an optimal concentration had been ascertained. In the second phase, this optimum concentration of the dye was injected into four human cadaveric heads following the same technique standardized using the goat's head. Upon dissecting the four cadaveric human heads which were injected with silicon dyes and preserved in 10% formalin, the vessels were all well-opacified and the brain was of near normal consistency and good for dissection, without showing any features of putrefaction. The goat model, having similar color, texture, and the handling as the cadaveric head, offers an opportunity to test indigenously manufactured polymerizing dyes in the future. This biological model, therefore, has the potential to considerably reduce the cost of cadaver preparation.

AB  - Introduction: The success of endodontic regeneration lies in the appropriate combination of stem cells and bioactive materials. Several novel dental materials are available on the market in this regard. Hence, the current study aimed to evaluate the proliferation, differentiation, and osteogenic potential of human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) onto biomaterials like ProRoot MTA (MTA; Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), Biodentine (BD; Septodont, Saint Maur de Fosses, France), and EndoSequence Root Repair Material (ERRM; Brasseler USA, Savannah, GA). Methods: Dental cements were formulated into discs and assessed for their biocompatibility. hBMSCs were used to study biocompatitibility and the proliferative and osteogenic potential of these dental cements. A live dead assay was performed using confocal microscopy to study the biocompatibility, proliferation, and cell attachment property of the cements. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay was also performed on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 to study growth kinetics. The osteogenic potential of these cements was studied by inducing hBMSCs over them using osteogenic differentiation medium (assessed by alkaline phosphatase assay). Results: ERRM and MTA have shown the best biocompatibility among the tricalcium silicate materials used with no significant difference between them. Both have shown significantly higher osteogenic bioactivity than BD. All 3 tricalcium silicate cements support good adherence of hBMSCs. Conclusions: All of the dental cements used in this study are biocompatible with the potential to induce proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Therefore, the newly introduced ERRM can be the material of choice in various endodontic applications.

AB  - To study the features of upper eyelid in healthy individual and different types of congenital ptosis in the Indian population using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Methods: This was a prospective observational study at a tertiary care center. Eyelid structure of healthy individuals with no eyelid abnormalities (n = 19); simple congenital ptosis (n = 33) cases; Marcus Gunn jaw-winking ptosis (MGJWP, n = 7) cases, and blepharophimosis-ptosis-epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES, n = 20) cases were studied on a vertical UBM scan using 50-MHz probe. Lid-thickness, tarsal-thickness, orbicularis oculi and levator-Muller-orbital septum-conjunctival (LMSC) complex were measured in primary gaze. Comparison was made between four groups and results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA test. In normal individuals, LMSC measurements were repeated in down-gaze imaging. Results: Skin with subcutaneous tissue, LMSC complex and pre-aponeurotic fat-pad appeared echodense while orbicularis oculi and tarsus appeared echolucent. In primary gaze, mean thickness (+/- standard deviation) of the eyelid, tarsus, orbicularis oculi and LMSC, respectively, were: 1.612 +/- 0.205, 0.907 +/- 0.098, 0.336 +/- 0.083, and 0.785 +/- 0.135 mm in normal individual. LMSC showed 46.64% increase in thickness on down-gaze. The mean eyelid thickness and LMSC were thicker in MGJWP and BPES as compared to normal. In different types of congenital ptosis cases, various patterns of UBM imaging were observed. Conclusion: UBM allows noninvasive imaging of eyelid structures with good anatomical correspondence in normal eyelids and study the structural alterations of eyelids in different types of congenital ptosis. UBM can be used to highlight the anatomical difference in normal eyelids that may help modify the surgery for better cosmetic outcomes. Furthermore, it has the potential to be used in preoperative evaluation and operative planning in certain types of acquired ptosis, which needs to be evaluated.

AB  - Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most lethal cancers among all gynecological malignancies. An effective and non-invasive screening approach is needed urgently to reduce high mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to identify the salivary protein signatures (SPS) for non-invasive detection of ovarian cancer. Differentially expressed SPS were identified by fluorescence-based 2D-DIGE coupled with MALDI/TOF-MS. The expression levels of three differential proteins (Lipocalin-2, indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase1 (IDO1) and S100A8) were validated using western blotting and ELISA. Immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR were performed in an independent cohort of ovarian tumor tissues. 25 over expressed and 19 under expressed (p<0.05) proteins between healthy controls and cancer patients were identified. Lipocalin-2, IDO1 and S100A8 were selected for initial verification and successfully verified by immunoassay. Diagnostic potential of the candidate biomarkers was evaluated by ROC analysis. The selected biomarkers were further validated by immunohistochemistry in an independent cohort of ovarian tissues. The global expression of selected targets was also analyzed by microarray and validated using qRT-PCR to strengthen our hypothesis. Tumor secreted proteins identified by 'dual-omics' strategy, whose concentration are significantly high in ovarian cancer patients have obvious potential to be used as screening biomarker after large scale validation.

AB  - Retinal blindness is an important cause of pediatric visual loss. Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) is one of these causes, often wrongly included in the spectrum of retinitis pigmentosa. The disease has become the center of research after initial reports of success in management with gene therapy. This review discusses in brief the clinical presentation and investigative modalities used in LCA. Further, the road to gene discovery and details of currently applied gene therapy are presented. LCA is one of the first successfully managed human diseases and offers an entirely new dimension in ocular therapeutics.

AB  - Introduction: In this study, we aimed to investigate safety and efficacy of the trochanteric flip osteotomy with surgical hip dislocation technique in selected displaced acetabular and femoral head fractures with clinico-radiological outcome and potential complications.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed 32 patients from January 2009 to June 2014. Selected displaced acetabular fractures with comminution and/or cranial extension of posterior wall, marginal impaction, intraarticular fragment, femoral head fractures and hip fracture-dislocations were operated by this modified approach of trochanteric flip osteotomy and surgical hip dislocation. Patients were evaluated for fracture reduction, femoral head viability, trochanteric union, abduction power, and functional evaluation was done by Merle d'Aubigne-Postel scoring system. Minimum follow-up was 24 months.
   Results: Reduction was judged to be anatomical in 84.38% of cases, and within 1-3 millimetres in 9.38% of cases. All osteotomies healed in an anatomical position. Heterotopic ossification was found in 2 patients limited to Brooker class I. Osteonecrosis developed in 1 patient. 2 patients developed arthritis of the hip as sequelae of poor reduction. Abduction power was MRC 5/5 in all except in 1 patient (4/5). Mean Merle d'Aubigne-Postel score was 16.18; overall good to excellent result was achieved in 87.5% of cases.
   Conclusions: Trochanteric flip osteotomy with surgical dislocation allows better intraarticular assessment, control of intraarticular fragments, assists accurate reduction and the fixation of complex acetabular and femoral head fractures, without compromising femoral head vascularity and abductor strength. This technique has provided excellent midterm results in the management of complex injuries around the hip.

AB  - Neuroimaging (NI) in Parkinson's disease (PD) includes functional techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and morphological imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transcranial sonography to probe different aspects of the neurobiology of PD. Changes in neurotransmitters in various regions of the brain and their influence on brain networks is the basis for the motor symptoms of PD which are interrogated by NI. The recent Movement Disorders Society Clinical Diagnostic Criteria for PD (MDS-PD) have included the results of a few of these neuroimaging techniques to serve as single supportive criteria or absolute exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of PD. While dopaminergic imaging is useful in the early stages of disease to differentiate the neurodegenerative versus non-degenerative causes of parkinsonism like essential tremors, it has also been used for the differential diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's disease (AD), for inclusion of PD patients into clinical trials and for evaluating response to cell-replacement therapies in PD. Metabolic patterns on F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography have been used effectively for the classification and differential diagnosis of the parkinsonian syndromes using visual and quantitative approaches. Disease related network-patterns have been used for a completely automated approach to differential diagnosis of parkinsonian syndromes on a single case basis. Structural MRI and advanced MR techniques have been used for the classification of PD and the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Thus, multimodal imaging in PD may aid in an early, accurate and objective diagnostic classification by highlighting the underlying neurochemical and neuroanatomical changes that underlie this spectrum of disorders. The present challenge in PD is to develop radioligands which could bind selectively to alphasynuclein in-vivo.

AB  - Lymphopenia is a common accompaniment of multimodal cancer therapy. As the most radiosensitive cells of the hematopoietic system, lymphocytes residing within or circulating through a radiation portal are frequently depleted by radiation therapy. The recognition that radiation-induced reduction of circulating lymphocyte counts and eventual lymphocyte infiltration of tumors have a tangible impact on overall survival outcomes has revived the interest in understanding the causes of treatment-associated lymphopenia and developing strategies to predict, prevent and ameliorate this well-documented phenomenon. In this systematic review, we have performed a comprehensive search of the literature to elucidate the studies that document a correlation between radiation-associated lymphopenia and survival outcomes in solid malignancies. We also summarize potential unifying paradigms that account for radiation-induced lymphopenia across studies and lay the groundwork for attempting to explain and/or counter this phenomenon.

AB  - Background
   Distinguishing between Crohn's Disease (CD) and Intestinal Tuberculosis (ITB) has been a challenging task for clinicians due to their similar presentation. CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) have been reported to be increased in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. However, there is no such data available in ITB. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of FOXP3(+) T cells in patients with ITB and CD and its utility as a biomarker.
   Methods
   The study prospectively recruited 124 patients with CD, ITB and controls: ulcerative colitis (UC) and patients with only haemorrhoidal bleed. Frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Tregs in peripheral blood (flow cytometry), FOXP3 mRNA expression in blood and colonic mucosa (qPCR) and FOXP3(+) T cells in colonic mucosa (immunohistochemistry) were compared between controls, CD and ITB patients.
   Results
   Frequency of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells in peripheral blood was significantly increased in ITB as compared to CD. Similarly, significant increase in FOXP3(+) T cells and FOXP3 mRNA expression was observed in colonic mucosa of ITB as compared to CD. ROC curve showed that a value of >32.5% for FOXP3(+) cells in peripheral blood could differentiate between CD and ITB with a sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 90.6%.
   Conclusion
   Phenotypic enumeration of peripheral CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells can be used as a non-invasive biomarker in clinics with a high diagnostic accuracy to differentiate between ITB and CD in regions where TB is endemic.

AB  - Women with endometriosis (EMS) appear to be at a higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases predominantly multiple sclerosis (MS). Though EMS and MS are evidently diverse in their phenotype, they are linked by a common autoimmune condition or immunodeficiency which could play a role in the expansion of endometriosis and possibly increase the risk of developing MS in women with EMS. However, the common molecular links connecting EMS with MS are still unclear. We conducted a meta-analysis of microarray experiments focused on EMS and MS with their respective controls. The GEO2R web application discovered a total of 711 and 1516 genes that are differentially expressed across the experimental conditions in EMS and MS, respectively with 129 shared DEGs between them. The functional enrichment analysis of DEGs predicts the shared gene expression signatures as well as the overlapping biological processes likely to infer the co-occurrence of EMS with MS. Network based meta-analysis unveiled six interaction networks/crosstalks through overlapping edges between commonly dysregulated pathways of EMS and MS. The PTPN1, ERBB3, and CDH1 were observed to be the highly ranked hub genes connected with disease-related genes of both EMS and MS. Androgen receptor (AR) and nuclear factor-kB p65 (ReIA) were observed to be the most enriched transcription factor in the upstream of shared down-regulated and up-regulated genes, respectively. The two disease sample sets compared through crosstalk interactions between shared pathways revealed commonly up- and down-regulated expressions of 10 immunomodulatory proteins as probable linkers between EMS and MS. This study pinpoints the number of shared genes, pathways, protein kinases, and upstream regulators that may help in the development of biomarkers for diagnosis of MS and endometriosis at the same time through improved understanding of shared molecular signatures and crosstalk.

AB  - Introduction
   Suicide is a spectrum of behavior including suicide ideation and suicidal attempt and is undoubtedly the outcome of the interaction of several factors. The role of two main constructs of human nature, aggression and impulsivity, has been discussed broadly in relation to suicide, as endophenotypes or traits of personality, in research and in clinical practice across diagnoses. The objective of our study was to assess impulsive and aggressive behaviors among primitive people of the Idu Mishmi tribe, who are known for high suicide completer and attempter rates.
   Methods
   The study group was comprised of 177 unrelated Idu Mishmi participants divided into two sets: 39 suicide attempters and 138 non-attempters. Data on demographic factors and details of suicide attempts were collected. Participants completed a set of instruments for assessment of aggression and impulsivity traits.
   Results
   In the Idu Mishimi population we screened (n = 177), 22.03% of the individuals had attempted suicide, a high percentage. The suicide attempters also showed a significant sex difference: 35.9% were male and 64.10% were female (p = .002*). The suicide attempters (A) scored significantly higher than non-attempters (NA) on aggression (A = 23.93, NA = 18.46) and impulsivity (A = 75.53, NA = 71.59, with p value = 0.05). The trait impulsiveness showed a significantly higher difference (F (1, 117) = 7.274) in comparison to aggression (F (1, 117) = 2.647), suggesting a profound role of impulsiveness in suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population. Analysis of sub-traits of aggression and impulsivity revealed significant correlations between them. Using different models, multivariate logistic regression implied roles of gender (OR = 1.079 (0.05)) and impulsiveness (OR = 3.355 (0.013)) in suicide attempts.
   Conclusion
   Results demonstrate that gender and impulsivity are strong risk factors for suicide attempts in the Idu Mishmi population.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by the presence of hypoxia, stemness and local invasiveness. We have earlier demonstrated that FAT1 promotes invasiveness, inflammation and upregulates HIF-1 alpha expression and its signaling in hypoxic GBM. Here, we have identified the role of FAT1 in regulating EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) and stemness characteristics in GBM. The expression of FAT1, EMT (Snail/LOX/Vimentin/N-cad), stemness (SOX2/OCT4/Nestin/REST) and hypoxia markers (HIF-1 alpha/VEGF/PGK1/CA9) was upregulated in >= 39% of GBM tumors (n = 31) with significant positive correlation (p <= 0.05) of the expression of FAT1 with LOX/Vimentin/SOX2/HIF-1 alpha/PGK1/VEGF/CA9. Furthermore, positive correlation (p <= 0.01) of FAT1 with Vimentin/N-cad/SOX2/REST/HIF-1 alpha has been observed in TCGA GBM-dataset (n = 430). Analysis of cells (U87MG/A172) exposed to severe hypoxia (0.2% O-2) revealed elevated mRNA expression of FAT1, EMT (Snail/LOX/Vimentin/N-cad), stemness (SOX2/OCT4/Nestin/REST) and hypoxia markers (HIF-1 alpha/PGK1/VEGF/CA9) as compared to their normoxic (20% O2) counterparts. FAT1 knockdown in U87MG/A172 maintained in severe hypoxia and in normoxic primary glioma cultures led to significant reduction of EMT/stemness markers as compared to controls. HIF-1 alpha knockdown in U87MG cells markedly reduced the expression of all the EMT/stemness markers studied except for Nestin and SOX2 which were more under the influence of FAT1. This indicates FAT1 has a novel regulatory effect on EMT/stemness markers both via or independent of HIF-1a. The functional relevance of our study was corroborated by significant reduction in the number of soft-agar colonies formed in hypoxicsiFAT1 treated U87MG cells. Hence, our study for the first time reveals FAT1 as a novel regulator of EMT/stemness in hypoxic GBM and suggests FAT1 as a potential therapeutic candidate.

AB  - We report the development of a platform for sensing bacterial growth by observing pH change via a change in fluorescence. While the platform allows for the rapid detection of bacteria it is sensitive enough to detect even similar to 10(4) CFU of bacteria. The platform can differentiate between resistant and non-resistant strains of E. coli in similar to 4 to 6 hours, which is better than currently used clinical methods.

AB  - Peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase (Pth) catalyzes the breakdown of peptidyl-tRNA into peptide and tRNA components. Pth from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbPth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized in a native unbound (AbPth-N) state and in a bound state with the phosphate ion and cytosine arabinoside (cytarabine) (AbPth-C). Structures of AbPth-N and AbPth-C were determined at 1.36 and 1.10 angstrom resolutions, respectively. The structure of AbPth-N showed that the active site is filled with water molecules. In the structure of AbPth-C, a phosphate ion is present in the active site, while cytarabine is bound in a cleft which is located away from the catalytic site. The cytarabine-binding site is formed with residues: Gln19, Trp27, Glu30, Gln31, Lys152, Gln158 and Asp162. In the structure of AbPth-N, the side chains of two active-site residues, Asn70 and Asn116, were observed in two conformations. Upon binding of the phosphate ion in the active site, the side chains of both residues were ordered to single conformations. Since Trp27 is present at the cytarabine-binding site, the fluorescence studies were carried out which gave a dissociation constant (K-D) of 3.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(-7) M for cytarabine. The binding studies using surface plasmon resonance gave a K-D value of 3.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(-7) M. The bacterial inhibition studies using the agar diffusion method and the biofilm inhibition assay established the strong antimicrobial potential of cytarabine. It also indicated that cytarabine inhibited Gram-negative bacteria more profoundly when compared with Gram-positive bacteria in a dose-dependent manner. Cytarabine was also effective against the drug-resistant bacteria both alone as well as in combination with other antibiotics.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the prevalence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and its characteristics and risk factors in children with epilepsy at a tertiary medical center in New Delhi. Children with active epilepsy, aged 6 to 12 years, were assessed for ADHD using DSM-IV-TR criteria. Epilepsy and psychiatric characteristics, sociodemographic indicators, and use of antiepileptic drugs were analyzed for differences between the ADHD and non-ADHD groups. Among the 73 children with epilepsy, 23% (n = 17) had comorbid ADHD, of whom 59% (n = 10) had predominantly inattentive type, 35% (n = 6) combined type, and 6% (n = 1) predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type. Lower IQ scores, epileptiform EEG activity, not attending school, and male sex were significantly associated with comorbid ADHD in children with epilepsy. Groups were similar in terms of age, socioeconomic indicators, family history of psychiatric disorders, seizure frequency in the last six months, seizure etiology, and seizure type. Epilepsy is a common pediatric neurological condition with frequent psychiatric comorbidities, including ADHD. Specialists should collaborate to optimize treatment for children with epilepsy and ADHD, especially for families in developing countries where the burden of disease can be great.

AB  - Osteoporosis is associated with reduced density and quality of bone leading to weakened skeleton thereby increasing the risk of fractures responsible for increased morbidity and mortality. Due to preference for western food style the consumption of salt intake in our diets has increased many folds. High dietary salt intake has recently been linked with induction of Th17 cells along with impairment of Treg cells. Also, Th17 cells have been one of major players in the pathophysiology of various bone pathologies including osteoporosis. We thus hypothesized that high salt diet (HSD) intake would lead to enhanced bone loss by modulating Th17-Treg cell balance. In the present study, we report for the first time that HSD intake in male mice impairs both trabecular and cortical bone microarchitecture along with decreasing the mineral density and heterogeneity of bones. The HSD modulates host immune system and skews Treg-Th17 balance by promoting osteoclastogenic Th17 cells and inhibiting development of anti-osteoclastogenic Treg cells in mice. HSD also enhanced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, RANKL and IL-17) and decreased the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IFN-gamma). Taken together the present study for the first time establishes a strong correlation between high dietary salt intake and bone health via interplay between Th17-Treg cells.

AB  - PURPOSE To evaluate surgical outcome of superior rectus transposition (SRT) in esotropic Duane syndrome (DS) and abducens nerve palsy.
   METHODS Retrspective medical record analysis of all patients with esotropic DS and abducens nerve palsy treated with SRT at our center with minimum follow-up of 6 months. Primary outcome measures were esotropia in primary position and abduction limitation. Secondary outcome measures included head turn, stereopsis, and cyclovertical deviations.
   RESULTS A total of 20 eyes of 19 patients were included: 9 with DS and 10 with traumatic abducens nerve palsy. One patient had bilateral esotropic DS. Mean age of DS patients was 12.5 +/- 10.1 years; of abducens nerve palsy patients, 25.4 +/- 11.3 years. Medial rectus recession (MRc) of 3.5 mm was additionally performed in 5 DS eyes. An adjustable MRc 5.6 2.2 mm with or without augmentation suture was performed in all abducens nerve palsy patients. In DS patients, esotropia improved from 27.5(Delta) +/- 5.4(Delta) to 3.6(Delta) +/- 6.4(Delta) (P < 0.001), abduction limitation reduced from 3.8 to 1.8 (P < 0.001), and head posture improved from 20 to 4 (P < 0.001) at 6 months. In abducens nerve palsy patients, esotropia improved from 51.5 +/- 18.8 to 6.1 +/- 10.7 (P < 0.001), abduction limitation reduced from -3.8 to -2, and head posture improved from 25 degrees to 8 degrees (P < 0.001). Stereopsis improved in 4 patients (P = 0.12). No patient had vertical deviation or torsional diplopia.
   CONCLUSIONS In our patient cohort with esotropic DS or abducens nerve palsy, SRT reduced esotropia and improved abduction. Because of a long-term exotropic drift, initial undercorrection in the immediate postoperative period may prevent eventual overcorrection.

AB  - Objective and design Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, exhibits anti-inflammatory property. The present study was designed to evaluate its protective effect in a rat model of colitis.
   Methods The anti-inflammatory property of roxithromycin was first validated in rat paw edema model at 5 and 20 mg/kg doses where it produced 19 and 51% inhibition of paw swelling induced by carrageenan. The efficacy of roxithromycin was evaluated at these doses in a rat model where colitis was induced by intra-colonic instillation of acetic acid. Rats were divided into six groups viz. normal control, experimental control and drug-treated groups: roxithromycin 5 and 20 mg/kg, diclofenac 10 mg/kg and mesalazine 300 mg/kg. All drugs were given orally 1 h before induction of colitis. The macro and microscopic changes, mean ulcer score, mucus content and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation were evaluated in all the groups after 24 h.
   Results Pretreatment with roxithromycin markedly decreased hyperemia, ulceration, edema and restored histological architecture. The protection afforded by roxithromycin was substantiated by dose-dependent increase in mucus content, normalization of markers of oxidative stress (GSH and TBARS) and levels of TNF-alpha, PPGE(2) and nitrite along with marked decrease in expression of NF kappa B (p65), IL-1 beta and COX-2. The protective effect of roxithromycin was found to be comparable to mesalazine while diclofenac was found ineffective.
   Conclusion Our study demonstrates that roxithromycin ameliorates experimental colitis by maintaining redox home-ostasis, preserving mucosal integrity and downregulating NF kappa B-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and suggests that it has a therapeutic potential in inflammatory conditions of the colon.

AB  - A number of research designs have been used to study the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in addictive disorders, including open label studies and randomised controlled trials. Only through a rigorously conducted research, evidence base for effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention can be established. However, research on these interventions are fraught with a number of challenges. It is imperative for researchers to ask appropriate research questions based on sound theoretical understanding of psychiatric disorders, psychosocial interventions and research designs. This would help in choosing the less studied, relevant areas for in depth study as well as in using pragmatic, realistic research designs. Defining intervention clearly is as crucial, as is its uniform implementation across various treatment arms. In addition, tapping the mediators, moderators and confounders of treatment using appropriate methods while assessing the factors that directly impact the outcome is important to determine actual effects of psychosocial intervention. Barriers at different stages must be gauged proactively and dealt with, wherever possible.

AB  - ObjectiveReliable differentiation of benign from malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy is important, especially in countries with a high tuberculosis burden. We hypothesized that specific sonographic features on endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) may differentiate benign from malignant nodes. In this study, the sonographic features of non-malignant and malignant nodes were compared.
   MethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of patients with intrathoracic lymphadenopathy who underwent EBUS-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA). Sonographic features such as nodal size, margin (distinct or indistinct), echogenicity (heterogeneous or homogeneous), and presence or absence of calcification, a central hilar structure, coagulation necrosis sign, and nodal conglomeration were recorded and compared in the 2 groups.
   ResultsDuring the study period, a diagnosis of tuberculosis (n=71), sarcoidosis (n=63), and malignancy (n=36) was made in 170 patients by EBUS-TBNA. A total of 312 lymph node stations were examined. Presence of central hilar structure (15.6% versus 4%, P=.03) and the presence of nodal conglomeration (27.5% versus 8%, P<.01) were significantly higher in benign nodes. Further, logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of well-defined nodal margins, the presence of central hilar structure, and the presence of conglomeration of lymph nodes were independent predictive factors for the diagnosis of benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
   ConclusionSonographic features of well-defined margins, presence of central hilar structure, and presence of nodal conglomeration in the lymph nodes on EBUS are predictive of benign disease.

AB  - Molecular and clinical characteristics of pediatric meningiomas are poorly defined. Therefore, we analyzed clinical, morphological and molecular profiles of pediatric meningiomas. Forty pediatric meningiomas from January 2002 to June 2015 were studied. 1p36, 14q32 and 22q-deletion were assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization and mutations of most relevant exons of AKT, SMO, KLF4, TRAF and pTERT using sequencing. Expression of GAB1, stathmin, progesterone receptor (PR), p53 along with MIB-1 LI was examined using immunohistochemistry. There were 36 sporadic and four NF2 associated meningiomas. Among sporadic meningiomas, the majority (72.2%) of cases harbored 22q-deletion. Difference in frequency of combined 1p/14q deletion in Grade-I versus Grade-II/III tumors was not significant (13.7% vs 28.5%, P=0.57). PR immunoreactivity was seen in 65.5% of Grade-I and 14.2% of Grade-II/III tumors (P=0.03). The majority (97.2%) of meningiomas were immunonegative for p53. Stathmin and GAB co-expression was observed in 58.3% of cases. Notably, AKT, SMO, KLF4, TRAF7 (exon 17) and pTERT mutations were seen in none of the cases analyzed. 1p/14q codeletion was frequent in skull base as compared to non-skull base meningiomas (23% vs 11.1%, P=0.37). All NF2 meningiomas harbored 22q-deletion and showed GAB and stathmin co-expression while none showed 1p/14q loss. Pediatric meningiomas share certain phenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics with adult counterparts, but GAB and stathmin co-expression in the majority of cases and non-significant difference in frequency of 1p/14q co-deletion between low-and high-grade meningiomas indicate an inherently aggressive nature. Characteristic AKT/SMO, KLF4/TRAF7 and pTERT genetic alterations seen in adults are distinctly absent in pediatric meningiomas.

AB  - Objective: To compare ultrasound-detected abnormalities, namely double contour sign (DCS) and hyperechoic aggregates (HAGs), at two sites (knee and first metatarsophalangeal [1st MTP] joints) versus six sites (knee joint, 1st MTP joint, radiocarpal joint, talar joint, patellar tendon and triceps tendon) in gout patients.
   Methods: Forty-seven clinically diagnosed gout patients and 50 subjects (serum uric acid < 7 mg/dL) as controls were included. DCS was looked for at three articular cartilage sites (first metatarsal, tibiotalar and femoral condyle), whereas HAGs were looked for at one joint site (radiocarpal joint) and two tendon sites (patellar tendon and triceps tendon). Ultrasound findings of both the groups were compared.
   Results: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and positive likelihood ratio (LR) of two sites ultrasound findings for gout were 87.2%, 84%, 83.7%, 85.6% and 5.5 respectively. Similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and positive LR were observed with six sites ultrasound findings. Among controls, 16% were found to have these abnormal ultrasound findings by both two sites and six sites examinations.
   Conclusion: Screening of two sites (knee and 1st MTP) has similar sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and positive LR as compared to six sites in diagnosing gout.

AB  - Addictive disorders have a strong psychosocial component in their etiogenesis, and hence psychosocial approaches form a significant part of management planning with a role in prevention, treatment, relapse prevention and long term rehabilitation. Due to a number of myths and misconceptions associated with addictive disorders, there is often strong resistance from the patients as well as the families towards treatment. The disorder is often perceived as a bad habit and hence not requiring treatment. It is very important to break this barrier to bring the patient and the family in treatment engagement. This article summarizes the need for psychosocial management of the addictive disorders, dealing with treatment resistance building therapeutic alliance, and improving the long term outcome.

Unlike in high-income countries, GHPUs in India are also the main training centers for providing postgraduate training in psychiatry and allied disciplines. Aim: This paper traces the history of the GHPUs in India from beginning to the present. Material and Methods: PubMed, old issues of the Indian Journal of Psychiatry and related sources were searched with key words general hospital and psychiatry both electronically and manually to look for the related literature. Results: The history of the development of GHPUs is discussed under 3 phases: beginning to the preindependence period, independence to the year of the launch of the National Mental Health Programme of India, and afterward. Contributions of the GHPUs towards service development, teaching, research, community awareness and reducing stigma, and their future scope are discussed. Conclusion: GHPUs have been a revolutionary development in India with great contribution in the field of mental heath.

AB  - Background & objectives: Bartonella henselae causes infections which closely resemble febrile illness and chronic diseases such as tuberculosis and haematological malignancies. There are not many studies on Bartonella infections from India. The present study was undertaken to diagnose B. henselae infection in diverse clinical conditions in a tertiary care hospital in north India.
   Methods: A total of 145 patients including those with fever and lymphadenopathy, infective endocarditis and neuroretinitis were enrolled in the study. Whole blood, serum and lymph node aspirate and valvular vegetations if available, were obtained. Samples were plated on chocolate agar and brain-heart infusion agar containing five per cent fresh rabbit blood and were incubated at 35 degrees C for at least four weeks in five per cent CO2 with high humidity. Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) was done for the detection of IgM antibodies in the serum using a commercial kit. Whole blood was used to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the citrate synthase gene (gltA).
   Results: IFA was positive in 11 of 140 (7.85%) patients and PCR was positive in 3 of 140 (2.14%) patients. Culture was negative in all the cases. A higher incidence of Bartonella infection was seen in patients with fever and lymphadenopathy (n= 30), seven of whom were children. In ophthalmological conditions, four cases were IFA positive.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The present study shows that the threat of Bartonella infection is a reality in India. It is also an important treatable cause of fever and lymphadenopathy in children. Serology and PCR are useful tests for its diagnosis. Clinicians should consider Bartonella infection in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses and chronic diseases.

AB  - A 26-year-old healthy male patient's fundus revealed findings consistent with torpedo maculopathy. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a dome-shaped elevation of the retina at the level of ellipsoid zone. On OCT angiography segmented at the level of the choriocapillaris, a cluster of convoluted fine vessels was seen, and further, deeper scans of the larger choroidal vessels showed a slower flow. From these observations along with the embryological correlation of choriocapillaris development, a possibility of an abnormality preventing proper fenestration of the choriocapillaris along the horizontal raphe being responsible for this anomaly is suggested.

AB  - Idiopathic retinal vasculitis, aneurysms and neuroretinitis (IRVAN) syndrome is a rare entity of unknown etiology for which many hypotheses have been proposed with inflammation being the most commonly accepted hypothesis. We report cases of a 9 year old girl and a 22 year old male patient with diagnosis of IRVAN syndrome. The conclusions drawn from the clinical examination and multimodal imaging including optical coherence tomography angiography of the patients are discussed. Our conclusions and interpretation point towards IRVAN being a developmental vascular anomaly rather than a consequence of inflammation. It is thus proposed to be renamed as Idiopathic retinal arteriolar aneurysm syndrome (IRAA).

AB  - BackgroundVitiligo is a multifactorial, autoimmune, depigmenting disorder of the skin where aberrant presentation of autoantigens may have a role.
   ObjectivesTo study the association of two antigen-processing genes, PSMB8 and PSMB9, with vitiligo.
   MethodsIn total 1320 cases of vitiligo (1050 generalized and 270 localized) and 752 healthy controls were studied for the PSMB9 exon 3 G/A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), PSMB8 exon 2 C/A SNP and PSMB8 intron 6 G/T SNP at site 37360 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Real-time PCR was used for transcriptional expression of PSMB8 and cytokines. Expression of ubiquitinated proteins and phosphorylated-p38 (P-p38) was studied by Western blotting.
   ResultsSignificant increases in PSMB8 exon 2 allele A (P<2.07 x 10(-6), odds ratio 193) and genotypes AA (P<1.03 x 10(-6), odds ratio 251) and AC (P<1.29 x 10(-6), odds ratio 163) were observed in patients with vitiligo. Interferon- stimulation induced lower expression of PSMB8 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cases compared with controls, suggesting impaired antigen processing, which was confirmed by accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in both lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with vitiligo. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and IL-8 - was higher in the lesional skin. P-p38 expression was variable but correlated with the amount of ubiquitinated proteins in the lesional and nonlesional skin, suggesting that the inflammatory cytokine responses in lesional skin could be a result of both P-p38-dependent and -independent pathways.
   ConclusionsThe PSMB8 exon 2 SNP is significantly associated with vitiligo. Accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in skin of cases of vitiligo suggests their aberrant processing, which may promote the development of the disease.
   What's already known about this topic?
   Antigen presentation is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders like vitiligo. Peptides presented to CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules are generated from ubiquitin-tagged cytosolic proteins, degraded by a multicatalytic, cytosolic immunoproteasome complex encoded by the PSMB9 and PSMB8 genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes may be involved in their differential expression and function, which may be detrimental for manifestation of vitiligo.
   What does this study add?
   This study highlights a significant role of PSMB8 SNPs in manifestation of vitiligo through aberrant processing of self-antigens and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the lesional and nonlesional epidermis of vitiligo. Reduced expression of PSMB8 in vitiligo peripheral blood mononuclear cells after interferon- stimulation suggests its role in inducing inflammatory responses, probably through accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins leading to reactive oxygen species production and autoinflammatory immune responses.
   What is the translational message?
   Strategies to clear the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins from the skin may result in reduced inflammation. Identification of molecules that could target the altered turnover of ubiquitinated proteins may help in designing immunotherapeutic approaches for treatment of vitiligo.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a multisystem disease affecting the predominately nervous system, followed by muscle, heart, and pancreas. Current research focused on therapeutic interventions aimed at molecular amelioration, but there are no reliable noninvasive signatures available to understand disease pathogenesis. The present study investigates the alterations of plasma cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) in FRDA patients and attempts to find the significance in relevance with the pathogenesis. Total RNA from the plasma of patients and healthy controls were subjected to miRNA microarray analysis using Agilent Technologies microarray platform. Differentially regulated miRNAs were validated by SYBR-green real-time polymerase chain reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The study identified 20 deregulated miRNAs (false discovery rate<0.01, fold change >= 2.0 <=) in comparison with healthy controls; out of which 17 miRNAs were upregulated, and 3 miRNAs were downregulated. Target and pathway analysis of these miRNAs have shown association with neurodegenerative and other clinical features in FRDA. Further validation (n=21) identified a set of significant (p<0.05) deregulated miRNAs; hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-26a-5p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-24-3p, and hsa-miR-21-5p in comparison with healthy controls. These miRNAs were reported to influence various pathological features associated with FRDA. The present study is expected to aid in the understanding of disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Catheters with inflatable balloons such as a Foley catheter may be used for feeding gastrostomy/jejunostomy. The incorrect or improper use of these catheters can have serious consequences. We report 13 cases of feeding jejunostomy with balloon-inflated catheter's malfunction, some referred to our centre and others operated here over a period of 8 years. The most dramatic consequence of such improper use led to rupture of the small intestine due to inadvertent over-inflation (over 100 ml) of the balloon of the catheter during a contrast study. The patient required a laparotomy with resection and anastomosis of the bowel. Three other patients had similar over-inflation of the balloon leading to severe pain and discomfort. In all three patients, timely deflation of the balloon was sufficient to relieve the symptoms. One patient had intussusception with the inflated balloon acting as a lead point. The patient underwent resection of the small bowel with end jejunostomy and distal mucous fistula. All other patients presented with abdominal pain and distension and intestinal obstruction and were managed non-operatively with deflation of balloon either by aspiration, cutting the balloon port or ultrasound-guided puncture of balloon. Healthcare personnel dealing with patients with indwelling catheters must be educated to suspect, detect and manage such problems. The best measure for such unusual complications of otherwise safe devices would be prevention by training and generation of awareness.

KW  - SSPE
KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly progressive degenerative disorder caused by measles virus. It is characterised by typical clinical and electrophysiological features in the form of slow myoclonic jerks, with progressive cognitive impairment, visual symptoms, and periodic complexes on EEG, with raised titres of anti-measles antibodies in CSF and serum. Atypical presentations of SSPE have been reported including brainstem involvement, ADEM-like presentation, acute encephalitis, and cerebellar ataxia. Presentation with predominant extrapyramidal features is uncommon. We describe a case of SSPE presenting with extensive rigidity with highly elevated CPK values, mimicking neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) which was most probably due to central dopaminergic blockade induced by the disease process. To our knowledge, this is the first case of SSPE presenting with a NMS-like syndrome.

AB  - Levamisole has been considered the least toxic and least expensive steroid-sparing drug for preventing relapses of steroid-sensitive idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (SSINS). However, evidence for this is limited as previous randomized clinical trials were found to have methodological limitations. Therefore, we conducted an international multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial to reassess its usefulness in prevention of relapses in children with SSINS. The efficacy and safety of one year of levamisole treatment in children with SSINS and frequent relapses were evaluated. The primary analysis cohort consisted of 99 patients from 6 countries. Between 100 days and 12 months after the start of study medication, the time to relapse (primary endpoint) was significantly increased in the levamisole compared to the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.22 [95% confidence interval 0.11-0.43]). Significantly, after 12 months of treatment, six percent of placebo patients versus 26 percent of levamisole patients were still in remission. During this period, the most frequent serious adverse event (four of 50 patients) possibly related to levamisole was asymptomatic moderate neutropenia, which was reversible spontaneously or after treatment discontinuation. Thus, in children with SSINS and frequent relapses, levamisole prolonged the time to relapse and also prevented recurrence during one year of treatment compared to prednisone alone. However, regular blood controls are necessary for safety issues.

KW  - ARGON
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) among patients with juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma (JOAG).
   Methods: Patients diagnosed with JOAG who were not controlled on medical therapy were offered a trial of SLT. The patients were followed up prospectively for 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postlaser to evaluate the efficacy of SLT as second-line therapy. Success was defined as an intraocular pressure (10P) reduction of >= 20% at 12 months without the need for further medication, laser, or surgery. Factors associated with success/failure, prelaser 10P, age, and angle dysgenesis on gonioscopy were analysed.
   Results: The average prelaser 10P in these JOAG eyes (n = 30) was 25.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, which reduced to 17.3 +/- 5.8 mm Hg at 12 months (p = 0.01). All patients were of Indian ethnicity. Out of 30 eyes, at 12 months post-SLT, 13 (43%) eyes had at least a 20% reduction in IOP. In the eyes that achieved success, the average reduction of 10P was 37.6%. There was no difference in the prelaser 10P between those with success (25.5 +/- 5.6 mm Hg) and those that failed (25.1 +/- 8 mm Hg; p = 0.8), nor was there a difference in the mean age between successful cases (34.4 +/- 9.4 years) and failures (31.6 +/- 8.9 years; p = 0.4). However, those without angle dysgenesis were 4 times (CI 1.1-15.2) more likely to succeed with SLT than those with angle dysgenesis (p = 0.03).
   Conclusions: A significant proportion of patients with JOAG can benefit from an 10P reduction after SLT. Those with gonioscopically normal-appearing angles are more likely to respond to SLT.

AB  - To determine the frequency of CYP1B1 p.E229K and p.R368H, gene mutations in a cohort of sporadic juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) patients and to evaluate their genotype/phenotype correlation.
   Unrelated JOAG patients whose first-degree relatives had been examined and found to be unaffected were included in the study. The patients and their parents were screened for p.E229K and p.R368H mutations. The phenotypic characteristics were compared between probands carrying the mutations and those who did not carry these mutations.
   Out of 120 JOAG patients included in the study, the p.E229K mutation was seen in 9 probands (7.5%) and p.R368H in 7 (5.8%). The average age of onset of the disease (p = 0.3) and the highest untreated IOP (p = 0.4) among those carrying mutations was not significantly different from those who did not have these mutations. The proportion of probands with angle dysgenesis among those with p.E229K and p.R368H mutations was 70% (11 out of 16) in comparison to 65% (67 out of 104) of those who did not harbour these mutations (p = 0.56). Similarly, the probands with moderate to high myopia among those with p.E229K and p.R368H mutations was 20% (3 out of 16) in comparison to 18% (18 out of 104) of those who did not harbour these mutations (p = 0.59).
   The frequency of p.E229K and p.R368H mutations of the CYP1B1 gene is low even among sporadic JOAG patients. Moreover, there is no clinical correlation between the presence of these mutations and disease severity.

AB  - Context.-Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has emerged as a very useful tool in the field of diagnostic respiratory cytology. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) of EBUS-TBNA not only has the potential to improve diagnostic yield of the procedure but also to triage samples for predictive molecular testing to guide personalized treatments for lung cancer.
   Objective.-To provide an overview of the current status of the literature regarding ROSE of EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung cancer.
   Data Sources.-An electronic literature search in PubMed and Google databases was performed using the following key words: cytology, lung cancer, on-site evaluation, rapid on-site evaluation, and ROSE EBUS-TBNA. Only articles published in English were included in this review.
   Conclusions.-Rapid on-site evaluation can ensure that the targeted lesion is being sampled and can enable appropriate specimen triage. If available, it should be used with EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung cancer because it can minimize repeat procedures for additional desired testing (ie, molecular studies). Some studies have shown that ROSE does not adversely affect the number of aspirations, total procedure time of EBUS-TBNA, or the rate of postprocedure complications; it is also helpful in providing a preliminary diagnosis that can reduce the number of additional invasive procedures, such as mediastinoscopy. As EBUS technology continues to evolve, our knowledge of the role of ROSE in EBUS-TBNA for the diagnosis of lung cancer will also continue to grow and evolve.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has emerged as a common and heterogeneous condition across the globe. Improved understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical features of T1DM has led to in-depth study of the condition. This review describes the classification of T1DM, as proposed by leading international bodies. It explains the importance of such a taxonomy, and proposes a novel, comprehensive clinic-etiologic rubric to classify T1DM. Such a classification based on etiological and clinical features, rather than complex investigations, should further enhance academics, clinical science, and research in T1DM.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases significantly alter the gait dynamics and, hence, various gait parameters. In this paper, we present results of a comprehensive statistical analysis of the gait time parameters, namely swing interval, stance interval, stride interval, and double support interval, in healthy individuals and patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases (Huntington's, HD, Parkinson's, PD, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS). Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) along with other tests, including univariate tests, post-hoc tests, and discriminant analysis, were employed in this study. Results of discriminant analysis demonstrated that the groups differed significantly from each other with respect to the dependent variables (P < 0.05). All the variables had a strong positive relationship with the first variate or factor, and the left swing, right swing, right stride, and left stride had a positive relationship with the second variate; the double support had a negative relationship. Results of our analyses provide a direction for the selection of certain gait parameters for automatic classification of neurodegenerative diseases based on these parameters.

AB  - Isolated choledochal cysts involving the cystic duct are rare. We present a case of a choledochal cyst involving only the proximal cystic duct, and discuss the taxonomic and therapeutic challenges. There is a need for a clearly defined classification system for these cysts as they may be categorised as either type II or type VI cysts. The optimal treatment remains debatable, with some authors recommending a bilioenteric reconstruction owing to the wide cystic duct-bile duct junction. However, we suggest that a cholecystectomy should be performed with examination of the specimen and frozen section in case of any abnormality rather than upfront bile duct excision. In addition, given the rarity of this condition and the paucity of long-term data, we recommend meticulous follow-up for development of any malignancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atlantoaxial spondyloptosis (AAS), which is defined as complete displacement of facets of atlas anterior to the facets of axis such that there is no contact between the 2 articulating surfaces, is an extremely rare manifestation of atlantoaxial instability. The reason for an extreme rarity of traumatic AAS is probably the severity of injury in traumatic AAS that is usually incompatible to life. It represents the most severe form of atlantoaxial dislocation, and complete reduction in such a case presents a real technical challenge because of the interlocking of C1-C2 facets. Cranial traction fails to achieve reduction in such cases.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: In this report, we describe a case of traumatic odontoid fracture associated with AAS and discuss our technique of complete reduction of deformity via posterior approach. An 11-year-old child presented to us 4 months after a road traffic accident with progressive spastic quadriparesis. On evaluation, displaced type II odontoid fracture with AAS was detected. The patient underwent surgery via posterior approach. The techniques of "joint manipulation" and "joint remodeling" were used to achieve complete reduction of spondyloptosis. Postoperative imaging showed complete reduction of deformity. The patient also improved neurologically after surgery.
   CONCLUSION: This case report aims to present the ability of "joint manipulation" and "joint remodeling" techniques in achieving excellent reduction in even one of the most difficult post-traumatic deformities that affect the craniovertebral junction.

TI  - Study of efficacy and safety of noncultured, extracted follicular outer root sheath cell suspension transplantation in the management of stable vitiligo
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - PLUCKED HAIR
KW  - MELANOCYTES
AB  - Background Noncultured, extracted follicular outer root sheath suspension (NC-EHF-ORSCS) is a recently introduced technique for the treatment of stable vitiligo.
   Objective To study the clinical efficacy of this technique and to determine the viability and cell composition of the suspension.
   Methods Twenty-five patients with stable vitiligo were included in this prospective study. Fifty follicles were extracted from occipital scalp and were incubated with trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to separate outer root sheath cells. The cell suspension was filtered and centrifuged to obtain a cell pellet, which was resuspended and applied to the dermabraded recipient area. Cell viability of the suspension was assessed using trypan blue staining, and markers of keratinocyte stem cells (CD200) and melanocytes (S100) were evaluated using flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry, respectively.
   Results At 6 months, the mean (+/-SD) repigmentation was 52 +/- 25.1%, and >75% repigmentation was seen in 8/25 (32%) patients. Mean percentage cell viability of the suspension was 80 +/- 17.2% with a mean concentration of CD200 + and S100 + cells being 7.91 +/- 8.68% and 9.93 +/- 1.22% (n = 3), respectively. Recipient site infection was seen in 4 of 25 (16%) patients and a color mismatch in 11 of 25 (44%) patients.
   Conclusion NC-EHF-ORS-CS is a useful minimally invasive therapy for vitiligo.

AB  - Objective: The literature on managing migraine non-responsive to pharmacological approaches and that co-occurring with depression is scanty. The comorbid condition predicts a poorer prognosis for migraine as well as depression. The present report assesses efficacy and tolerability of high frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as a treatment modality for migraine with comorbid depression.
   Methods: The current retrospective chart review assesses effectiveness of high frequency rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as a treatment modality to manage migraine occurring comorbid with depression in 14 subjects.
   Results: The mean scores on Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) and depression rating scale reduced significantly from 21.14 +/- 3.01 and 20.71 +/- 3.95 at baseline to 13.93 +/- 6.09 and 14.21 +/- 5.52 respectively, after rTMS. There was significant improvement in migraine frequency, severity and functional disability assessed using MIDAS scores (p < 0.05) following high frequency rTMS compared to baseline.
   Conclusion: There is a role of applying rTMS as a potential therapeutic modality in the integrated management of a distinct subgroup of migraine patients with comorbid depression.

AB  - ObjectiveAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are routinely withdrawn during long-term video-electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring (LTM), to record sufficient number of seizures. The efficacy of rapid and slow AED taper has never been compared in a randomized control trial (RCT), which was the objective of this study.
   MethodsIn this open-label RCT, patients aged 2-80years with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) were randomly assigned (1:1) to rapid and slow AED taper groups. Outcome assessor was blinded to the allocation arms. Daily AED dose reduction was 30% to 50% and 15% to <30% in the rapid and slow taper groups, respectively. The primary outcome was difference in mean duration of LTM between the rapid and slow AED taper groups. Secondary outcomes included diagnostic yield, secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), 4- and 24- hour seizure clusters, status epilepticus, and need for midazolam rescue treatment. The study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2016/08/007207).
   ResultsOne hundred forty patients were randomly assigned to rapid (n=70) or slow taper groups (n=70), between June 13, 2016 and February 20, 2017. The difference in mean LTM duration between the rapid and slow taper groups was -1.8days (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.9 to -0.8, P=.0006). Of the secondary outcome measures, time to first seizure (2.91.7 and 4.6 +/- 3.0days in the rapid and slow taper groups respectively, P=.0002) and occurrence of 4-hour seizure clusters (11.9% and 2.9% in the rapid and slow taper groups, respectively, P=.04) were statistically significant. None of the other safety variables were different between the 2 groups. LTM diagnostic yield was 95.7% and 97.1%, in rapid and slow taper groups respectively (P=.46).
   SignificanceRapid AED tapering has the advantage of significantly reducing LTM duration over slow tapering, without any serious adverse events.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the pattern of microbial keratitis after accelerated corneal collagen cross-linkage (aCXL) in patients with keratoconus.
   Method: The medical records of cases of keratoconus that underwent aCXL from June 2014 to May 2017 were reviewed. Cases that developed microbial keratitis after aCXL were included in the study. The clinical, microbiological profile and the treatment outcomes were evaluated.
   Results: Of 532 eyes that underwent aCXL, 7 cases developed microbial keratitis during the study period. Median age at presentation was 11 years (range 8-17). Association with vernal keratoconjunctivitis was noted in 57.1% of cases (n = 4/7). The median time at the onset of infection was 3 days after aCXL (range 1-4). Microbiological reports revealed mixed infection in 3 cases [coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) + Aspergillus fumigatus, Staphylococcus aureus and Mucor spp., Staph. aureus and Acanthamoeba], Staph. aureus in 2 cases, and CoNS and Alternaria spp. in 1 case each. Resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones was noted in 83.3% of cases of bacterial keratitis (n = 5/6). All cases were initially managed with empirical antibiotic treatment that was later tailored based on microbiological reports. One case eventually required therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty for corneal perforation. At 6 months, the corrected distance visual acuity was >6/60 in 3 cases while 4 cases had corrected distance visual acuity <6/60.
   Conclusions: Microbial keratitis after aCXL is rare; however, the infection tends to be severe with high preponderance of mixed infection and resistance to fourth-generation fluoroquinolones.

AB  - Chest trauma is an important public health problem accounting for a substantial proportion of all trauma admissions and deaths. It directly account for 20-25 % of deaths due to trauma. Therefore, this study was conducted to analyze the presentation, patterns, and outcome of chest trauma in a level-1 urban trauma center. It was a prospective observational study of all patients presented with chest trauma to an urban level 1-trauma center over a period of 3 years. Demographic profile, mechanism of injury, injury severity scores (ISS), associated injuries, hospital stay, etc. were recorded. Morbidity and mortality rates were analyzed and compared with the published literature. Chest injuries comprised 30.9 % of all trauma admissions and the mechanism was blunt in majority (83.5 %) of the cases. Vehicular crashes (59.7 %) followed by assault were the most common modes of injury. Rib fracture was the most common chest injury seen in 724 of the 1258 patients while abdominal visceral injuries were the commonest associated injuries in polytrauma cases. Majority of the patients were managed non-operatively. Inter costal tube drainage (ICD) was the main stay of treatment in 75 % of the cases, whereas, thoracotomy was required only in 5.56 % of the patients. Overall mortality was 11 % and it was found to be significantly higher following blunt chest trauma. We observed that associated extra thoracic injuries resulted in higher mortality as compared to isolated chest injuries. Thoracic injuries can be readily diagnosed in the emergency department by meticulous and repeated clinical evaluation and majority require simple surgical procedures to prevent immediate mortality and long-term morbidity.

AB  - Dyslexia is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in reading and writing. In this study, we describe the identification of a set of 17 polymorphisms located across 1.9 Mb region on chromosome 5q31.3, encompassing genes of the PCDHG cluster, TAF7, PCDH1 and ARHGAP26, dominantly inherited with dyslexia in amulti-incident family. Strikingly, the non-risk formof seven variations of the PCDHG cluster, are preponderant in the human lineage, while risk alleles are ancestral and conserved across Neanderthals to non-human primates. Four of these seven ancestral variations ( c.460A > C [p.Ile154Leu], c.541G > A [p.Ala181Thr], c.2036G > C [p.Arg679Pro] and c.2059A > G [p.Lys687Glu]) result in amino acid alterations. p.Ile154Leu and p.Ala181Thr are present at EC2: EC3 interacting interface of gamma A3-PCDH and gamma A4-PCDH respectively might affect transhomophilic interaction and hence neuronal connectivity. p.Arg679Pro and p. Lys687Glu are present within the linker region connecting trans-membrane to extracellular domain. Sequence analysis indicated the importance of p.Ile154, p.Arg679 and p.Lys687 in maintaining class specificity. Thus the observed association of PCDHG genes encoding neural adhesion proteins reinforces the hypothesis of aberrant neuronal connectivity in the pathophysiology of dyslexia. Additionally, the striking conservation of the identified variants indicates a role of PCDHG in the evolution of highly specialized cognitive skills critical to reading. (c) 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Introduction:Abdominal trauma is one of the preventable causes of death in polytrauma patients. Decision and timing of laparotomy is a major challenge. Rate of nontherapeutic laparotomy is still high. Laparoscopy can avoid nontherapeutic laparotomy and also provide a reliable and accurate diagnosis of injury.Materials and Methods:This ambispective observational study was conducted in the division of Trauma Surgery and Critical Care, JPN Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data of cases from January 1, 2008 through April 30, 2013 and prospective analysis of cases from May 1, 2013 through March 31, 2015 was done using appropriate measures. Hemodynamically stable or responders fulfilling inclusion criteria were included. Selected patients underwent the laparoscopic procedure and if required converted to laparotomy.Results:Of the 3610 patients of abdominal trauma, laparotomy was done in 1666 (46.14%) patients and laparoscopy was done in 119 (3.29%) patients. Rate of reduction of nontherapeutic laparotomy in patients with abdominal trauma using diagnostic laparoscopy was 55.4%. However laparotomy could be avoided in 59.7%. Laparoscopy was 100% accurate in identifying injuries in our study. No injuries were missed in these patients. Fever and wound infection were significantly higher in laparotomy group. Chest infection and sepsis were also higher in laparotomy group but the difference was not statistically significant. Median length of hospital stay in laparoscopy group was 4 days (range: 1 to 28 d) and in laparotomy group was 9.5 days (range: 2 to 55 d) with P-value of 0.001.Conclusions:Laparoscopy has a role in management of hemodynamically stable patients with suspected abdominal injury to prevent nontherapeutic laparotomies, and thereby decreasing postoperative complications.

AB  - Purpose: The World Health Organisation (WHO) strategy for non-physician health workers (NPHWs) to diagnose and manage people with untreated epilepsy depends on them having access to suitable tools. We have devised and validated an app on a tablet computer to diagnose epileptic episodes and now examine how its use by NPHWs compares with diagnosis by local physicians and a neurologist.
   Methods: Fifteen NPHWs at Jan Swasthya Sahyog (JSS) a hospital with community outreach in Chhattisgarh, India were trained in the use of an epilepsy diagnosis app on a tablet computer. They were asked to determine the app scores on patients in their communities with possible epilepsy and then refer them first to their local JSS doctors and then to a visiting neurologist. With the neurologist's opinion as the "gold standard", the misdiagnosis rate from the NPHWs was compared with that of the local physicians.
   Results: There were 96 patients evaluated completely. The NPHWs misdiagnosed eight and the physicians seven. There were more uncertain diagnoses by the NPHWs. In the 22 patients who presented for the first time during the study, the NPHWs misdiagnosed three and the physicians five.
   Conclusions: NPHWs using an app achieved similar misdiagnosis rates to local physicians. Both these rates were well within the range of misdiagnosis in the published literature. These results suggest that task shifting epilepsy diagnosis and management from physicians to NPHWs, who are enabled with appropriate technology, can be an effective and safe way of reducing the epilepsy treatment gap.

AB  - Gaucher disease (GD) is amongst the most frequently occurring lysosomal storage disorder in all ethnicities. The clinical manifestations and natural history of GD is highly heterogeneous with extreme geographic and ethnic variations. The literature on GD has paucity of information and optimal management guidelines for Indian patients.
   Gaucher Disease Task Force was formed under the auspices of the Society for Indian Academy of Medical Genetics. Invited experts from various specialties formulated guidelines for the management of patients with GD. A writing committee was formed and the draft guidelines were circulated by email to all members for comments and inputs. The guidelines were finalized in December 2016 at the annual meeting of the Indian Academy of Medical Genetics.
   These guidelines are intended to serve as a standard framework for treating physicians and the health care systems for optimal management of Gaucher disease in India and to define unique needs of this patient population.
   Manifestations of GD are protean and a high index of suspicion is essential for timely diagnosis. Patients frequently experience diagnostic delays during which severe irreversible complications occur. Leucocyte acid beta-glucosidase activity is mandatory for establishing the diagnosis of Gaucher disease; molecular testing can help identify patients at risk of neuronopathic disease. Enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 and type 3 Gaucher disease is the standard of care. Best outcomes are achieved by early initiation of therapy before onset of irreversible complications. However, in setting of progressive neurological symptoms such as seizures and or/neuroregression, ERT is not recommended, as it cannot cross the blood brain barrier. The recommendations herein are for diagnosis, for initiation of therapy, therapeutic goals, monitoring and follow up of patients. We highlight that prevention of recurrence of the disease through genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis is essential in India, due to uniformly severe phenotypes encountered in our population.

AB  - Objectives: Early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma still remains a challenge. Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) have a markedly increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes play a role in development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This study assessed mutations in KRAS and p53 gene in blood as a screening tool for malignant transformation in CP patients.
   Methods: This was a cohort, single-center study including 294 CP patients. DNA was isolated from plasma of CP patients, and KRAS mutations were identified using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Patients with positive KRAS mutation were screened for malignancy using positron emission tomography or endoscopic ultrasound. Mutations in p53 gene were analyzed by sequencing. Tissue samples from CP and pancreatic cancer patients were also tested for mutations in KRAS and p53 genes.
   Results: The plasma samples of 64 CP patients were positive for KRAS mutation, and 4 had mutation in p53 gene also. No patient positive for KRAS mutation and/or p53 mutation was found to have malignant transformation.
   Conclusion: Detection of KRAS or p53 mutation in plasma is not an effective screening tool for pancreatic cancer because accumulation of multiple mutations is required for malignant transformation in the pancreas.

AB  - Background: Cholecalciferol and/or calcium supplementation might increase skeletal muscle strength and serum testosterone in young adult males.
   Objective: We performed a randomized control trial assessing the effect of cholecalciferol/calcium on skeletal muscle strength and serum testosterone in vitamin D deficient young males.
   Design: Two-by-two factorial RCT.
   Subject and Intervention: Two-hundred and twenty-eight young males were block-randomized to (i) double-placebo, (ii) calcium/placebo, (iii) cholecalciferol/placebo and (iv) cholecalciferol/calcium. Doses for cholecalciferol were 60 000 IU/wk for 8 weeks followed by 60 000 IU/fortnightly, and doses for elemental calcium were 500 mg/twice daily for 6 months. A total of 180 subjects completed the study protocol. Their ean age, body mass index and baseline 25(OH) D were 20.2 +/- 2.2 years, 23.0 +/- 3.6 kg/m(2) and 21.5 +/- 9.5 nmol/L, respectively.
   Measurements: Handgrip (primary outcome), pinch-grip strength, distance walked in 6 minutes, dyspnoea-score, quality of life by Short Form 36, serum 25(OH) D, 1,25(OH) 2D, iPTH, total testosterone and free androgen index (FAI).
   Results: After intervention, mean serum 25(OH) D was >75.0 nmol/L in cholecalciferol groups. However, the handgrip strength (29.7 +/- 4.4, 29.3 +/- 4.6, 30.6 +/- 5.0 and 28.8 +/- 4.3 kg, P = .28) was comparable in the 4 groups. Subgroups analysis among subjects with baseline serum 25OH) D < 25.0 and < 12.0 nmol/L showed similar results. The mean serum testosterone decreased significantly at 6 months; however, delta change was similar in 4 groups. Change in handgrip strength and other outcomes was similar in 4 groups with and without adjustment for delta testosterone and FAI.
   Conclusions: Six months of cholecalciferol/calcium supplementation had no significant effect on skeletal muscle strength and serum testosterone in young adult males.

AB  - Background and aimsGiven the scarcity of alcohol prevention and alcohol use disorder treatments in many low and middle-income countries, the World Health Organization launched an e-health portal on alcohol and health that includes a Web-based self-help program. This paper presents the protocol for a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the internet-based self-help intervention to reduce alcohol use.
   DesignTwo-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) with follow-up 6 months after randomization.
   SettingCommunity samples in middle-income countries.
   ParticipantsPeople aged 18+, with Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) scores of 8+ indicating hazardous alcohol consumption.
   Intervention and comparatorOffer of an internet-based self-help intervention, Alcohol e-Health', compared with a waiting list' control group. The intervention, adapted from a previous program with evidence of effectiveness in a high-income country, consists of modules to reduce or entirely stop drinking.
   MeasurementsThe primary outcome measure is change in the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score assessed at 6-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes include self-reported the numbers of standard drinks and alcohol-free days in a typical week during the past 6 months, and cessation of harmful or hazardous drinking (AUDIT < 8).
   AnalysisData analysis will be by intention-to-treat, using analysis of covariance to test if program participants will experience a greater reduction in their AUDIT score than controls at follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by (generalized) linear mixed models. Complier average causal effect and baseline observations carried forward will be used in sensitivity analyses.
   CommentsIf the Alcohol e-Health program is found to be effective, the potential public health impact of its expansion into countries with underdeveloped alcohol prevention and alcohol use disorder treatment systems world-wide is considerable.

AB  - Introduction: To study the utility of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the diagnosis of diabetes in patients with cirrhosis as compared to the gold standard oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and to see the effect of anemia and severity of cirrhosis on its performance.
   Methods: Individuals (n = 100) with an established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis were recruited. The OGTT was performed as described by the World Health Organization (WHO). The severity of cirrhosis was calculated using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score. The severity of anemia was defined according to WHO criteria. The utility of HbA1c was compared against the OGTT results. Test sensitivity and specificity were used to describe the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c.
   Results: A total of 100 subjects aged 46.9 +/- 9.1 years (mean +/- standard deviation) participated in the study, of whom 65% were recruited from out patient department of our hospital. The overall sensitivity and specificity of a HbA1c level of >= 6.5% for the diagnosis of diabetes in patients with cirrhosis was 77.1% (95% CI 59.9, 89.6) and 90.8% (95% CI 81.0, 96.5), respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 81.8% (95% CI 67.3, 90.8) and 88.1% (95% CI 80.0, 93.2), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.94). The sensitivity of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes in outpatients was 87.0% (95% CI 66.4, 97.2) and was better than that for diagnosing diabetes in hospitalized patients (58.3%; 95% CI 27.7, 84.8). The sensitivity of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes was poor in patients with moderate to severe anemia. The difference in sensitivity and specificity was not statistically different for CTP classes A, B and C. The prevalence of diabetes as defined by American Diabetes Association OGTT criteria was 35% (95% CI 25.7-45.2%).
   Conclusions: Taking OGTT as the gold standard, the sensitivity of HbA1c for diagnosing diabetes is good when used in outpatients with cirrhosis. However, the sensitivity of HbA1c decreases when it is used for hospitalized patients, suggesting that it is not a good test for diagnosis of diabetes in such cases. It also performs poorly if the patient has moderate to severe anemia.

AB  - Background: Many patients with dermatitis over photo-exposed body areas are positive to many contact allergens and have a pre-existing allergic contact dermatitis.
   Methods: This study included patients who presented to a tertiary centre in India with dermatitis on photo-exposed body areas suspected of chronic actinic dermatitis. Their detailed histories were recorded and cutaneous and systemic examinations were performed. Patch testing was done in all the patients and photo-patch testing was carried out in 86 patients.
   Results: Altogether 101 patients were included (69 males, 32 females). The most common presentation was lichenified hyperpigmented plaques on the photo-exposed sites. Photosensitivity was recorded in 64 (63%) patients and summer exacerbation in 52 (52%). Exposure to the Parthenium hysterophorus weed was recorded in 70 (69%) patients, 27 (26.7%) had a history of hair dye application and 20 (20%) had a history of atopy. Photo-patch test was positive in 11 (12.8%) patients and patch testing was positive in 71 (70%). Parthenium hysterophorus was the most common allergen implicated and was positive in three (4%) photo-patch and 52 (52%) patch tests. Other positive photo-patch test allergens were perfume mix, balsam of Peru, thiuram mix, Compositae mix and promethazine hydrochloride. Other common patch test allergens were parthenolide, colophony, fragrance mix and p-phenylenediamine (PPD) base.
   Conclusion: In the Indian population parthenium and perfume mix are the most common photoallergens in patients with dermatitis over photo-exposed areas, while parthenium, colophony, fragrance mix and PPD are the common positive allergens.

AB  - To compare the efficacy of daily assisted physical exercise (starting from one week of postnatal age) on bone strength at 40 weeks of post menstrual age to no intervention in infants born between 27 and 34 weeks of gestation.
   Open-label randomized controlled trial.
   Tertiary-care teaching hospital in northern India from 16 May, 2013 to 21 November, 2013.
   50 preterm neonates randomized to Exercise group (n=26) or Control group (n=24).
   Neonates in Exercise group underwent one session of physical exercise daily from one week of age, which included range-of-motion exercises with gentle compression, flexion and extension of all the extremities with movements at each joint done five times, for a total of 10-15 min. Infants in Control group underwent routine care and were not subjected to any massage or exercise.
   Primary: Bone speed of sound of left tibia measured by quantitative ultrasound at 40 weeks post menstrual age. Secondary: Anthropometry (weight length and head circumference) and biochemical parameters (calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase) at 40 weeks post menstrual age.
   The tibial bone speed of sound was comparable between the two groups [2858 (142) m/s vs. 2791 (122) m/s; mean difference 67.6 m/s; 95% CI -11 to 146 m/s; P=0.38]. There was no difference in anthropometry or biochemical parameters.
   Daily assisted physical exercise does not affect the bone strength, anthropometry or biochemical parameters in preterm (27 to 34 weeks) infants.

AB  - Objective To compare virtual autopsy using postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with conventional autopsy with respect to phenotypic characterization of stillbirths and malformed fetuses, and acceptability to parents.
   Methods This was a prospective diagnostic evaluation study, conducted from June 2013 to June 2015, including stillbirths and pregnancies terminated owing to fetal malformation at >= 20 weeks' gestation, for which parental consent to both conventional autopsy and postmortem MRI was obtained. Cases of maternal and obstetric cause of fetal demise were excluded. Whole-body postmortem MRI (at 1.5 T) was performed prior to conventional autopsy. Taking conventional autopsy as the diagnostic gold standard, postmortem MRI findings alone, or in conjunction with other minimally invasive prenatal and postmortem investigations, were assessed and compared for diagnostic accuracy.
   Results Parental consent for both conventional autopsy and postmortem MRI was obtained in 52 cases of which 43 were included in the analysis. In 35 (81.4%) cases, the final diagnosis based on virtual autopsy with postmortem MRI was in agreement with that of conventional autopsy. With conventional autopsy as the reference standard, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of postmortem MRI were, respectively: 77.7%, 99.8%, 97.4% and 98.0% for whole-body assessment; 93.1%, 99.0%, 87.1% and 99.5% for the nervous system; 61.0%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 96.7% for the cardiovascular system; 91.1%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 98.0% for the pulmonary system; 80.6%, 99.8%, 96.7% and 98.7% for the abdomen; 96.2%, 99.7%, 96.2% and 99.7% for the renal system; and 66.7%, 100.0%, 100.0% and 97.2% for the musculoskeletal system. Virtual autopsy was acceptable to 96.8% of families as compared with conventional autopsy to 82.5%.
   Conclusions Virtual autopsy using postmortem MRI and other minimally invasive investigations can be an acceptable alternative to conventional autopsy when the latter is refused by the parents. Postmortem MRI is more acceptable to parents and can provide additional diagnostic information on brain and spinal cord malformations. Copyright (C) 2017 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Haloperidol is an antipsychotic with well-known antiemetic potential. It is underutilized for postoperative nausea vomiting due to reported corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation. This meta-analysis evaluates its safety and efficacy as an antiemetic in the perioperative period. Trials comparing haloperidol to 5-HT3-receptor antagonists (5-HT3-RA) for 24 postoperative vomiting incidences published up to May 2017 were searched in the medical database. Comparisons were made for antiemetic efficiency variables (vomiting incidence, rescue antiemetic need, and patients with complete response) during early (until 6 hours) and late postoperative phases. Eight randomized controlled double-blinded trials were included in the final analysis. Twenty-four-hour vomiting incidence was similar in groups (fixed effects, P = 0.52, I-2 = 0%). Trial-sequential analysis confirmed noninferiority of haloperidol over 5-HT3-RAs ( = 5%, = 20%, = 10%), with information size being 859 (required > 812). Pooled results did not demonstrate superiority/inferiority of 5-HT3-RAs over haloperidol in all other antiemetic efficacy variables (early and delayed). Negligible heterogeneity was found in all the comparisons made. Pooled Mantel Haenszel odds ratio for QTc prolongation was equivalent in both groups (fixed effects, P = 0.23, I-2 = 0%). The mean dose of haloperidol used was 1.34 mg, and no trial reported extrapyramidal side effects. Trial-sequential analysis showed statistical equivalence ( = 5%, = 20%, = 10%), with information size being 745 (required > 591). Publication bias was unlikely (Egger test, X-intercept = 2.07, P = 0.10). We conclude that haloperidol is equivalent to the well-established 5-HT3-RAs in preventing vomiting during the first day after surgery. The incidence of QTc prolongation with haloperidol is statistically equivalent to 5-HT3-RAs and thus should not be the factor that discourages its use for treatment/prophylaxis of postoperative nausea vomiting.

AB  - ObjectiveWe aim to describe the data collected from India during phase 3 of the International study of asthma and allergy in childhood (ISAAC) study. Prevalence, severity, and population characteristics associated with rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema were assessed.
   MethodsChildren from two age groups (6-7 and 13-14 years) were included in the study as per the ISAAC protocol. The symptoms of allergy and associated features were assessed using a questionnaire.
   ResultsThe prevalence of allergic rhinitis among the 6-7 years age group was 11.3%, while it was 24.4% in the 13-14 years age group. The prevalence of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis was 3.9% in the 6-7 years age group and 10.9% in the 13-14 years age group. The prevalence of eczema was 2.8% in the 6-7 years age group and 3.7% in the 13-14 years age group. The passage of trucks near home, parental smoking, use of paracetamol, use of antibiotics, cooking with firewood, and television watching were associated with allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema. Maternal smoking was the strongest of all the associated features for allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema, especially in the 6-7 years age group (odds ratio: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.5-2.4; odds ratio: 2.9, 95% CI, 2.2-3.9; and odds ratio: 3.5, 95% CI: 2.6-4.8, respectively).
   ConclusionAllergic conditions like allergic rhinitis, rhinoconjunctivitis, and eczema are prevalent among Indian children and are associated with environmental tobacco smoke, paracetamol use, antibiotic use, television watching, and outdoor and indoor air pollution.

AB  - The reductions in cancer morbidity and mortality afforded by population-based cancer screening programmes have led many low-income and middle-income countries to consider the implementation of national screening programmes in the public sector. Screening at the population level, when planned and organised, can greatly benefit the population, whilst disorganised screening can increase costs and reduce benefits. The International Cancer Screening Network (ICSN) was created to share lessons, experience, and evidence regarding cancer screening in countries with organised screening programmes. Organised screening programmes provide screening to an identifiable target population and use multidisciplinary delivery teams, coordinated clinical oversight committees, and regular review by a multidisciplinary evaluation board to maximise benefit to the target population. In this Series paper, we report outcomes of the first regional consultation of the ICSN held in Agartala, India (Sept 5-7, 2016), which included discussions from cancer screening programmes from Denmark, the Netherlands, USA, and Bangladesh. We outline six essential elements of population-based cancer screening programmes, and share recommendations from the meeting that policy makers might want to consider before implementation.

AB  - Bacicground: Gamma delta (gamma delta) T cells are known to link innate and adaptive immunity. Decidual yS T cells are known to provide immunotolerance by producing IL-10 and TGF-beta. In recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) females, the role of peripheral gamma delta T cells remain unstudied.
   Objective: To investigate the different phenotypes of gamma delta T cells in the peripheral blood of women with idiopathic RPL and their possible involvement in RPL condition.
   Methods: A total of 120 women were recruited for the study. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated and they were stained with appropriate antibodies to determine the phenotype of gamma delta T cells and major cytokines produced by them in the blood using flow cytometry.
   Results: We observed a significant decrease in the proportion of CD31-CD4 CD8-gamma delta T cells (p < 0.001) and increase in the percentage of IFN-gamma (p < 0.05) and IL-17 (p < 0.001) producing gamma delta T cells in RPL pregnant as compared to normal pregnant females.
   Conclusion: Increase in IFN-gamma and IL-17-producing CD3 CD4-CD8 gamma delta T cells is associated with creating inflammatory cytokine milieu, thereby, may contribute towards pregnancy loss in RPL females.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to study the prevalence of DED and analyze risk factors in North Indian population. Methods: This was a cross-section hospital-based, observational study. Cases enrolled over 2 years (systematic random sampling) were administered ocular surface disease index questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of DED. Schirmer's test and tear break-up time were performed only in the subset of patients giving consent. Categorical data were assessed with Chi-square/Fisher's Exact test, and odds ratio was analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. P < 0.05 was statistically significant. Results: A total of 15,625 patients were screened. The prevalence of DED was 32% (5000/15625); 9.9% (496/5000) had mild DED; 61.2% (3060/5000) had moderate DED; and 28.9% (1444/5000) had severe DED. Age group of 21-40 years, male sex, urban region, and desk job were associated with increased risk of DED. Hours of visual display terminal (VDT) usage significantly correlated with DED (P < 0.001), and 89.98% of patients with 4 h or more of VDT use had severe dry eye. Cigarette smoking and contact lens usage had increased odds of developing severe DED (P < 0.001). Objective tests were undertaken in 552 patients; of these, 81.3% (449/552) had severe DED. Conclusions: The prevalence of DED in North India is 32%, with the age group of 21-40 years affected most commonly. VDT use, smoking, and contact lens use were associated with increased odds of developing DED.

AB  - F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is emerging to be a useful tool in supporting the diagnosis of AIE. In this study, we describe the metabolic patterns on F-18 FDG PET imaging in AIE.
   Twenty-four antibody-positive patients (anti-NMDA-15, anti-VGKC/LGI1-6, and anti-GAD-3), 14 females and 10 males, with an age range of 2-83 years were included in this study. Each PET study was evaluated visually for the presence of hypometabolism or hypermetabolism and semiquantitatively using Cortex ID (GE) and Scenium (Siemens) by measuring regional Z-scores. These patterns were correlated with corresponding antibody positivity once available.
   Visually, a pattern of hypometabolism, hypermetabolism, or both in various spatial distributions was appreciated in all 24 patients. On quantitative analysis using scenium parietal and occipital lobes showed significant hypometabolism with median Z-score of -3.8 (R) and -3.7 (L) and -2.2 (R) and -2.5 (L) respectively. Two-thirds (16/24) showed significant hypermetabolism involving the basal ganglia with median Z-score of 2.4 (R) and 3.0 (L). Similarly on Cortex ID, the median Z-score for hypometabolism in parietal and occipital lobes was -2.2 (R) and -2.4 (L) and -2.6 (R) and -2.4 (L) respectively, while subcortical regions were not evaluated. MRI showed signal alterations in only 11 of these patients.
   There is heterogeneity in metabolic topography of AIE which is characterized by hypometabolism most commonly involving the parietal and occipital cortices and hypermetabolism most commonly involving the basal ganglia. Scenium analysis using regional Z-scores can complement visual evaluation for demonstration of these metabolic patterns on FDG PET.

AB  - Head and neck extramedullary plasmacytoma is a rare localized plasma cell neoplasm. We intended to perform this review of the published literature to assess the demographic profile, pattern of care and survival outcomes.
   Two authors independently searched PubMed, Google search and Cochrane library for eligible studies from 1950 till July 1, 2016, published in English language.
   Median age of the cohort was 57 years (range 11-85). Site-wise distributions were paranasal sinuses 22.3% (70), nasal cavity 17.5% (55), nasopharynx 10.8% (34). Median size of SEMP was 3 cm (range 0.3-12 cm). Treatment distribution was radiotherapy (RT) in 52% (164), surgery (S) 19% (60), chemotherapy (C) 5% (16), S + RT 23.49% (74),CRT 1.9% (6), S + C 0.6% (2), S + RT + C 0.95% (3).Radiation was used as a modality in 78.4%(247), surgery in 44.1%(139), chemotherapy in 4.8%(15). Median radiation dose used was 45 Gy with range 20-61 Gy. Median overall survival (OS) was 40 months (range 0.5-298). Median local progression-free survival was 36 months (range 0-298). Median myeloma relapse-free survival was 36 months (range 0.5-298). Five- and 10-year OS was 78.33 and 68.61%. Five-year cause-specific survival (CSS) and 10-year CSS was 90.15 and 83.31%. Five-year LPFS was 94.78%, and 10-year LPFS was 88.43%. Five-year myeloma progression-free survival was 84.46%, and 10-year myeloma PFS was 80.44%. The factors associated with risk of local relapse were site of disease (sinonasal), secretory EMP, type of treatment received (surgery + RT > RT alone > surgery on univariate analysis). Risk factors for myeloma relapse were coexisting diseases, site of disease (sinonasal), bony erosion, size of lesion > 5 cm and type of treatment received on univariate analysis.
   Our study shows that combined modality S + RT is superior compared to uni-modality in preventing local recurrence. Radiation dose of 45 Gy is optimal. Nodal irradiation has no impact on local recurrence.

AB  - Background: A small proportion of patients with mobile unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) report poor functional outcomes in spite of optimal component alignment on postoperative radiographs. The purpose of this study is to assess whether there is a correlation between functional outcome and knee kinematics.
   Methods: From a cohort of consecutive cases of 150 Oxford medial UKA, patients with fair/poor functional outcome at 1-year postsurgery (Oxford Knee Score [OKS] < 34, n = 15) were identified and matched for age, gender, preoperative clinical scores, and follow-up period with a cohort of patients with good/excellent outcome (OKS >= 34, n = 15). In vivo kinematic assessment was performed using step-up and deep knee bend exercises under fluoroscopic imaging. The fluoroscopic videos were analyzed using MATLAB software to measure the variation in time taken to complete the exercises, patellar tendon angle, and bearing position with knee flexion angle.
   Results: Mean OKS in the fair/poor group was 29.9 and the mean OKS in the good/excellent group was 41.1. The tibial slope, time taken to complete the exercises, and patellar tendon angle trend over the flexion range were similar in both the groups; however, bearing position and the extent of bearing excursion differed significantly. The total bearing excursion in the OKS < 34 group was significantly smaller than the OKS >= 34 group (35%). Furthermore, on average, the bearing was positioned 1.7 mm more posterior on the tibia in the OKS < 34 group.
   Conclusion: This study provides evidence that abnormal knee kinematics, in particular bearing excursion and positioning, are associated with worse functional outcomes after mobile UKA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the highly aggressive subgroup of breast cancers with poor prognosis due to absence of estrogen receptor (ER). Therefore, alternative targeted therapies are required against ER-negative breast cancers. Coumestrol, a phytoestrogen inhibits cell growth of ER-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells; the exact mechanism has not yet been reported. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells contain elevated copper which play an integral role in angiogenesis. The current focus of the work was to identify any possible role of copper in coumestrol cytotoxic action against breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Results demonstrated that coumestrol inhibited cell viability, induced ROS generation, DNA damage, G1/S cell cycle arrest, up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis induction via caspase-dependent mitochondrial mediated pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, addition of copper chelator, neocuproine and ROS scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine were ineffective in abrogating coumestrol-mediated apoptosis. This suggests non-involvement of copper and ROS in coumestrol-induced apoptosis. To account for coumestrol-mediated up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis induction, direct binding potential between coumestrol and Bax/Bcl-2 was studied using in silico molecular docking studies. We propose that coumestrol directly enters cells and combines with Bax/Bcl-2 to alter their structures, thereby causing Bax binding to the outer mitochondrial membrane and Bcl-2 release from the mitochondria to initiate apoptosis. Thus, non-copper targeted ROS independent DNA damage is the central mechanism of coumestrol in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings will be useful in better Understanding of anticancer mechanisms of coumestrol and establishing it as a lead molecule for TNBC treatment.

AB  - Background: Role of Th9 cells and interleukin-9 ( IL-9) in human autoimmune diseases such as psoriasis and ulcerative colitis has been explored only very recently. However, their involvement in human rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is not conclusive. Pathogenesis of RA is complex and involves various T cell subsets and neutrophils. Here, we aimed at understanding the impact of IL-9 on infiltrating immune cells and their eventual role in synovial inflammation in RA.
   Methods: In vitro stimulation of T cells was performed by engagement of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Flow cytometry was employed for measuring intracellular cytokine, ROR gamma t in T cells, evaluating apoptosis of neutrophils. ELISA was used for measuring soluble cytokine, Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy were used for STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation.
   Results: We demonstrated synovial enrichment of Th9 cells and their positive correlation with disease activity (DAS28-ESR) in RA. Synovial IL-9 prolonged the survival of neutrophils, increased their matrix metalloprotienase-9 production and facilitated Th17 cell differentiation evidenced by induction of transcription factor ROR gamma t and STAT3 phosphorylation. IL-9 also augmented the function of IFN-gamma+ and TNF-alpha + synovial T cells.
   Conclusions: We provide evidences for critical role of IL-9 in disease pathogenesis and propose that targeting IL-9 may be an effective strategy to ameliorate synovial inflammation in RA. Inhibiting IL-9 may have wider impact on the production of pathogenic cytokines involved in autoimmune diseases including RA and may offer better control over the disease.

AB  - Chronic myelocytic leukemia cell line K562 undergoes differentiation by phorbol esters to megakaryocytes and we have used this system to understand miRNA processing leading to isomiR generation. PMA treatment significantly altered the production of miRNA in K562 cells. Expression of 24.4% of miRNAs were found to be stimulated whereas expression of 10% miRNAs were inhibited by PMA treatment. Our results suggest that miRNA precursors are processed into isomiRs in a deterministic manner. The relative levels of different isomiRs of a miRNA remained mainly unchanged even after PMA treatment irrespective of overall changes in expression (either up-regulation or down-regulation). However, not all miRNAs behave in the same way, about 7% showed a variation of isomiR profiles after PMA treatment. Most of the later class of miRNAs were found to be oncogenic miRNAs. Further, it was also found that number of isomiRs was independent of abundance of a miRNA. Functional importance of different isomiRs was demonstrated using three different isomiRs of miR-22. Our results showed that different isomiRs could inhibit expression of targets genes with different efficiencies. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of a miRNA population generated during processing is in general regulated and that variation in the generation of an isomiR can be a functionally important regulatory feature.

AB  - Background & Aims: Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) is used to control refractory variceal bleeding secondary to portal hypertension. This meta-analysis was conducted to systematically review polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent grafts (CS) versus bare stents (BS) in TIPS procedure. Methods: Systematic search of literature databases was done from January-1990 till April-2017, using predecided keywords. Outcome measures studied were (1) primary-patency (PP) at 1 year (defined as absence of shunt insufficiency at 1 year), (2) rebleeding (RE) (3) new-onset hepatic encephalopathy ([HE] new-onset or worsening encephalopathy following the procedure), and (4) survival at 1 year (SU). Odds ratio (OR) was calculated for each outcome variable. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed by the I-2 statistics and (2) Q-test. Results: Fourteen studies (4RCTs, 2 prospective nonrandomized, and 8 retrospective) were included with 2519 patients (1548 patients in BS group and 971 patients in CS group). Three-quarter outcome measures showed significantly better results with CS. PP was pooled from 13 studies and showed an OR=4.75 (95% confidence interval [CI]=3.32-6.79; P<.00001; I-2=44%) in favor of CS. RE was pooled from six studies with odds ratio (OR)=0.37(95% CI=0.24-0.56; P<.00001; I-2=0%) in favor of CS. SU was pooled from 11 studies with OR=1.85 (95% CI=1.44-2.38; P<.00001; I-2=0%) in favor of CS. On subset analysis for RCTs, three outcome variables favored CS with minimal heterogeneity [PP: OR=4.18 (95% CI=2.66-6.55; P<.00001; I-2=0%). RE: OR=0.43 (95% CI=0.25-0.72; P<.001; I-2=0%). SU: OR=1.85 (95% CI=1.44-2.38, P<.00001; I-2=0%)]. HE showed no difference between two stents on the overall and subset pooled analysis. Overall: OR=0.86 (95% CI=0.68-1.08; P=.19; I-2=4%). Only RCTs: OR=0.91 (95% CI=0.63-1.32, P=.63; I-2=0%). Conclusions: CS is associated with better primary patency and survival and lesser rate of rebleeding than BS in patients undergoing TIPS procedure. There is no difference in new-onset hepatic encephalopathy.

AB  - Background and purpose
   Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is an emergency in cognitive neurology, defined as cognitive impairment affecting the daily living activities developed over less than 1 year. This study investigated the profile of patients with rapidly progressive dementia at first presentation.
   Methods
   Retrospective case analysis was done in 187 patients with rapidly progressive dementia who presented to the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India from January 2008 to August 2016. Patients were divided into three groups: (1) Reversible (treatable) secondary dementia group, (2) Prion dementia group (sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), (3) Non-prion Neurodegenerative and vascular dementias (primary neurodegenerative and vascular dementia). Cases presenting with delirium secondary to metabolic, drug induced or septic causes and those with signs of meningitis were excluded.
   Results
   Secondary reversible causes formed the most common cause for RPD with immune mediated encephalitides, neoplastic and infectious disorders as the leading causes. The patients in this series had an younger onset of RPD. Infections presenting with RPD accounted for the most common cause in our series (39%) with SSPE (41%) as the leading cause followed by neurosyphilis (17.9%) and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (15.3%). Immune mediated dementias formed the second most common (18.1%) etiologic cause for RPD. The neurodegenerative dementias were third common cause for RPD in our series. Neoplastic disorders and immune mediated presented early (< 6 months) while neurodegenerative disorders presented later (> 6 months).
   Conclusions
   Rapidly progressive dementia is an emergency in cognitive neurology with potentially treatable or reversible causes that should be sought for diligently.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a microwave assisted method for the rapid synthesis of A2E and also to develop a method to quantify N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine(A2E), all-trans retinal dimer (ATRD), A2-glycerophospho ethanolamine (A2GPE), dihydropyridine phosphatidyl ethanolamine (A2DHPE) and monofuran A2E (MFA2E) in age matched retina.
   Methods: The development of microwave assisted synthesis of A2E, its purification and characterization for its utility in quantification in human retina. The semi-quantitative method development using LC-ESI-MS, LCESI-MS/MS and LC-APCI-MS/MS from pooled macula and peripheral retina for the bisretinoid analysis has been done.
   Results: Maximum A2E conversion using microwave assisted process took place at 80 degrees C for 45 min with a yield of 55.01%. Highly sensitive and specific mass spectrometric method was developed using reverse phase C-18 separation with positive electrospray ionization and positive atmospheric phase chemical ionization of tandom mass spectrometry. A gradient mobile phase separation was achieved using water and methanol with 0.1% TFA.
   Multiple reaction monitoring acquisition for ESI and APCI was performed at ATRD m/z 551.2/522.2, A2GPE m/z 746.4/729.5, A2DHPEm/z 594.4/576.5, MFA2E m/z 608.2/591.2, A2E m/z 592.4/418.2. Method was validated using LC-ESI-SIM mode to determine selectivity, linearity, sensitivity, precision and accuracy.
   Conclusion: An attempt towards optimization of the synthetic procedure of A2E was made so as to reduce the lengthy reaction time without compromising the yield. Developed method was capable enough for the detection of low level of bisretinids in retina.

AB  - Background: India is witnessing a rising burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus. India's National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cancer, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke recommends population-based screening and referral to primary health centre for diagnosis confirmation and treatment initiation. However, little is known about uptake of confirmatory tests among screen positives.
   Objective: To estimate the uptake of confirmatory tests and identify the reasons for not undergoing confirmation by those at high risk for developing diabetes.
   Methods: We analysed data collected under project UDAY, a comprehensive diabetes and hypertension prevention and management programme, being implemented in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. Under UDAY, population-based screening for diabetes was carried out by project health workers using a diabetes risk score and capillary blood glucose test. Participants at high risk for diabetes were asked to undergo confirmatory tests. On follow-up visit, health workers assessed if the participant had undergone confirmation and ask for reasons if not so.
   Results: Of the 35,475 eligible adults screened between April 2015 and August 2016, 10,960 (31%) were determined to be at high risk. Among those at high risk, 9670 (88%) were followed up, and of those, only 616 (6%) underwent confirmation. Of those who underwent confirmation, ` lack of symptoms of diabetes warranting visit to health facility' (52%) and ` being at high risk was not necessary enough to visit' (41%) were the most commonly reported reasons for non-confirmation. Inconvenient facility time (4.4%), no nearby facility (3.2%), un-affordability (2.2%) and long waiting time (1.6%) were the common health system-related factors that affected the uptake of the confirmatory test.
   Conclusion: Confirmation of diabetes was abysmally low in the study population. Low uptake of the confirmatory test might be due to low ` risk perception'. The uptake can be increased by improving the population risk perception through individual and/or community-focused risk communication interventions.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and the second most common cancer overall, ranking as the fifth cause of death from cancer. The chronicity of the disease produces long-term physiological and psychological manifestations, which adversely affect the quality of life of the individual. The primary treatment while managing cancer presents with various debilitating side effects. With the recent advances in treatment techniques that have improved the survival rate, patients suffer from continuing posttreatment complications. Patients seem to cope well with the stress of treatment of BC and sustain a normal life; however, the deterioration in physical well-being makes the patient functionally inefficient. Exercise has been proven to be an effective, safe, and feasible tool in combating the adverse effects of treatment, prevents complications and decreases the risk of BC-specific mortality. This review briefly presents an overview of the burden of the disease and its management strategies. Owing to the heterogeneity of the population and the multitude of therapies they receive, the response of each patient to treatment is different and so is the magnitude of adverse effects. The review discusses the late sequelae following treatment and evidence supporting the role of physical activity in their management. In conclusion, there is a need for personalized physical activity plans to be developed to suit the individual and their circumstances.

AB  - The objectives of the study were to develop a framework for automatic outer and inner breast tissue segmentation using multi-parametric MRI images of the breast tumor patients; and to perform breast density and tumor tissue analysis. MRI of the breast was performed on 30 patients at 3T-MRI. T1, T2 and PD-weighted(W) images, with and without fat saturation( WWFS), and dynamic-contrast-enhanced(DCE)-MRI data were acquired. The proposed automatic segmentation approach was performed in two steps. In step-1, outer segmentation of breast tissue from rest of body parts was performed on structural images (T2-W/T1-W/PD-W without fat saturation images) using automatic landmarks detection technique based on operations like profile screening, Otsu thresholding, morphological operations and empirical observation. In step-2, inner segmentation of breast tissue into fibroglandular( FG), fatty and tumor tissue was performed. For validation of breast tissue segmentation, manual segmentation was carried out by two radiologists and similarity coefficients( Dice and Jaccard) were computed for outer as well as inner tissues. FG density and tumor volume were also computed and analyzed. The proposed outer and inner segmentation approach worked well for all the subjects and was validated by two radiologists. The average Dice and Jaccard coefficients value for outer segmentation using T2-W images, obtained by two radiologists, were 0.977 and 0.951 respectively. These coefficient values for FG tissue were 0.915 and 0.875 respectively whereas for tumor tissue, values were 0.968 and 0.95 respectively. The volume of segmented tumor ranged over 2.1 cm3 +/- 7.08 cm 3. The proposed approach provided automatic outer and inner breast tissue segmentation, which enables automatic calculations of breast tissue density and tumor volume. This is a complete framework for outer and inner breast segmentation method for all structural images.

AB  - Pathogens frequently employ eukaryotic linear motif (ELM)-rich intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) to perturb and hijack host cell networks for a productive infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a relatively high percentage of IDPs in its proteome, the significance of which is not known. The Mycobacterium-specific PE-PPE protein family has several members with unusually high levels of structural disorder and disorder-promoting Ala/Gly residues. PPE37 protein, a member of this family, carries an N-terminal PPE domain capable of iron binding, two transmembrane domains, and a disordered C-terminal segment harboring ELMs and a eukaryotic nuclear localization signal (NLS). PPE37, expressed as a function of low iron stress, was cleaved by M. tuberculosis protease into N- and C-terminal segments. A recombinant N-terminal segment (P37N) caused proliferation and differentiation of monocytic THP-1 cells, into CD11c, DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin)-positive semimature dendritic cells exhibiting high interleukin-10 (IL-10) but negligible IL-12 and also low tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion-an environment suitable for maintaining tolerogenic immune cells. The C-terminal segment entered the macrophage nucleus and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of host cells. Mice immunized with recombinant PPE37FL and PPE37N evoked strong anti-inflammatory response, validating the in vitro immunostimulatory effect. Analysis of the IgG response of PPE37FL and PPE37N revealed significant immunoreactivities in different categories of TB patients, viz. pulmonary TB (PTB) and extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), vis-a-vis healthy controls. These results support the role of IDPs in performing contrasting activities to modulate the host processes, possibly through molecular mimicry and cross talk in two spatially distinct host environments which may likely aid M. tuberculosis survival and pathogenesis.
   IMPORTANCE To hijack the human host cell machinery to enable survival inside macrophages, the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires a repertoire of proteins that can mimic host protein function and modulate host cell machinery. Here, we have shown how a single protein can play multiple functions and hijack the host cell for the benefit of the pathogen. Full-length membrane-anchored PPE37 protein is cleaved into N- and C-terminal domains under iron-depleted conditions. The N-terminal domain facilitates the propathogen semimature tolerogenic state of dendritic cells, whereas the C-terminal segment is localized into host cell nucleus and induces apoptosis. The immune implications of these in vitro observations were assessed and validated in mice and also human TB patients. This study presents novel mechanistic insight adopted by M. tuberculosis to survive inside host cells.

AB  - Background: Genetic changes in p53 gene contribute to breast cancer susceptibility.
   Objective and Methods: A case-control study and a meta-analysis were performed to investigate the role of p53 codon72 SNP with breast cancer susceptibility in Indian women.
   Results: p53 heterozygous arginine variant was associated with decreased risk of breast cancer in total cohort. In meta-analysis, Allelic and GG vs. CC genetic comparison model were found to be associated with breast cancer risk. Moreover, recessive comparison model indicated a protective correlation with breast cancer occurrence.
   Conclusion: The findings of our case-control study and meta-analysis suggest a significant association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and an increased risk of breast cancer in Indian population.

AB  - Background and AimSmoking has been linked with adverse outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD); however, it is not known whether oral tobacco (OT) use affects disease outcomes in these patients. The study aimed to assess the association between smoking or OT and outcomes in CD.
   MethodsRetrospective analysis was performed on prospectively maintained records of CD patients from 2004 to 2016. The parameters assessed included disease characteristics at baseline (location, behavior, age at onset, perianal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations), course pattern, and outcomes (surgery, hospitalizations, immunomodulator or biologics use, and steroid requirement).
   ResultsA total of 426 patients were included (mean age: 39.9years; 59.9% men; median follow up: 71months). Forty patients were ever-OT users, and 59 were ever-smokers, ever-use being defined as daily use for at least 2years. OT use was associated with male sex and smoking. Both OT use and smoking had no effect on baseline characteristics, but upper gastrointestinal disease was less common in ever-smokers. Both OT use and smoking did not have any effect on surgery, immunomodulator, and biologic use. Similarly, no association was found between these outcomes and duration, daily, and cumulative exposure to tobacco. Current but not former tobacco use in both smoked (adjusted odds ratio=2.59 [1.22-5.49]) and OT (adjusted odds ratio=2.97 [1.03-8.6]) forms increased risk of hospitalizations.
   ConclusionOral tobacco use and smoking had no significant detrimental effect on disease phenotype or medical and surgical requirements in CD in Indian patients, affirming other non-Caucasian studies that found lack of effect of smoking. However, current tobacco use in any form was associated with hospitalization during follow up.

AB  - Array CGH has led to the delineation of innumerable microdeletion syndromes. We present a patient with a 7-Mb deletion at 5q11.2 with previously unreported features, such as immunodeficiency, asymmetry of hands and feet, joint laxity, and agenesis of corpus callosum. The clinical features of this patient are compared with 13 patients reported previously. A common critical region (CCR) of 1.4 Mb (54-55.4 Mb) is defined in all cases including the present one. Of the 14 genes present in CCR, IL6ST is proposed to be the candidate gene for immunodeficiency observed in some of these patients. IL6ST encodes gp130, a signal transduction protein for various interleukins and cytokines. It is involved in the generation of both T and B lymphocytes as well as the production of acute-phase reactants. Microdeletion 5q11.2 should be considered as a recognisable syndrome based on the common phenotype and the novel features described.

AB  - A very high incidence of typhoid was described in studies conducted in urban locations on the Indian subcontinent at the end of the twentieth century. Despite their availability, licensed immunogenic conjugate typhoid vaccines have not been introduced in the national immunization program, in part, because of a lack of understanding of where and for whom prevention is most necessary. Uncertainty regarding the burden of disease is based on the lack of reliable, recent estimates of culture-confirmed typhoid and an observed trend of low isolations of Salmonella Typhi and fewer complications at large referral hospitals in India. In this article, we examine the trends of S. Typhi isolation at three large tertiary care centers across India over 15 years and describe trends of recognized risk factors for typhoid from published literature. There appears to be a decline in the isolation of S. Typhi in blood cultures, which is more apparent in the past 5 years. These trends are temporally related to economic improvement, female literacy, and the use of antibiotics such as cephalosporins and azithromycin. The analysis of trends of culture-confirmed typhoid may not accurately capture the typhoid incidence trends if antibiotic use confounds the burden of disease presenting to larger facilities. Emerging antimicrobial resistance may result in a resurgence of disease if the underlying incidence and transmission of typhoid are not adequately addressed through public health approaches.

AB  - Pediatric posttraumatic endophthalmitis presents with great complexities and challenges arising due to delayed presentation, difficulty in eliciting an accurate history, or trauma with unusual and highly contaminated objects. The possibility of initial misdiagnosis as panuveitis, metastatic endophthalmitis, and masquerade syndrome is also very high, which results not only in several unwarranted investigations being performed, but also a delay in the initiation of treatment. The standard treatment remains primary repair of the wound, intravitreal therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics, and parsplana vitrectomy. Despite appropriate intervention, visual outcome in children with posttraumatic endophthalmitis is dampened by additional factors like poor compliance with postoperative instructions and high risk of amblyopia. Hence, it is important to recognize that posttraumatic endophthalmitis in children differs from that in adults in several ways. We made a very tailored effort to review the published literature pertaining to posttraumatic endophthalmitis in children and herein present the results of our search.

AB  - Objective: Previous studies have shown moderate agreement between physicians when diagnosing epilepsy, but have included small numbers. The EpiNet study group was established to undertake multicentre clinical trials in epilepsy. Before commencing trials, we wanted to determine levels of agreement between physicians from different countries and different health systems when diagnosing epilepsy, specific seizure types and etiologies.
   Methods: 30 Case scenarios describing six children and 24 adults with paroxysmal events (21 epileptic seizures, nine non-epileptic attacks) were presented to physicians with an interest in epilepsy. Physicians were asked how likely was a diagnosis of epilepsy; if seizures were generalised or focal; and the likely etiology. For 23 cases, clinical information was presented in Step 1, and investigations in Step 2.
   Results: 189 Participants from 36 countries completed the 30 cases. Levels of agreement were determined for 154 participants who provided details regarding their clinical experience. There was substantial agreement for diagnosis of epilepsy (kappa = 0.61); agreement was fair to moderate for seizure type(s) (kappa = 0.40) and etiology (kappa = 0.41). For 23 cases with two steps, agreement increased from step 1 to step 2 for diagnosis of epilepsy (kappa 0.56-0.70), seizure type(s) (kappa 0.38-0.52), and etiology (kappa 0.38-0.47). Agreement was better for 53 epileptologists (diagnosis of epilepsy, kappa = 0.66) than 56 neurologists with a special interest in epilepsy (kappa = 0.58). Levels of agreement differed slightly between physicians practicing in different parts of the world, between child and adult neurologists, and according to one's experience with epilepsy.
   Conclusion: Although there is substantial agreement when epileptologists diagnose epilepsy, there is less agreement for diagnoses of seizure types and etiology. Further education of physicians regarding semiology of different seizure types is required. Differences in approach to diagnosis, both between physicians and between countries, could impact negatively on clinical trials of anti-epileptic drugs.

AB  - Background & objectives: The incidence and severity of invasive and non-invasive infections demonstrate variability over time. The emerging resistance of Group A streptococci (GAS) to commonly used antibiotics is of grave concern. This study was conducted to assess the antimicrobial resistance of beta-haemolytic streptococci (beta HS) in India and to ascertain the molecular mechanisms of resistance.
   Methods: All isolates of beta HS from the Trauma Centre of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) (north India), and heavily populated area of old Delhi from 2010 to 2014 and Yashoda Hospital, Secunderabad (in south India, 2010-2012) and preserved isolates of beta HS at AIIMS (2005-2009) were included. Phenotypic confirmation was done using conventional methods and the Vitek 2. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was done by disc diffusion and E-test. Detection of resistance genes, erm(A), erm(B), mef(A), tet(M) and tet(O), was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
   Results: A total of 296 isolates of beta HS (240 from north and 21 from south India) were included in the study. Of the 296 beta HS, 220 (74%) were GAS, 52 (17.5%) were Group G streptococci and 11 (3.7%), 10 (3.3%) and three (1%) were Group B streptococci, Group C streptococci and Group F streptococci, respectively. A total of 102 (46%) and 174 (79%) isolates were resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin, respectively; a lower resistance to ciprofloxacin (21, 9.5%) was observed. A total of 42 (14%) and 30 (10%) isolates, respectively, were positive for tet(M) and erm(B) genes. Only 13 (5%) isolates were positive for mef(A). None of the isolates were positive for erm(A) and tet(O). There was discordance between the results of E-test and PCR for erythromycin and tetracycline.
   Interpretation & conclusions: A high level of resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline was seen in beta HS in India. Discordance between genotypic and phenotypic results was reported. Absence of erm(A) and tet(O) with high prevalence of tet(M) and erm(B) was observed.

AB  - Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is one of the common forms of haematological malignancy in adults. We analysed the prevalence and clinical significance of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) and Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations in AML patients of North East India. Co-prevalence and clinical significance of three recurrent chromosomal translocations namely t(15; 17), t(8; 21), t(16; 16) and expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), flow markers were also documented and co-related with disease progress. We analysed bone marrow aspirates or peripheral blood samples from 165 newly diagnosed AML patients. All clinical samples were analysed by Real Time PCR and DNA sequencing based assays. NPM1 was the most frequently detected mutation in the study population (46/165 = 27.90%, 95% CI 20.75-35.05). FLT3 mutations were detected in 27/165 (16.40%, 95% CI 10.45-22.35) patients with internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) in 24/165 (14.60%, 95% CI 8.91-20.29) and FLT3-D835 in 3/165 (1.80%, 95% CI 0-4.13) patients. NPM1 mutations were associated with a higher complete remission rate and longer overall survival (P < 0.01) compared to FLT3-ITD whereas FLT3-ITD showed adverse impact with poor survival rate (P < 0.01), leukocytosis (P < 0.01) and a packed bone marrow. EGFR expression was more in patients with NPM1 mutation compared to FLT3 mutation (P = 0.09). Patients with FLT3 and NPM1 mutations uniformly expressed CD13 and CD33 whereas CD34 was associated with poor prognosis (P ae<currency> 0.01) in patients with NPM1 mutation. FLT3-ITD was associated with inferior overall survival. However the clinical significance of FLT3-D835 was not clear due to small number of samples. NPM1 mutation showed better prognosis with increased response to treatment in the absence of FLT3-ITD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a skin substitute composed of mPEG-PCL-grafted-gelatin (Bio-Syn)/hyaluronan/chondroitin sulfate/sericin and to study its in vitro biocompatibility with human fibroblasts, human keratinocytes and hMSCs in terms of cellular adhesion and proliferation (similar to 5-6 fold). mPEG-PCL was grafted into a gelatin backbone via a Michael addition reaction to prepare Bio-Syn and it was characterized using ATR-FTIR, H-1 NMR and TNBS assay. Additionally, keratinocyte-hMSC contact co-culture studies showed that Bio-Syn composite scaffolds loaded with sericin promote hMSCs' epithelial differentiation with regard to qRT-PCR gene expression (Delta Np63 alpha and keratin 14) and expression of various epithelial markers (Pan-cytokeratin, Delta Np63 alpha and keratin 14). In vivo efficacy studies on a 2nd degree burn wound model in Wistar rats showed an improved rate of wound contraction, histology (H&E and Van Gieson's staining) and pro-healing marker (hexosamine, hydroxyproline, etc.) expression in granular tissue compared to using the commercial dressing Neuskin (TM) and a cotton gauze control.

AB  - Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by proliferation of Philadelphia positive clonal pluripotent hematopoietic cells. Bleeding is a rare presentation of CML that can occur due to platelet dysfunction. Both pre-treatment and post-treatment platelet function abnormalities in CML have been described in the literature. We describe a rare case of childhood CML who presented with mucocutateous bleeding manifestations. On laboratory workup, a Glanzmann Thrombasthenia (GT) like platelet phenotype was demonstrated along with confirmation of diagnosis of CML in chronic phase. The acquired nature of platelet function defect was confirmed by demonstrating recovery of platelet anti-gens glycoprotein IIb/IIIa after achieving complete hematological response with Imatinib. Due to presenting complaint of bleeding diathesis and absence of hepatosplenomegaly, the case was undiagnosed for CML until the patient reported to us. Careful evaluation of complete blood counts, peripheral blood picture and detailed laboratory workup was the window to proper diagnosis and treatment in this case.

AB  - Purpose: Extraocular retinoblastoma with optic nerve invasion is treated by a multimodal protocol consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, enucleation, and adjuvant therapy. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) used for tumor restaging in these children after systemic chemotherapy administration.
   Methods: Contrast-enhanced MRI scan of orbits and brain was performed at diagnosis and patients were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After chemotherapy, MRI scan was repeated for tumor restaging and residual post-laminar thickening and/or enhancement of the affected optic nerve, if any, was recorded. MRI findings were correlated with histopathology in enucleated specimens. The main outcome measures were specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of MRI in predicting post-laminar invasion after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
   Results: A total of 46 eyes (46 patients) were studied. Optic nerve thickening on MRI had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 64.6-100%), 76.9% (95% CI: 61.7-87.4%), and 80.4% (95% CI: 66.8-89.4%), respectively. Optic nerve enhancement had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 85.7% (95% CI: 48.7-97.4%), 79.5 % (95% CI: 64.5-89.2%), and 80.4% (95% CI: 66.8-89.4%), respectively. Combined thickening and enhancement of the optic nerve had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100% (95% CI: 60.9-100%), 82.4% (95% CI: 66.5-91.7%), and 85% (95% CI: 70.9-92.9%), respectively.
   Conclusion: MRI is a valuable tool for restaging of retinoblastoma and predicting residual optic nerve disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Combined thickening and enhancement on MRI appeared to be a more reliable indicator of post-laminar invasion as compared to thickening or enhancement alone.

AB  - Background: With the rising incidence of CSA in India and absence of culturally competent tool to assess the impact of trauma, there is a dire need for development of a comprehensive scale to assess the impact of trauma on children. Thus, the present study aims to develop a multi-dimensional CSA tool for children aged between 7 and 13 years.
   Method: Qualitative research method of FGD/Key Interviews with 4 group participants (Parents, counsellors, mental health and medical professionals) and in-depth interview with children having history of CSA was conducted along with item pooling from existing scales. Scale domain and sub-constructs were identified through thematic analysis of the qualitative data and statements extracted through item pooling. Face and content validity was obtained followed by the administration of the scale on pilot sample of 30 children meeting selection criteria of the study.
   Results: 6 domains of the multi-dimensional impact of trauma was identified (i.e. Behavioral, Emotional, Cognition, Biological, Psychopathology and Social Functioning) which was constructed in the form of 85 scale statements across 6 domains and 48 sub-constructs on a 3-point Likert scale of response in both Hindi as well as English language. The scale was found to be having high reliability and average inter-item and inter-domain correlation. Modification of scale items based on pilot study findings and expert feedback analysis done to obtain a final scale containing 78 items.
   Discussion: Discussion done primarily in terms of scale's psychometric properties, its clinical & research implications, especially focusing on cultural competency of the scale.

AB  - T cells and Scavenger receptors are key parts of the innate immune machinery, playing significant roles in regulating immune homeostasis at the epithelial surface. The roles of these immune components are not yet characterized for the autoimmune skin disorder Pemphigus vulgaris (PV). Phenotyping and frequency of T cells estimated by flow cytometry have shown increased frequency of T cells (6<bold></bold>7% versus 4<bold></bold>4%) producing interferon- (IFN-; 35<bold></bold>2% versus 26<bold></bold>68%) in the circulation of patients compared with controls. Dual cytokine-secreting (IFN- and interleukin-4) T cells indicate the plasticity of these cells. The T cells of patients with PV have shown higher cytotoxic potential and the higher frequency of T cells producing IFN- shows T helper type 1 polarization. The increased expression of Scavenger receptors expression (CD36 and CD163) could be contributing to the elevated inflammatory environment and immune imbalance in this disease. Targeting the inflammatory T cells and Scavenger receptors may pave the way for novel therapeutics.

AB  - Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a glycoprotein which regulates bioavailability of sex steroid hormones. Interest in SHBG has escalated in recent years because of its inverse association with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes type II. This meta-analysis was performed to examine the associations of SHBG with PCOS and to correlate serum SHBG levels with various PCOS associated endocrine and metabolic dysregulation as well as to determine the effects of various therapeutic agents on serum SHBG levels in PCOS patients in order to assess the true accuracy of SHBG in the prediction of PCOS. A literature search was performed using Pub-Med, Science direct, google scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane library. A total of 675 relevant records were identified, of which 62 articles were included. Meta-analysis using a random-effects model was performed using STATA version 13 to calculate standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95 % CIs). SHBG levels in controls were significantly higher than that of PCOS patients (SMD= -0.83, 95%CI = -1.01, -0.64), with significant heterogeneity across studies (I-2= 93.9% and p=0.000). Our results suggest that the lower serum SHBG levels are associated with the risk of PCOS. SHBG may also play an important role in various metabolic disturbances in PCOS patients. Therapeutic interventions improved SHBG levels in PCOS women which further reduced PCOS associated complications. Therefore, SHBG levels may prove to be a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of PCOS.

AB  - Leydig cells are the principal steroidogenic cells of the testis. Leydig cells also secrete a number of growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) which has been shown to regulate both testicular steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis. The thyroid hormone, T-3,T- is known to stimulate steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. T-3 has also been shown to stimulate VEGF production in a variety of cell lines. However, studies regarding the effect of T-3 on VEGF synthesis and secretion by the Leydig cells were lacking. Therefore, we investigated the effect of T-3 on VEGF synthesis and secretion in a mouse Leydig tumour cell line, MLTC-1. The effect of T-3 was compared with that of LH/cAMP and hypoxia, two known stimulators of Leydig cell functions. The cells were treated with T-3, 8-Br-cAMP (a cAMP analogue), or CoCl2 (a hypoxia mimetic) and VEGF secreted in the cell supernatant was measured using ELISA. The mRNA levels of VEGF were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. In the MLTC-1 cells, T-3, 8-Br-cAMP, and CoCl2 stimulated VEGF mRNA levels and the protein secretion. T-3 also increased steroid secretion as well as HIF-1 protein levels, two well-established upstream regulators of VEGF. Inhibitors of steroidogenesis as well as HIF-1 resulted in inhibition of T-3-stimulated VEGF secretion by the MLTC-1 cells. This suggested a mediatory role of steroids and HIF-1 protein in T-3-stimulated VEGF secretion by MLTC-1 cells. The mediation by steroids and HIF-1 were independent of each other.Abbreviations: 8-Br-cAMP: 8-bromo - 3', 5' cyclic adenosine monophosphate; CoCl2: cobalt chloride; HIF-1: hypoxia inducible factor -1; LH: luteinizing hormone; T-3: 3, 5, 3'-L-triiodothyronine; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor

AB  - The deformity known as congenital idiopathic talipes equinovarus (CTEV) is probably the most common (1 to 2 in 1000 live births) congenital orthopedic condition requiring intensive treatment. With the perception that the treatment of idiopathic CTEV by extensive soft tissue release is often complicated by stiffness, recurrence, and the need for additional procedures, the minimally invasive Ponseti method has been accepted as the first line of treatment, which has achieved excellent results globally. The Ponseti method has achieved excellent results in children with idiopathic CTEV aged <= 2 years. However, the upper age limit for the Ponseti treatment has not yet been defined. We reviewed the published data to determine the efficacy of the Ponseti method in older children with neglected CTEV. (C) 2017 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. All rights reserved.

KW  - GROWTH
AB  - Background and Purpose-The computed tomographic angiography spot sign as a predictor of hematoma expansion is limited by its modest sensitivity and positive predictive value. It is possible that hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients is missed because of decompression of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) into the ventricular space. We hypothesized that revising hematoma expansion definitions to include intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) expansion will improve the predictive performance of the spot sign. Our objectives were to determine the proportion of ICH nonexpanders who actually have IVH expansion, determine the proportion of false-positive spot signs that have IVH expansion, and compare the known predictive performance of the spot sign to a revised definition incorporating IVH expansion.
   Methods-We analyzed patients from the multicenter PREDICT ICH spot sign study. We defined hematoma expansion as >= 6 mL or >= 33% ICH expansion or >2 mL IVH expansion and compared spot sign performance using this revised definition with the conventional 6 mL/33% definition using receiver operating curve analysis.
   Results-Of 311 patients, 213 did not meet the 6-mL/33% expansion definition (nonexpanders). Only 13 of 213 (6.1%) nonexpanders had >= 2 mL IVH expansion. Of the false-positive spot signs, 4 of 40 (10%) had >2 mL ventricular expansion. The area under the curve for spot sign to predict significant ICH expansion was 0.65 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.72), which was no different than when IVH expansion was added to the definition (area under the curve, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.71).
   Conclusions-Although IVH expansion does indeed occur in a minority of ICH nonexpanders, its inclusion into a revised hematoma expansion definition does not alter the predictive performance of the spot sign.

AB  - LETM is a common syndrome and the diagnosis of CNS lymphoma is not usually considered in the list of differentials. Primary CNS lymphoma can present as longitudinally extensive transverse myelopathy. Failure to suspect and evaluate leads to delay in diagnosis and treatment. PCNSL may be non contrast enhancing on gadolinium enhanced MRI. CSF analysis should be done preferably before starting corticosteroids as it is usual practice in treatment of transverse myelitis, as steroids may lead to transient improvement and mask the correct diagnosis. Repeated CSF examinations may be needed to clinch the diagnosis. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Predatory journals (PJ) exploit the open-access model promising high acceptance rate and fast track publishing without proper peer review. At minimum, PJ are eroding the credibility of the scientific literature in the health sciences as they actually boost the propagation of errors. In this article, we identify issues with PJ and provide several responses, from international and interdisciplinary perspectives in health sciences. Authors, particularly researchers with limited previous experience with international publications, need to be careful when considering potential journals for submission, due to the current existence of large numbers of PJ. Universities around the world, particularly in developing countries, might develop strategies to discourage their researchers from submitting manuscripts to PJ or serving as members of their editorial committees.

AB  - Background: Glaucoma (POAG) is a kind of neurodegenerative disease known to be closely associated with stress and adverse quality of life (QOL). Stress has also been shown to be involved in etiopathogenesis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Complementary treatment in form of Meditation has been reported to improve QOL, brain oxygenation and decrease markers of stress. With this premise, a randomized controlled trial was carried out to assess the effect of Meditation on intraocular pressure, subjective QOL and objective markers of stress and brain oxygenation in patients with POAG.
   Methods: Sixty patients were randomized into intervention and control groups. Intervention group underwent 45 minutes of Meditation daily for 6 weeks in addition to standard medical treatment while controls received only standard medical treatment. Inclusion criteria were patients with POAG, age >45 years, best corrected visual acuity >6/60. Patients with other ocular co-morbid conditions contributing to vision loss, systemic diseases, patients already practicing meditation in any form were excluded. An assessment of TOP, brain oxygenation using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), QOL (WHO-BREF QOL) and stress markers in serum (cortisol, beta-endorphins, interleukin-6, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), reactive oxygen species) was made at baseline and at 6 weeks.
   Results: 21 female and 39 male patients were enrolled with a mean age of 57.28 +/- 9.37 years. All parameters were comparable between two groups at baseline. At 6 weeks mean level of TOP decreased significantly in intervention group (15.9 +/- 1.8 mmHg to 14.4 +/- 1.21 mm Hg, p-value 0.0001) as compared to control group (15.7 +/- 1.4 mmHg to 15.65 +/- 1.41, p-value 0.41). fNIRS showed significant improvement in oxygenated hemoglobin change (Delta HbO) in intervention group in the prefrontal cortex (p-value <0.0001) as compared to control group (p-value 0.52). WHO-BREF QOL score increased significantly in intervention group (86.6 +/- 6.16 to 93.3 +/- 5.66, p-value 0.0001) as compared to control (89 +/- 7.25 to 89.07 +/- 3.24, p-value 0.74). Mean serum cortisol decreased significantly in intervention group (497 +/- 46.37 ng/ml to 447 +/- 53.78 ng/ml, p-value 0.01) as compared to control group (519.75 +/- 24.5 to 522.58 +/- 26.63 ng/ml, p-value 0.64). Mean beta-endorphin levels increased significantly (33 +/- 5.52pg/ml to 43.27pg/ml, p-value < 0.0001) as compared to control group (34.78 +/- 4.1pg/ml to 36.33pg +/- 4.07pg/ml p-value 0.27). Interleukin-6 decreased significantly in intervention group (2.2 +/- 0.5 ng/ml to 1.35 +/- 0.32 ng/ml, p-value < 0.0001) as compared to control group (2.03 +/- 0.37 to 2.17 +/- 0.34 ng/ml p-value 0.25). BDNF increased significantly in intervention group (52.24 +/- 6.71 to 63.25 +/- 13.48 ng/ml p-value 0.004) as compared to control group (53.23 +/- 5.82 to 54.42 +/- 5.66 ng/ml p-value 0.54). ROS decreased significantly in intervention group (1596.19 +/- 179.14 to 1261 +/- 244.31 RLU/min/10(4) neutrophils p -value 0.0001) as compared to control group (1577.5 +/- 172.02 to 1662.5 +/- 84.75 RLU/min/10(4) neutrophils p-value 0.16).
   Conclusions: A short term course of Meditation was associated with significant improvement in brain oxygenation and QOL along with a reduction in TOP and stress markers. Meditation may be a useful as an adjunct to standard treatment in patients with POAG and potentially decrease the risk of glaucoma progression.

AB  - Background: Metformin, a commonly used oral antidiabetic agent, is known to possess pleiotropic antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. In this study, we evaluated the effect of metformin on pulmonary fibrosis and the mechanism underlying its effect.
   Methods: Pulmonary fibrosis was induced experimentally with bleomycin (0.035 U/g, i.p.) given twice weekly for four weeks. Metformin (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg/day, p.o) was given seven days prior to first injection of bleomycin and continued till 28 days after starting bleomycin injection. Prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day, p.o) was the standard control.
   Results: Administration of bleomycin caused pulmonary fibrosis in rats as evidenced by characteristic structural changes in histopathology, increased inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, elevated lipid peroxidation marker, depleted endogenous antioxidants and increased inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6). There were also increased levels of TGF-beta, Smad2/3, ERK1/2, p38, JNK, fibronectin, hydroxyproline and type I collagen in bleomycin-control group. All these changes were ameliorated by high dose metformin. It restored structural, biochemical and molecular changes towards normal. This protective effect may be attributed to activation of AMPK by metformin, with consequent reduction in oxidative stress and TGF-beta. Moreover, this protective effect was superior to prednisolone as metformin had additional antioxidant and antifibrotic properties.
   Conclusion: These data suggest that metformin protects against bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis through activation of AMPK and amelioration of TGF-beta signaling pathways.

AB  - Background: Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a novel, noninvasive technique for assessing hepatic steatosis. However, its role in morbidly obese individuals is unclear. The effect of bariatric surgery on inflammation and fibrosis needs to be explored.
   Objectives: To assess the utility of CAP for assessment of hepatic steatosis in morbidly obese individuals and evaluate the effect of bariatric surgery on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis.
   Setting: A tertiary care academic hospital.
   Methods: Baseline details of anthropometric data, laboratory parameters, FibroScan (XL probe), and liver biopsy were collected. Follow-up liver biopsy was done at 1 year.
   Results: Of the 124 patients screened, 76 patients were included; mean body mass index was 45.2 +/- 7.1 kg/m(2). FibroScan success rate was 87.9%. The median liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and CAP were 7.0 (5.0-9.5) kPa and 326.5 (301-360.5) dB/m, respectively. On liver histopathology, severe steatosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis were present in 5.3% and 15.8%; significant fibrosis (>= stage 2) and cirrhosis in 39.5% and 2.6%, respectively. Area under receiver operator characteristic curve of LSM for prediction of significant fibrosis (F2-4 versus F0-1) and advanced fibrosis (F3-4 versus F0-2) was.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: .52.77) and .83 (95% CI: .72.94), respectively. The area under receiver operator characteristic curve of CAP for differentiating moderate hepatic steatosis (S2-3 versus S0-1) and severe hepatic steatosis (S3 versus S0-2) was .74 (95% CI: .62.86) and .82 (95% CI: .73.91), respectively. At 1-year follow-up, 32 patients underwent liver biopsy. In these patients, there was significant improvement in hepatic steatosis (P = .001), lobular inflammation (P = .033), ballooning (P < .001), and fibrosis (P = .003). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was resolved in 3 of 4 (75%) patients. LSM and CAP significantly declined.
   Conclusions: LSM and CAP are feasible and accurate at diagnosing advanced fibrosis and severe hepatic steatosis in morbidly obese individuals. Bariatric surgery is associated with significant improvement in LSM, CAP, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. (C) 2018 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. All rights reserved.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY

KW  - DEPTH
AB  - Objective: Susceptibility artefacts from bones and bowel, geometric distortion makes diffusion imaging of the pelvis difficult. We discuss the difficulties of single-shot-echo-planar (ss-ep) DWI and evaluate a new diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) technique-readout segmented echo planar (rs-ep) DWI in endometrial carcinoma and discuss the imaging physics.
   Methods: Institute review board approval was obtained and five consecutive patients underwent both rs-ep and ss-ep-DWI of the female pelvis and two radiologists compared the images. ROIs were drawn on the endometrium on the b400 images-signal to noise was calculated and compared using F test.
   Results: The rs-ep-DWI had less imaging artefacts, less bowel-related susceptibility and geometric distortion compared to ss-ep-DWI. There was statistically significant greater SNR in ss-ep-DWI compared to rs-ep-DWI. This resulted in increased graininess of the readout segmented diffusion images. Artefacts in SS-EPI-DTI may make fibre tracking fallacious and rs-ep DTI may have fewer artefacts.
   Conclusion: rs-ep-DWI is a new imaging arsenal in imaging of the female pelvis in general; however further reduction in imaging time and improvement in signal to noise may be desirable.
   Advances in Knowlegde: rs-ep-DWI affords lesser imaging artefacts from susceptibility and geometric distortion; at a higher time dividend and may find a place in oncological imaging.

AB  - Squamous cell carcinoma is known to occur as a serious complication of chronic burns, scars, and ulcers, but very rarely has it been reported to occur in a long-neglected meningocele. The authors wish to present the case of a 21-year-old man who presented to us when a previously asymptomatic meningocele developed a squamous cell carcinoma on the meningocele sac. The squamous cell carcinoma was excised in toto, followed by excision of the redundant meningocele sac. The neural placode was closed and dural closure done with an artificial dural patch. Reconstruction of the defect thus created was performed by a lumbar perforator-based reverse latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap. The patient did not develop any postoperative neurological deficits and made an uneventful recovery in the postoperative period. He received adjuvant radiation therapy and is doing well at 4 months' follow-up. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - D Objectives: Solid variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (SVPTC) is rare, differing from classical PTC (cPTC) in architecture and outcome. We evaluated the cytomorphology of SVPTC cases to assess the feasibility of a preoperative diagnosis. Study Design: SVPTC cases were evaluated for architecture, nuclear features, and Bethesda category and were compared with noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features/follicular variant of PTC (NIFTP/FVPTC), cPTC, and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC). Results: Nine SVPTCs, 29 NIFTP/FVPTCs, 12 cPTCs, and 4 PDTCs were included. The predominant architecture in most SVPTCs was solid fragment, which is helpful in differentiating them from NIFTP/FVPTC (p < 0.001) and cPTC (p = 0.006) but not from PDTC. The presence of microfollicles led to misinterpretation as NIFTP/FVPTC/follicular neoplasm in 4 patients. All but 1 SVPTC showed diffuse nuclear features. Intranuclear pseudoinclusions (INIs) were seen in 67% of SVPTCs as compared to 83% of cPTCs, 14% of NIFTP/FVPTCs (p = 0.005), and none of PDTCs. SVPTC cases were commonly (78%) categorized as intermediate/suspicious. Conclusions: The presence of solid fragments and lack of true papillae are helpful in differentiating SVPTC from cPTC. Solid fragments, trabeculae, the extent of nuclear features, and INIs should be looked for in cases with prominent microfollicles for distinguishing SVPTC from NIFTP/FVPTC. None of the features were helpful in differentiating SVPTC from PDTC. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Study Objectives: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent risk factor for stroke. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on prevention of new vascular events among patients with stroke and OSA.
   Methods: Consecutive conscious patients presenting with first imaging-confirmed arterial stroke were included, 6 weeks or more after ictus. All patients underwent clinical and polysomnography (PSG) testing. Patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of > 15 events/h were randomized to posttitration nightly CPAP treatment and non-CPAP (received best medical treatment) groups. On follow-up at 3, 6, and 12 months from randomization, evaluation was carried out for any new vascular events as the primary outcome measure, and for clinical stroke outcomes (using the Barthel Index and modified Rankin scale) and neuropsychological parameters as the secondary outcome measures.
   Results: Among the 679 patients with stroke who were screened, 116 reported for PSG, 83 had AHI > 15 events/h, and 70 (34 in CPAP and 36 in non-CPAP) were randomized. Thirteen patients could not be randomized because of a lack of CPAP devices. Four patients crossed over from the CPAP to the non-CPAP group. Age (mean age 53.41 +/- 9.85 in CPAP versus 52.69 +/- 13.23 years in non-CPAP, P = .81) and sex distribution (24 males in CPAP versus 33 males in non-CPAP, P = .79) were similar in both groups. At 12-month follow-up, there was 1 vascular event (3.33%) in the CPAP group and 6 events (15%) in the non-CPAP group (P = .23). Modified Rankin scale score improvement by = 1 at 12-month follow-up was found in significantly more patients in the CPAP group than in the non-CPAP group (53% versus 27%).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest significantly better stroke outcomes and statistically nonsignificant favorable outcomes in terms of recurrence of vascular events for patients with stroke and OSA who use CPAP treatment.

AB  - Purpose: To report in vivo confocal features in a clinical case series of patients with sclerokeratitis presenting as crystalline keratopathy.Methods: Five cases of crystalline keratopathy following sclerokeratitis are described. Confocal microscopic images of the cornea were captured in all cases to confirm the diagnosis by evaluating the morphology of the crystals.Results: Unilateral and non-progressive peripheral crystalline keratopathy manifested after previous episodes of sclerokeratitis in the involved eye. Confocal microscopy revealed numerous, discrete, hyperreflective, needle-like, shiny crystals in the anterior and posterior stromal layers of the cornea. These deposits were oriented randomly and showed occasional confluence. An extensive ophthalmic and systemic evaluation did not reveal any other contributory factors.Conclusion: Crystalline keratopathy, probably resulting from an immune-mediated response, is a possible manifestation of sclerokeratitis. This should be considered during long-term follow-up of such patients and differentiated from infectious crystalline keratopathy.

AB  - Background: Sitting position is preferred during posterior fossa surgeries as it provides better anatomical orientation and a clear surgical field. However, its use has been declining due to its propensity to cause life-threatening complications. This study was carried out to analyze the perioperative complications and postoperative course of children who underwent neurosurgery in sitting position.
   Materials and Methods: Medical records of 97 children (< 18 years) who underwent neurosurgery in sitting position over a period of 12 years, were retrospectively analyzed. Data pertaining to the perioperative course such as demographics, hemodynamic changes, various complications, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and neurological status at discharge were recorded. Statistical analysis was done by chi-square and Mann-Whitney test, and a P value < 0.05 was considered as significant.
   Results: The median age of these children was 12 (3-18) years. Hemodynamic instability was observed in 12 (12.3%) children. A total of 38 episodes of venous air embolism (VAE) were encountered in 21 (21.6%) children; nine experienced multiple episodes. VAE was associated with hypotension in five (23.8%) and desaturation in four (19.1%) children. Six children presented with postoperative tension pneumocephalus; three were managed with twist drill burr-hole evacuation. Brainstem handling was the most common indication (42.5%) for the requirement of elective postoperative ventilation. The duration of ICU and hospital stays were comparable among the children who experienced VAE and those who did not (P > 0.05). Neurological status at discharge was also comparable between these two groups (P = 0.83).
   Conclusions: This study observed a lesser incidence of VAE and associated complications. Tension pneumocephalus was managed successfully without any adverse outcome. Hence, it is believed that with meticulous anesthetic and surgical techniques, sitting position can safely be practiced in children undergoing neurosurgery.

AB  - The recently proposed molecular genetic criteria promise improved risk-prediction in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). This study assesses their utility in BCR-ABL1 negative pediatric B-ALL, particularly with respect to end-induction minimal residual disease (MRD). The DNA was analyzed for copy number alterations in CDKN2A/B, PAX5, IKZF1, and other genes. Seventy-six cases with median age 7years (2months-18years) included MRD-positive (24; 32%), and MRD negative-standard(20; 26%), intermediate(20; 26%), & high risk (12;16%) cases. The risk classification was based on age, initial total leukocyte count, central nervous system involvement, cytogenetics, day 8 prednisolone response and MRD status after induction chemotherapy. The genetic profile based on Moorman's criteria identified two subgroups with different event free survival (EFS) (0.77 vs. 0.38;p=.045) and overall survival (OS) (0.90 vs. 0.30;p=.037) in the MRD-negative intermediate-risk group. The genetic profile also separated two subgroups with different EFS (0.75 vs. 0.41;p=.036) in the MRD-positive group, however the OS was not different (0.75 vs. 0.57;p=.293).

AB  - AimHenoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), a primary vasculitis, characterized by purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis and renal involvement, is predominantly a disease of childhood. However, rarely it can occur in adults in whom it is believed to be a more severe form with poor renal outcomes. We aimed to answer if the age of onset affected the clinical spectrum and renal outcomes of the disease in a north Indian population. Hence, we studied the differences in clinical spectrum and renal outcomes between adult-onset HSP and childhood-onset HSP.
   MethodsCase records of all adult patients diagnosed with HSP (onset 18 years) over the last 25 years in our department (1992-2017) were retrieved. Data on clinical features, lab abnormalities and outcomes were extracted and compared with that in pediatric HSP patients (onset < 18 years) seen during the same period.
   ResultsA total of 87 patients, including 30 adults and 57 children, were seen during this period. Compared to children, most of the adults had purpura as the first clinical manifestation (86.7% vs. 56.1%, P < 0.01) whereas abdominal pain was only rarely the initial symptom in adults (10.0% vs. 36.8%, P < 0.02). During the disease course, adults had a higher frequency of joint involvement as compared to children (90.0% vs. 43.9%, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the frequency of renal involvement (60.0% vs. 50.9%, P = NS) and gastrointestinal involvement (66.7% vs. 84.2%, P = NS) between adults and children. Outcomes were good in both groups and most adults and children achieved complete recovery (83.3% and 86.0%, respectively). There was no difference in the frequency of immunosuppressive treatment required by the two groups. None of the patients developed renal insufficiency on follow-up.
   ConclusionCompared to children, adults with HSP seldom have abdominal pain as the first clinical manifestation while joint involvement is seen more commonly in them during the disease course.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate phenotypic differences among familial and non-familial JOAG patients.
   Methods: First degree relatives of unrelated JOAG patients were screened for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. JOAG probands were grouped as familial or non-familial and phenotypic differences in terms of age of onset, gender, baseline untreated IOP, presence angle dysgenesis, and refractive error was compared between the two groups.
   Results: Out of 368 unrelated JOAG patients, 134 in whom all first degree relatives had been examined were included in the study. The non-familial JOAG (n = 96) had similar age of onset as familial JOAG (n = 38); (p = 0.076) but had greater male preponderance (p = 0.046), and had the higher baseline IOP (p = 0.044) compared to familial JOAG. However, on adjustment using the Bonferroni correction, the observed differences were not found to be significant. Both groups had similar proportion of patients with angle dysgenesis (p = 0.46) and high myopia (p = 0.72).
   Conclusions: Non-familial JOAG were not found to be phenotypically different from the familial JOAG patients in this cohort.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is a clinical problem and recently we have shown that 82.5% of our entire study cohort had inadequate serum 25(OH)D levels. In this study, we analysed serum 25(OH)D levels of juvenile patients admitted to the Burjeel Hospital of VPS Health care in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from October 2012 to September 2014. Out of a total of 7883 juvenile patients considered in this study, almost 58.1% of females and 43.3% of males in the age group of 1-18 years were found to have low serum 25(OH)D levels (<50 nmol/L). According to the coefficient of variation, females had significantly higher variability among juveniles (63.8%) than males (49.9%). Among the juveniles group of patients, age appears to be an important determining factor for defining vitamin D deficiency.The risk of deficiency (<30 nmol/L) was found to be present in 31.4% of patients in the age group of 10-12 years, followed by 50.4% of patients in the age group of 13-15 years and 52.9% of patients in the age group of 16-18 years. The analysed age groups of females were found to have lower levels of 25(OH)D than males. It is important and perhaps alarming to note that such high rate of vitamin D deficiency is present in the juvenile age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti-IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti-IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti-IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 29 September 2017. We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 24 January 2018.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing anti-IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager.
   Main results
   Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double-blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti-IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function.

AB  - Pompe disease (PD) is a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by glycogen accumulation in muscle, with infantile-onset (IOPD) and late-onset (LOPD) types. Nineteen cases of PD were diagnosed over a 14-year period on muscle biopsy by ultrastructural examination. Pools of glycogen (intralysosomal and cytoplasmic) and excessive phagocytosis were seen in myofibers on electron microscopy. Glycogen was noted in endothelial cells in IOPD. Although PD accounts for a small fraction of muscle diseases, timely accurate diagnosis is imperative as it is treatable. Ultrastructural examination is necessary to confirm the diagnosis in cases with non-diagnostic light microscopic features, especially in adult LOPD patients.

AB  - The vital signs are an integral part of clinical methods. In diabetes, determination of plasma glucose can be taken as the fifth vital sign. The sixth vital sign is well being, which can easily be measured by two item questionnaires designed to assess distress, depression and coping skills. This sign is essential for the screening and follow up of persons living with diabetes, as it provides an idea of quality of care, helps plan therapeutic interventions, and serves as a surrogate for prognosis or outcome. Inclusion of the sixth vital sign reflects the relevance of the bio-psychosocial model of health to diabetes care.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate intraoperative and postoperative outcomes with chop or matrix lens fragmentation patterns in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery.Methods: Prospective comparative study of 66 eyes with grade III-IV nuclear sclerosis was conducted at an apex tertiary care ophthalmic center. Cases were randomly allocated to undergo femtosecond laser pretreatment using matrix pattern (group I; n=33) or chop pattern (group II; n=33) of lens fragmentation (LenSx laser platform), followed by phacoemulsification. The primary outcome measures were intraoperative phacoemulsification parameters and postoperative anterior chamber (AC) flare. Secondary outcome measures were intraoperative complications, postoperative central macular thickness, visual acuity, and endothelial cell counts. Follow-up was performed on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 30.Results: Phacoemulsification parameters including cumulative dissipated energy (p=0.008), ultrasonic time (p=0.001), aspiration time (p<0.001), and total duration (p=0.001) were significantly less in group I. The AC flare was 9.84.6 in group I and 15.4 +/- 6.0 in group II (p<0.001) on POD 1, and the difference persisted at 1month. A highly significant positive correlation was observed between the total duration of phacoemulsification and AC flare (p<0.001). No case developed cystoid macular edema. The postoperative specular counts were significantly less in group II on POD 1 (p=0.036) and POD 30 (p=0.02). There was no difference in visual acuity between the two groups, and intraoperative complications were not observed in any case.Conclusion: A decrease in phacoemulsification time and energy is observed after femtosecond laser pretreatment with the matrix pattern of lens fragmentation as compared to the chop pattern. The endothelial cell loss and postoperative inflammation is significantly less with the matrix pattern, and the inflammation correlates with the duration of phacoemulsification.

AB  - Wealth of structural data on theurapeutic targets in complex with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and advances in molecular modeling algorithms present exciting opportunities in the field of novel biologic design. Interleukin 23 (IL23), a well-known drug target for autoimmune diseases, in complex with mAb 7G10 offers prospect to design potent lead antibodies by traversing the complete epitope-paratope interface. Herein, key interactions aiding antibody-based neutralization in IL23-7G10 complex are resolute through PyMOL, LigPlot(+), Antibody i-Patch, DiscoTope and FoIdX. Six amino acids Ser31, Val33, Asn55, Lys59 in heavy chain and His34, Ser93 in light chain are subjected to in silico mutagenesis with residues Met, Trp, Ile, Leu and Arg. A set of 431 mutant macromolecules are outlined. Binding affinities of these molecules with IL23 are estimated through protein-protein docking by employing ZDOCK, ClusPro and RosettaDock. Subsequently, the macromolecules revealed comparable result with 7G10 are cross validated through binding free-energy calculations by applying Molecular Mechanics/Poisson Boltzman Surface Area method in CHARMM. Thirty nine designed theoretical antibodies showed improved outcome in all evaluations; from these, top 10 molecules showed at least nine unit better binding affinity compared to the known mAb. These molecules have the potential to act as lead antibodies. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations too favored prospective of best ranked molecule to have therapeutic implications in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Background Anorectal malformation (ARM) is a common congenital anomaly with a wide clinical spectrum. Recently, many genetic and molecular studies have been conducted worldwide highlighting the contribution of genetic factors in its etiology. We summarize the current literature on such genetic factors.
   Materials and methods Literature search was done using different combinations of terms related to genetics in anorectal malformations. From 2012 to June 2017, articles published in the English literature and studies conducted on human population were included.
   Observations and results A paradigm shift was observed from the earlier studies concentrating on genetic aberrations in specific pathways to genome wide arrays exploring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs) in ARM patients. Rare CNVs (including 79 genes) and SNPs have been found to genetically contribute to ARM. Out of disrupted 79 genes one such putative gene is DKK4. Down regulation of CDX-1 gene has also been implicated in isolated ARM patients. In syndromic ARM de novo microdeletion at 17q12 and a few others have been identified.
   Conclusion Major genetic aberrations proposed in the pathogenesis of ARM affect members of the Wnt, Hox (homebox) genes, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Gli2, Bmp4, Fgf and CDX1 signalling pathways; probable targets of future molecular gene therapy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Though Unani medications have been used for centuries to treat psoriasis, there is paucity of published studies which have systematically evaluated their efficacy and safety. This study was conducted to establish non-inferiority of Unani medications (oral UNIM-401 and topical UNIM-403) vs psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) sol in treatment of moderate-severe chronic plaque psoriasis (CPP) in achieving psoriasis area severity index (PASI) 75 at 12 wk and to estimate proportion of patients who relapsed in follow up period of 12 weeks, after having achieved PASI 50.
   Methods: In this randomized, controlled trial patients with CPP were block randomized to receive either Unani treatment (147 patients) or PUVA sol (140 patients) for 12 weeks. Percentage reduction in PASI was determined in each patient at 12 wk to calculate number of patients who achieved PASI 75 as also to estimate median of percentage reduction in PASI in each group. All patients who achieved PASI 50 at 12 weeks were followed up for another 12 wk to determine proportion of patients who relapsed.
   Results: Of the 287 patients randomized, 84 of 147 in Unani group and 67 of 140 in PUVA sol group completed 12 weeks of treatment. On intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the response in patients on Unani medication was not inferior to those receiving PUVA sol, in attaining PASI 75 (16.3% in Unani group vs 15.7% in the PUVA sol group). Median of percentage reduction of PASI at 12 wk from baseline in Unani group (68.2%; -60, 100) and PUVA sol group (63%; -15.7, 100) was comparable. Proportion of patients who relapsed at 24 wk was comparable in both groups. However, frequency of clinical side effects was significantly higher (P= 0.001) in PUVA sol group (16.4%) compared to Unani group (2%).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of the present study indicated that oral UNIM-401 and topical UNIM-403 were effective and well tolerated therapeutic options in patients with moderate-severe CPP.

AB  - Background: Clubfoot is a three-dimensional deformity of the foot in which the foot is twisted in three mutually perpendicular planes from the normal shape of the foot. Of the various treatment methods that are available to manage clubfoot, non-operative approaches are preferred. The conventional non-operative method of treatment is to apply a series of casts to the infant's clubfoot to gradually manipulate its position. However, prolonged use of casts can result in skin rash, skin dehydration and ulcers on the soft skin of an infant. Treatment using orthosis represents an alternative non-operative and convenient technique because an orthosis can be put on and taken off at any time.
   Methods: In the present study, an orthosis was developed according to the rotation of three mutually perpendicular planes and was subsequently tested on five patients over the duration of one week.
   Findings: In all five cases, the desired incremental correction to the clubfoot was achieved through the one week intervention with the orthosis. No form of rash, dehydration, ulcers, and so on were observed on the skin of any baby involved in the study during or following application of the orthosis.
   Interpretation: By using the developed orthosis, partial correction of the clubfoot deformity was achieved over a short period of time. However the widespread use of this device for extended durations and with a larger number of patients will generate further evidence of the extent to which this orthosis can reliably treat clubfoot.

AB  - Purpose Severely subluxated crystalline lenses pose a difficult situation to anterior segment surgeons and can only be managed surgically by removal of the lens as well as the capsular bag. Several techniques have been described in literature for the management of such cases. We describe a modified technique of endocapsular lens aspiration by the limbal route for lens extraction through small incisions on the cornea.
   Patients and methods Thirty-two eyes of 16 consecutive patients with severely subluxated crystalline lenses were recruited in the study. All eyes underwent a modified technique of lens aspiration within the capsular bag using a single instrument, vitrectomy cutter, and irrigation cannula, followed by sacrificing of the capsular bag. The patients were either left aphakic or implanted with an open loop anterior chamber intraocular lens (ACIOL Kelman Multiflex) and prospectively followed up for a period of 3 months.
   Results The mean age of the patients was 9 years 3 months +/- 3 years (range 5-15 yrs). All eyes underwent complete lens aspiration within the capsular bag with no dislocation of the lens matter. ACIOL was inserted in 22 eyes (68.7%) and 10 eyes (31.2%) were left aphakic. All the surgeries were uneventful. The mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 3 months post surgery was 0.47 +/- 0.11 logMAR which was significantly better than pre-operative BCVA (P = 0.001). The percentage endothelial cell loss at 3 months was 7.1%. There was no evidence of glaucoma, corneal decompensation, or retinal detachment. The astigmatism which increased from 1.45D +/- 086 preoperatively to 3.76D +/- 2.02 1 week post-operatively due to sutures reduced to 1.97D +/- 0.81 post suture removal at 3 months.
   Conclusion The modified technique of endocapsular lens aspiration proves to be a simple and effective method of removal of the lens-capsular bag complex in severely subluxated lenses.

AB  - Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have decreased both time span and cost for sequencing the whole bacterial genome. High-throughput Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has led to the generation of enormous data concerning microbial populations publically available across various repositories. As a consequence, it has become possible to study and compare the genomes of different bacterial strains within a species or genus in terms of evolution, ecology and diversity. Studying the pan-genome provides insights into deciphering microevolution, global composition and diversity in virulence and pathogenesis of a species. It can also assist in identifying drug targets and proposing vaccine candidates. The effective analysis of these large genome datasets necessitates the development of robust tools. Current methods to develop pan-genome do not support direct input of raw reads from the sequencer machine but require preprocessing of reads as an assembled protein/gene sequence file or the binary matrix of orthologous genes/proteins. We have designed an easy-to-use integrated pipeline, NGSPanPipe, which can directly identify the pan-genome from short reads. The output from the pipeline is compatible with other pan-genome analysis tools. We evaluated our pipeline with other methods for developing pan-genome, i.e. reference-based assembly and de novo assembly using simulated reads of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The single script pipeline (pipeline. pl) is applicable for all bacterial strains. It integrates multiple in-house Perl scripts and is freely accessible from https://github.com/Biomedinformatics/NGSPanPipe.

AB  - Background: Our objectives were to evaluate the etiology of short stature, assess the prevalence of idiopathic short stature (ISS) and assess the growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis in children with ISS.
   Methods: A stepwise diagnostic evaluation was done in 394 children aged 4-16 years with short stature. Children with no definitive etiology were labeled as ISS. In these children, baseline IGF-1, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and stimulated IGF-1 after administration of GH for 4 days were measured.
   Results: Hypothyroidism (in 18.1%) and ISS (in 15.5%) were the commonest causes of short stature. In children with ISS (n = 61), the mean baseline and stimulated IGF-1 standard deviation scores (SDSs) were -1.2 +/- 1.0 and -0.3 +/- 1.4, respectively, with levels below -2 SDS in 13 (21%) and six (10%) children, respectively. In 33 (54%) of the ISS patients, response to GH was suboptimal (increment in the IGF-1 level <40%). There was no difference in the mean peak GH, IGFBP-3 and baseline and stimulated IGF-1 levels between children with familial and non-familial ISS. A significant positive correlation of height SDS with baseline IGF-1 SDS (r = 0.28, p = 0.026), stimulated IGF-1 SDS (r = 0.32, p = 0.010) and Delta IGF-1 SDS (r = 0.26, p = 0.036) was observed in children with ISS.
   Conclusions: Hypothyroidism and ISS were the commonest etiologies for short stature. The baseline IGF-1 was below -2 SDS in 21% and the increment after GH stimulation was suboptimal in 54% of children, indicating that a substantial proportion of children with ISS had an impaired GH-IGF axis.

AB  - An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure prednisolone have been developed. An antibody was raised in rabbits using prednisolone-21-hemisuccinate (PSL-21-HS) conjugated to bovine serum albumin. Similarly, PSL-21-HS was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase to prepare enzyme conjugate. The developed assay has been validated for sensitivity and effective displacement at 50% of the assay were 0.078 and 2.64ng/mL, respectively. This assay showed cross-reaction with only 4 steroids - i.e. progesterone 1.76%, 17-OH progesterone 5.89%, cortisol 7.69% and prednisone 1.13%, out of 55 analogous steroids. The percent recovery of prednisolone from the exogenously spiked human serum pools was in the range of 94.84-100.17%. The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged from 5.79% to 8.00% and from 3.23% to 8.63%, respectively. The serum prednisolone values obtained by this method correlated well with the commercially available kit and found to be 0.93.

AB  - Evidence on influenza vaccine effectiveness from low and middle countries (LMICs) is limited due to limited institutional capacities; lack of adequate resources; and lack of interest by ministries of health for influenza vaccine introduction. There are concerns that the highest ethical standards will be compromised during trials in LMICs leading to mistrust of clinical trials. These factors pose regulatory and operational challenges to researchers in these countries. We conducted a community-based vaccine trial to assess the efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccine and inactivated influenza vaccine in rural north India. Key regulatory challenges included obtaining regulatory approvals, reporting of adverse events, and compensating subjects for trial-related injuries; all of which were required to be completed in a timely fashion. Key operational challenges included obtaining audio-visual consent; maintaining a low attrition rate; and administering vaccines during a narrow time period before the influenza season, and under extreme heat. We overcame these challenges through advanced planning, and sustaining community engagement. We adapted the trial procedures to cope with field conditions by conducting mock vaccine camps; and planned for early morning vaccination to mitigate threats to the cold chain. These lessons may help investigators to confront similar challenges in other LMICs.

AB  - Telomere length (TL) is maintained by telomere capping protein complex called shelterin complex. We studied the possible involvement and biomarker potential of shelterin complex molecules in naive multiple myeloma (MM) patients and controls. TL, relative telomerase activity (RTA), real-time PCR and Western blotting were performed in bonemarrow sample of 70 study subjects (patients=50; controls=20). Significantly lowered mean TL, increased RTA and higher mRNA expression of shelterin molecules were observed in patients, while PIN2/TERF1 interacting telomerase inhibitor 1 (PINX1) showed lower mRNA expression. Significantly increased protein expression of telomeric repeat binding factor 2 (TERF2), protection of telomeres 1, adrenocortical dysplasia homolog, Tankyrase 1 and telomere reverse transcriptase were observed in MM patients. Significant correlation was observed among genes and of genes with clinical parameters. In conclusion, our findings showed alteration of these molecules at mRNA and protein levels suggested their involvement in disease progression. Optimal sensitivity and specificity of TERF2 and RTA on receiver operating characteristics curve analysis and univariate analysis demonstrated their biomarkers potential in better prediction of disease course.

AB  - Background: Cancer is a major global health issue. It causes extensive individual suffering and gives a huge burden on the health care in society. Despite extensive research and different tools have been developed it still remains a challenge for early detection of this disease. FTIR imaging has been used to diagnose and differentiate the molecular differences between normal and diseased tissues.
   Methods: Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) is able to measure biochemical changes in tissue, cell and biofluids based on the vibrational signature of their components. This technique enables to the distribution and structure of lipids, proteins, nucleic acids as well as other metabolites. These differences depended on the type and the grade of cancer.
   Results: We emphasize here, that the FTIR spectroscopy and imaging can be considered as a promising technique and will find its place on the detection of this dreadful disease because of high sensitivity, accuracy and inexpensive technique. Now the medical community started using and accepting this technique for early stage cancer detection. We discussed this technique and the several challenges in its application for the diagnosis of cancer in regards of sample preparations, data interpretation, and data analysis. The sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs on individual specific has also discussed.
   Conclusion: So far progressed has done with the FTIR imaging in understanding of cancer disease pathology. However, more research is needed in this field and it is necessary to understand the morphology and biology of the sample before using the spectroscopy and imaging because invaluable information to be figured out.

AB  - Objective: To assess the accuracy of splenic stiffness (SS) measured by 2D-shear wave elastography (SWE) for predicting variceal bleeding in the patients with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction (EHPVO).
   Methods: 52 patients with EHPVO (mean age: 22.29 years; 26 each males and females) were included in the study after obtaining approval from the institute ethics committee. All patients initially underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy followed by ultrasonography, including 2D-SWE on the Aixplorer Supersonic Imagine scanner. The SS was measured through the anterior abdominal wall and an average of three measurements was taken. The SS was then compared with clinical symptoms, variceal grade, and other ultrasonography (USG) parameters. USG parameters were also compared with variceal grade.
   Results: The mean SS was 44.92 +/- 12.35 kPa. There was no significant difference in the mean SS of patients with high grade varices (44.30 kPa; n = 25) from those with low grade varices (46.91 kPa; n = 20). The ROC analysis showed a poor area under the curve of 0.477 for the prediction of high grade varices by the SS. The SS did not show any significant correlation with other ultrasonography parameters except splenic size, with which there was a weak but significant correlation. The measurement of SS by 2D-SWE was reliable and Cronbach's alpha was 0.905.
   Conclusion: The SS measured by 2D-SWE is not an accurate predictor of variceal grade and thus bleeding in patients of EHPVO.
   Advances in knowledge: EHPVO is a vascular pathology with most patients showing splenomegaly and preserved liver function. Although, elastography of spleen has been shown to be useful in patients with cirrhosis for predicting portal hypertension, it does not seem to be helpful in patients with EHPVO.

AB  - We investigated the effect of eplerenone on myocardial infarcted diabetic rats via modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and its downstream target GSK-3 beta. Diabetes was induced by administration of a single dose of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg IP). Diabetic rats received either eplerenone or PI3k/Akt antagonist (wortmannin) or in combination for 14 days with concurrent administration of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg s.c) on 13th and 14th day. Isoproterenol prompted cardiotoxicity and was demonstrated by a decrease in the maximal positive rate of developed left ventricular pressure, the maximal negative rate of developed left ventricular pressure and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure along with oxidative stress. Myocardial infarcted diabetic rats exhibited increased myonecrosis, edema, and apoptotic cell death. Treatment with eplerenone significantly improved the redox status of the myocardium. Eplerenone markedly inhibited Bax expression, TUNEL-positive cells, and myonecrosis. On the other hand, the administration of eplerenone and wortmanin did not draw out the same effects, when administered concomitantly or individually. Moreover, the rats treated with eplerenone showed increased expression of PI3K/Akt and decreased its downstream target GSK-3 beta. The present study confirms the protective effects of eplerenone on myocardial infarction in diabetic rats via modulation of PI3K/Akt pathway and its downstream regulator GSK-3 beta.

AB  - Purpose: In this study non-calcified plaque composition is evaluated by Dual Energy CT (DECT). Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) has been used to study the Plaque composition. An attempt has been made to explain the DECT results with EDS analysis.& para;& para;Methods: Thirty-two ex-vivo human cadaver coronary artery samples were scanned by DECT and data was evaluated to calculate their effective atomic number and electron density (Z(eff) & rho(e) ) by inversion method. Result of DECT was compared with pathology to assess their differentiating capability. The EDS study was used to explain DECT outcome.& para;& para;Results: DECT study was able to differentiate vulnerable plaque from stable with 87% accuracy (area under the curve (AUC):0.85 [95% confidence interval {CI}:0.73-0.98}] and Kappa Coefficient (KC):0.75 with respect to pathology. EDS revealed significant compositional difference in vulnerable and stable plaque at p < .05. The weight percentage of higher atomic number elements like F, Na, Mg, S, Si, P, Cl, K and Ca was found to be slightly more in vulnerable plaques as compared to a stable plaque. EDS also revealed a significantly increased weight percentage of nitrogen in stable plaques.& para;& para;Conclusions: The EDS results were able to explain the outcomes of DECT study. This study conclusively explains the physics of DECT as a tool to assess the nature of non-calcified plaques as vulnerable and stable. The method proposed in this study allows for differentiation between vulnerable and stable plaque using DECT.

AB  - Objectives: Flow cytometry osmotic fragility test (FC-OFT) was a recently introduced screening test for hereditary spherocytosis (HS). This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of FC-OFT in all newly diagnosed cases of HS, to compare its diagnostic value with conventional OFT and to correlate with clinical disease severity.
   Methods: In this study, the percentage of residual red cells (% RRC) was measured using flow cytometer after creating a red cell suspension. Subsequently, this was spiked with deionized water for FC-OFT in all cases of HS (n = 40), healthy subjects (n = 40) and beta-thalassemia traits (BTT) (n = 20).
   Results: The receiver operator curve analysis defined the optimal cut-offs for FC-OFT-derived indices, such as % RRC value (<= 16.29%) and % RRC ratio (> 1.72), for HS cases when compared with healthy subjects and BTT (p < 0.05). The FC-OFT (96%) achieved higher test efficiency than the conventional OF test (68.9%). A significant positive and a negative correlation were found between number of spherocytes/hpf and % RRC ratio (p = 0.001) and % RRC values (p = 0.0486). No significant correlation was observed between % RRC value (p = 0.8934), % RRC ratio (p = 0.6348) and HS disease severity score.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that FC-OFT could be the better screening test for HS cases in developing countries if flow cytometer is available.

AB  - Purpose: Deep freezing and storing in formalin are some of the common techniques of human tissue preservation. However, the preservation modes affect the biomechanical properties of the tissues. In this work, the effects of the above-stated preservation techniques are compared with that of fresh cadaveric samples. Methods: FATC samples from male cadavers of age between 60 and 70 years were tested under tensile loading at a strain rate of 0.8 s(-1). Fourteen FATC samples from soft embalmed cadavers were preserved for 3 weeks by two methods: (a) 10% formalin and (b) deep freezing at -20 degrees C followed by thawing. Seven FATC samples from fresh cadavers were experimented as control samples. The results were evaluated by a two-stage statistical process of Kruskal-Wallis H test and Mann-Whitney U-test. Results: It was observed that the failure force of fresh cadavers was the highest while that of preserved samples were approximately half the value. Failure elongation of frozen samples exceeded fresh samples while formalin samples failed at lesser elongations. Higher incidence of tibial insertion point or mid-section failures were observed in fresh samples while the higher incidence of ruptures at femoral insertion point was observed in the two preservation methods. Conclusion: Tensile properties of fresh tissues vary significantly from that of formalin preserved or frozen preserved samples.

AB  - The anterior cruciate ligament is one of the six ligaments in the human knee joint that provides stability during articulations. It is relatively prone to acute and chronic injuries as compared to other ligaments. Repair and self-healing of an injured anterior cruciate ligament are time-consuming processes. For personnel resuming an active sports life, surgical repair or replacement is essential. Untreated anterior cruciate ligament tear results frequently in osteoarthritis. Therefore, understanding of the biomechanics of injury and properties of the native ligament is crucial. An abridged summary of the prominent literature with a focus on key topics on kinematics and kinetics of the knee joint and various loads acting on the anterior cruciate ligament as a function of flexion angle is presented here with an emphasis on the gaps. Briefly, we also review mechanical characterization composition and anatomy of the anterior cruciate ligament as well as graft materials used for replacement/reconstruction surgeries. The key conclusions of this review are as follows: (a) the highest shear forces on the anterior cruciate ligament occur during hyperextension/low flexion angles of the knee joint; (b) the characterization of the anterior cruciate ligament at variable strain rates is critical to model a viscoelastic behavior; however, studies on human anterior cruciate ligament on variable strain rates are yet to be reported; (c) a significant disparity on maximum stress/strain pattern of the anterior cruciate ligament was observed in the earlier works; (d) nearly all synthetic grafts have been recalled from the market; and (e) bridge-enhanced repair developed by Murray is a promising technique for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, currently in clinical trials. It is important to note that full extension of the knee is not feasible in the case of most animals and hence the loading pattern of human ACL is different from animal models. Many of the published reviews on the ACL focus largely on animal ACL than human ACL. Further, this review article summarizes the issues with autografts and synthetic grafts used so far. Autografts (patellar tendon and hamstring tendon) remains the gold standard as nearly all synthetic grafts introduced for clinical use have been withdrawn from the market. The mechanical strength during the ligamentization of autografts is also highlighted in this work.

AB  - Background: Coronary stenting has now become a gold standard to prevent or counteract narrowing and obstruction of coronary vessels due to disease or injury. While the use of stents has been successful in this situation, they are not without drawbacks and concerns. Restenosis and stent thrombosis after an interventional procedure are the dreaded side effects resulting from the body's natural response to a foreign object in the vasculature. New developments in drug-eluting stents, such as biodegradable materials could mitigate some of the problems like stent thrombosis, at least late stent thrombosis.
   Methods: The goal of this work is to identify how the structural and design components of bio-resorbable scaf-folds (BRS) evolved and get translated into clinical outcomes. All the BRS articles were identified by an internet based search and relevant articles were included in the review.
   Results: The evolution of BRS from concept to current form is examined and the possible future course this field might turn discussed.
   Conclusion: The BRS field has evolved learning from DES terrain but this technology has its own advantages and limitations. Newer generation of bio-resorbable scaffolds will be required to replace current generation of technologically advanced DES.

AB  - Background: Recently SIX1 and SIX6 genes have been associated with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). This study was planned to do mutation screening in SIX1 and SIX6 genes in North Indian POAG patients and correlate with clinical phenotypes.
   Materials and Methods:SIX1 and SIX6 genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced in 115 POAG cases and 105 controls. Four pathogenecity prediction tools (MutationTaster, PolyPhen-2 HumDiv, PolyPhen-2 HumVar and SIFT) were used to predict the pathogenicity of the missense mutations. Protein modeling studies were done to predict the effect of the missense mutations on the protein structure and function.
   Results: Two novel mutations p.R116G and p.R116E were observed in the SIX6 gene of patients with POAG. The mutations p.R116G and p.R116E were predicted to be pathogenic and replacement of R116 by G or E might lead to loss of interaction between DNA and R116 of wild type SIX6 protein. The patients with the mutation p.R116E had significantly more visual field damage (MD) and early age of onset of the disease. No sequence variations were observed in the SIX1 gene.
   Conclusion: These results expand the mutation spectrum of SIX6 gene and suggest that SIX6 gene plays an important role in POAG pathogenesis.

AB  - X-linked hyperimmunoglobulin M (HIGM) syndrome may increase the susceptibility of patients to disseminated cryptococcal infections primarily due to CD40L deficiency that causes defective cross talk between T- and B-cells, thus preventing class switching. In HIGM syndrome, serum IgM levels are elevated with severe reduction in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA levels. In addition, the expression of CD40L (CD154) on in vitro-activated T-cells is severely reduced or absent. Here, we describe a rare, and perhaps, the first reported case in India of a 3-year-old male child with X-linked HIGM immunodeficiency syndrome who developed disseminated Cryptococcosis. Evaluation of the serum IgG profile of the patient revealed increased serum IgM levels with reduced IgG and IgA levels. Both the frequency and the function of T-cells, primarily CD40L on activated T-cells, showed weak expression suggestive of HIGM syndrome.

AB  - Pediatric posterior-circulation aneurysms are uncommon, difficult-to-treat lesions associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Infections and trauma are important risk factors in children. Here, we present a 10-year-old boy with a lower respiratory tract infection, rapidly progressive rightneck swelling, and weakness of the right upper limb. Imaging revealed a partially thrombosed right vertebral-artery pseudoaneurysm with multiple cavitory lung lesions. Subsequent laboratory work-up showed underlying primary immunodeficiency disorder (chronic granulomatous disease). The aneurysm was successfully managed by parent-artery occlusion. The child made a complete recovery without neurological sequelae. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Ependymomas are gliomas that recapitulate normal ependymal cells. The epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) shows dot-like and ring-like staining patterns, highlighting microlumens or intracytoplasmic rosettes, a pathognomonic ultrastructural feature. NHERF1/EBP50, an adaptor protein localized at the apical plasma membrane of human epithelia, has been found to localize to these microlumens. We aimed to analyze the staining patterns of EMA and EBP50 in ependymomas and other tumors, and thereby compare their diagnostic utility. Sixty-three ependymomas of different grades and 44 nonependymal tumors (meningiomas, 5; pilocytic astrocytoma, 2; paraganglioma, 2; neurocytoma, 4; pituitary adenoma, 3; papillary tumor of pineal region, 3; oligodendroglioma, 4; choroid plexus papilloma, 3; medulloblastoma, 2; schwannoma, 2; cellular hemangioblastoma, 2; subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, 1; glioblastoma multiforme, 8; diffuse astrocytoma, 1; anaplastic astrocytoma, 1; and pilomyxoid astrocytoma, 1) were included. Ring-like positivity was 100% specific for ependymomas, but showed a poor sensitivity (EMA, 29%; EBP50, 37%). Dot EMA positivity was more sensitive in grade III ependymomas (100%), whereas dot EBP50 positivity was more sensitive in grade I subependymomas (80%) and myxopapillary ependymomas (40%). Among grade II ependymomas, EBP50 labeled a significantly higher number of dots and rings, which may be of value in small biopsies. Focal dot positivity for EMA and EBP50 in glioblastoma multiforme and meningioma contributed to the lowered specificity (EMA, 84%; EBP50, 80%). Myxopapillary ependymomas (60%), choroid plexus papillomas (66%), and papillary tumors of pineal region (100%) showed membranous staining with EBP50. Although EPB50 appears to be a better diagnostic marker for grade I/II ependymomas, we recommend a combined panel of EMA and EBP50 for grade III ependymomas to compensate for the reduced sensitivity of EBP50 in this subgroup.

AB  - BackgroundNo estimates of influenza-associated mortality exist for India.
   ObjectiveTo evaluate national mortality and viral surveillance data from India for assessing their appropriateness in estimating influenza-associated mortality using varied analytic approaches.
   MethodsWe reviewed influenza virus surveillance data from a national influenza surveillance network. We also reviewed national mortality data from Civil Registration System (CRS), Medical Certification of Cause of Death (MCCD) and the Sample Registration System (SRS). We compared and scored the different sources of mortality data using specific criteria, including the process of cause of death assignment, sample size, proportion of ill-defined deaths, representativeness and availability of time series data. Each of these 5 parameters was scored on a scale from 1 to 5. To evaluate how to generate an influenza-associated mortality estimate for India, we also reviewed 4 methodologic approaches to assess the appropriateness of their assumptions and requirements for these data sets.
   ResultsThe influenza virus surveillance data included year-round sample testing for influenza virus and was found to be suitable for influenza mortality estimation modelling. Based on scoring for the 5 mortality data criteria, the SRS data had the highest score with 20 of 25 possible score, whereas MCCD and CRS scored 16 and 12, respectively. The SRS which used verbal autopsy survey methods was determined to be nationally representative and thus adequate for estimating influenza-associated mortality. Evaluation of the modelling methods demonstrated that Poisson regression, risk difference and mortality multiplier methods could be applied to the Indian setting.
   ConclusionDespite significant challenges, it is possible to estimate influenza-associated mortality in India.

AB  - Human calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CAMKIV) is a member of Ser/Thr kinase family, and is associated with different types of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Vanillin is a natural compound, a primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean which possesses varieties of pharmacological features including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-tumor. Here, we have investigated the binding mechanism and affinity of vanillin to the CAMKIV which is being considered as a potential drug target for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We found that vanillin binds strongly to the active site cavity of CAMKIV and stabilized by a large number of non-covalent interactions. We explored the utility of vanillin as anti-cancer agent and found that it inhibits the proliferation of human hepatocyte carcinoma (HepG2) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, vanillin treatment resulted into the significant reduction in the mitochondrial membrane depolarization and ROS production that eventually leads to apoptosis in HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cancer cells. These findings may offer a novel therapeutic approach by targeting the CAMKIV using natural product and its derivative with a minimal side effect.

AB  - To propose an algorithm for automatic localization of 3D cephalometric landmarks on CBCT data, those are useful for both cephalometric and upper airway volumetric analysis. 20 landmarks were targeted for automatic detection, of which 12 landmarks exist on the mid-sagittal plane. Automatic detection of mid-sagittal plane from the volume is a challenging task. Mid-sagittal plane is detected by extraction of statistical parameters of the symmetrical features of the skull. The mid-sagittal plane is partitioned into four quadrants based on the boundary definitions extracted from the human anatomy. Template matching algorithm is applied on the mid-sagittal plane to identify the region of interest ROI, further the edge features are extracted, to form contours in the individual regions. The landmarks are automatically localized by using the extracted knowledge of anatomical definitions of the landmarks. The overall mean error for detection of 20 landmarks was 1.88 mm with a standard deviation of 1.10 mm. The cephalometric land marks on CBCT data were detected automatically with in the mean error less than 2 mm.

AB  - The cardinal dogma of central nervous system (CNS) immunology believed brain is an immune privileged site, but scientific evidences gathered so far have overturned this notion proving that CNS is no longer an immune privileged site, but rather an actively regulated site of immune surveillance. Landmark discovery of lymphatic system surrounding the duramater of the brain, made possible by high resolution live imaging technology has given new dimension to neuro-immunology. Here, we discuss the immune privilege status of CNS in light of the previous and current findings, taking into account the differences between a healthy state and changes that occur during an inflammatory response. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along with interstitial fluid (ISF) drain activated T cells, natural killer cells, macrophages and dendritic cells from brain to regional lymph nodes present in the head and neck region. To keep an eye on inflammation, this system hosts an army of regulatory T cells (CD25+ FoxP3+) that regulate T cell hyper activation, proliferation and cytokine production. This review is an attempt to fill the gaps in our understanding of neuroimmune interactions, role of innate and adaptive immune system in maintaining homeostasis, interplay of different immune cells, immune tolerance, knowledge of communication pathways between the CNS and the peripheral immune system and lastly how interruption of immune surveillance leads to neurodegenerative diseases. We envisage that discoveries should be made not only to decipher underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of immune trafficking, but should aid in identifying targeted cell populations for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders.

KW  - AWARENESS
AB  - Purpose: To assess awareness, barriers, and misconceptions related to eye donation in people with corneal disease as compared to controls in a population setting.Materials and Methods: A population-based study was conducted in 25 randomly selected clusters of Rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India, as part of the CORE (Cornea Opacity Rural Epidemiological) study. In addition to ophthalmic examination, knowledge and perceptions regarding eye donation were assessed through a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire captured the sociodemographic factors influencing awareness regarding eye donation in participants with corneal disease and twice the number of age- and gender-matched controls recruited from the same study clusters. Descriptive statistics were computed along with multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine associated factors for awareness of eye donation.Results: In the CORE study, 452 participants had corneal opacities on ocular examination. Of these, 442 were assessed for eye donation awareness. Additionally, 884 age- and gender-matched controls were recruited. The mean age of cases and controls was 60.915.5 and 59.6 +/- 14.3years, respectively. Awareness of eye donation in cases and controls was 46.4% (n=205 of 442) and 52.3% (n=462 of 884), respectively (P=0.044). Educational status was an important factor determining knowledge about eye donation in both cases and controls (P=<0.001). Major barriers reported for not pledging eyes were lack of willingness (36.7%) and ignorance (15.3%). Common misconceptions like eyes could be donated before death or even after 24h of death and that any type of blindness could be treated with corneal transplantation were prevalent.Conclusions: The study demonstrated that although there is substantial awareness about eye donation, there are numerous barriers in this population that need to be resolved to improve donation rates. Additional efforts are needed to translate this awareness into actual eye donation in both cases with corneal disease and controls.

AB  - Overexpression of cathepsin L (CTSL), an endolysosomal cysteine protease, is associated with inferior survival of patients with various human malignancies. We evaluated the expression/activity of CTSL in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) of 103 pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients to assess its prognostic significance in this malignancy. Thirty-five healthy siblings of patients served as controls. Our results revealed significantly higher CTSL activity (p<.0001), protein (p<.05), and mRNA levels (p<.01) in both PBMCs and BMMCs of patients as compared with controls. BMMCs displayed higher activity of CTSL than PBMCs (p<.01). A dramatic reduction in CTSL activity was recorded after chemotherapy in a significant proportion (74%) of patients (p<.0001). By multivariate analysis, CTSL in BMMCs emerged as a strong independent prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) (p=.004). Thus, our results suggest the potential utility of CTSL in predicting the outcome of pediatric AML.

TI  - Imaging of anomalous pulmonary venous connections by multidetector CT angiography using third-generation dual source CT scanner
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - Abnormal embryological development of the pulmonary veins can manifest as either partial or total anomalous drainage into the systemic venous circulation. Echocardiography does not provide adequate information in all cases as the optimal visualization of anomalous structures is limited by the availability of acoustic window; also it is highly operator dependent. However, multidetector CT angiography, with its multiplanar reformatting and volume rendering techniques, offers precise information about the three-dimensional anatomy and spatial relationships of the cardiovascular structures. With advent of dual source CT scanners and use of advanced dose reduction techniques, this information can be obtained in a short time with minimal radiation dose. In this pictorial essay, we present the multidetector CT imaging findings of the spectrum of total and partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections, using a third-generation dual source CT scanner.

AB  - Background
   Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder). Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell electrical activity in the brain. Despite the development of more than 10 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) since the early 2000s, approximately a third of people with epilepsy remain resistant to pharmacotherapy, often requiring treatment with a combination of AEDs. In this review, we summarised the current evidence regarding rufinamide, a novel anticonvulsant medication, which, as a triazole derivative, is structurally unrelated to any other currently used anticonvulsant medication, when used as an add-on treatment for refractory epilepsy. In January 2009, rufinamide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of children four years of age and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It is also approved as an add-on treatment for adults and adolescents with focal seizures.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment in people with refractory epilepsy.
   Search methods
   On 2 October 2017, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language restrictions. We also contacted the manufacturers of rufinamide and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trials of rufinamide, recruiting people (of any age or gender) with refractory epilepsy.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (primary outcomes); seizure freedom; treatment withdrawal; and adverse effects (secondary outcomes). Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) and we presented summary risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE approach, which we presented in a 'Summary of findings' table.
   Main results
   The review included six trials, representing 1759 participants. Four trials (1563 participants) included people with uncontrolled focal seizures. Two trials (196 participants) included established Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, the age of the adults ranged from 18 to 80 years and the age of the infants ranged from four to 16 years. Baseline phase ranged from 28 to 56 days and double-blind phases from 84 to 96 days. Five of the six included trials described adequate methods of concealment of randomisation and only three described adequate blinding. All analyses were by ITT. Overall, five studies were at low risk of bias, and one had unclear risk of bias due to lack of reported information around study design. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturer of rufinamide, and therefore, were at high risk of funding bias.
   The overall RR for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 1.79 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.22; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence) indicating that rufinamide (plus conventional AED) was significantly more effective than placebo (plus conventional AED) in reducing seizure frequency by at least 50%, when added to conventionally used AEDs in people with refractory focal epilepsy. The overall RR for treatment withdrawal (for any reason and due to AED) was 1.83 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.31; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence) showing that rufinamide was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than placebo. In respect of adverse effects, most were significantly more likely to occur in the rufinamide-treated group. The adverse events significantly associated with rufinamide were: headache, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and diplopia. The RRs of these adverse effects were: headache 1.36 (95% Cl 1.08 to 1.69; 3 RCTs; high-quality evidence); dizziness 2.52 (95% Cl 1.90 to 3.34; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); somnolence 1.94 (95% Cl 1.44 to 2.61; 6 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); vomiting 2.95 (95% Cl 1.80 to 4.82; 4 RCTs; low-quality evidence); nausea 1.87 (95% Cl 1.33 to 2.64; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); fatigue 1.46 (95% Cl 1.08 to 1.97; 3 RCTs; moderate-quality evidence); and diplopia 4.60 (95% Cl 2.53 to 8.38; 3 RCTs; low-quality evidence). There was no important heterogeneity between studies for any of the outcomes. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate to low quality, due to potential risk of bias from some studies contributing to the analysis and wide CIs.
   Authors' conclusions
   In people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment was effective in reducing seizure frequency. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provided no evidence for the long-term use of rufinamide. In the short term, rufinamide as an add-on was associated with several adverse events. This review focused on the use of rufinamide in drug-resistant focal epilepsy and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of rufinamide when used as monotherapy.

AB  - Background: The type of opioid used influences the severity and complications experienced. Natural opiates (opium and poppy husk) use is a socio-culturally accepted phenomenon reported in India. However, studies on their profile, quality of life, and addiction severity are limited. Objectives: The objective of this cross-sectional, observational study was to assess the socio-demographic profile, clinical profile, addiction severity, and quality of life of treatment-seeking natural opiate users. Method: Hundred subjects aged 18-65years using opium or poppy husk seeking outpatient treatment at a tertiary addiction treatment center in India were interviewed to collect information on their socio-demography, natural opiate, and other substance use. Additionally, their addiction severity and quality of life were assessed using Addiction Severity Index-Lite and WHO Quality of Life-Bref instrument, respectively. Results: All subjects were male with a mean age of 44.6 (+/- 11.0) years. Majority (97%) used poppy husk daily orally. Curiosity/experimentation (63%) was the most common reason for starting opiate use. The past month rates of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and sedative-hypnotics use was 58%, 33%, 3%, and 12%, respectively. Only 4% injected any opioid. Inability to afford opiates (72%) was the most common reason for seeking treatment. Rates of medical, familial, social, psychological, and legal complications were low, while the WHOQOL-BREF scores fell between 40 and 50 across various domains. Conclusions/Importance: Natural opiate users may constitute distinct subgroup of opioid users with fewer/no complications despite long duration of uninterrupted use. These findings would be important in planning management strategies for people dependent on natural opiates.

AB  - Background: Advanced stage is a known prognostic factor in B-Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL); however, factors within advanced stage and overall data on pediatric B-NHL from India are lacking. Methods: This is a retrospective study wherein all consecutive pediatric (<= 18 years) patients of advanced stage B-NHL (St. Jude stage 3 and 4) treated at our center from Jan 2003 to June 2016 with BFM-90 protocol were evaluated for outcome and pathology review. Results: Total 140 patients were analyzed with median age 8 years; M:F ratio was 5.2:1; 36% patients presented within 30 days of symptom onset and 58% had rural residence. Burkitt lymphoma (66%) was commonest histopathological subtype; bone marrow was involved in 15% and CSF in 8% cases. Undernourishment was observed in 30% patients and 51% had ECOG performance status of 3&4. At 5 years, EFS was 52 +/- 4% (CI 0.43-0.60) and OS was 61 +/- 4% (CI 0.52-0.68). On multivariate analysis, poor performance status (p < 0.001) and urban residence (p = 0.016) emerged as significant negative prognostic factors for EFS; while for OS, female sex (p = 0.006), poor performance status (p < 0.001) and urban residence (p = 0.023) predicted inferior outcome. Conclusion: This is the largest study from south Asia on advanced stage pediatric B-NHL and it suggests undernourishment, poor performance status and gender bias to be unique features at presentation. Although, outcomes are comparable with other data from resource-challenged nations, yet they are 15-20% inferior than trial data from other developed countries. Further, poor performance status, female sex and urban residence for poor outcome were identified as unique prognostic factors.

AB  - Purpose: To study the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) changes on optical coherence tomography in early multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care center. Patients of early MS (expanded disability status scale < 3) with or without optic neuritis (ON) and idiopathic ON were included. Twenty age-matched individuals were taken as controls. Changes in RNFL and GCL thickness were evaluated along with the correlation with visual function parameters such as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and visual evoked response at first visit and again at six months. Results: Forty-four patients of MS with or without ON (24 and 20 patients respectively), 29 patients with idiopathic ON, and 20 healthy controls constituted the cohorts. Mean LogMAR best-corrected visual acuity was found to be significantly reduced in all groups except fellow eyes (FE) of ON group. Mean values of average RNFL thickness and values in superior, temporal, and inferior quadrant were significantly reduced. Similarly, overall mean values of average GCL-inner plexiform layer (IPL) thickness and values in superior, superonasal, superotemporal, inferonasal, and inferotemporal quadrant were significantly reduced in all groups except FE of ON group (P < 0.05). All the visual parameters significantly correlated with GCL + IPL thickness. Conclusion: GCL + IPL thickness is a more sensitive clinical structural marker than RNFL in early MS with/without ON and ON patients and correlates with all the visual parameters better than RNFL thickness.

AB  - A series of novel hybrid molecular entities incorporating various spiro chromanone scaffolds onto the benzannulated oxepine core moiety were synthesised using allylation, Claisen rearrangement, Kabbe condensation and Ring Closing Metathesis (RCM) as a key step. During the synthesis we found that the nitrogen functionality in the substrate influences significantly the catalyst load due to electronic effects. Several iterations have been carried out to achieve complete conversion to products 6a-6e.

AB  - Objective To prospectively validate association between the ratio of platelet distribution width (PDW)/platelet count (PCT) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) mortality.
   Methods The study was done in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Platelet indices in the first sample taken after admission were used. In this case control analysis, cases were the patients who died in PICU and the survivors served as controls. Consecutive 209 eligible patients over a period of 15 mo from January 2014 through March 2015 were included. Exposure was PDW/PC above 0.07. Of them 174 survived and 35 died.
   Results The mean PDW for survivors was 16.77 (+/- 0.92) and for those who died it was 17.33 (+/- 1.03) (p 0.0015). Mean platelet count (PC) for survivors was 3,46,000 (+/- 1,64,700) and for those who died it was 1,75,800 (+/- 1,61,500) (p < 0.001). PDW/PC for survivors was 0.12 (+/- 0.46) and for those who died it was 0.336 (+/- 0.53) (p 0.0014). Using the cutoff of 0.07 for PDW/PC described by Golwala et al., 77.14% above the cut-off died, compared to 22.85% below that cutoff. The odds ratio (OR) for death was 10.6 (95% CI: 4.48 to 25.12). The area under the receiver operating curve (ROC) curve for PDW/PC ratio was 0.81.
   Conclusions The ratio of PDW/PC, higher than 0.07 in the first sample after admission can be considered as an independent predictor of mortality with sensitivity and specificity of 77.1% and 77.5%, respectively. It may be a useful component for inclusion in composite scores for predicting mortality.

AB  - Background: Progressive apoptosis in the dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra lead to Parkinson's disease. Since neurons require substantially higher supply of energy, their mitochondria have a pivotal status in neuronal survival. These organelles have a key role to play in apoptosis and any impairment thereof may lead to apoptosis mediated cell death.
   Objectives: To evaluate and compare the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi) in Parkinson's disease patients and healthy controls.
   Methods: We evaluated the mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Flow cytometry using a lipophillic cationic dye JC-1 in Parkinson's disease patients (N = 61) and healthy controls (N = 37).
   Results: JC-1 fluorescence was measured and represented as percentage positivity i.e., Mean +/- SEM in FL-2 (representing non-apoptotic aggregates) and FL-1 (indicating apoptotic cell population having depolarized or damaged mitochondria) channels. The ratio of % FL-2 and % FL-1, which is an indicator of cellular mitochondrial membrane potential, was found to be significantly higher in healthy controls (Mean +/- SEM = 60.48 +/- 18.42) as compared to patients (Mean +/- SEM = 24.30 +/- 4.671) in both stimulated and unstimulated conditions.
   Conclusions: Mitochondrial membrane potential is altered and hence its evaluation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells may serve as an early marker of apoptosis in PD and, therefore, may pave way for early interventions. Since Delta Psi has a role in the maintenance of electrochemical gradient, the disruption of which may lead to neuronal apoptosis, Delta psi is intricately nested within etiopathogenesis of PD and may prove to be useful in design of diagnostics, prognostics and therapeutics for PD.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) have been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic fluoride ion (F) toxicity. Many studies have shown that F-induced apoptosis may be associated with oxidative stress and provoke the initiation of the apoptotic process. Apoptosis is mainly regulated by complex pro- and anti-apoptotic gene families. The Bcl-2 family of regulator proteins has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis with Bcl-2 inhibiting apoptosis and Bax promoting it. Both genes are widely present in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of the cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate F-associated mitochondriopathy in human renal cells. The patient sample comprised 64 children, aged 4-12 yr, with nephrotic syndrome due to minimal change disease (NS-MCD) who were divided into two groups: (i) group 1 (n=32) with a normal urinary F (<= 1 mg/L) and (ii) group 2 (n=32) with a high urinary F (>1 mg/L). Renal biopsies, taken for clinical diagnostic indications, were processed for ultrastructural analysis of the tubular parts by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The group 2 patients showed a remarkably high level of mitochondriopathy including mitochondrial edema, cristolysis, and electron dense deposits in the mitochondrial matrix. These findings may help in understanding F-associated nephrotoxicity in humans and in paving the way for the early diagnosis of F-induced renal impairment.

AB  - Background: Movement disorders are one of the prominent nonataxic symptoms in patients of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). The type of movement disorder may provide clinical clue to the type of SCA. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate various movement disorders in patients of genetically proven SCAs and to establish a probable clinico-genetic correlation. Methods: Ninety-Five patients of genetically proven SCAs were assessed for the presence of various movement disorders. Results: Patients with SCA (75.8% males) with at least one movement disorder contributed 43.16%. Age for onset of movement disorder was 43.39 +/- 13.43 years. SCA-12 (38.95%) was the most common subtype. Among the patients with at least one movement disorder, action tremor of hands contributed majority (90.2%). Dystonia and parkinsonism were present in 17.07% and 12.2% of patients (with movement disorder), respectively. Action tremor of hands was present in 34 patients with SCA-12 (91.89%), and 20 patients (54.05%) had onset of hand tremor preceding the onset of ataxia. Majority of patients with SCA-12 (81%) were of the same ethnic origin belonging to Agrawal community. Patients with movement disorder had a later onset (45 +/- 13.88 years) of ataxic symptoms compared to those without a movement disorder (32.8 +/- 11.92) (P = <0.0005). There was no significant association between severity of ataxia and presence of movement disorder. Conclusion: Movement disorders are present in about 43% of patients with SCA and can precede or succeed the onset of ataxia. Tremor onset SCA predicted SCA-12, especially in Agrawal community.

AB  - Background: Natural Killer (NK) cell plays an important role in the innate immune system and is known to produce IFN- at an early stage of infection that is essential to eliminate intracellular infection like Leishmania spp. It is already established that Leishmania parasite inhibits the activity of NK cells, avoiding the encounter with the early innate immune response. This, in turn, favors establishment and further dissemination of the infection. Methods: In the present study, we have tried to measure the frequency of different phenotypic subsets of NK cells among visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients. Results: We have phenotyped three distinct three distinct subsets (CD56(-)CD161(+), CD56(+)CD161(-), and CD56(+)CD161(+)) of NK (CD3(-)) cell using their specific markers CD161 and CD56. Conclusion: Interestingly, we observed selective loss of CD56(+)CD161(+) subset of circulating NK (CD3(-)) cells. Importantly, the other subsets (i.e., CD56(-)CD161(+) and CD56(+)CD161(-)) of circulating NK cells remain unaffected as compared with healthy subjects.

AB  - Background: Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) characterized by the presence of unusual giant cells. It is a CD30+ lymphoma of T-cells lineage, which shows anaplastic lymphoma kinase-nucleophosmin (ALK-NPM) rearrangement. ALCL on fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) shows unusually large and bizarre tumor cells. Materials and Methods: All aspirates seen over a 6-year period from November 2009 to November 2015 in which a diagnosis of ALCL or Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) with bizarre giant cells were suspected on cytomorphology were prospectively selected. Twenty such aspirates were subjected to CD-30 and ALK-1 immunocytochemistry (ICC). Subsequent biopsy was available in all cases. Results: Out of 20 cases, seven cases, suspected to be ALCL on FNAC, were confirmed on biopsy. ALK-1 was positive in both cytology and biopsy of 6/7 of these. Two cases suspected to be ALCL on cytomorphology were HL (1) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (1) on biopsy, both of which were ALK-1 negative on cytology. Eight cases of HL and three cases of large-cell NHL, which were all ALK negative on cytology, were confirmed on biopsy. Conclusion: ICC for ALK and CD30 is useful in aspiration cytodiagnosis of ALCL. One CD30 positive DLBCL and one ALK negative ALCL showed concordant results of ICC on cytology and histology.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Palmo-plantar psoriasis and dermatitis show several overlapping clinical features. We undertook this retrospective study to elucidate and compare the histological findings in these two dermatoses.
   Materials and Methods: Biopsies of 31 clinically diagnosed cases of palmo-plantar psoriasis and 24 cases of hyperkeratotic palmo-plantar dermatitis, with concomitant presence of representative lesions at other body sites, were retrieved and analysed.
   Results: Histologically, confluent parakeratosis, suprapapillary thinning and dermal edema were observed in significantly greater number of palmo-plantar psoriasis biopsies while an inflammatory infiltrate confined to the papillary dermis only, was a significant feature in palmo-plantar dermatitis. The two conditions could not be differentiated on the basis of features like focal parakeratosis, presence of neutrophils and fibrin globules in the stratum corneum, hypogranulosis, acanthosis, spongiosis, rete ridge pattern, or vascularity.
   Conclusion: Histopathology of palmo-plantar psoriasis and dermatitis can have several overlapping features. In our study, we found only few features as strong pointers towards psoriasis.

AB  - Introduction Several different surgical techniques have been used in the treatment of patients with symptomatic Arnold-Chiari malformation type 1 (ACM-1) with or without syrinx. Endoscope-assisted decompression of the posterior fossa has been found to be safe and effective. We report our initial experience of endoscopic management of ACM-I.
   Material and Methods This was a prospective study of 15 symptomatic patients. Pre- and postoperative clinical status and computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging findings were recorded. Suboccipital bone of approximate to 3 cm distance from the foramen of magnum and posterior arch of atlas was removed. Partial splitting of the dura mater with preservation of the inner portion and the arachnoid membrane was performed. Any change in axial and sagittal length of the syrinx, tonsillar ascension, shape of the tonsil tip, appearance of cerebrospinal fluid posterior to the tonsil, and formation of the cisterna magna were recorded. Patients with atlantoaxial instability, tethered cord, associated myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus, or elevated intracranial pressure were excluded.
   Results Age of patients ranged from 26 to 48 years. There were nine female patients. There were six patients with ACM-I without and nine with ACM-I with syrinx. Average pre- and postoperative Karnofsky performance score was 78 and 93, respectively. Average operative time was 130 minutes (110-190 minutes), and blood loss was 30 mL (20-180 mL). Follow-up ranged from 9 to 21 months.
   Conclusion Although the study is limited by the small number of patients with a short follow-up, endoscopic decompression in selected patients of ACM-I with or without syrinx with dural splitting was a safe and effective alternative to microsurgical treatment.

AB  - Extragenital infections can occur concurrently with simultaneous urogenital infections. Extragenital sites are believed to serve as hidden reservoirs and play a critical role in their transmission. The etiological relationship of the most widespread Sexually transmitted diseases ( STD) pathogen to reproductive tract has long been established, but the distribution to extragenital sites appears to be infrequent and its correlation with the sexual practice still requires to be investigated. Optimal-screening strategies for extragenital infections are largely unknown. However, there is a lack of data on clinical outcomes and optimal treatment regimens for rectal and pharyngeal extragenital infections. Further studies are needed in settings other than reproductive health and STD clinics, especially in primary care clinics and resource-limited settings.

AB  - The pulmonate slug Onchidium tigrinum (Stoliczka, 1869) is an estuarine protandrous gastropod. Transmission electron microscopy of both the gonadal and somatic cell populations of the ovotestis of the slug is documented. The acini of smaller slugs are comprised of developing spermatogenic cells and three to four small ill-developed oocytes. Details of the microscopic structures of Sertoli cells, interacinar cells and acinar boundary are described in-depth, revealing their secretory function. Sertoli cells are more numerous in the ovotestes of smaller slugs than in those of larger slugs. Tunnelling nanotubes of 200-400 nm in diameter are described for the first time in the Sertoli cells of molluscan ovotestis. These nanotubes may help to supply various cellular materials into distantly developing spermatogenic cells. The acini of larger slugs possess 2-3 mature oocytes along with a few spermatogenic cells. Sertoli cells, interacinar cells and spermatogonial cells are fewer in number in the acini of the ovotestis of larger individuals establishing the predominance of oogenesis in this phase of life. The number of oocytes per acinus is analysed in relation to the habitat of the pulmonates.

AB  - Glutathione-S-transferase also referred as GST is one of the major detoxification enzymes in parasitic helminths. The crucial role played by GST in various chronic infections has been well reported. The dependence of nematodes on detoxification enzymes to maintain their survival within the host established the crucial role of GST in filariasis and other related diseases. Hence, this well-established role of GST in filariasis along with its greater nonhomology with its human counterpart makes it an important therapeutic drug target. Here in this study, we have tried to explore the inhibitory potential of some of the well-reported natural ant-filarial compounds against the GST from Wuchereria bancrofti (W.bancrofti) and Brugia malayi (B.malayi). In silico virtual screening, approach was used to screen the selected natural compounds against GST from W.bancrofti and B.malayi. On the basis of our results, here we are reporting some of the natural compounds which were found to be very effective against GSTs. Along with we have also revealed the characteristic of the active site of BmGST and WbGST and the role of important active site residues involve in the binding of natural compounds within the active site of GSTs. This information will oped doors for using natural compounds as anti-filarial therapy and will also be helpful for future drug discovery.

AB  - Up to a third of patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) fail to respond to intensive steroid therapy and eventually require a salvage colectomy. We have previously reported that the mortality of emergency colectomy can be decreased by offering it within the first week of intensive medical therapy. We implemented this policy and report the results of our experience.
   The clinical records of all patients with ASUC who underwent emergency colectomy after failure of medical therapy between January 2005 and July 2015 were extracted from a prospectively maintained database. The data were analysed with regard to duration of intensive medical therapy, timing of surgery, in-hospital mortality and post-operative complications.
   Eighty-eight patients underwent emergency surgery for ASUC after failed medical therapy. Of these, 75 (85.2%) were operated within 7 days of initiation of intensive medical therapy [n = 51 (58%) were operated < 5 days]. One patient who was operated on day 8 following steroid therapy died postoperatively. The current post-operative mortality of 1.1% (1/88) was significantly lower than the mortality noted in the previously recorded retrospective case series [8/51 (15.6%); p = 0.001]. In addition, the incidence of overall (9/13 vs. 23/75; p = 0.012) and clinically significant (12/75 vs. 6/13; p = 0.022) complications was significantly higher in patients operated after 7 days as compared to those operated within 7 days.
   The policy of early colectomy, within 7 days, in patients with ASUC who fail to respond to intensive steroid-based therapy improves perioperative outcomes with significantly low in-hospital mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Background: The clinical forms of cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB) consist of a spectrum that reflects the host's immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis; it provides an ideal model to study the immunological dysregulation in humans. IL-17 plays an important role in initial immune response and is involved in both immune-mediated protection and pathology during M. tuberculosis infection. TGF-beta producing regulatory T-cells (Tregs) are high in leprosy patients and responsible for immune suppression. However, in CTB, the involvement of Tregs and Th17 remains unevaluated.
   Objective: To study the role of proinflammatory Th17 and Treg cells in the human CTB.
   Methods: Blood and skin biopsies of CTB patients and healthy controls (HC) were included in the study. Flow cytometric analysis of IL-17, FOXP3, and TGF-beta in blood was done followed by immunohistochemistry on paraffin-embedded skin sections. Expression of IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, and IL-17 was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR.
   Results: We found significant (P<0.0002) lower expression of proinflammatory IL-17 and IFN-gamma (P<0.01) in CTB skins as compared to HC. However, the frequency of TGF-beta producing Treg cells was found to be high in CTB patients (P<0.001) as compared to HC. A similar type of profile was observed by flow cytometric analysis. Treg cells produced suppressive cytokine TGF-beta which showed a positive correlation with FOXP3 gene expression.
   Conclusion: Our study found an increase in lineage-specific CD4(+) Tregs in CTB as compared to the HC individuals. Such cells secrete TGF-beta, a suppressive cytokine and may play a role in negatively regulating the T-cell immune responses in CTB. In addition, Tregs with TGF-beta may downregulate Th17 cell responses leading to the antigen-specific anergy associated with CTB patients.

AB  - Background
   Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in angiogenesis in foetal life. Researchers have recently attempted to use anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a vasoproliferative disorder. The safety and efficacy of these agents in preterm infants with ROP is currently uncertain.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of anti-VEGF drugs when used either as monotherapy, that is without concomitant cryotherapy or laser therapy, or in combination with planned cryo/laser therapy in preterm infants with type 1 ROP (defined as zone I any stage with plus disease, zone I stage 3 with or without plus disease, or zone II stage 2 or 3 with plus disease).
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 11), MEDLINE (1966 to 11 December 2016), Embase (1980 to 11 December 2016), CINAHL (1982 to 11 December 2016), and conference proceedings.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy or safety of administration, or both, of anti-VEGF agents compared with conventional therapy in preterm infants with ROP.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard Cochrane and Cochrane Neonatal methods for data collection and analysis. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.
   Main results
   Six trials involving a total of 383 infants fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Five trials compared intravitreal bevacizumab (n = 4) or ranibizumab (n = 1) with conventional laser therapy (monotherapy), while the sixth study compared intravitreal pegaptanib plus conventional laser therapy with laser/cryotherapy (combination therapy).
   When used as monotherapy, bevacizumab/ranibizumab did not reduce the risk of complete or partial retinal detachment (3 studies; 272 infants; risk ratio (RR) 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21 to 5.13; risk difference (RD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.04; very low-quality evidence), mortality before discharge (2 studies; 229 infants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.26 to 8.75), corneal opacity requiring corneal transplant (1 study; 286 eyes; RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.26), or lens opacity requiring cataract removal (3 studies; 544 eyes; RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.79). The risk of recurrence of ROP requiring retreatment also did not differ between groups (2 studies; 193 infants; RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.63; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.07; very low-quality evidence). Subgroup analysis showed a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence in infants with zone I ROP (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.62), but an increased risk of recurrence in infants with zone II ROP (RR 2.53, 95% CI 1.01 to 6.32). Pooled analysis of studies that reported eye-level outcomes also revealed significant increase in the risk of recurrence of ROP in the eyes that received bevacizumab (RR 5.36, 95% CI 1.22 to 23.50; RD 0.10, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.17). Infants who received intravitreal bevacizumab had a significantly lower risk of refractive errors (very high myopia) at 30 months of age (1 study; 211 eyes; RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.20; RD -0.40, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.30; low-quality evidence).
   When used in combination with laser therapy, intravitreal pegaptanib was found to reduce the risk of retinal detachmentwhen compared to laser/cryotherapy alone (152 eyes; RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55; RD -0.29, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.16; low-quality evidence). The incidence of recurrence of ROP by 55 weeks' postmenstrual age was also lower in the pegaptanib + laser therapy group (76 infants; RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.7; RD -0.35, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.16; low-quality evidence). There was no difference in the risk of perioperative retinal haemorrhages between the two groups (152 eyes; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.56; RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.05; very lowquality evidence). However, the risk of delayed systemic adverse effects with any of the three anti-VEGF drugs is not known.
   Authors' conclusions
   Implications for practice: Intravitreal bevacizumab/ranibizumab, when used as monotherapy, reduces the risk of refractive errors during childhood but does not reduce the risk of retinal detachment or recurrence of ROP in infants with type 1 ROP. While the intervention might reduce the risk of recurrence of ROP in infants with zone I ROP, it can potentially result in higher risk of recurrence requiring retreatment in those with zone II ROP. Intravitreal pegaptanib, when used in conjunction with laser therapy, reduces the risk of retinal detachment as well as the recurrence of ROP in infants with type 1 ROP. However, the quality of the evidence was very low to low for most outcomes due to risk of detection bias and other biases. The effects on other critical outcomes and, more importantly, the long-term systemic adverse effects of the drugs are not known. Insufficient data precludes strong conclusions favouring routine use of intravitreal anti-VEGF agents -either as monotherapy or in conjunction with laser therapy - in preterm infants with type 1 ROP.
   Implications for research: Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of anti-VEGF agents on structural and functional outcomes in childhood and delayed systemic effects including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.

AB  - "Faggot" cells, named for the resemblance of multiple Auer rods to a bundle of sticks, are often considered sine qua non for acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, blasts in other acute myeloid leukemias rarely also show faggot cells. This case demonstrates faggot cells in stodtmeister cells in mixed phenotypic acute leukemia. In addition to being uncommon, this case also highlights the importance of immunophenotyping and genetic analysis in avoiding misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy.

AB  - We report two cases of bilateral severe familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) presenting with bilateral angle closure glaucoma, with evidence of neovascularization in one eye of each case. Both cases displayed bilateral disc dragging with evidence of avascular retinae on fundus fluorescein angiography. Retinal laser photocoagulation and antivascular endothelial growth factor injections provided satisfactory regression of the neovascularization. Medical management of glaucoma was administered to both patients. Lens aspiration with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed for one eye of each patient. It helped in clearing media as well as in increasing anterior chamber depth, helping in indirect control of intraocular pressure. Although the primary pathology of FEVR lies in the retina, a comprehensive glaucoma screening is essential. We conclude that neovascular glaucoma albeit uncommon in FEVR, may be the presenting feature in advanced unlasered cases, and should be specifically looked for.

AB  - Surface modification of medical grade V titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V) with biomolecules is an important and vital step for tailoring it for various biomedical applications. Present study investigates the influence of type I human collagen (T1HC) bio-conjugation through a three stage process. Polished grade V titanium alloy discs were functionalized with free -OH group by means of controlled heat and alkali treatment followed by coating of 3-aminopropyltriethoxy (APTES) silane couplingagent. T1HC were bio-conjugated through 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC-NHS)coupling reaction. At each stage, grade V titanium alloy surfaces were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Xrayphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). FTIR and XPS studies confirms the covalent attachment of APTES with titanium alloy surface while terminalamine groups of APTES remained free for further attachment of T1HC through covalent bond. Aqueous stability of bio-conjugated titanium discsat various pH and time intervals (i.e. at pH of 5.5, 6.8 and 8.0 at timeinterval of 27 and 48 h) confirmed the stability of T1HC bioconjugated collagen on titanium surface. Further human periodontalfibroblast cell line (HPdlF) culture revealed enhanced adhesion on the T1HC bio-conjugated surface compared to the polystyrene and polishedgrade V titanium alloy surfaces.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the role of various quantitative and semiquantitative metabolic parameters derived from dynamic and static baseline F-18-FDG PET/CT in prediction of overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who were planned to undergo platinum-based chemotherapy.
   Methods Sixty patients (51 male and 9 female patients) with biopsy-proven NSCLC and mean age 59.55 10.06 years who were planned to undergo platinum-based chemotherapy were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent a baseline regional dynamic and a static whole-body F-18-FDG PET/CT after injecting 0.21 mCi/kg (5.18-7.77 MBq/kg) of F-18-FDG intravenously. Two dynamic PET/CT parameters, that is, net influx rate constant and glucose metabolic rate at 30 and 60 minutes, were evaluated. In addition, whole-body PET/CT parameters, that is, SUVmax, average SUV, tumor-to-background ratio, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumor, and MTV and TLG of whole-body tumor lesions, were evaluated. Best possible cutoffs for all parameters were calculated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Survival analysis was performed using log-rank test, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards model to determine the prognostic markers for OS.
   Results The median follow-up period was 4.4 months (range, 8 days to 15.9 months). In univariate analysis, the 4 static whole-body PET/CT parameters, that is, MTV, TLG, and MTV and TLG of whole-body tumor lesions, were found to be significantly associated with OS with cutoff values of 120, 800, 160, and 1350 cm(3) and hazard ratios of 3.64 (P = 0.001), 3.35 (P = 0.002), 2.51 (P = 0.019), and 2.69 (P = 0.008), respectively. In multivariate survival analysis, MTV was found to be an independent prognostic marker for OS.
   Conclusions Baseline MTV and TLG evaluated from primary tumor as well as the whole-body tumor lesions are reliable prognostic markers of OS in NSCLC patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. However, other baseline whole-body PET/CT parameters (SUVmax, average SUV, and tumor-to-background ratio) and dynamic PET/CT parameters (net influx rate constant, glucose metabolic rate) have no prognostic value in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: The present study was undertaken to analyse the trend in prevalence of culture-positive typhoid fever during the last decade and to determine antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Salmonella Typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A isolated from patients of enteric fever presenting to our hospital. Methods: All the culture-positive enteric fever cases during 2005-2016 presenting to our Hospital were included in the study. Antimicrobial susceptibility was done against chloramphenicol, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, pefloxacin, ceftriaxone and azithromycin as per corresponding CLSI guidelines for each year. We also analysed the proportion of culture positivity during 1993-2016 in light of the antibiotic consumption data from published literature. Results: A total of 1066 strains-S. Typhi (772) and S. Paratyphi A (294) were isolated from the blood cultures during the study. A maximum number of cases were found in July-September. Antimicrobial susceptibility for chloramphenicol, amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole was found to be 87.9%, 75.5%, 87.3% for S. Typhi and 94.2%, 90.1% and 94.2% for S. Paratyphi A, respectively. Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and levofloxacin susceptibility were 71.3%, 70.8% and 70.9% for S. Typhi and 58.1%, 57.4% and 57.1% for S. Paratyphi A, respectively. Azithromycin susceptibility was 98.9% in S. Typhi. Although susceptibility to ceftriaxone and cefixime was 100% in our isolates, there is a continuous increase in ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 50 and MIC 90 values over the time. The proportion of blood culture-positive cases during 1993-2016 ranged from a minimum of 0.0006 in 2014 to a maximum of 0.0087 in 1999. Conclusion: We found that the most common etiological agent of enteric fever is S. Typhi causing the majority of cases from July to October in our region. MIC to ceftriaxone in typhoidal salmonellae is creeping towards resistance and more data are needed to understand the azithromycin susceptibility.

AB  - We ascertained two unrelated consanguineous families with two affected children each having microcephaly, refractory seizures, intellectual disability, and spastic quadriparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed atrophy of cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord, prominent cisterna magna, symmetric T2 hypo-intensities in the bilateral basal ganglia and thinning of corpus callosum. Whole-exome sequencing of three affected individuals revealed c. 105C>A [p.(Tyr35Ter)] variant in AIMP2. The variant lies in a common homozygous region of 940 kb on chromosome 7 and is likely to have been inherited from a common ancestor. The phenotype noted in our subjects' shares marked similarity with that of hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-3 caused by mutations in closely related gene AIMP1. We hereby report the first human disease associated with deleterious mutations in AIMP2.

AB  - Molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on glutathione (GSH) indicated existence of closed and extended conformations. The present work in a multi-center research setting reports indepth analysis of GSH conformers in vivo using a common magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocol and signal processing scheme. MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence was applied on healthy subjects using 3T Philips MRI scanner (India) and 3T GE MRI scanner (Norway) using the same experimental parameters (echo time, repetition time, and selective 180 degrees refocusing ON-pulse at 4.40 ppm and 4.56 ppm). All MRS data were processed at one site National Brain Research Center (NBRC) using in-house MRS processing toolbox (KALPANA) for consistency. We have found that both the closed and extended GSH conformations are present in human brain and the relative proportion of individual conformer peak depends on the specific selection of refocusing ON-pulse position in MEGA-PRESS pulse sequence. It is important to emphasize that in vivo experiments with different refocusing and inversion pulse positions, echo time, and voxel size, clearly evidence the presence of both the GSH conformations. The GSH conformer peak positions for the closed GSH (Cys-H-beta) peak at similar to 2.80 ppm and extended GSH (Cys-H-beta) peak at similar to 2.95 ppm remain consistent irrespective of the selective refocusing OFF-pulse positions. This is the first in vivo study where both extended and closed GSH conformers are detected using the MEGA-PRESS sequence employing the parameters derived from the high resolution in vitro NMR studies on GSH.

AB  - Background: Vitamin D is an immunomodulator, and its deficiency is associated with Tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is a rich milieu of macrophages that form the first line of defense against invading TB bacilli. As there is an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in TB and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) subjects, we intend exploring the possibility of a localized deficiency of vitamin D metabolites in BALF of these patients.
   Objective: The primary objective was to assess the level of 25D(3) in serum and BALF of subjects and look for a significant difference among patients and controls. The secondary objective was to find a correlation between serum and BALF 25D(3) levels.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study with subjects divided into four groups: Controls (group 1), HIV positive without active TB (group 2), active TB without HIV (group 3), and HIV-TB coinfection (group 4). BALF and serum 25D(3) levels were compared between the groups.
   Results: Among the 149 (an immunomodulator) successive subjects enrolled, there were 40 subjects in group 1 (HIV-TB-), 48 in group 2 (HIV+TB-), 37 in group 3 (HIV-TB+), and 24 in group 4 (HIV+TB+). Females constituted 31.6% of the study subjects. In groups 3 and 4, there were significantly lower serum 25D(3) levels compared to group 1 (p-value group 3: 0.002; group 4: 0.012). In groups 2, 3, and 4, there were significantly lower BALF 25D(3) levels compared to group 1 (p-value group 2: 0.000; group 3: 0.000; group 4: 0.001). There was a significant correlation between serum and BALF 25D 3 levels (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.318, p-value = 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Lower levels of serum and BALF 25D(3) were observed in HIV, TB, and HIV-TB coinfected patients. Localized deficiency of vitamin D metabolites might be associated with increased vulnerability to TB infection.

AB  - Background and Objectives: People living with HIV/AIDS are at an increased risk of developing cancer. The goals of this study were to obtain data on the prevalence of HIV in the cancer population and vice versa at a major tertiary cancer and HIV center in North India.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted over a 3-year period from July 2013 to June 2016, wherein successive HIV positive patients from an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) center were screened for malignancy. Simultaneously, successive cancer patients at the cancer center were screened for HIV. Baseline demographic details, risk factors, and laboratory investigations were obtained for all the patients.
   Results: Among the 999 HIV-positive patients at the ART center, the prevalence of malignancy was 2% (n=20; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13, 2.87). Among the 998 patients with a malignancy, the prevalence of HIV infection was 0.9% (n=9; 95% CI 0.31, 1.49). Weight loss, loss of appetite, and fever were the most common symptoms in patients with HIV and cancer. Among 29 patients with HIV and cancer, AIDS-defining cancer was found in 19 patients; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the most common malignancy reported (n=13).
   Interpretation and Conclusion: There is a low prevalence of HIV in cancer patients as well as a low prevalence of cancer in HIV patients. AIDS-defining cancers remain much more common than non-AIDS-defining cancers. With the increased coverage of ART, it is expected that non-AIDS-defining cancers will increase, as is evident from data from more developed countries.

AB  - To study the nutritional risk factors and status of serum 25(OH)D levels in patients with breast cancer. A total of 100 women (cases) with confirmed breast cancer (BC) matched with equal number of healthy females (controls) of similar age and socioeconomic status (SES) were included in study. Controls included were nonbreast cancer patients who accompanied the patients to a tertiary care hospital. All the subjects (cases and controls) were administered a questionnaires to collect data on socioeconomic status, dietary pattern and the frequency of food consumption using a validated food frequency questionnaire. Anthropometric assessment was done for waist and hip circumference to calculate waist to hip ratio (WHR). Non fasting blood samples were collected for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels estimation using chemiluminescent immunoassay technique and total serum calcium levels by colorimetric assay technique. Serum 25(OH)D and total calcium levels were expressed in ng/ml and mg/dl. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as per the guidelines set by United States Endocrine Society. The mean age of cases and controls was 45 9 and 46 10 years respectively. On multivariate analysis, an inverse association with BC was found for less frequency of fruits consumption with an adjusted (ORs, 95% CI) (2.7, 0.5-15.7) respectively. Mushroom intake was inversely associated with risk of BC (ORs, 95% CI) (5.6,1.9-16.6). Saturated fat intake and high WHR were significantly associated with high risk of BC with adjusted ORs, 95% CI of (3.4, 1.4-8.1) and (5,1.4-17). A significant association (p < 0.05) was found between low serum 25(OH)D levels and the risk of BC with adjusted ORs, 95% CI of (2.5, 0.9-7.4). Majority of the patients with BC were suffering from vitamin D deficiency. Dietary intake of mushrooms containing vitamin D naturally was found to be associated with decreased risk of breast cancer. A significant association was found between low serum 25(OH)D levels (<20 ng/ml) with the risk of BC. Obesity as a consequence of nutritional risk factors determined by higher WHR was found to be significantly associated with the risk of BC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study was conducted with an objective to investigate the association between reproductive factors, nutritional status and serum 25(OH)D levels among women diagnosed with breast cancer (BC). A total of 200 women with BC attending a tertiary healthcare institute of Delhi, India matched with 200 healthy women for age (+/- 2 years) and socio economic status were included in the study. Data was collected on socio-demographic profile, reproductive factors, physical activity and dietary intake (24 h dietary recall and food frequency questionnaire) using interviewer administered structured questionnaires and standard tools. Non fasting blood samples (5 ml) were collected for the biochemical estimation of serum 25(OH)D and calcium levels by chemiluminescent immunoassay and colorimetric assay technique. Data was analyzed by univariable conditional logistic regression and significant variables with (p < 0.05), were analyzed in final model by conditional multivariable logistic regression analysis. The mean age of patients at diagnosis of BC was 45 +/- 10 years. Results of multivariable conditional logistic regression analysis revealed significantly higher odds of BC for reproductive factors like age at marriage (more than 23 years), number of abortions, history or current use of oral contraceptive pills (OCP), with [OR (95% CI)] of [2.4 (1.2-4.9)], [4.0 (1.6-12.6)], [2.4 (1.2-5.0)]. Women with physically light activities and occasional consumption of eggs were found to have higher odds of BC [4.6 (1.6-13.0)] and [3.2 (1.6-6.3)]. Women with serum 25(OH)D levels less than 20 ng/ml and calcium levels less than 10.5 mg/dl had higher odds of having BC [2.4 (1.2-5.1)] and [3.7 (1.5-8.8)]. A protective effect of urban areas as place of residence and energy intake greater than 50% of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) per day against BC was observed (p < 0.05). The findings of the present study revealed a significant association of reproductive and dietary factors in addition to sedentary physical activity and low serum 25(OH)D levels in women diagnosed with BC.

AB  - Purpose: To study optic nerve head (ONH) characteristics using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, Heidelberg retina tomograph (HRT), in an elderly population.
   Methods: A population-based, cross-sectional study included 1460 eyes of 1460 consecutive, subjects >60 years, in North India. All subjects underwent a detailed ophthalmic evaluation and imaged on HRT. Stereometric parameters, Moorfields regression analysis (MRA) and discriminant function analysis were analyzed. Correlation between ONH parameters and disc area, age, sex, and intraocular pressure was analyzed.
   Results: Disc size had a normal Gaussian distribution (2.22 +/- 0.48 mm(2)), but all other stereometric parameters showed a wide variation.
   MRA found 1320 (90.4%) eyes within normal limits, 71 (4.86%), borderline limits, and 69 (4.73%) outside normal limits.
   Comparison of eyes meeting International Society of Geographical and Epidemiological Ophthalmology criteria for a glaucoma suspect, C:D > 0.7, with those that did not show a statistically significant difference in the cup area, rim area, rim disc ratio, and cup volume (p = 0.02, 0.02, 0.02, 0.03, respectively).
   An Intraocular pressure (IOP) >= 21 mmHg was seen in 3.01%, and only 12 eyes out of 1460, 0.82%, had an IOP >= 21 mmHg and a cup:disc ratio of more than 0.7. A van Herick estimation of < Grade 3 was seen in 19.4%
   Conclusions: Stereometric parameter data, MRA, and clinical examination in this population at high risk for glaucoma found that about 10% of individuals over 60 years of age could be classified as glaucoma suspects and would need further evaluation.

AB  - BackgroundHypertension is associated with endothelial cell dysfunction. E-selectin, an endothelial cell adhesion molecule, is specific for endothelial cell activation. Polymorphism in E-selectin gene has recently been identified among which Leu554Phe E-selectin gene polymorphism is least investigated in essential hypertension. This study reports the association of E-selectin gene Leu554Phe polymorphism and the expression of E-selectin gene in patients with essential hypertension.
   Materials and methodsWe analysed the Leu554Phe polymorphism and expression of E-selectin gene in 250 patients with essential hypertension and 250 normal healthy controls. Genotyping of Leu554Phe polymorphism was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), and the expression of E-selectin gene at mRNA and protein levels were carried out by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively.
   ResultsA significant association of E-selectin genotypes (CT+TT) with essential hypertension (P<.0001, Odds ratio=2.2 [1.58-3.24] at 95% CI) was observed. The expression of mRNA for E-selectin gene in patients with essential hypertension was similar to 12-fold higher as compared to control. We observed an elevated level of E-selectin protein expression (up to 1.9 times) in patients as compared to controls.
   ConclusionsA significant association of E-selectin (Leu554Phe) gene and increased expression of E-selectin gene at mRNA and protein levels in patients might be related to the genetic predisposition to develop essential hypertension.

AB  - Aims & para;& para;Dislocation rates are reportedly lower in patients requiring proximal femoral hemiarthroplasty than for patients undergoing hip arthroplasty for neoplasia. Without acetabular replacement, pain due to acetabular wear necessitating revision surgery has been described. We aimed to determine whether wear of the native acetabulum following hemiarthroplasty necessitates revision surgery with secondary replacement of the acetabulum after proximal femoral replacement (PFR) for tumour reconstruction.& para;& para;Patients and Methods & para;& para;We reviewed 100 consecutive PFRs performed between January 2003 and January 2013 without acetabular resurfacing. The procedure was undertaken in 74 patients with metastases, for a primary bone tumour in 20 and for myeloma in six. There were 48 male and 52 female patients, with a mean age of 61.4 years (19 to 85) and median follow-up of two years (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5 to 3.7 years). In total, 52 patients presented with a pathological fracture and six presented with failed fixation of a previously instrumented pathological fracture.& para;& para;Results & para;& para;All patients underwent reconstruction with either a unipolar (n = 64) or bipolar (n = 36) articulation. There were no dislocations and no acetabular resurfacings. Articular wear was graded using the criteria of Baker et al from 0 to 3, where by 0 is normal; grade 1 represents a narrowing of articular cartilage and no bone erosion; grade 2 represents acetabular bone erosion and early migration; and grade 3 represents protrusio acetabuli. Of the 49 patients with radiological follow-up greater than one year, six demonstrated grade 1 acetabular wear and two demonstrated grade 2 acetabular wear. The remainder demonstrated no radiographic evidence of wear. Median medial migration was 0.3 mm (IQR -0.2 to 0.7) and superior migration was 0.3 mm (IQR -0.2 to 0.6). No relationship between unipolar versus bipolar articulations and wear was evident.& para;& para;Conclusion & para;& para;Hemiarthroplasty PFRs for tumour reconstruction eliminate joint instability and, in the short to medium term, do not lead to native acetabular wear necessitating later acetabular resurfacing.

AB  - Comprehensive knowledge of host-pathogen interactions is central to understand the life cycle of a pathogen and devise specific therapeutic strategies. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are key mediators of host-pathogen interactions. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of viral hepatitis in humans. Recent reports also demonstrate its extrahepatic manifestations in the brain. Toward understanding the molecular details of HEV life cycle, we screened human liver and fetal brain cDNA libraries to identify the host interaction partners of proteins encoded by genotype 1 HEV and constructed the virus-host PPI network. Analysis of the network indicated a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed the presence of multiple host translation regulatory factors in the viral translation/replication complex. Depletion of host translation factors such as eIF4A2, eIF3A, and RACK1 significantly reduced the viral replication, whereas eIF2AK4 depletion had no effect. These findings highlight the ingenuity of the pathogen in manipulating the host machinery to its own benefit, a clear understanding of which is essential for the identification of strategic targets and development of specific antivirals against HEV.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a pathogen that is transmitted by the fecaloral route. Owing to the lack of an efficient laboratory model, the life cycle of the virus is poorly understood. During the course of infection, interactions between the viral and host proteins play essential roles, a clear understanding of which is essential to decode the life cycle of the virus. In this study, we identified the direct host interaction partners of all HEV proteins and generated a PPI network. Our functional analysis of the HEV-human PPI network reveals a role of HEV proteins in modulating multiple host biological processes such as stress and immune responses, the ubiquitin-proteasome system, energy and iron metabolism, and protein translation. Further investigations revealed an essential role of several host factors in HEV replication. Collectively, the results from our study provide a vast resource of PPI data from HEV and its human host and identify the molecular components of the viral translation/replication machinery.

AB  - Background and Purpose-The Indo-US Collaborative Stroke Project was designed to characterize ischemic stroke across 5 high-volume academic tertiary hospitals in India.
   Methods-From January 2012 to August 2014, research coordinators and physician coinvestigators prospectively collected data on 2066 patients with ischemic stroke admitted <2 weeks after onset. Investigator training and supervision and data monitoring were conducted by the US site (Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston).
   Results-The mean age was 58.3 +/- 14.7 years, 67.2% men. The median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 10 (interquartile range, 5-15) and 24.5% had National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale >= 16. Hypertension (60.8%), diabetes mellitus (35.7%), and tobacco use (32.2%, including bidi/smokeless tobacco) were common risk factors. Only 4% had atrial fibrillation. All patients underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; 81% had cerebrovascular imaging. Stroke etiologic subtypes were large artery (29.9%), cardiac (24.9%), small artery (14.2%), other definite (3.4%), and undetermined (27.6%, including 6.7% with incomplete evaluation). Intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis was administered in 13%. In-hospital mortality was 7.9%, and 48% achieved modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2 at 90 days. On multivariate analysis, diabetes mellitus predicted poor 3-month outcome and younger age, lower admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and small-artery etiology predicted excellent 3-month outcome.
   Conclusions-These comprehensive and novel clinical imaging data will prove useful in refining stroke guidelines and advancing stroke care in India.

AB  - Optic disc melanocytoma (ODM) has been considered as a benign tumor with few reports of malignant transformation. We present swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) imaging of a case of ODM. As attaining histopathology is impossible in most cases, we discuss the possibility of using SSOCT as a tool for ruling out choroidal invasion or juxtapapillary melanoma.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the mydriatic effect of proparacaine hydrochloride (PH) in children undergoing strabismus surgery under general anesthesia (GA). Methods: This was a pilot, prospective, non-randomized, self-controlled interventional study. Nine children with esotropia or exotropia undergoing horizontal muscle squint surgery under GA at a tertiary eye care center were included. The six Group 1 patients underwent both eye surgeries, while the three Group 2 patients underwent single eye surgery. PH was instilled in one eye of Group 1 patients and both eyes of Group 2 patients. Change in pupil diameter (PD) was analyzed as the main outcome measure. Results: Mean age of the patients was 4.67 +/- 2.64 years. In the study eyes, mean average baseline PD was 1.59 +/- 0.40 mm (range: 1.06-2.37), while postoperative average PD was 3.99 +/- 1.34 mm (range: 1.79-6.02). The mean baseline PC had increased from 5.51 +/- 1.09 mm to 12.6 +/- 3.58 mm at the end of the surgery. PD and PC increased in all of the study eyes while no change in PD or PC was seen in the control eyes of either of the groups. The dilated pupil was skewed horizontally towards the muscle being operated upon in all of the study eyes. Conclusions: PH has a mydriatic effect of its own. It penetrates through the bare sclera and leads on to skewed dilation of the pupil. Surgeons should consider this effect while judging pupil alignment at the end of the surgery.

AB  - Objective: To determine effects of allopurinol administration on outcomes following intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF).
   Materials and Methods: Fifty patients undergoing TOF repair were randomized to 2 groups of 25 each: the allopurinol group (n = 25) and the placebo group (n = 25). Postoperatively, inotropic score, rhythm, duration of mechanical ventilation, cardiac output, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and hospital stay were assessed. Plasma troponin-I, superoxide dismutase (SOD), interleukin (IL) 1-beta, IL-6, and malondialdehyde were measured serially.
   Results: Inotropic score was lower in the allopurinol compared with placebo group (11.04 +/- 5.70 vs 17.50 +/- 7.83; P = .02). Duration of ICU and hospital stay was lower in the allopurinol group. Plasma levels of SOD preoperative were (2.87 +/- 1.21 U/mL vs 4.5 +/- 2.08 U/mL; P = .012), immediately following release of crossclamp (2.32 +/- 0.98 U/mL vs 5.32 +/- 2.81 U/mL; P < .001), and after termination of CPB (2.18 +/- 1.0.78 U/mL vs 3.44 +/- 1.99 U/mL; P = .003) between the placebo versus allopurinol group, respectively. Postoperative levels of IL1-beta and IL-6 were lower in the allopurinol group. Malondialdehyde levels following CPB were lower in the allopurinol group (11.80 +/- 2.94 pg/mL in the placebo vs 9.16 +/- 3.02 g/mL in the allopurinol group; P < .001).
   Conclusions: Allopurinol administration in patients undergoing intracardiac repair of TOF is associated with reduced inotropic scores, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay and favorable biochemical markers of inflammation. Further studies in multiple setups are needed before recommending it as a routine practice.

AB  - Predicated on our improved understanding of the disease biology, we have seen remarkable advances in the management of multiple myeloma over the past few years. Recently approved drugs have radically transformed the treatment paradigm and improved survivals of myeloma patients. The progress has necessitated revision of the diagnostic criteria, risk-stratification and response definition. The huge disparities in economy, healthcare infrastructure and access to novel drugs among different Asian countries will hinder the delivery of optimum myeloma care to patients managed in resource-constrained environments. In the light of the tremendous recent changes and evolution in myeloma management, it is timely that the resource-stratified guidelines from the Asian Myeloma Network be revised to provide updated recommendations for Asia physicians practicing under various healthcare reimbursement systems. This review will highlight the most recent advances and our recommendations on how they could be integrated in both resource-abundant and resource-constrained facilities.

AB  - Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by non-cultivable bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. Ridley and Jopling classified the disease into five polar forms, Tuberculoid (TT) and Lepromatous (LL), in between two forms of the disease Borderline tuberculoid (BT), Borderline (BB) and Borderline lepromatous (BL) are laid. The tuberculoid type (BT/TT) leprosy patients show good recall of cellmediated immune (CMI) response and Th1 type of immune response, while lepromatous leprosy (LL) patients show defect in cell-mediated immunity to the causative agent and Th2 type of immune response. Due to distinct clinical and immunological spectra of the disease, leprosy attracted immunologists to consider an ideal model for the study of deregulations of various immune reactions. Recent studies show that Tregs, Th3 (TGF-beta, IL-10), IL-35 producing Treg immune response associated with the immune suppressive environment, survival of bugs. IL-17 producing Th17 immune response associated with tuberculoid leprosy and play protective role. gamma delta T cells also increased from tuberculoid to lepromatous pole of leprosy. In this review, we will discuss the role of various subtypes of T-cell and their cytokines in the pathogenesis of leprosy.

AB  - Purpose: To assess intraoperative morphology of clear corneal incisions (CCI) and its impact on incision-site descemet membrane detachment (DMD) in conventional phacoemulsification and femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS).
   Methods: Prospective comparative study of 129 eyes that underwent either conventional phacoemulsification (Group I, n = 77) or FLACS (Group II, n = 52) was undertaken at an apex tertiary care ophthalmic setup. In group I, a 2.2-mm metal keratome was used to create a biplanar CCI. In group II, femtosecond laser-assisted biplanar CCI was created with 2.2mm diameter. Incision architecture and incision-site DMD were assessed using microscope-integrated intraoperative OCT (iOCT) and anterior segment OCT on postoperative day (POD) 1 and 30. Visual acuity was assessed on POD 1 and 30.
   Results: Smooth slit (SS) or ragged slit (RS) morphology of the proximal opening of CCI was observed immediately after creation [Group I: 68.8% SS, 31.2% RS; Group II: 86.5% SS, 13.5% RS]. DMD was observed in 87.1% cases with RS and 16.3% cases with SS morphology (p < 0.001). DMD was more frequent in group I (Group I = 38/77, Group II = 5/52; p < 0.001) and most commonly observed during the step of stromal hydration (83.7%). DMD was self-resolving and did not persist in any group at 1 month. Visual acuity was comparable in both groups on POD 1 and 30.
   Conclusion: Ragged morphology of proximal opening of CCI is the most important predictive factor for incision-site DMD. Femtosecond-laser CCIs have less incision-site DMD as compared to keratome-assisted CCIs. iOCT provides real-time assessment of CCI morphology and DMD.

AB  - Background: Current interventions for major depressive disorder (MDD) are suboptimal, and only one third respond to them on initial treatment. Neuroplasticity theories are the basis for several emerging treatments. Evidence on the impact of yoga, a well-known mind-body intervention, on neuroplasticity in MDD is limited.
   Objectives: To determine the effects of 12-week yoga- and meditation-based lifestyle intervention (YMLI) on depression severity and systemic biomarkers of neuroplasticity in adult MDD patients on routine drug treatment.
   Methods: A total of 58 MDD patients were randomized into yoga or control group. The severity of depression was assessed with Beck Depression Inventory-II scale (BDI-II). Blood samples were collected before and after intervention for the measurement of the biomarkers that characterize neuroplasticity, including mind-body communicative and cellular health biomarkers.
   Results: There was a significant decrease [difference between means, (95% CI)] in BDI-II score [-5.83 (-7.27, -4.39), p < 0.001] and significant increase in BDNF (ng/ml) [5.48 (3.50, 7.46), p < 0.001] after YMLI compared to control group. YMLI significantly increased DHEAS, sirtuin 1, and telomerase activity levels, and decreased cortisol, and IL-6 levels, in addition to decreasing DNA damage and balancing oxidative stress. Multiple regression analyses were used to associate neuroplasticity biomarkers with depression severity. A 'post-intervention change in BDNF' x 'group' interaction indicated that yoga group had more BDNF in association with less BDI-II scores relative to controls. Increased sirtuin 1 and telomerase activity and decreased cortisol significantly predicted this association (all p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: These results suggest that decrease in depression severity after YMLI in MDD is associated with improved systemic biomarkers of neuroplasticity. Thus YMLI can be considered as a therapeutic intervention in MDD management.

AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes of the innate immune system and play a pivotal role against virus-infected cells, microbial pathogens, and tumor cells. NK cells secrete several cytokine,s but IFN- secreted by NK cells play a vital role in the activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. But during any infection or tumor burden, functional activity of NK cells is downregulated significantly by nTreg cells. It is also found that during tumor progression, the number of nTreg cells increases as a result; it effectively suppresses the antitumor activity of NK cells. Therefore, in the present investigation, we intend to examine the mechanism of downregulation of antitumor immune response mediated by NK cells. We observed increased NK cell population at an early stage of Dalton's lymphoma (DL) growth, while at late stage, NK cell numbers were decreased. The NK cell functional activity was govern by high level of IFN- measurement during tumor progression. The FoxP3(+) CD25(+) CD4(+) T regulatory cell population was found to be continuously increased with high-level expression of FoxP3 during DL growth. The rapid increase in the number of Treg cells during DL progression may be due to high level of the FoxP3 transcription factor. The tumor microenvironment of DL cell progression has highly deleterious effect on NK cells after massive growth of tumor burden in BALB/c mice. This result also indicates that NK cell proliferation, activation, and accumulation are under the control of regulatory T cells.

AB  - The authors present a 36-year-old female with pulmonary tuberculosis who developed a choroidal tuberculoma in the left eye. The choroidal tuberculoma successfully resolved with visual gain following oral anti-tubercular and oral steroid therapy leaving behind a chorioretinal scar. One year after the completion of anti-tubercular treatment, she developed visual loss due to the development of a secondary choroidal neovascular membrane at the fovea. This was treated successfully with one intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in the left eye. The fovea remained free of fluid until the last follow-up 10 months after the intravitreal injection. Intravitreal bevacizumab may be an effective modality for treating secondary choroidal neovascular membranes that may form at the edge of a healed choroidal tuberculoma.

AB  - Phthisis bulbi denotes end-stage eye disease characterized by shrinkage and disorganization of the eye with the resultant functional loss. The major factors associated with the pathogenesis of phthisis are hypotony, deranged blood-ocular barriers, and inflammation. Common causes include trauma, surgery, infection, inflammation, malignancy, retinal detachment, and vascular lesions. A phthisical globe shows a small squared off shape, opaque and thickened cornea, thickened sclera, neovascularization of iris, cataract, cyclitic membrane, ciliochoroidal detachment, and retinal detachment. Microscopic features include internal disorganization, inflammatory reaction, a reactive proliferation of various cells, calcification, and ossification. Early treatment of the causative etiology is the best strategy available to avoid an eye from going into phthisis. A phthisical eye has no visual potential and cosmetic rehabilitation or symptomatic relief of pain remains the mainstay in the management. The authors present a comprehensive review of the etiopathogenesis, pathology, clinical features, and management of the end-stage ocular disease.

AB  - Objective: To compare the recently proposed Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) with the four-tiered reporting system (FTRS) followed at our institute. Methods: Parotid gland fine-needle aspirates reported over a period of 5 years were analysed. These aspirates had been placed into 4 categories according to the FTRS: unsatisfactory (UNS), no evidence of malignancy/negative (NEG), inconclusive for malignancy (INC), and diagnostic for malignancy/positive (POS). Aspirates with follow-up histopathology were then categorized according to the MSRSGC as follows: non-diagnostic, non-neoplastic, atypia of undetermined significance (AUS), neoplasm, suspicious for malignancy, and malignant. The risk of malignancy (ROM) was calculated. Results: A total of 893 parotid region aspirates were evaluated and histopathology was available for 190 cases (21%). ROM in MSRSGC groups, namely non-diagnostic, nonneoplastic, AUS, neoplasm, suspicious for malignant neoplasm, and malignant, was 44, 8, 0, 12, 81 and 100%, respectively. ROM in FTRS groups, namely UNS, NEG, INC, and POS, was 45, 13, 67 and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: MSRGC and FTRS are comparable with respect to the ROM across groups. Compared to FTRS, the further subcategorisation of the non-malignant group, the use of specific nomenclature, and the reproducibility of MSRGC provide proper risk stratification, thereby guiding better management and resulting in improved patient care.

AB  - Sarcomas are extremely complex and heterogeneous group of malignancies. However, exact categorization of the type of sarcoma is essential for the individualized approach for a given patient. It is mandatory that sarcomas should be treated in tertiary care centers with good pathology support and expertise. Here, we present an apt example of a young girl with large abdominal mass which was diagnosed as ovarian rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Besides, her excellent response to RMS regimen further reinforces the findings.

AB  - Objective Early risk assessment is important in acute pancreatitis (AP). The primary objective of this study was to compare various scores and biochemical markers done on the day of admission in predicting the outcome.
   Methods Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of patients presenting within 2 weeks of onset were collected. Various scores were calculated and biochemical markers were measured on the day of admission. Optimum cutoffs were identified through receiver operating curve analysis. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of outcome.
   Results Of 343 patients included, 202 (59%) were male; mean (SD) age was 38.7 (15.5) years. Acute pancreatitis was severe in 170 (49.6%) patients. Twenty-eight percent of the patients developed infected pancreatic necrosis and 18% died. An Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score of at least 7, bedside index for severity of AP (BISAP) of at least 2, systemic inflammatory response syndrome score of at least 3, and C-reactive protein of at least 82 ng/mL predicted severity. Predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis were as follows: PANC 3 score of at least 1, BISAP score of at least 2, and Marshall score of at least 2, whereas C-reactive protein of greater than 98, BISAP score of at least 2, APACHE score of at least 10, and a blood urea nitrogen of at least 17 predicted mortality.
   Conclusions Both BISAP and APACHE II are comparable in predicting outcome, but BISAP predicted all 3 outcomes with the same cutoff and hence is a robust scoring system.

AB  - Background. Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynaecological malignancy in India. Despite relatively high response rates to first-line carboplatin and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the majority of patients experience multiple relapses and finally become resistant. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes progression of ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF-A is an anti-angiogenesis agent. Data on the use of bevacizumab for EOC from India are not available. We, therefore, studied the use of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer.
   Methods. In this prospective, non-randomized study, 10 patients who received bevacizumab were compared with 20 age-and stage-matched controls. After maximal surgical debulking, patients in the bevacizumab arm received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg i.v. on day 1 every 3 weeks followed by paclitaxel and carboplatin from cycle 1. After 6 cycles, bevacizumab was continued for 1 year. Controls received paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) and carboplatin only for 4-8 cycles. The outcome measures were adverse effects and progression-free survival.
   Results. Haematological toxicity (i.e. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anaemia) was similar in both arms. Hypertension (40% v. 10%, p= 0.04) and bleeding-related complications (50% v. 0%, p= 0.002) were more in the bevacizumab arm. However, gastrointestinal (GI) perforations were not increased. The median progression-free survival was similar in both arms; 26 months versus 21 months (p= 0.57).
   Conclusion. In this small group of patients, addition of bevacizumab increased the toxicity of chemotherapy.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the efficacy of pulse cyclophosphamide with pulse dexamethasone in acute macular serpiginous choroiditis (SC).Methods: A total of 30 patients with macular SC were prospectively randomized into three treatment groups: group D (pulse dexamethasone); group C (pulse cyclophosphamide); and combination (pulse group DCP) administered for 3 days. Macular SC was defined as any active lesion involving/threatening macula.Results: A total of 30 patients were enrolled, with 10 patients in each group. Lesions completely healed at median duration of 2 weeks in each group, with significant improvement in visual acuity compared with pretreatment levels (p<0.05). Pulse cyclophosphamide was most effective in faster healing of lesions compared with other groups. There was no difference in gain in visual acuity between any of the groups (p = 0.32).Conclusions: Cyclophosphamide may be an effective treatment modality for acute macular SC, though it may not have a long-term effect on disease relapse.

AB  - There is scant literature on the effectiveness of using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as an intervention modality for managing tinnitus. The current case series reflects the use of tDCS as an effective intervention for tinnitus while inhibiting the dominant temporoparietal cortex and simultaneous stimulating the non-dominant dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Objective:To investigate the association of brain volumes, white matter lesion (WML) volumes, and lacunes, with cognitive decline in a population-based cohort of nondemented persons.Methods:Within the Rotterdam Study, 3624 participants underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. Cognition was evaluated at baseline (2005 to 2009) and at the follow-up visit (2011 to 2013). We used a test battery that tapped into domains of executive function, information processing speed, motor speed, and memory. The volumetric measures assessed were total brain volume, lobar (gray matter and white matter) volumes, and hippocampal volumes. We also studied the association of WML volumes and lacunes with cognitive decline using linear regression models.Results:Total brain volume was associated with decline in global cognition, information processing, and motor speed (P<0.001) in analyses controlled for demographic and vascular factors. Specifically, smaller frontal and parietal lobes were associated with decline in information processing and motor speed, and smaller temporal and parietal lobes were associated with decline in general cognition and motor speed (P<0.001 for all tests). Total WML volume was associated with decline in executive function. Lobar WML volume, hippocampal volume, and lacunes were not associated with cognitive decline.Conclusions:Lower brain volume is associated with subsequent cognitive decline. Although lower total brain volume was significantly associated with decline in global cognition, specific lobar volumes were associated with decline in certain cognitive domains.

AB  - Background: Herbal drugs are being used worldwide in a variety of debilitating neurological and psychiatric disorders such as cerebrovascular accident, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. However, unlike drugs of modern medicine, herbal drugs are complex products containing multiple pharmacologically active constituents. The nature and relative amounts of these constituents vary due to diverse factors such as but not limited to source of the plant(s), local environmental conditions, parts of the plant used, storage, method of extract preparation, accidental contamination or intentional adulteration. Further, they are handled by the human body like modem drugs and subjected to the processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. In each of these processes, they can potentially interact with modem drugs due to sharing of similar transport proteins, metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and uptake / efflux pumps. Moreover, herbal drugs can also inhibit or induce CYP450 enzymes or inactivate transporters leading to Herb-Drug interactions (HDIs).
   Method: In this narrative review, we have analyzed the clinically reported as well as potential HDIs between 10 common herbal drugs viz. Ginkgo, Ginseng, St. John's Wort, Grapefruit, Black and Long Pepper, Curcumin, Brahmi, Kava, Garlic and Valerian and modem medicines used in neurological and psychiatric disorders with their proven or postulated underlying mechanism(s).
   Results: Though a number of potential pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic HDIs have been examined, clinically significant alteration of response to modem medicines and/or serious adverse effects are apparently scarce except for Grapefruit and St. John's Wort.
   Conclusion: Physicians and patients should exercise caution when using herbal drugs and modem medicines concomitantly so that the recognized serious HDIs can be avoided..

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - COMMUNICATION FAILURES
KW  - HEALTH-CARE
KW  - CLIMATE
AB  - Background. Patient safety cannot be considered in isolation when organizational factors, both active and latent, influence patient outcomes.
   Methods. We did a cross-sectional mixed methods study using a convergent parallel design at a tertiary care public sector hospital in Hyderabad, Telangana (i) to qualitatively investigate the nature and determinants of patient safety incidents occurring in the hospital; (ii) to quantify the perception of hospital staff regarding factors affecting patient safety from an organizational perspective; and (iii) to triangulate the results to highlight areas in need of improvement.
   Results. The most common factors affecting patient safety were situational factors, working conditions and latent organizational factors including communication systems. Despite the relatively poor knowledge of paramedical staff regarding patient safety incidents, they perceived innovation and flexibility, outward focus, reflexivity, quality, pressure to produce, performance feedback and effort to be significantly higher compared to the heads of departments and clinical faculty. The strength of the dimensions: integration, involvement, training, welfare, supervisory support in the hospital was weak as perceived by all categories of staff.
   Conclusion. There is a need to build team work, improve trust and communication between various departments, invest more in training, and provide supervisory support along with structural and process improvements in issues such as drug procurement and developing patient-friendly physical environment.

AB  - Background: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and alopecia areata (AA) are common causes of alopecia which can sometimes be difficult to differentiate clinically. Horizontal sections of scalp biopsies are used to study non-cicatricial alopecias due to the ability to perform both quantitative and morphometric analysis of hair follicles on them. Methods: It was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted to assess the utility of horizontal sections to differentiate between the alopecias. Fifty-two cases were included: 20 cases of male AGA, 11 of female AGA and 21 cases of AA. After clinical examination and dermoscopy, a skin biopsy was taken and subjected to transverse sectioning. Histopathological assessment was done by two dermatopathologists blinded to clinical details. Results: Among the quantitative parameters, terminal: vellus hair ratio (3.08 in AGA and 1.83 in AA, p = 0.0091) and anagen:non-anagen hair ratio (9.25 in AGA and 3.56 in AA, p = 0.0021) were significantly lower in AA. In qualitative parameters, peribulbar inflammation was seen in 63% of AA cases (p = 0.0001). Pigment casts were seen in twice the number of AA (57%) than AGA (26%) cases. Broad avascular stelae and focal trichomalacia were seen in 9.5% of AA cases. Conclusion: Besides peribulbar inflammation, we found a lower anagen: non-anagen hair ratio and presence of pigment casts in transverse sections of scalp biopsies favouring AA over AGA. (c) 2018 S.

AB  - Use of anti-inflammatory drugs is well known to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer, one of the most common causes of cancer related mortality. In view of anti-inflammatory property of artesunate reported in various experimental models, the present study was carried out to evaluate its efficacy in rat model where colon carcinogenesis was induced by 1, 2 dimethylhydrazine (DMH). A time course study revealed that two injections of DMH given at an interval of one week resulted in appearance of multiple plaque lesions and aberrant crypt foci in the colon with a peak effect occurring at the end of 8 weeks. An efficacy study carried out with daily oral administration of artesunate (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) showed a marked reduction in preneoplastic changes with a significant decrease in the number of aberrant crypt foci, crypt multiplicity and restoration of histoarchitecture. Both the drugs down regulated beta-catenin signaling, reduced the levels of angiogenic markers like VEGF, MMP-9 and inhibited cellular proliferation. The anti-cancer effect of these drugs was concomitant with the pro-apoptotic effect as revealed by increased DNA fragmentation, TUNEL positivity and Bax/Bcl(2) immunoreactivity. This is the first study to evaluate the inhibitory effect of artesunate on pre-neoplastic changes in colon where its chemopreventive effect was found to be comparable to that of aspirin. Our study strengthens the previous findings and shows that it has a preventive and therapeutic potential in the treatment of colon cancer.

AB  - The release of paused RNA polymerase II into productive elongation is highly regulated, especially at genes that affect human development and disease. To exert control over this rate-limiting step, we designed sequence-specific synthetic transcription elongation factors (Syn-TEFs). These molecules are composed of programmable DNA-binding ligands flexibly tethered to a small molecule that engages the transcription elongation machinery. By limiting activity to targeted loci, Syn-TEFs convert constituent modules from broad-spectrum inhibitors of transcription into gene-specific stimulators. Here we present Syn-TEF1, a molecule that actively enables transcription across repressive GAA repeats that silence frataxin expression in Friedreich's ataxia, a terminal neurodegenerative disease with no effective therapy. The modular design of Syn-TEF1 defines a general framework for developing a class of molecules that license transcription elongation at targeted genomic loci.

TI  - Urinary potassium is a potential biomarker of disease activity in Ulcerative colitis and displays in vitro immunotolerant role
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - SODIUM
KW  - INFLAMMATION
AB  - We evaluated the in-vitro effect of potassium on CD4(+) T cells and the role of urinary potassium as a potential biomarker of disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). This prospective observational cohort study included healthy controls (n = 18) and UC patients [n = 30, median age: 40 (IQR: 28-46) years, 17 males)] with active disease(assessed by Mayo score) from September 2015-May 2016. Twenty-four hours urinary potassium along with fecal calprotectin (FCP) were estimated in UC patients (at baseline and follow-up after 3-6 months) and controls. In healthy volunteers, we also assessed the effect of potassium on CD4+ T cells differentiated in the presence of Th17 polarizing condition. UC patients had significantly higher FCP (368.2 +/- 443.04 vs 12.44 +/- 27.51, p < 0.001) and significantly lower urinary potassium (26.6 +/- 16.9 vs 46.89 +/- 35.91, p = 0.01) levels than controls. At follow-up, a significant increase in urinary potassium among patients who had clinical response [n = 22, 21.4 (14.4-39.7) to 36.5 (20.5-61.6), p = 0.04] and remission [n = 12, 18.7 (9.1-34.3) to 36.5 (23.4-70.5), p = 0.05] was accompanied with a parallel decline in FCP. On in-vitro analysis, potassium under Th17 polarizing conditions significantly inhibited IL-17 and interferon-gamma expression while favoring the induction of FoxP3(+) T cells. Therefore, urinary potassium levels are inversely associated with disease activity in UC with in-vitro data supporting an immune-tolerant role of potassium.

AB  - Background: Asthma is a complex, heterogeneous disorder with similar presenting symptoms but with varying underlying pathologies. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a relatively unexplored matrix which reflects the signatures of respiratory epithelium, but is difficult to normalize for dilution.
   Methods: Here we explored whether internally normalized global NMR spectrum patterns, combined with machine learning, could be useful for diagnostics or endotype discovery. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of EBC was performed in 89 asthmatic subjects from a prospective cohort and 20 healthy controls. A random forest classifier was built to differentiate between asthmatics and healthy controls. Clustering of the spectra was done using k-means to identify potential endotypes.
   Results: NMR spectra of the EBC could differentiate between asthmatics and healthy controls with 80% sensitivity and 75% specificity. Unsupervised clustering within the asthma group resulted in three clusters (n = 41,11, and 9). Cluster 1 patients had lower long-term exacerbation scores, when compared with other two clusters. Cluster 3 patients had lower blood eosinophils and higher neutrophils, when compared with other two clusters with a strong family history of asthma.
   Conclusion: Asthma clusters derived from NMR spectra of EBC show important clinical and chemical differences, suggesting this as a useful tool in asthma endotype-discovery.

AB  - To investigate the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) to high resolution, the GoT2D and T2D-GENES consortia catalogued variation from whole-genome sequencing of 2,657 European individuals and exome sequencing of 12,940 individuals of multiple ancestries. Over 27M SNPs, indels, and structural variants were identified, including 99% of low-frequency (minor allele frequency [MAF] 0.1-5%) non-coding variants in the whole-genome sequenced individuals and 99.7% of low-frequency coding variants in the whole-exome sequenced individuals. Each variant was tested for association with T2D in the sequenced individuals, and, to increase power, most were tested in larger numbers of individuals (> 80% of low-frequency coding variants in similar to 82 K Europeans via the exome chip, and similar to 90% of low-frequency non-coding variants in similar to 44 K Europeans via genotype imputation). The variants, genotypes, and association statistics from these analyses provide the largest reference to date of human genetic information relevant to T2D, for use in activities such as T2D-focused genotype imputation, functional characterization of variants or genes, and other novel analyses to detect associations between sequence variation and T2D.

AB  - Aim
   To evaluate the incidence and progression of myopia and factors associated with progression of myopia in school going children in Delhi.
   Methods
   Prospective longitudinal study of 10,000 school children aged 5 to 15 years screened after an interval of 1 year to identify new myopes (Spherical Equivalent <= -0.5D) and progression of myopia in previously diagnosed myopic children. Association between risk factors and progression was analyzed using adjusted odds ratio.
   Results
   Of the 9,616 children re-screened (97.3% coverage), annual incidence of myopia was 3.4% with mean dioptric change of -1.09 +/- 0.55. There was a significant higher incidence of myopia in younger children compared to older children (P = 0.012) and among girls compared to boys (P = 0.002). Progression was observed in 49.2% children with mean dioptric change of -0.27 +/- 0.42 diopters. The demographic and behavioral risk factors were analyzed for children with progression (n = 629) and adjusted odds ratio values were estimated. Hours of reading-writing/week (p<0.001), use of computers/video games (P<0.001) and watching television (P = 0.048) were significant risk factors for progression of myopia. Outdoor activities/time spent outdoors> 2 hours in a day were protective with an inverse association with progression of myopia (P<0.001).
   Conclusion
   Myopia is an important health issue in India and is associated with long hours of reading and screen time with use of computers and video games. An annual eye vision screening should be conducted, and outdoor activities be promoted to prevent the increase of myopia among school children.

AB  - Background Underweight, overweight, and obesity in childhood and adolescence are associated with adverse health consequences throughout the life-course. Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to compare trends with those of adults.
   Methods We pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128.9 million participants aged 5 years and older, including 31.5 million aged 5-19 years. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI and for prevalence of BMI in the following categories for children and adolescents aged 5-19 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO growth reference for children and adolescents (referred to as moderate and severe underweight hereafter), 2 SD to more than 1 SD below the median (mild underweight), 1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the median (healthy weight), more than 1 SD to 2 SD above the median (overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the median (obesity).
   Findings Regional change in age-standardised mean BMI in girls from 1975 to 2016 ranged from virtually no change (-0.01 kg/m (2) per decade; 95% credible interval -0.42 to 0.39, posterior probability [PP] of the observed decrease being a true decrease= 0.5098) in eastern Europe to an increase of 1.00 kg/m(2) per decade (0.69-1.35, PP> 0.9999) in central Latin America and an increase of 0.95 kg/m (2) per decade (0.64-1.25, PP> 0.9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. The range for boys was from a non-significant increase of 0.09 kg/m(2) per decade (-0.33 to 0.49, PP= 0.6926) in eastern Europe to an increase of 0.77 kg/m (2) per decade (0.50-1.06, PP> 0.9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Trends in mean BMI have recently flattened in northwestern Europe and the high-income English-speaking and Asia-Pacific regions for both sexes, southwestern Europe for boys, and central and Andean Latin America for girls. By contrast, the rise in BMI has accelerated in east and south Asia for both sexes, and southeast Asia for boys. Global age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 0.7% (0.4-1.2) in 1975 to 5.6% (4.8-6.5) in 2016 in girls, and from 0.9% (0.5-1.3) in 1975 to 7.8% (6.7-9.1) in 2016 in boys; the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight decreased from 9.2% (6.0-12.9) in 1975 to 8.4% (6.8-10.1) in 2016 in girls and from 14.8% (10.4-19.5) in 1975 to 12.4% (10.3-14.5) in 2016 in boys. Prevalence of moderate and severe underweight was highest in India, at 22.7% (16.7-29.6) among girls and 30.7% (23.5-38.0) among boys. Prevalence of obesity was more than 30% in girls in Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau; and boys in the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Niue, and American Samoa in 2016. Prevalence of obesity was about 20% or more in several countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Middle East and north Africa, the Caribbean, and the USA. In 2016, 75 (44-117) million girls and 117 (70-178) million boys worldwide were moderately or severely underweight. In the same year, 50 (24-89) million girls and 74 (39-125) million boys worldwide were obese.
   Interpretation The rising trends in children's and adolescents' BMI have plateaued in many high-income countries, albeit at high levels, but have accelerated in parts of Asia, with trends no longer correlated with those of adults.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesThe immune dysfunction in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients is one of the major factors for growth and dissemination of tumor affecting disease-free survival.
   MethodsThe phenotypic and functional characteristics of Regulatory T (T-reg) CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) subsets in OSCC patients were assessed by multicolor flow cytometry and its effector component (TGF-) by Western blot and qRT-PCR.
   ResultsAn increased (P<0.05) prevalence of T-reg phenotypes (CD4(+)CD25(+), CD4(+)FoxP3(+), CD8(+)FoxP3(+), CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)) was observed in the peripheral circulation of OSCC patients that positively correlated with clinicopathological features. The increased frequency of CD4(+)CD8(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+), a unique T cell subset, CTLA-4(+), GITR(+), NrP1(+), HLA-DR+, CD127(+), Tbet(+), TGF-(+), and granzyme B+ (GzmB) T-regs also showed a significantly higher prevalence in OSCC patients. Functionally, CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T-regs showed skewed expression of IL-2, IL-10, and IL-35 in patients as compared with the normal controls. Further, enhanced expression of CCR5 and CCR7 on T-regs with up regulation of their ligands (CCL5, CCL19, and CCL21) in tumor cells indicates efficient recruitment and trafficking of T-regs to the tumor site.
   ConclusionIt seems reasonable to assume that modulation of functional dynamics of selective T-reg subsets may be useful in developing immunotherapeutic strategy for OSCC patients.

AB  - In vivo biodistribution and fate of extracellular vesicles (EVs) are still largely unknown and require reliable in vivo tracking techniques. In this study, in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) using Renilla luciferase (Rluc) was developed and applied to monitoring of EVs derived from thyroid cancer (CAL-62 cells) and breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) in nude mice after intravenous administration and was compared with a dye-based labeling method for EV derived from CAL-62 cells. The EVs were successfully labeled with Rluc and visualized by BLI in mice. In vivo distribution of the EVs, as measured by BLI, was consistent with the results of ex vivo organ analysis. EV-CAL-62/Rluc showed strong signals at lung followed by liver, spleen & kidney (P < 0.05). EV-MDA-MB-231/Rluc showed strong signals at liver followed by lung, spleen & kidney (P < 0.05). EV-CAL-62/Rluc and EV-MDA-MB-231/Rluc stayed in animal till day 9 and 3, respectively; showed a differential distribution. Spontaneous EV-CAL-62/Rluc shown distributed mostly to lung followed by liver, spleen & kidney. The new BLI system used to show spontaneous distribution of EV-CAL-62/Rluc in subcutaneous CAL-62/Rluc bearing mice. Dye (DiR)-labeled EV-CAL-62/Rluc showed a different distribution in vivo & ex vivo compared to EV-CAL-62/Rluc. Fluorescent signals were predominately detected in the liver (P < 0.05) and spleen (P < 0.05) regions. The bioluminescent EVs developed in this study may be used for monitoring of EVs in vivo. This novel reporter-imaging approach to visualization of EVs in real time is expected to pave the way for monitoring of EVs in EV-based treatments.

AB  - Objectives: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) continues to be major public health burden in developing world. Echocardiographic screening in school children has shown that subclinical RHD cases are several times more than clinical cases. Recent reports have used World Heart Federation (WHF) criteria. Objective of present study was to determine RHD prevalence using WHF criteria in Indian children.
   Methods: Children (5-15 years) from randomly selected schools across four sites were included. After focused clinical evaluation, echocardiography was performed using WHF criteria in all children. Images/loops of abnormal cases were analyzed independently by an additional experienced cardiologist. Children with murmur and confirmatory echocardiography were categorized 'clinical RHD'; those with abnormal echocardiography alone were labeled 'subclinical RHD'.
   Results: Among 16,294 children included, mean age was 10.8 +/- 2.9 years; 55.1% weremales; 11,405 (70%) were fromrural areas and 3978 (24.4%) were fromgovernment schools. Wedetected RHD by echocardiography in 125 children [prevalence: 7.7/1000 (95% CI 6.3, 9.0)]. BorderlineRHDwas present in 93 children (5.7/1000, 95% CI 4.6, 6.9), definite RHD in 32 (2/1000, 95% CI 1.2, 2.6), and clinical RHD in six [0.36/1000, 95% CI: 0.1-0.7]. On univariate analysis, older age, female gender, and higher waist circumference were associated while on multivariate analysis, older age (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.26) and female gender (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.3) were associated with RHD.
   Conclusion: RHD prevalence varies in different parts of India. Echocardiographic prevalence is several times higher than clinical and underscores importance of echocardiographic screening in community. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present work deals with the development of a non-invasive optical glucose biosensor using saliva samples and a smartphone. The sensor was fabricated with a simple methodology by immobilization of Glucose oxidase enzyme along with a pH responsive dye on a filter paper based strip. The strip changes color upon reaction with glucose present in saliva and the color changes were detected using a smartphone camera through RGB profiling. This standalone biosensor showed good sensitivity and low interference while operating within 20 s response time. We used various means for improvements such as the use of slope method instead of differential response; use of a responsive pH indicator and made numerous tweaks in the smartphone app. Calibration with spiked saliva samples with slopes for (R vertical bar G vertical bar B) pixels revealed an exponentially increasing calibration curve with a linear detection range of 50-540 mg/dL, sensitivity of 0.0012 pixels sec(-1)/mg dL(-1) and LOD of 24.6 mg/dL. The biosensor was clinically validated on both healthy and diabetic subjects divided into several categories based on sex, age, diabetic status etc. and correlation between blood and salivary glucose has been established for better standardization of the sensor. Correlation of 0.44 was obtained between blood and salivary glucose in healthy individuals whereas it was 0.64 and 0.94 in case of prediabetic and diabetic patients respectively. The developed biosensor has the potential to be used for mass diagnosis of diabetes especially in such areas where people remain prohibited from routine analysis due to high healthcare cost. Apart from that, a smartphone would be the only device the user needs for this measurement, along with a disposable low cost test strip. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which have also been adopted by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO), India, Efavirenz-based Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART) is better in Human-Immunodeficiency-Virus (HIV)-infected patients who are also being treated with Rifampicin-based Anti-Tuberculous Therapy (ATT). However, Efavirenz is much more expensive. We hypothesize that Nevirapine is a cheaper alternative that possesses equal efficacy as Efavirenz in HIV-Tuberculosis (TB) co-infected patients.
   Methods: A parallel open-label randomized clinical trial was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi and National AIDS Research Institute (NARI), Pune. Those who were ART-naive and co-infected with TB were randomized to receive either Nevirapine (Group 1)- or Efavirenz (Group 2)-based ART along with Rifampicin-based ATT. ATT was begun first in ART-naive patients according to the NACO guidelines, with a median of 27 days between ATT and ART in both groups. The primary endpoint was a composite unfavourable outcome (death and/or ART failure) at 96 weeks, and the secondary outcome was successful TB treatment at 48 weeks.
   Results: A total of 284 patients (mean age 36.7 +/- 8.1 years) were randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive either Nevirapine (n = 144)-or Efavirenz (n = 140)-based ART after a median ATT-ART gap of 27 days. The median CD4 count was 105 cells/mu l, with a median viral load of 820,200 copies/mu l and no significant difference between the groups. Composite unfavourable outcomes were reported in 49 patients in the Nevirapine group and 51 patients in the Efavirenz group (35. 3% vs. 36.9%; hazard ratio, 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.63,1.43, adjusted). There was no difference in successful TB treatment outcome between the groups (71.5% vs. 65.6%, 95% CI -3.8,17.9, adjusted). The results were similar, showing no difference between the groups in the two centres of the study after adjusting for disease stage.
   Conclusions: Composite unfavourable outcome in HIV-TB co-infected patients who were ART-naive showed no statistically significant difference in the Nevirapine or Efavirenz groups.. Therefore, Nevirapine-based ART is a reasonable alternative to Efavirenz in resource-limited settings. However, multi-centric studies with larger sample sizes are required to confirm these findings.

AB  - Direct smear microscopy of sputum forms the mainstay of TB diagnosis in resource-limited settings. Stained sputum smear slides can serve as a ready-made resource to transport sputum for molecular drug susceptibility testing. However, bio-safety is a major concern during transport of sputum/stained slides and for laboratory workers engaged in processing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected sputum specimens. In this study, a bio-safe USP (Universal Sample Processing) concentration-based sputum processing method (Bio-safe method) was assessed on 87 M. tuberculosis culture positive sputum samples. Samples were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) smear, liquid culture and DNA isolation. DNA isolated directly from sputum was subjected to an IS6110 PCR assay. Both sputum DNA and DNA extracted from bio-safe ZN concentrated smear slides were subjected to rpoB PCR and simultaneously assessed by DNA sequencing for determining rifampin (RIF) resistance. All sputum samples were rendered sterile by Bio-safe method. Bio-safe smears exhibited a 5% increment in positivity over direct smear with a 14% increment in smear grade status. All samples were positive for IS6110 and rpoB PCR. Thirty four percent samples were RIF resistant by rpoB PCR product sequencing. A 100% concordance (kappa value = 1) was obtained between sequencing results derived from bio-safe smear slides and bio-safe sputum. This study demonstrates that Bio-safe method can address safety issues associated with sputum processing, provide an efficient alternative to sample transport in the form of bio-safe stained concentrated smear slides and can also provide information on drug (RIF) resistance by direct DNA sequencing.

AB  - Background: Herein, for the first time, we report aberrant expression of membrane-associated RING-CH8 (MARCH8) in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. MARCH8 is a member of the recently discovered MARCH family of really interesting new genes (RING) E3 ligases. Though initial studies primarily focused on its immunomodulatory role, the newly discovered targets of this E3 ligase point towards its possible role in other biological processes such as embryogenesis and inhibition of apoptosis. However, its relevance in cancers is yet to be elucidated.
   Methods: We carried out quantitative real time PCR and immunohistochemistry to examine the levels of MARCH8 mRNA and protein in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues. The role of MARCH8 in esophageal cancer cells was evaluated by cell proliferation, clonogenic and migration/invasion assays and flow cytometry with MARCH8 gene knockdown.
   Results: Significantly increased expression of MARCH8 mRNA was found in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as compared to distant matched non-malignant tissues (p = 0.024, AUC = 0.654). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed overexpression of MARCH8 protein in 86% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues (p < 0.001, AUC = 0.908). Interestingly, intense nuclear staining of MARCH8 protein was detected in cancer cells in addition to its cytoplasmic expression. Knockdown of MARCH8 resulted in decreased proliferation, migration, invasion and clonogenic potential of esophageal cancer cells. In addition to this, silencing of MARCH8 induced apoptosis in esophageal cancer cells which was measured by cell cycle distribution assay which showed increase in sub G0 and G2/M populations (cell death) and decrease in S-phase population. To further check the type of apoptosis induced by MARCH8 silencing, annexin assay was performed which showed significant increase in the number of cells in early apoptotic phase.
   Conclusions: Overall, increased expression of MARCH8 gene in preneoplastic and neoplastic esophageal tissues and its knockdown effect on cancer cell properties demonstrated herein points towards the potential role of this protein in esophageal tumorigenesis.

AB  - Background 18% of the world's population lives in India, and many states of India have populations similar to those of large countries. Action to effectively improve population health in India requires availability of reliable and comprehensive state-level estimates of disease burden and risk factors over time. Such comprehensive estimates have not been available so far for all major diseases and risk factors. Thus, we aimed to estimate the disease burden and risk factors in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016.
   Methods Using all available data sources, the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative estimated burden (metrics were deaths, disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs], prevalence, incidence, and life expectancy) from 333 disease conditions and injuries and 84 risk factors for each state of India from 1990 to 2016 as part of GBD 2016. We divided the states of India into four epidemiological transition level (ETL) groups on the basis of the ratio of DALYs from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases (CMNNDs) to those from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and injuries combined in 2016. We assessed variations in the burden of diseases and risk factors between ETL state groups and between states to inform a more specific health-system response in the states and for India as a whole.
   Findings DALYs due to NCDs and injuries exceeded those due to CMNNDs in 2003 for India, but this transition had a range of 24 years for the four ETL state groups. The age-standardised DALY rate dropped by 36.2% in India from 1990 to 2016. The numbers of DALYs and DALY rates dropped substantially for most CMNNDs between 1990 and 2016 across all ETL groups, but rates of reduction for CMNNDs were slowest in the low ETL state group. By contrast, numbers of DALYs increased substantially for NCDs in all ETL state groups, and increased significantly for injuries in all ETL state groups except the highest. The all-age prevalence of most leading NCDs increased substantially in India from 1990 to 2016, and a modest decrease was recorded in the age-standardised NCD DALY rates. The major risk factors for NCDs, including high systolic blood pressure, high fasting plasma glucose, high total cholesterol, and high body-mass index, increased from 1990 to 2016, with generally higher levels in higher ETL states; ambient air pollution also increased and was highest in the low ETL group. The incidence rate of the leading causes of injuries also increased from 1990 to 2016. The five leading individual causes of DALYs in India in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, and cerebrovascular disease; and the five leading risk factors for DALYs in 2016 were child and maternal malnutrition, air pollution, dietary risks, high systolic blood pressure, and high fasting plasma glucose. Behind these broad trends many variations existed between the ETL state groups and between states within the ETL groups. Of the ten leading causes of disease burden in India in 2016, five causes had at least a five-times difference between the highest and lowest state-specific DALY rates for individual causes.
   Interpretation Per capita disease burden measured as DALY rate has dropped by about a third in India over the past 26 years. However, the magnitude and causes of disease burden and the risk factors vary greatly between the states. The change to dominance of NCDs and injuries over CMNNDs occurred about a quarter century apart in the four ETL state groups. Nevertheless, the burden of some of the leading CMNNDs continues to be very high, especially in the lowest ETL states. This comprehensive mapping of inequalities in disease burden and its causes across the states of India can be a crucial input for more specific health planning for each state as is envisioned by the Government of India's premier think tank, the National Institution for Transforming India, and the National Health Policy 2017.

AB  - Background: Dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data acquired using gradient echo based sequences is affected by errors in flip angle (FA) due to transmit B-1 inhomogeneity (B(1)inh). The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of B(1)inh on quantitative analysis of DCE-MRI data of human brain tumor patients and to evaluate the clinical significance of B(1)inh correction of perfusion parameters (PPs) on tumor grading.
   Methods: An MRI study was conducted on 35 glioma patients at 3T. The patients had histologically confirmed glioma with 23 high-grade (HG) and 12 low-grade (LG). Data for B-1-mapping, T-1-mapping and DCE-MRI were acquired. Relative B-1 maps (B-1rel) were generated using the saturated-double-angle method. T-1-maps were computed using the variable flip-angle method. Post-processing was performed for conversion of signal-intensity time (S(t)) curve to concentration-time (C(t)) curve followed by tracer kinetic analysis (K-trans, Ve, Vp, Kep) and first pass analysis (CBV, CBF) using the general tracer-kinetic model. DCE-MRI data was analyzed without and with B(1)inh correction and errors in PPs were computed. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed on HG and LG patients. Simulations were carried out to understand the effect of B-1 inhomogeneity on DCE-MRI data analysis in a systematic way. S(t) curves mimicking those in tumor tissue, were generated and FA errors were introduced followed by error analysis of PPs. Dependence of FA-based errors on the concentration of contrast agent and on the duration of DCE-MRI data was also studied. Simulations were also done to obtain K-trans of glioma patients at different B-1rel values and see whether grading is affected or not.
   Results: Current study shows that B-1rel value higher than nominal results in an overestimation of C(t) curves as well as derived PPs and vice versa. Moreover, at same B-1rel values, errors were large for larger values of C(t). Simulation results showed that grade of patients can change because of B(1)inh.
   Conclusions: B(1)inh in the human brain at 3T-MRI can introduce substantial errors in PPs derived from DCE-MRI data that might affect the accuracy of tumor grading, particularly for border zone cases. These errors can be mitigated using B(1)inh correction during DCE-MRI data analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathies refer to a group of disorders in which there is damage to the nerves of the peripheral nervous system. Electrophysiologic studies are the main stay for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathies. However, direct visualization of the nerves is possible with exact localization of site of disease with high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) and 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and newer magnetic resonance (MR) sequences.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study including 55 patients and 64 nerves with upper limb peripheral neuropathies. All patients included underwent high-resolution focused USG of the nerves and MR neurography. A nerve conduction velocity study was performed for reference.
   RESULTS: The diagnostic confidence of the turbo spin echo T2-weighted (T2W) MR sequence was seen to be highest, with a sensitivity of 95.31%, whereas it was 81.25% for USG. Continuity of the nerve in patients with traumatic neuropathy was seen in 65.7% and 62.86% (22/35) nerves on MRI and USG, respectively. T1-weighted and T2W MR sequences were seen to be equally effective in establishing the continuity of the nerve. Increase in the caliber/thickening was seen in 77% of cases on MRI and 73.8% of cases on USG. Neuroma formation was seen equally on both MR and USG in 60.66%. We consistently found low fractional anisotropy (FA) values at the site of disease.
   CONCLUSIONS: USG is a sensitive technique to diagnose peripheral neuropathies and it should be used as a screening modality for focused MR to be performed later. Turbo spin echo T2W fast spin has the highest sensitivity to identify nerve disease and is comparable with nerve conduction studies. Among the newer sequences, diffusion tensor imaging should be performed to increase diagnostic confidence.

AB  - Several B cell defects are reported in HIV-1 infected individuals including variation in B cell subsets, polyclonal B cell activation and exhaustion, with broadly neutralizing antibodies elicited in less than 10-20% of the infected population. HIV-1 disease progression is faster in children than adults. B Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS), expressed on dendritic cells (DCs), is a key regulator of B cell homeostasis. Understanding how DCs influence B cell phenotype and functionality (viral neutralization), thereby HIV-1 disease outcome in infected children, is important to develop interventional strategies for restoration of B cell function. In this study, a total of 38 vertically transmitted HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive children and 25 seronegative controls were recruited. Based on the CD4 counts and years post-infection, infected children were categorized as long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) (n = 20) and progressors (n = 18). Eight of these progressors were followed up at 6-12 months post-ART. Percentages (%) of DCs, B cell subsets, and expression of BLyS on DCs were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Plasma levels of B cell growth factors were measured by ELISA and viral neutralization activity was determined using TZM-bl assay. Lower (%) of myeloid DCs (mDCs), plasmacytoid DCs, and high expression of BLyS on mDCs were observed in HIV-1 infected progressors than seronegative controls. Progressors showed lower % of naive B cells, resting memory B cells and higher % of mature activated, tissue-like memory B cells as compared to seronegative controls. Higher plasma levels of IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and IgA were observed in progressors vs. seronegative controls. Plasma levels of IgG were high in progressors and in LTNPs than seronegative controls, suggesting persistence of hypergammaglobulinemia at all stages of disease. High plasma levels of BLyS in progressors positively correlated with poor viral neutralizing activity. Interestingly on follow up, treatment naive progressors, post-ART showed increase in resting memory B cells along with reduction in plasma BLyS levels that correlated with improvement in viral neutralization. This is the first study to demonstrate that reduction in plasma BLyS levels correlates with restoration of B cell function, in terms of viral neutralization in HIV-1-infected children.

AB  - Motivated by recent interest in identification of functional brain networks, we develop a new multivariate approach for functional brain network identification and name it as Multivariate Vector Regression based Connectivity (MVRC). The proposed MVRC method regresses time series of all regions to those of other regions simultaneously and estimates pairwise association between two regions with consideration of influence of other regions and builds the adjacency matrix. Next, modularity method is applied on the adjacency matrix to detect communities or functional brain networks. We compare the proposed MVRC method with existing methods ranging from simple Pearson correlation to advanced Multivariate Adaptive Sparse Representation (ASR) methods. Experimental results on simulated and real fMRI dataset demonstrate that MVRC is able to extract functional brain networks that are consistent with the literature. Also, the proposed MVRC method is 650-750 times faster compared to the existing ASR method on 90 node network. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Elevated expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone H3K27 methyltransferase, was observed in gliomas harboring telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations. Given the known involvement of TERT and EZH2 in glioma progression, the correlation between the two and subsequently its involvement in metabolic programming was investigated. Inhibition of human telomerase reverse transcriptase either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation not only decreased EZH2 expression, but also (i) abrogated FASN levels, (ii) decreased de novo fatty acid accumulation, and (iii) increased ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) phosphorylation levels. Conversely, diminished TERT and FASN levels upon siRNA-mediated EZH2 knockdown indicated a positive correlation between TERT and EZH2. Interestingly, ATM kinase inhibitor rescued TERT inhibition-mediated decrease in FASN and EZH2 levels. Importantly, TERT promoter mutant tumors exhibited greater microsatellite instability, heightened FASN levels and lipid accumulation. Coherent with invitro findings, pharmacological inhibition of TERT by costunolide decreased lipid accumulation and elevated ATM expression in heterotypic xenograft glioma mouse model. By bringing TERT-EZH2 network at the forefront as driver of dysregulated metabolism, our findings highlight the non-canonical but distinct role of TERT in metabolic reprogramming and DNA damage responses in glioblastoma.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. The most common causes for liver cancer include hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and alcohol use.
   OBJECTIVE To report results of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2015 study on primary liver cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 195 countries or territories from 1990 to 2015, and present global, regional, and national estimates on the burden of liver cancer attributable to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and an " other" group that encompasses residual causes.
   DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Mortalitywas estimated using vital registration and cancer registry data in an ensemble modeling approach. Single-cause mortality estimates were adjusted for all-cause mortality. Incidence was derived from mortality estimates and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. Through a systematic literature review, data on the proportions of liver cancer due to HBV, HCV, alcohol, and other causes were identified. Years of life lost were calculated by multiplying each death by a standard life expectancy. Prevalence was estimated using mortality-to-incidence ratio as surrogate for survival. Total prevalence was divided into 4 sequelae that were multiplied by disability weights to derive years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were the sum of years of life lost and YLDs.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Liver cancer mortality, incidence, YLDs, years of life lost, DALYs by etiology, age, sex, country, and year.
   RESULTS There were 854 000 incident cases of liver cancer and 810 000 deaths globally in 2015, contributing to 20 578 000 DALYs. Cases of incident liver cancer increased by 75% between 1990 and 2015, of which 47% can be explained by changing population age structures, 35% by population growth, and -8% to changing age-specific incidence rates. The male-to-female ratio for age-standardized liver cancer mortality was 2.8. Globally, HBV accounted for 265 000 liver cancer deaths (33%), alcohol for 245 000 (30%), HCV for 167 000 (21%), and other causes for 133 000 (16%) deaths, with substantial variation between countries in the underlying etiologies.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Liver cancer is among the leading causes of cancer deaths in many countries. Causes of liver cancer differ widely among populations. Our results show that most cases of liver cancer can be prevented through vaccination, antiviral treatment, safe blood transfusion and injection practices, as well as interventions to reduce excessive alcohol use. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, the identification and elimination of risk factors for liver cancer will be required to achieve a sustained reduction in liver cancer burden. The GBD study can be used to guide these prevention efforts.

TI  - Do attributes of persons with chronic kidney disease differ in low-income and middle-income countries compared with high-income countries? Evidence from population-based data in six countries

AB  - Kidney biopsies to elucidate the cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are performed in a minority of persons with CKD living in high-income countries, since associated conditions-that is, diabetes mellitus, vascular disease or obesity with pre-diabetes, prehypertension or dyslipidaemia-can inform management targeted at slowing CKD progression in a majority. However, attributes of CKD may differ substantially among persons living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used data from population or community-based studies from five LMICs (China, urban India, Moldova, Nepal and Nigeria) to determine what proportion of persons with CKD living in diverse regions fit one of the three major clinical profiles, with data from the US National Health Nutrition and Examination Survey as reference. In the USA, urban India and Moldova, 79.0%-83.9%; in China and Nepal, 62.4%-66.7% and in Nigeria, 51.6% persons with CKD fit one of three established risk profiles. Diabetes was most common in urban India and vascular disease in Moldova (50.7% and 33.2% of persons with CKD in urban India and Moldova, respectively). In Nigeria, 17.8% of persons with CKD without established risk factors had albuminuria >= 300 mg/g, the highest proportion in any country. While the majority of persons with CKD in LMICs fit into one of three established risk profiles, the proportion of persons who have CKD without established risk factors is higher than in the USA. These findings can inform tailored CKD detection and management systems and highlight the importance of studying potential causes and outcomes of CKD without established risk factors in LMICs.

AB  - BackgroundThere is a paucity of data available about BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) infection after renal transplantation (RTX) in resource-limited countries with a predominantly living-donor, ABO-compatible RTX program. We aimed to assess BKPyV infection in such patients in a public hospital in India.
   MethodsWe prospectively evaluated plasma BKPyV replication in 62 patients at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12months after RTX. Sustained significant BK viremia (SSBKV) was defined as significant viremia (10000 copies/mL) detected 2 times, and BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKVAN) as histologic changes of BKVAN with BK viremia with/without graft dysfunction.
   ResultsAll patients underwent RTX without requiring desensitization. Incidence of BK viremia was: 17.7%, 41.9%, 16.1%, 25.8%, and 17.7% at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12months, respectively. Of 62 patients, 64.5% had BKPyV viremia during the study, 32.2% had significant viremia, all except one detected in the first 6months. Nine (14.5%) patients had SSBKV. There was no biopsy-proven BKVAN. At the end of 1year, mean serum creatinine was higher and graft dysfunction was significantly more common in patients with SSBKV compared to those without SSBKV.
   ConclusionTransient BK viremia is common in low/intermediate immunologic risk RTX recipients in India, with a peak occurring at 3-6months. Most clear their viremia by 12months. Graft dysfunction seems to be more frequent in patients with SSBKV, although BKVAN is uncommon on biopsy in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: Our objective was to assess how telephonic review of outpatients with stable epilepsy compared with conventional face-to-face clinic management.
   Methods: We constructed a randomized parallel group study of suitable patients attending our Epilepsy Clinic and compared telephonic review with conventional clinic visit based management. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with breakthrough seizures and total number of breakthrough seizures. We also compared cost, patient satisfaction and numbers defaulting.
   Results: A total of 465 patients were randomized and 429 were included in the final analysis. There was no significant difference in breakthrough seizures between the two groups. Mean time spent in the consultation was 10 min in the telephone group (FT) and 22 h in the face-to-face group (FC) and cost was INR 865 more expensive on an average in the FC group. Satisfaction was over 90% in the FT group. Significantly more people in the FC group were lost to follow-up.
   Conclusion: This study provides Class I evidence that the number of stable epilepsy patients who have breakthrough seizures and the total number of breakthrough seizures remain the same irrespective of whether patients are reviewed telephonically or face-to-face in the clinic. Clinicians managing epilepsy patients should consider using telephonic review for selected patients. Telephonic reviews have the potential of effectively reducing the secondary treatment gap in millions of patients who do not have easy access to doctors. (C) 2017 British Epilepsy Association.

AB  - Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a multifactorial syndrome with high morbidity and mortality rates, characterized by deficiency in gas exchange and lung mechanics that lead to hypoxemia, dyspnea, and respiratory failure. Histologically, ARDS is characterized by an acute, exudative phase, combining diffuse alveolar damage and noncardiogenic edema, followed by a later fibroproliferative phase. Despite an enhanced understanding of ARDS pathogenesis, the capacity to predict the development of ARDS and to risk-stratify patients with the disease remains limited. Biomarkers may help to identify patients at the greatest risk of developing ARDS, to evaluate response to therapy, to predict outcome, and to improve clinical trials. The ARDS pathogenesis is presented in this article, as well as concepts and information on biomarkers that are currently used clinically or are available for laboratory use by academic and practicing pathologists and the developing and validating of new assays, focusing on the assays' major biologic roles in lung injury and/or repair and to ultimately suggest innovative, therapeutic approaches.

AB  - The gold standard diagnostic test for Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy (UCMD) is molecular testing for COL6 mutation. The facility for genetic testing is sparingly available and it is usually diagnosed by muscle biopsy. The latter is an invasive procedure requiring expertise and sedation. Skin biopsy has shown promise as a simpler diagnostic modality. Eleven and 7 cases, respectively, of phenotypically suspected Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and dystrophinopathy underwent simultaneous skin and muscle biopsies, which were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry staining for collagen VI and dystrophin 1, 2, and 3. Of the 8 and 5 muscle biopsy-confirmed cases of Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and dystrophinopathy, 6 Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy and 5 dystrophinopathy cases showed absent and preserved COL6 staining, respectively, in the skin biopsy. Skin biopsy as a diagnostic option has shown encouraging results in Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. These should be evaluated in larger studies.

AB  - We report here a 3D cell culture microgel-based system containing carbon dots capable of sensing the pH changes in the cellular microenvironment. We have utilized a simple droplet-based microfluidics methodology for encapsulating cells and fluorescent pH sensitive carbon dots in polyethylene glycol microgels. Since the microfluidics assembly is developed from simple components that can be modified easily to yield microgels of different size, composition, and architecture, it can be utilized to develop complex 3D cell culture scaffolds of desired composition along with spatial control on the polymer composition. The synthesized pH sensitive carbon dots possess green fluorescence emission, which increases as the pH is lowered from neutral to acidic. Since the probe sensitivity to pH change is well within the physiologically relevant range (pH 5.8-7.7), the probe can be used for detecting a lowering of pH as the cells proliferate or undergo various biological processes. We demonstrate that the nanoprobes as well as the process of forming the microgel beads with nanoprobes and mammalian cells is biocompatible, and the cells easily proliferate inside the microgels. The changes in pH as the mammalian cells grow in the microgels is easily monitored via fluorescence microscopy, suggesting that the platform can be used to study time dependent changes in cellular microenvironment pH and can be easily utilized to monitor cellular growth, disease progression, etc.

AB  - A comprehensive laboratory diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies forms an integral part in workup of disorders of globin chain synthesis. Clinical findings, complete blood counts, peripheral smear examination along with hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis and/or cation exchange high performance liquid chromatography findings and parental study helps to clinch a final diagnosis. Compound heterozygous hemoglobinopathy presents with variable clinical findings and some of them are picked up on screening tests done as part of routine antenatal workup. Here we report a rare double heterozygous hemoglobinopathy of Hb D-Punjab and Hb J-Meerut in a 35 year antenatal female.

AB  - Though not very frequent, blood group discrepancies are of common occurrence which must be promptly resolved for safe transfusion practices. Blood group discrepancy is defined as the non-corroboration between cell grouping and serum grouping. Variable erythrocyte antigenic expressions (qualitative and/or quantitative difference) owing to allelic heterogeneity, give rise to subgroups. Problems during blood grouping due to weakened expression of antigens are a rare cause for ABO discrepancies. Of note, subgroups of 'B' with decreased expression of the B antigen are of very rare occurrence in the general population. Serologically, the variants of 'B' can be classified into B-3, B-x, B-m and B-el. Serological confirmation of such subgroups requires special immuno-haematological procedures. The current study reports 3 cases of subgroups of B (2 cases of B-m and 1 case of B-w) detected at our centre. It is important to detect and resolve discrepant ABO grouping results so as to prevent ABO mis-match transfusions. Such individuals should also be pre-emptively informed of their respective blood donor and transfusion recipient status, as well.

AB  - BackgroundUtilization of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) as an imaging modality in clinical practice is rapidly increasing. More evidence from randomized studies establishing clinical safety and performance of pacing systems in patients undergoing a cMRI scan is needed.
   ObjectivesThe purpose of this prospective, multicenter, randomized study was to demonstrate safety and efficacy of the Accent MRI conditional pacing systems (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN, USA) in patients undergoing cMRI scan.
   MethodsPatients (n=283) indicated for dual-chamber pacemaker implant were randomized to either the MRI Group (MG) (n=140) or the Control Group (CG) (n=143) after successful device implantation of the Accent MRI system. Clinical evaluation and device interrogation were performed at pre- and post-MRI scan, and 1 month post-MRI for all patients. At 9-12weeks postimplant, patients in MG underwent a nondiagnostic cMRI scan at 1.5 Tesla (T), while patients in CG underwent device interrogation and clinical evaluation twice with a 45-minute waiting period in between. The safety endpoint was freedom from MRI scan-related complications and that for efficacy was significant changes in right atrial/ventricular capture threshold and sensing amplitude between right before MRI, immediately after MRI, and 1 month post-MRI.
   ResultsResults showed 100% freedom from MRI scan-related complications. There were no significant changes in device performance between pre-MRI scan and 1 month post-MRI scan time points in both study groups.
   ConclusionscMRI scanning with 1.5 T scanners is safe in patients implanted with the Accent MRI conditional pacing system and has no significant effect on the electrical parameters of the device and leads.

AB  - Introduction: Few studies have addressed the mid to long term impact of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) on weight loss and obesity associated co-morbidities, particularly in Indian population. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of LSG in morbid obesity over 3-7 years follow up.
   Materials and methods: Data of all patients who underwent LSG between January 2008 and March 2015 and completed their at least 1 year follow up till March 2016 was retrospectively reviewed using a prospectively collected database.
   Results: 424 patients undergoing primary LSG were included. The mean age (+/- 2SD) was 39.8 +/- 22.5 years and the mean Body Mass Index (BMI) (+/- 2SD) was 46.67 +/- 15.8 kg/m(2). 124 patients (29.2%) were super-obese (BMI> 50 kg/m2). The percentage follow-up at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years and 7 years was 78.3%, 66.7%, 42.3% and 38.4% respectively. The mean percentage Excess weight Loss (% EWL) (+/- 2SD) at 1year, 3years, 5years, and 7years was 71.8 (+/- 50.5%), 64.95% (+/- 41.8%), 61.7% (+/- 46.2%) and 57.15% (+/- 50.2%) respectively. The preoperative BMI significantly correlated with % EWL at 5 year (r(2) = 0.107, p = 0.018). The overall complication rate was 5.8%. Early complications included staple line leak (1.2%), bleeding (1.2%), deep venous thrombosis (0.4%) and 30-day mortality (0.21%). Late complications included stricture formation (0.21%) and new onset Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) (2.8%). At 5 years, 83.3% of diabetic patients showed remission while rest showed improvement in glycemic control with decrease in dosage. 69.3% patients showed improvement in hypertension, 100% patients showed improvement in Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome, 75% patients showed improvement in hypothyroidism after surgery. GERD resolved in 62.8% patients while worsened in 11.4% patients.
   Conclusions: LSG has durable weight loss at 5 year with % EWL of 61% and significant resolution of obesity associated co-morbidities.

AB  - The ability to use indirect cyanmethemoglobin method using 20 mu l of dried blood spots (DBSs) on filter paper for the analysis of haemoglobin (Hb) levels could be an important diagnostic tool for areas that have limited access to laboratory facilities. We assessed the validity of a method for Hb estimation in which a single drop of whole blood was directly taken on the filter paper. We collected 124 DBSs containing 20 mu l of blood (filter paper A) and single drop of whole blood (filter paper B) from subjects living in Nainital, Uttrakhand. Estimation of Hb was done by indirect cyanmethemoglobin method in both the filter papers. A correction factor for predicting value of Hb from DBSs of single drop of whole blood was established. The Bland-Altman plot suggested that the difference in Hb values obtained by the single drop of blood and 20 mu l of DBSs was within the 1.5 SD limits, suggesting high validity of the correction factor. The estimation of Hb using single drop of whole blood on filter paper after applying the correction factor provides results similar to indirect cyanmethemoglobin method using 20 mu l of blood. Hence, single drop of whole blood on filter paper can be used as an alternate method for estimation of Hb in large scale community surveys.

AB  - Pancreatic injury is an uncommon and frequently missed injury in abdominal trauma patients. However, missed pancreatic injury is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study was conducted to know the burden of pancreatic injury and its outcome in our setup. A retrospective analysis of 53 patients with pancreatic injury from January 2008 through March 2012 at the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Center (JPNATC), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Pancreatic injuries were present in 1.18 % of all trauma admissions. Blunt trauma to the abdomen (n = 49, 92.45 %) due to road traffic injury (n = 38, 71.70 %) was the most common mechanism of injury. Isolated pancreatic injury was present in eight (15.09 %) patients. Grade III pancreatic injury (n = 25, 47 %) was the most common. Of these patients, 18.86 % were managed nonoperatively and 81.13 % were managed operatively. Among the operatively managed patients (n = 43), 74.4 % were operated due to pancreatic injury and 25.5 % were operated due to associated injuries. Distal pancreatectomy with or without spleen preservation (n = 25) was the most common operative procedure done. Three out of five patients of Whipple operation for pancreatic injury died. Pancreatic injury was associated with complications in 43.40 % and death in 20 % (n = 11). Pancreatic injury is rare, but delay in diagnosis of pancreatic injury has been associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Low-grade pancreatic injury with intact main pancreatic duct (MPD) could be successfully managed nonoperatively, whereas in high-grade pancreatic injury, an operative intervention is invariably necessary. Distal pancreatectomy with spleen preservation is a desirable goal whenever possible for distal transaction of the pancreas. Whipple resection should be reserved only for hemodynamically stable patients with complex pancreaticoduodenal injury and is associated with high mortality.

AB  - Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical parasitic disease caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan of the genus Leishmania. The disease is transmitted by the bite of infected sand flies (Phlebotomus species) and affects all ages and both genders. Nearly half of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases occur in children. The clinical manifestations of pediatric leishmaniasis may be different from the adults associated with host-related factors. In this review, only the visceral form is covered. Confirmation of diagnosis is made by the parasitological, immunological, or by molecular methods. Sodium antimony gluconate (stibogluconate) has been the drug of choice for more than 60 years. However, in last three decades, its efficacy against leishmaniasis has gone significantly down especially in the Indian subcontinent where most cases of VL are seen. Therefore, other drugs, such as pentamidine-isothionate, paromomycin, amphotericin B, and miltefosine, are being used as alternative drugs for VL treatment. In the absence of an effective vaccine for VL, controlmeasures are based on the prevention of disease transmission via vector control and community awareness. The present review focuses on the current state of the leishmaniasis, its diagnosis, treatment, and prevention with emphasis on pediatric leishmaniasis.

AB  - Published literature lacks systematic studies on disseminated histoplasmosis in India, and previous reviews on its epidemiology in India were conducted two decades back. Thus, we review the Indian studies published in this century to understand the recent epidemiology of histoplasmosis in India and do a retrospective analysis of all cases diagnosed at our institute.
   A literature of review search was done in Pubmed/Medline and Scopus. Studies published during January 2001-December 2015 were considered along with retrospective analysis of cases presented to us. A distinction was made in the clinical presentation of immunocompetent and immunocompromised cases.
   Ninety-five included studies described 204 cases, and 10 cases from our retrospective analysis were included. The mean age at presentation was 45.1 +/- 15.4 years [range 3-83, median 45, interquartile range 37-55], and male-to-female ratio was 6:1. Most cases were reported from northern and northeastern states of India along the rivers Ganges, Yamuna and Brahmaputra and in people associated with agricultural activity. About 33% of cases were immunocompromised, out of which immunosuppression due to HIV was seen in 72% cases. The mean age of presentation was significantly lower in immunocompromised cases (37.9 vs. 49.2 years; p < 0.00001, Mann-Whitney test), and mortality was also higher (10 vs. 27.5%, p = 0.01, Fisher's exact test). Adrenal involvement was in significantly higher proportion of immunocompetent patients compared to immunocompromised population.
   Disseminated histoplasmosis is being increasingly recognized in India. There is a need to undertake well-designed, analytical studies utilizing appropriate diagnostic modalities to understand the epidemiology of this neglected disease in proper perspective.

AB  - Asparagine synthetase deficiency is a rare inborn error of metabolism caused by a defect in ASNS, a gene encoding asparagine synthetase. It manifests with a severe neurological phenotype manifesting as severe developmental delay, congenital microcephaly, spasticity and refractory seizures. To date, nineteen patients from twelve unrelated families have been identified. Majority of the mutations are missense and nonsense mutations in homozygous or compound heterozygous state. We add another case from India which harbored a novel homozygous missense variation in exon 11 and compare the current case with previously reported cases.

AB  - Introduction: Cue-induced craving is known to be associated with a higher risk of relapse, wherein drug-specific cues become conditioned stimuli, eliciting conditioned responses. Cue-reactivity paradigm are important tools to study psychological responses and functional neuroimaging changes. However, till date, there has been no specific study or a validated paradigm for inhalant cue-induced craving research. The study aimed to develop and validate visual cue stimulus for inhalant cue-associated craving.
   Method: The first step (picture selection) involved screening and careful selection of 30 cue-and 30 neutral-pictures based on their relevance for naturalistic settings. In the second step (time optimization), a random selection of ten cue-pictures each was presented for 4 s, 6 s, and 8 s to seven adolescent male inhalant users, and pre-post craving response was compared using a Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) for each of the picture and time. In the third step (validation), craving response for each of 30 cue- and 30 neutral-pictures were analysed among 20 adolescent inhalant users.
   Results: Findings revealed a significant difference in before and after craving response for the cue-pictures, but not neutral-pictures. Using ROC-curve, pictures were arranged in order of craving intensity. Finally, 20 best cueand 20 neutral-pictures were used for the development of a 480 s visual cue paradigm.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to systematically develop an inhalant cue picture paradigm which can be used as a tool to examine cue induced craving in neurobiological studies. Further research, including its further validation in larger study and diverse samples, is required.

AB  - Traditional examination has inherent deficiencies. Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is considered as a method of assessment that may overcome many such deficits. OSCE is being increasingly used worldwide in various medical specialities for formative and summative assessment. Although it is being used in various disciplines in our country as well, its use in the stream of general surgery is scarce. We report our experience of assessment of undergraduate students appearing in their pre-professional examination in the subject of general surgery by conducting OSCE. In our experience, OSCE was considered a better assessment tool as compared to the traditional method of examination by both faculty and students and is acceptable to students and faculty alike. Conducting OSCE is feasible for assessment of students of general surgery.

AB  - The etiology of ITP remains unknown but its pathogenesis consists of loss of tolerance to platelet antigens. There is a complex dysregulation of the immune system involving both the B cells and the T cells. Splenectomy is the standard second line option in steroid refractory chronic ITP patients. However, costs of surgery and reluctance for surgery in severely thrombocytopenic patients on part of surgeons are major obstacles in resource limited settings. Rituximab has been used in both the standard doses of 375 mg/m(2) and low doses of 100 mg/m(2) with similar results. We studied the utility of low dose Rituximab (@100 mg/m(2) weekly x 4 doses) in resource limited settings. Overall response, complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) rates were 47.6% (10/21), 33.3% (7/21) and 14.3% (3/21) respectively. Median time to response in patients achieving CR was 75 days (range 45-185 days) while in patients achieving PR it was 105 days (range 45-165 days). However, there was no significant difference between males and females achieving CR or PR. We also observed that patients who had earlier responded to any form of treatment were more likely to respond to Rituximab treatment. The cumulative relapse free survival (RFS) at 13 months was 78%. By giving lower dose, six times less than conventional dosing dose, we have been able to demonstrate cost effectiveness in our study population. We were able to administer all the doses in day care without any major adverse events leading to further cost savings on in-patient care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The tuberculum sellae is a relatively common location for meningiomas. We assessed our experience with the use of transcranial resection, which, although criticized for its more invasive nature compared with endo-nasal approaches, may be the ideal approach in selected patients with tuberculum sellae meningiomas (TSMs).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients with TSMs treated by frontotemporal or bifrontal open cranial resection. Clinical, radiographic, and surgical variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with a TSM treated by frontotemporal or bifrontal open cranial resection were identified. The mean patient age was 53.2 +/- 14.0 years, and the mean duration of follow-up was 42.3 +/- 45.4 months. The mean tumor volume was 12.4 +/- 18.0 cm(3). Optic canal invasion was seen in 46.9% of the patients, and 91.8% presented with visual deficits. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 42 patients (85.7%), and near-total resection was performed in 7 patients (14.3%). Post-operatively, visual outcomes improved in 17 patients (34.7%), remained stable in 22 (44.9%), were intact in 6 (12.2%), and worsened in 1 (2.0%). Good outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] >= 4) was achieved by 46 of 49 patients (93%) at discharge and by 39 of 41 patients (95.1%) at 6 months. A total of 16 manageable and self-limiting complications occurred in 16 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: In most patients undergoing a frontotemporal approach, a GTR/Simpson grade I resection with manageable and self-limiting surgical complications, a good 6-month GOS in most patients, and improved to stable vision were seen at follow-up. Various treatment approaches can be considered for TSM resection, but the ability to decompress the optic canal and achieve a GTR makes the frontotemporal approach attractive in many cases.

AB  - Toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) are the procedure of choice to correct corneal astigmatism of 1 D or more in cases undergoing cataract surgery. Comprehensive literature search was performed in MEDLINE using "toric intraocular lenses," "astigmatism," and " cataract surgery" as keywords. The outcomes after toric IOL implantation are influenced by numerous factors, right from the preoperative case selection and investigations to accurate intraoperative alignment and postoperative care. Enhanced accuracy of keratometry estimation may be achieved by taking multiple measurements and employing at least two separate devices based on different principles. The importance of posterior corneal curvature is increasingly being recognized in various studies, and newer investigative modalities that account for both the anterior and posterior corneal power are becoming the standard of care. An ideal IOL power calculation formula should take into account the surgically induced astigmatism, the posterior corneal curvature as well as the effective lens position. Conventional manual marking has given way to image-guided systems and intraoperative aberrometry, which provide a mark-less IOL alignment and also aid in planning the incisions, capsulorhexis size, and optimal IOL centration. Postoperative toric IOL misalignment is the major factor responsible for suboptimal visual outcomes after toric IOL implantation. Realignment of the toric IOL is needed in 0.65%-3.3% cases, with more than 10 degrees of rotation from the target axis. Newer toric IOLs have enhanced rotational stability and provide precise visual outcomes with minimal higher order aberrations.

AB  - Pediatric cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Untreated cataracts in children lead to tremendous social, economical, and emotional burden to the child, family, and society. Blindness related to pediatric cataract can be treated with early identification and appropriate management. Most cases are diagnosed on routine screening whereas some may be diagnosed after the parents have noticed leukocoria or strabismus. Etiology of pediatric cataract is varied and diagnosis of specific etiology aids in prognostication and effective management. Pediatric cataract surgery has evolved over years, and with improving knowledge of myopic shift and axial length growth, outcomes of these patients have become more predictable. Favorable outcomes depend not only on effective surgery, but also on meticulous postoperative care and visual rehabilitation. Hence, it is the combined effort of parents, surgeons, anesthesiologists, pediatricians, and optometrists that can make all the difference.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of etiologic causes of primary amenorrhea in Indian population.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective study was performed using 102 complete medical records of women with primary amenorrhea who attended the Gynaecologic Endocrinology Clinic, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, AIIMS, New Delhi from September 2012 to September 2015. Cases were analysed according to clinical profile, development of secondary sexual characteristics, physical examination, pelvic and rectal examination, X-ray of chest and lumbo-sacral spine, hormone profile, pelvic USG, MRI, and cytogenetic study including karyotype.
   Results: The three most common causes of primary amenorrhea were Mullerian anomalies (47%), gonadal dysgenesis (20.5%), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (14.7%) in the present study. There were 3 cases of Turner syndrome (45,XO), 5 cases of Swyer's syndrome (46,XY) and 2 cases of Androgen insensitivity syndrome (46,XY). One case had pituitary macroadenoma and eight cases (7.8%) were of genital tuberculosis.
   Conclusions: The present study has currently been the largest case series of primary amenorrhea from North India. Mullerian anomaly is the most prevalent etiological factor leading to amenorrhoea followed by gonadal dysgenesis in our study. Racial, genetic and environmental factors could play role in the cause of primary amenorrhea. (C) 2017 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tumour cells distinguish from normal cells by fermenting glucose to lactate in presence of sufficient oxygen and functional mitochondria (Warburg effect). Crabtree effect was invoked to explain the biochemical basis of Warburg effect by suggesting that excess glucose suppresses mitochondrial respiration. It is known that the Warburg effect and Crabtree effect are displayed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae, during growth on abundant glucose. Beyond this similarity, it was also demonstrated that expression of human pro-apoptotic proteins in S. cerevisiae such as Bax and p53 caused apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that p53 expression in S. cerevisiae (Crabtree-positive yeast) causes increase in ROS levels and apoptosis when cells are growing on non-fermentable carbon sources but not on fermentable carbon sources, a feature similar to tumour cells. In contrast, in Kluyveromyces lactis (Crabtree-negative yeast) p53 causes increase in ROS levels and apoptosis regardless of the carbon source. Interestingly, the increased ROS levels and apoptosis are correlated to increased oxygen uptake in both S. cerevisiae and K. lactis. Based on these results, we suggest that at least in yeast, fermentation per se does not prevent the escape from apoptosis. Rather, the Crabtree effect plays a crucial role in determining whether the cells should undergo apoptosis or not.

AB  - Iron is implicated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The aim of this study was to see if long-term, experimental iron administration with aging modifies retinal and choroidal structures and expressions of iron handling proteins, to understand some aspects of iron homeostasis. Male Wistar rats were fed with ferrous sulphate heptahydrate (500 mg/kg body weight/week, oral; elemental iron availability: 20%) from 2 months of age onward until they were 19.5 month-old. At 8, 14 and 20 months of age, they were sacrificed and serum and retinal iron levels were detected by HPLC. Oxidative stress was analyzed by TBARS method. The retinas were examined for cell death (TUNEL), histology (electron microscopy) and the expressiAs of transferrin, transferrin receptor-1 [TFR-1], H- and L-ferritin. In control animals, at any age, there was no difference in the serum and retinal iron levels, but the latter increased significantly in 14- and 20 month-old iron-fed rats, indicating that retinal iron accumulation proceeds with progression of aging ( > 14 months). The serum and retinal TSARS levels increased significantly with progression of aging in experimental but not in control rats. There was significant damage to choriocapillaris, accumulation of phagosomes in retinal pigment epithelium and increased incidence of TUNEL + cells in outer nuclear layer and vacuolation in inner nuclear layer (INL) of 20 month-aged experimental rats, compared to those in age-matched controls. Vacuolations in INL could indicate a long-term effect of iron accumulation in the inner retina. These events paralleled the increased expression of ferritins and transferrin and a decrease in the expression of TFR-1 in iron-fed rats with aging, thereby maintaining iron homeostasis in the retina. As some of these changes mimic with those happening in eyes with AMD, this model can be utilized to understand iron-induced pathophysiological changes in AMD.

AB  - Purpose: Investigations such as EEG and brain imaging are often difficult to obtain in primary care settings of resource-limited regions impacting millions of epilepsy patients. We wanted to test the hypothesis that classification of chronic epilepsy into focal and generalized based on clinical history and examination alone would be comparable to making such a classification with additional inputs from EEG and brain imaging.
   Methods: Two investigators independently classified consecutive chronic epilepsy patients into focal, generalized and unclassified epilepsy. Investigator 1 made this determination using clinical history and examination alone whereas Investigator II additionally used EEG and brain imaging too. We calculated inter observer agreement between the two investigators and also looked at the predictors of focal and generalized epilepsy.
   Results: Five hundred and twelve patients were recruited. Inter observer agreement between the two investigators in making the focal versus generalized classification was 96.8%, kappa 0.91 (p < 0.0001). When EEG and neuroimaging findings were added to clinical information, there was a change in classification in 3.2% patients. Several predictors of focal and generalized epilepsy were identified.
   Conclusions: Classification of chronic epilepsy into focal and generalized can be done reliably in most patients using clinical information alone. Investigating chronic epilepsy patients with EEG and brain imaging may not be necessary in every patient. The results of our study are especially significant for epilepsy patients living in resource-limited regions where such investigations may not always be available.

AB  - Introduction: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with no clear etiopathogenesis. Owing to unique socio cultural milieu of India, it is worthwhile reviewing research on ADHD from India and comparing findings with global research. Thereby, we attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of research on ADHD from India.
   Methods: A boolean search of articles published in English from September 1966 to January 2017 on electronic search engines Google Scholar, PubMed, IndMED, MedIND, using the search terms "ADHD", "Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder", "Hyperactivity","Child psychiatry", "Hyperkinetic disorder", "Attention Deficit Disorder", "India" was carried out and peer - reviewed studies conducted among human subjects in India were included for review. Case reports, animal studies, previous reviews were excluded from the current review.
   Results: Results of 73 studies found eligible for the review were organized into broad themes such as epidemiology, etiology, course and follow up, clinical profile and comorbidity, assessment /biomarkers, intervention/treatment parameters, pathways to care and knowledge and attitude towards ADHD.
   Discussion: There was a gap noted in research from India in the domains of biomarkers, course and follow up and non-pharmacological intervention. The prevalence of ADHD as well as comorbidity of Bipolar Disorder was comparatively lower compared to western studies. The studies found unique to India include comparing the effect of allopathic intervention with Ayurvedic intervention, yoga as a non pharmacological intervention. There is a need for studies from India on biomarkers, studies with prospective research design, larger sample size and with matched controls.

AB  - Early infection after stroke is associated with a poor outcome. We aimed to determine whether delayed infections (up to 76 days post-stroke) are associated with poor outcome at 90 days. Data came from the international Efficacy of Nitric Oxide Stroke (ENOS, ISRCTN99414122) trial. Post hoc data on infections were obtained from serious adverse events reports between 1 and 76 days following stroke in this large cohort of patients. Regression models accounting for baseline covariates were used to analyse fatalities and functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Barthel Index, Euro-Qol-5D) at 90 days, in patients with infection compared to those without infection. Of 4011 patients, 242 (6.0%) developed one or more serious infections. Infections were associated with an increased risk of death (p < 0.001) and an increased likelihood of dependency (measured by mRS) compared to those of all other patients (p < 0.001). This remained when only surviving patients were analysed, indicating that the worsening of functional outcome is not due to mortality (p < 0.001). In addition, the timing of the infection after stroke did not alter its detrimental association with fatality (p = 0.14) or functional outcome (p = 0.47). In conclusion, severe post-stroke infections, whether occurring early or late after stroke, are associated with an increased risk of death and poorer functional outcome, independent of differences in baseline characteristics or treatment. Not only are strategies needed for reducing the risk of infection immediately after stroke, but also during the first 3 months following a stroke. This study is registered: ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN99414122, Identifier, NCT00989716.

KW  - DEFINITION
AB  - Background: Around 20-25 percent of the world's adult populations have the metabolic syndrome and they are twice as likely to die from heart attack or stroke compared with people without the syndrome. The World Health Organization proposed a definition for the metabolic syndrome in 1998 and later on NCEP ATPIII and IDF provided new definitions of this syndrome in 2001 and 2003 respectively. Very few studies have compared the different definitions to diagnose the metabolic syndrome in type two diabetics in India while as for Kashmir valley no such documented study has been carried out till date.
   Objective: To study the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in type 2 Kashmir diabetics and to find out the degree of agreement between three different criteria given by WHO, NCEPATPIII and IDF for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.
   Materials and Method: A cross sectional study was conducted in one of the two tertiary care hospitals of Kashmir, India. About 1000 patients were selected and their demographic, clinical and biochemical parameters were studied after obtaining informed consent from each patient.
   Results: Prevalance of metabolic syndrome was found to be highest(84.5%) while using WHO definition. Kappa statistic between WHO, ATP III and WHO, IDF definitions was 0.697 (95% CI 0.637-0.754) and 0.775 (95% CI 0.72-0.82) respectively while the degree of agreement between IDF and ATP III definitions was highest with kappa of 0.851 (95% CI 0.810-0.889).
   Conclusion: Our study warrants for interventions to prevent the progression towards this syndrome among type 2 diabetics as early as the diagnosis of diabetes is made. (C) 2017 Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose: The optimal treatment of patients with choroid plexus carcinoma (CPC) is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient information to determine the effect of surgery, adjuvant therapy, and other prognostic factors for CPC.
   Methods and Materials: A comprehensive search of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases was performed using the following MeSH terms to find all possible reports on CPC: choroid plexus tumor; choroid plexus carcinoma; choroid plexus carcinoma AND treatment; and choroid plexus carcinoma AND survival. We performed an individual patient data analysis to assess the strength of the potential associations between different variables and the outcomes for patients with CPC.
   Results: Data from 284 patients were retrieved from 89 studies. The median patient age was 2 years, with 26% patients diagnosed in the first year of their life. Of these 284 patients, 52.8% had undergone gross total resection (GTR) or near total resection. The median follow-up period for the entire cohort was 10.8 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13 months (95% confidence interval 8.14-17.8). PFS was better for patients >aged 5 years and those who had undergone GTR. The median overall survival (OS) was 29 months (95% confidence interval 16.3-41.7). OS was better for patients aged >5 years, those who had undergone GTR, those who had received adjuvant treatment, and those with a parenchymal tumor site.
   Conclusions: CPC is an aggressive tumor, with a median PFS of 13 months and median OS of 29 months. All patients should undergo maximal safe resection, because GTR is associated with improved survival. The use of adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy were also associated with improved outcomes.

AB  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder with its protean clinical manifestations. This is due to partial or complete absence of 'glycophosphatidyl-inositol-anchor proteins' (GPI-AP). The main aim of this review is to highlight various diagnostic modalities available, basic principle of each test and recent advances in the diagnosis of PNH. Recently among various tests available, the flow cytometry has become 'the gold standard' for PNH testing. In order to overcome the difficulties encountered by the testing and research laboratories throughout the world, International Clinical Cytometry Society has come up with guidelines regarding the indications for testing, protocol for sample collection, processing, panel of antibodies as well as gating strategies to be used, how to interpret the test and reporting format to be used. It is essential to test at least two GPI-linked markers on at least two different lineages particularly on red cells and granulocytes/monocytes. The fluorescent aerolysin combined with other monoclonal antibodies in multicolour flow cytometry offered an improved assay not only for diagnosis but also for monitoring of PNH clones. It is equally important to diagnose this rare entity with high index of suspicion.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of the study was to assess the awareness and health-seeking practices related to cataract in urban slums of Delhi. Methods: This study design was a population-based cross-sectional study. Participants aged 18-60 years were recruited from randomly selected five slums of South Delhi. They were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule on awareness and eye health-seeking practices related to cataract. The practices were recorded if the respondents themselves or any other member of the family was diagnosed with cataract in previous 2 years. Results: A total of 1552 respondents participated in the study, of which, 89.9% had heard of cataract but only (42%) were aware of any symptom of cataract. The common symptoms of cataract reported by the participants were white opacity in eyes (25.9%) and loss of vision (20.6%). Surgery as a treatment of cataract was known to only 559 (40.1%) participants. Awareness about surgery as treatment of cataract was significantly higher among people aged 45-60 years (adjusted odds ratio = 2.89, 95% confidence interval = 2.11-3.97) and in educated people (adjusted OR = 3.69 95% CI = 2.37-5.73). Out of 84 respondents who had been diagnosed with cataract, the health-seeking practices were observed by 70 (83.3%) participants. Among them, 51 (72.9%) had undergone surgery and another 19 (27.1%) had been advised to wait for surgery. Most of the operated patients 48 (94.1%) attended the postoperative follow-up. Conclusion: The study findings suggest the majority of participants have heard of cataract, but there is low awareness of its symptoms and treatment, and good eye health-seeking practices observed for cataract in urban slum population. Gaps in awareness observed can be filled up by implementing proper eye health education programs.

AB  - The retina is prone to be damaged by oxidative stress (OS), owing to its constant exposure to light, high rate of oxygen consumption and high membrane lipid content. Lipid peroxidation in aging human retina has been shown by biochemical means. However, information on the cellular sites of OS and antioxidant responses in aging human retina remains limited. Here, we show distribution of immunoreactivity (IR) to a marker of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy 2-nonenal [HNE] and antioxidant enzymes involved in counteracting lipid peroxidation (glutathione S-transferase-pi 1 and glutarexoxin-1) in donor human retinas at different ages (35-91 years; N = 24). Initially, HNE-IR was present in few macular cone outer segments (COS, sixth decade). With aging, IR appeared in many COS and peaked at ninth decade (14 vs 62 per 3850 mu m(2) area between 6 and 9 decade; p < 0.001) in the parafovea then seen elsewhere (perifoveal, mid-peripheral and nasal). IR was seen in the parafovea of all retinas, whereas it was present in 8/24 of perifoveal and 6/24 of mid-peripheral retinas, indicating that the parafovea is susceptible to undergo lipid peroxidation. Foveolar COS were immunonegative until 81 years, which developed IR later (>83 years). IR to glutathione S-transferase-pi 1 was moderate until eight decade and then showed a decrease in photoreceptor cells between ninth and tenth decade, while glutaredoxin-1 maintained a steady expression with aging. Damaged COS were present in aged retinas, and inner segments and photoreceptor nuclei also showed some degree of alterations. Although there was increased lipid peroxidation with aging, cone death was minimal in those retinas. The two antioxidant enzymes studied here, may play a role in protecting photoreceptors against OS with advanced aging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Three-dimensional multicellular human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) are showing a great promise in the repair of bone tissue due to its osteogenic differentiation potential, mimicking in vivo microenvironment and immunomodulatory property. In the present study, the potential of hBM-MSC microtissues (MTs) in combination with a biocomposite material to form vascularized bone-like tissue at an ectopic site in an immunocompromised mouse was evaluated. The scaffold was fabricated using gelatin, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol and nano-hydroxyapatite (GCnHP) by the freeze-drying method. The physico-chemico-biological characteristics were compared with control scaffold devoid of polyvinyl alcohol (GCnH). The scaffolds (GCnH and GCnHP) were highly porous and had interconnected pores. GCnHP showed higher mechanical strength, higher water adsorption and a lower rate of collagenase-mediated degradation in comparison to GCnH. The scaffolds also supported growth and proliferation of hBM-MSCs MTs and subsequent differentiation into osteoblast-like cells. The differentiated cells showed matrix mineralization and high expression of runX2, alkaline phosphatase, collagen type 1 and osteocalcin genes. A high expression of VEGF was also observed suggesting the potential of hBM-MSC MTs to induce angiogenesis. H&E and Masson's trichrome staining of the 4-weeks in vivo implanted scaffold revealed the presence of newly synthesized collagen and infiltration of host vasculature. IHC assessment showed expression of osteocalcin and osterix. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the combination of hBM-MSC MTs and biocomposite material as a promising approach for in vivo non-load bearing bone tissue repair for future clinical and various regenerative medicine applications.

The available drugs are either toxic or less effective leading to disease relapse or conversion to post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. Several herbal extracts have been shown to have antileishmanial activity, but a herbal drug may not always be safe. In the present study, the extract of Cedrus deodara leaves has been standardized and tested for immunomodulatory anitileishmanial activities.
   Methods: The extracts of C. deodara leaves with different solvents such as benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol were made by soxhlation process. Solvents were removed under reduced pressure and temperature using rotary evaporator. The antileishmanial bioassay test was performed with in vitro maintained parasites. Immunomodulatory activity of different extracts was tested by flow cytometry. Standardization of the effective fraction was performed with Linalool as a marker compound through reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: The extract with the use of benzene solvent showed strong antileishmanial activities within a dose 25-200 \g=m\g/ml culture with non-significant haemolytic activities and significant immunomodulant activities against the host cells. Linalool was found to be 1.29 per cent in the effective extract of C. deodara.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The antileishmanial activity of C. deodara, as assessed by bioassay testing on Leishmania donovani parasites and immunomodulatory effect of benzene extract of leaves on host cells indicated that it might be a potential new safe therapeutic target to cure the visceral leishmaniasis.

AB  - Objectives. The purpose of the study was to test the intra and interobserver reliability of manual volumetric segmentation of pharyngeal and sinonasal airway subregions.
   Study Design. Cone beam computed tomography data of 15 patients were collected from an orthodontic clinical database. Two experienced orthodontists independently performed manual segmentation of the airway subregions. Four performance measures were considered to test intra and interobserver reliability of manual segmentation: (1) volume correlation, (2) mean slice correlation, (3) percentage of volume difference, and (4) percentage of nonoverlapping voxels.
   Results. Intra and interobserver reliability was observed to be greater than 0.96 for the entire pharyngeal and sinonasal airway sinus subregions by both observers using the volume correlation method. Mean slice correlation was found to be greater than 0.84, showing the existence of nonoverlapping voxels. Therefore, the percentage of nonoverlapping voxels was used as a reliability measure and was found to be less than 20% for both intra and interobserver markings.
   Conclusions. The mean slice correlation and percentage of nonoverlapping voxels were the most reliable performance measures of segmentation correctness. Volume correlation and the percentage of volume difference were observed to be the most reliable performance measures for volume correctness.

AB  - Patients with many psychiatric disorders have considerable internalized stigma. The current study intended to examine the level and impact of internalized stigma in patients with bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). 60 patients with BPAD, 33 patients with schizophrenia and 30 patients with anxiety disorders were compared on Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale and The Stigma Scale. The patients with BPAD were assessed using Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), Participation scale (PS) and World Health Organization Quality Of Life Brief Version - Hindi (WHOQOL-bref). Significant differences were found in all domains of self-stigma measures among the three groups. Using appropriate covariates, it was found that the differences were significant and independent of the effect of the covariates. In patients of BPAD, stigma and its domains were significantly correlated with the measures on monthly income, education, socio-occupational functioning, RSES, PS and WHOQOL-bref. Patients with BPAD experience substantial stigma, which was intermediate between that experienced by patients with schizophrenia (higher) and that experienced by patients with anxiety disorder (lower). Internalized stigma has significant impact on self-esteem, socio-occupational participation and functioning, and quality of life in patients with BPAD. Small sample size, sample of convenience, and cross-sectional design, limit the generalizability of the results.

AB  - Port placement is the first and one of the most important step in laparoscopic surgeries. However, these incisions for port placement are often placed casually leading to larger or smaller incisions than those required. Larger incisions may lead to problems like oozing from skin incisions, egress of gas used to create pneuomoperitoneum, while smaller incisions lead to difficulty in port introduction and incision site skin necrosis. We describe a simple and novel technique of giving proper sized skin incision to avoid such problems.

AB  - Almost one-fourth of the world's population is possibly suffering from parasitic diseases. Children are more vulnerable to various parasitic infections as compared with normal adults due to their outdoor activities, immature immune system, nonadherence to good hygiene practices, and preference for street food. Parasitic infections are known to put a grave strain on their physical and cognitive growth and development. Thus, awareness and importance of pediatric parasitology need escalated recognition among pediatricians. Parasitic diseases both common and uncommon that are encountered in Indian children are contemplated in this review. We have covered epidemiology, life cycle, clinical features, and diagnosis of pediatric parasitic infections that transpire in India, including some preventive strategies.

AB  - To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of shear wave elastography (SWE) and transient elastography (TE) in the evaluation of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and C (CHC) patients taking liver biopsy as gold standard.
   Ethics committee approved this prospective cross-sectional study. Between October 2012 and December 2014, consecutive CHB/CHC patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included-age more than 18 years, informed written consent, willing and suitable for liver biopsy. SWE, TE, and biopsy were performed the same day. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) cut-offs for various stages of fibrosis were generated for SWE and TE. AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values were estimated individually or in combination.
   CH patients (n = 240, CHB 172, CHC 68), 176 males, 64 females, mean age 32.6 +/- 11.6 years were enrolled. Mean LSM of patients with no histological fibrosis (F0) was 5.0 +/- 0.7 and 5.1+1.4 kPa on SWE and TE, respectively. For differentiating F2 and F3-4 fibrosis on SWE, at 7.0 kPa cut-off, the sensitivity was 81.3% and specificity 77.6%. For TE, at 8.3 kPa cut-off, sensitivity was 81.8% and specificity 83.1%. For F3 vs. F4, SWE sensitivity was 83.3% and specificity 90.7%. At 14.8 kPa cut-off, TE showed similar sensitivity (83.3%) but specificity increased to 96.5%. Significant correlation between SWE and TE was observed (r = 0.33, p < 0.001). On combining SWE and TE, a drop in sensitivity with increased specificity for all stages of liver fibrosis occured.
   SWE is an accurate technique for evaluating liver fibrosis. SWE compares favorably with TE especially for predicting advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis. Combining SWE and TE further improves specificity.

AB  - Objective To estimate the expenditure incurred towards treatment of an episode of respiratory infection among under-fives in outpatient and inpatient departments of primary and secondary level health facilities.
   Methods During March 2011 - September 2012, under-five children presenting with febrile acute respiratory infection (FARI) in the outpatient (OPD) and inpatient (IPD) departments of public and private health facilities of Ballabgarh, Haryana were enrolled in the study. Children who were free from co-morbidities and whose contact number or proper address were available, were enrolled and followed up over telephone or by house visits till recovery. Information was collected on expenditure incurred towards treatment of FARI. Work loss of each day was valued as per capita national income per day. Cost of service in public facilities were supplemented by WHO-CHOICE estimates. The cost of respiratory episode in different settings are expressed in median and inter quartile range (IQR).
   Results One hundred fourteen children from OPD and 75 from IPD were enrolled and followed up till recovery. Among eligible children 40% and 20% in OPD and IPD were excluded respectively as they could not provide address or Electronic supplementary material The online version of this article (contact number. The median costs of an episode treated in OPD and IPD were INR 447(IQR: INR 294-669) and INR 7506.06 (IQR: INR 3765-10,406) respectively.
   Conclusions Respiratory infections are responsible for substantial economic burden, especially with huge proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure. Total cost of a respiratory episode that required hospitalization was 1.5 times the per capita monthly income of an Indian.

AB  - To date, CD5 expression and its role in acute T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) have not been studied closely. We observed a significant reduction in surface expression of CD5 (sCD5) on leukaemic T cells compared to autologous non-leukaemic T cells. In this study, we have shown the molecular mechanism regulating the expression and function of CD5 on leukaemic T cells. A total of 250 patients suffering from leukaemia and lymphoma were immunophenotyped. Final diagnosis was based on their clinical presentation, morphological data and flow cytometry-based immunophenotyping. Thirty-nine patients were found to be of ALL-T origin. Amplification of early region of E1A and E1B transcripts of CD5 was correlated with the levels of surface and intracellular expression of CD5 protein. Functional studies were performed to show the effect of CD5 blocking on interleukin IL-2 production and survival of leukaemic and non-leukaemic cells. Lack of expression of sCD5 on T-ALL blasts was correlated closely with predominant transcription of exon E1B and significant loss of exon E1A of the CD5 gene, which is associated with surface expression of CD5 on lymphocytes. High expression of E1B also correlates with increased expression of cytoplasmic CD5 (cCD5) among leukaemic T cells. Interestingly, we observed a significant increase in the production of IL-2 by non-leukaemic T cells upon CD5 blocking, leading possibly to their increased survival at 48 h. Our study provides understanding of the regulation of CD5 expression on leukaemic T cells, and may help in understanding the molecular mechanism of CD5 down-regulation.

AB  - Thyroglossal duct cysts are one of the commonest benign midline neck swellings. These are the remnants of the embryologic duct that fails to regress by the 10th week of fetal development. Generally, these are sporadic, slowly enlarging midline neck lumps, with half of them presenting before the age of 30. However, despite their relative frequency, reports of familial inheritance are rare. A review of literature reveals a total of 25 patients from 8 families showing a familial inheritance pattern worldwide. We describe here a 9th family with 5 affected patients taking the total number of cases to 30. Also, this is the 1st such reported case of familial inheritance of thyroglossal cyst from the Asian continent.

AB  - Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) is a frequent cause of chronic kidney disease. Here, we identified recessive mutations in the gene encoding the actin-binding protein advillin (AVIL) in 3 unrelated families with SRNS. While all AVIL mutations resulted in a marked loss of its actin-bundling ability, truncation of AVIL also disrupted colocalization with F-actin, thereby leading to impaired actin binding and severing. Additionally, AVIL colocalized and interacted with the phospholipase enzyme PLCE1 and with the ARP2/3 actin-modulating complex. Knockdown of AVIL in human podocytes reduced actin stress fibers at the cell periphery, prevented recruitment of PLCE1 to the ARP3-rich lamellipodia, blocked EGF-induced generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) by PLCE1, and attenuated the podocyte migration rate (PMR). These effects were reversed by overexpression of WT AVIL but not by overexpression of any of the 3 patient-derived AVIL mutants. The PMR was increased by overexpression of WT Avil or PLCE1, or by EGF stimulation; however, this increased PMR was ameliorated by inhibition of the ARP2/3 complex, indicating that ARP-dependent lamellipodia formation occurs downstream of AVIL and PLCE1 function. Together, these results delineate a comprehensive pathogenic axis of SRNS that integrates loss of AVIL function with alterations in the action of PLCE1, an established SRNS protein.

KW  - innovative intraocular lens design
AB  - In existing designs of intraocular lenses (IOLs), optical outcomes are compromised even after perfectly executed surgery. The reason for this is misalignment of optical axis of the eye and its visual axis. There is a need to design an IOL which compensates for this misalignment and hence enhances the optical outcomes of cataract surgery. The present innovation attempts to fulfill this unmet need and optimizes optical outcomes of all IOLs of different optical profiles - spherical, aspheric, toric, and multifocal. In addition, the improvised design of IOL offers other benefits such as delaying the formation of after-cataract and ameliorating negative dysphotopsia.

AB  - BackgroundUrine cytology is a highly specific modality for diagnosing high-grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC), but plagued by low sensitivity and wide inter-observer variability mainly ascribed to the lack of an established template of reporting. The Paris System (TPS) working group proposed such a template at the 2013 International Congress of Cytology, replete with objective criteria for categorising specimens into one of the seven categories: non-diagnostic, negative for HGUC, atypical urothelial cells, suspicious for HGUC, HGUC, low-grade urothelial neoplasm and others (including non-malignant entities). This study was undertaken to determine the impact of TPS criteria in the morphological interpretation of urine samples.
   MethodsA total of 255 voided urine specimens from 97 patients who had follow-up biopsies were re-assessed according to TPS criteria and correlated with the final histological diagnosis.
   ResultsSixty-three patients were diagnosed with HGUC, and 34 had low-grade papillary UC on biopsy. Earlier samples from 40 (41.2%) patients were categorised as merely atypical wheereas the positive for malignancy category was assigned to 33 (34%) patients. After re-evaluation of the same cases using TPS criteria, cytological features in 44 (69.8%) out of 63 HGUC patients were correctly recognised as HGUC and samples from additional seven patients were re-categorised as suspicious for HGUC (total 81%). The sensitivity of the HGUC category in predicting HGUC was 69.8% which rose to 81% when HGUC was grouped with suspicious for HGUC category.
   ConclusionThe criteria outlined by TPS facilitated the standardisation of urine cytology reporting and significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosing HGUC.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the efficacy of oral voriconazole (VCZ) with oral ketoconazole (KCZ) as an adjunct to topical natamycin in severe fungal keratitis.
   Methods: Fifty eyes of 50 patients with proven severe fungal keratitis, (>5 mm size, involving >4 mm central cornea and >50% stromal depth), smear, and/or culture positive were randomized to receive either oral VCZ (n = 25) or oral KCZ (n = 25) 200 mg twice a day. Both groups received topical natamycin along with oral medication. The primary outcome measure was best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) at 3 months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were the percentage of healed cases and scar size.
   Results: The mean BSCVA after treatment was 1.3 +/- 0.35 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution units in the VCZ group and 1.6 +/- 0.39 logarithm of minimum angle of resolution units in the KCZ group [P = 0.004, 95% confidence interval (CI), 20.10 to 0.54]. The final mean scar size was smaller for oral VCZ than for oral KCZ (P = 0.04, 95% CI, 20.01 to 0.93 mm). The percentage of cases healed were 80% and 72% in VCZ and KCZ groups, respectively (P = 0.51, 95% CI, 20.15 to 0.31). The ratio of tear film to serum concentration of oral VCZ was better than oral KCZ at days 14 (P = 0.002) and 21 (P = 0.006).
   Conclusions: Although the duration and percentage of healing was similar in both groups, oral VCZ attained a significantly better tear film concentration with a smaller scar size and better BSCVA compared with oral KCZ. Thus, oral VCZ may be preferred over oral KCZ in severe fungal keratitis.

AB  - Phacoemulsification is the most commonly performed cataract surgery in this era. With all the recent advances in investigations and management of cataract through phacoemulsification, most of the patients are able to achieve excellent visual outcome. Corneal edema after phacoemulsification in the immediate postoperative period often leads to patient dissatisfaction and worsening of outcome. Delayed onset corneal edema often warrants endothelial keratoplasty. This review highlights the etiopathogenesis, risk factors, and management of corneal edema in the acute phase including descemet's membrane detachment (DMD) and toxic anterior segment syndrome. Various investigative modalities such as pachymetry, specular microscopy, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and confocal microscopy have been discussed briefly.

AB  - Dyslexia also known as specific reading disorder is a complex heritable disorder with unexpected difficulty in learning to read and spell despite adequate intelligence, education, environment, and normal senses. Over past decades, researchers have attempted to characterize dyslexia neurobiological and genetic levels and unfold its pathophysiology. The genetic research on dyslexia has received attention in Asia from the last decade. Though limited by different constraints the studies from Asia have been able to gather significant evidence in this field. We present a review of studies of genetics in Asian population and suggest future directions.

AB  - Kasai hepato-portoenterostomy (HPE) is the most widely used surgical technique to restore bile flow in biliary atresia (BA). We aimed to review literature on HPE substitutes and additions to Kasai especially in advanced BA (ABA). A PubMed search was done for surgical procedures apart from or along with Kasai HPE for BA. Additional procedures to prevent cholangitis were also reviewed. Procedures and outcome were analysed. Alternative procedures done by the authors have also been described briefly. Results have been compiled in this review article. In ABA, with portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis, Kasai HPE is associated with poor outcome, increased morbidity, and even mortality. Most require liver transplant (LT). Some alternatives to HPE include exploration at porta hepatis to assess the bile flow yet avoid the major surgery (HPE) as a bridge to LT. Conduit diversion may help to combat cholangitis resistant to steroid therapy. Stoma formation is not preferred in cases listed for LT due to high risk of bleeding. Hepatocyte infusion, stem cell therapy, and synthetic liver are the future options to meet the challenges in BA. Various alternative procedures may become handy in the future especially in ABA.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, there's concern over high pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attritions or delays in Multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) diagnosis and treatment pathway (DTP). We conducted this operational research among patients with presumptive MDR-TB in north and central Chennai, India to determine attrition and turnaround times (TAT) at various steps of DTP and factors associated with attrition.
   Methods: Study was conducted in Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme setting. It was a retrospective cohort study involving record review of all patients with presumptive MDR-TB (eligible for DST) in 2014.
   Results: Of 628 eligible for DST, 557 (88%) underwent DST and 74 (13%) patients were diagnosed as having MDR-TB. Pre-diagnosis and pre-treatment attrition was 11% (71/628) and 38% (28/74) respectively. TAT [median (IQR)] to test from eligibility for DST and initiate DR-TB treatment from diagnosis were 14 (9,27) and 18 (13,36) days respectively. Patients with smear negative TB and detected in first quarter of 2014 were less likely to undergo DST. Patients in first quarter of 2014 had significantly lower risk of pre-treatment attrition.
   Conclusion: There was high uptake of DST. However, urgent attention is required to reduce pre-treatment attrition, improve TAT to test from eligibility for DST and improve DST among patients with smear-negative TB. (C) 2017 Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To evaluate immunological and virological outcomes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected children at six months of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
   Methods Records of HIV infected children <15-y-old were reviewed to identify those who were initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy between 2010 and 2014 and had CD4+ T cell percentage and HIV-1 viral load report at baseline visit and after 6 mo of initiation of the treatment.
   Results Seventy-four HIV infected children [26% girls, median age IQR 36 (24-108) mo] were included in the study. At the end of six months of HAART, median increase of 11% (6-15%) in CD4+ T cell percentage from the baseline levels was observed; nineteen (26%) children showed an increase in CD4+ T cell percentage of 15% or more at 6 mo. Viral load was undetectable (<47 copies/ml) in 27 (36.4%) children; 21 (28.3%) children had 47- < 500 copies/ml; 16 (21.6%) children had 500- < 10,000 copies/ml and 10 (13.5%) children had >= 10,000 copies/ml. At six months, only 15 (20.2%) children exhibited positive immuno-virological response to HAART (>= 15% increase in CD4% and <47 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml).
   Conclusions While HAART was effective in improving the immunological and virological parameters in the index cohort of children, virological responses were less robust.

AB  - BackgroundViral infections and drug reactions are the commonest causes of exanthems in clinical practice. Clinically, their overlapping features may pose a diagnostic challenge. Hematologic, in vitro, and drug provocation tests are either unreliable or impractical.
   MethodsThis was a descriptive, prospective study to assess and compare histopathological features of maculopapular viral and drug exanthem. Subjects fulfilling case definition of exanthems were included. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and absolute eosinophil count (AEC) were also studied.
   ResultsSkin biopsy slides of 48 cases were evaluated and AEC and CRP were performed. Both median AEC and CRP were lower in viral exanthem compared with drug exanthem. On histopathological evaluation, features such as lymphocytic exocytosis, and dermal infiltrate of eosinophils, lymphocytes and histiocytes were seen in a significantly greater number of drug exanthems. Other findings such as focal spongiosis, acanthosis, keratinocyte necrosis, basal cell damage, papillary dermal edema and atypical lymphocytes in the dermis were also observed in higher though not statistically significant number of drug exanthem biopsies.
   ConclusionsCertain histopathological features can help to differentiate between the two exanthems and this modality may be used in situations when there is clinical overlap and when drug rechallenge cannot be undertaken.

AB  - Stressful life events can precipitate relapses and recurrences in bipolar disorder. Kindling in bipolar disorder has been linked to maladaptive psychological reactivity to minor stressful life events. Systematic studies on life events and kindling are rare in bipolar disorder with a manic predominant polarity. One hundred and forty-nine remitted patients with bipolar I disorder were recruited. The National Institute of Mental Health-Life Chart Methodology was used to depict the illness course retrospectively, and the Presumptive Stressful Life Events Scale-Lifetime version was used to record the stressful life events. The role of stressful life events and the probability of kindling were assessed using appropriate statistics. There was a mania-predominant course of bipolar disorder in the sample with 55.7% (n = 83) having only recurrent mania. Family conflict and altered sleep patterns were the commonly reported stressful life events. When controlled for the severity of the stressor, the stressful life events were often associated With the initial episodes rather than the latter ones. Kindling may occur in bipolar disorder with mania as the predominant polarity. However, retrospective recall bias and hospital-based sampling limit generalizability of such observations.

AB  - Introduction We carried out this study to compare Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx) [Ga-68(HBED-CC)] [Ga-68 prostatespecific membrane antigen-11 (PSMA-11)] PET with multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for the staging of high-risk prostate cancer.
   Patients and methods This was a prospective study in which 36 patients with high-risk prostate cancer were included. The criteria for inclusion were biopsy-proven prostate cancer with a serum prostate specific antigen of at least 20 and/or Gleason's score of at least 8. Each patient then underwent both gallium-68 (Ga-68)-PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT) and mpMRI including diffusion-weighted whole-body imaging with background body signal suppression within an interval of 1 week and both modalities were compared for staging of primary disease, lymph node, and distant metastasis.
   Results The median age of the 36 patients included was 65 years (range: 44-80 years) and the median prostate specific antigen was 94.3 ng/ml (range: 20-19005 ng/ml). Concordance for localization of primary on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT and MRI was observed in 19/36 (52.7%) patients. Concurrence for T staging on Ga-68-PSMA and MRI was observed in 58.3% of patients. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CTdetected higher numbers of patients with regional (29) and nonregional (15) lymph nodes in comparison with MRI (20 and 5, respectively). Concurrence for regional and nonregional lymph node staging was observed in 72.2% of patients. Additional sites of metastatic disease reported on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT were to the skeleton in one patient, the lung in two patients, and the liver in one patient.
   Conclusion This study suggests that Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT is useful for lymph node and metastases staging in high-risk prostate cancers, whereas its utility for staging of disease in the prostate is limited. Copyright (c) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Increased expression of Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on cancer cells and immune cells predict response to PD-1/PDL1 inhibitors. Data regarding frequency and pattern of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC from India is not available.
   Objectives: To analyse PD-Ll expression on tumour cells (TC) and immune cells (IC) and to correlate PD-Ll expression with baseline clinico-pathological characteristics, oncogenic drivers and outcome data.
   Materials and methods: PD-Ll expression on tumour cells and immune cells was analysed.
   Results: Eighty-nine cases of resected NSCLC were included. Squamous cell carcinoma was more common than adenocarcinoma. IC were present in almost all cases. Immunopositivity for PD-Ll in TC and IC was 27% and 18% respectively. PD-Ll immunopositivity in TC or IC did not correlate with age, sex, stage or mutation status however sarcomatoid carcinoma and solid predominant adenocarcinomas showed higher positivity rates. PD-Ll immunopositivity in ICs was found to correlate with better disease free survival.
   Conclusion: PD-Ll immunopositivity was seen in a quarter of NSCLC patients in India. PDL1 positivity on immune cells may be associated with better prognosis in resected NSCLC. However the prognostic value of PD-Ll and clinical response to check point inhibitors in Indian population need to be validated in larger studies.

AB  - Three recombinant antigens viz. arginine kinase, cathepsin L-1 and TES-26 of Toxocara canis were expressed in Escherichia coli and evaluated for their potential in the detection of T. canis larval infection in human in immunoglobulin G-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (IgG-ELISA). Results of the IgG-ELISA with the above recombinant antigens were confirmed with commercially available IgG detection kit for T canis infection used as a standard test. All three recombinant antigens were 100% sensitive in the detection of positive cases (n = 6) of T. canis infection in human and were screened for their cross-reactivity in human patients with history of Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium vivax, Entamoeba hisiolytica, hydatid and hookworm infections. The recombinant TES-26 antigen showed higher specificity and cross-reacted with T gondii infection sera only. However. arginine kinase and cathepsin L-1 recombinant antigens showed cross-reactions with sera of patients infected with T. gondii, P. vivax and E. histolytica but not with the patient sera infected with hydatid and hookworm. These results show that recombinant TES-26 is a potential diagnostic candidate antigen for human toxocarosis caused by migrating T canis larvae.

AB  - Stroke is a multi-factorial polygenic disease and is a major cause of death and adult disability. Administration of bone marrow stem cells protects ischemic rat brain by facilitating recovery of neurological functions. But the molecular mechanism of stem cells action and their effect on gene expression is not well explored. In this study, we have transplanted 1x10(6) human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMMSCs) in middle cerebral artery occluded (MCAo) adult male Wistar rats through intracarotid artery route at 24h after surgery. Motor behavioral tests (rotarod and open field) were performed to assess the changes in motor functions at day 0 and day1, 4, 8 and 14. The expression of studied genes at mRNA and protein level was quantified by using Q-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Further, we have assessed the methylation pattern of promoter of these genes by using methylation-specific PCR. Data were analyzed statistically and correlated. A significant improvement in behavioral deficits was observed in stem cells treated group after 14th day post stroke. Significantly (p<0.05) increased mRNA and protein levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor and ANP genes in hBMMSCs treated group along with decrease in methylation level at their promoter was observed. On the other hand, significantly decreased mRNA and protein level of TSP1 and WNK1 in hBMMSCs treated group was observed. In conclusion, hBMMSCs administration significantly improves the behavioral deficits by improving motor and locomotor coordination. The promoter of TSP1 and WNK1 genes was found to be hyper-methylated in hBMMSCs group resulting in their decreased expression while the promoter of ANP and brain derived neurotrophic factor was found to be hypo-methylated. This study might shed a light on how hBMMSCs affect the gene expression by modulating methylation status.

AB  - Population substructure analysis and ancestry tracing are the critical issues for association studies of health, behaviors and forensic genetics. STR (short tandem repeat) markers are being extensively used to analyze genetic diversity among the populations. In the present study, allele frequencies and statistical parameters were estimated with 15 STR loci from 208 unrelated individuals from Delhi (India). A total of 146 alleles was found with corresponding allelic frequencies ranging from 0.001 to 0.3869. The MP (matching probability), PD (power of discrimination), PIC (polymorphism information content), PE (power of exclusion) and TPI (typical paternity index) ranged from 0.035 to 0.146, 0.854 to 0.965, 0.65 to 0.850, 0.416 to 0.774, and 1.76 to 4.52, respectively. Deviations were observed from the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium for D165539, D18551, D21S11 and TPDX Markers. The genetic proximity of the studied population was observed with central Indian population. The population's genetic structure analysis of this population can assist to contrive future genetic studies.

AB  - Purpose: Monofocal aspheric intraocular lenses (IOLs) provide better visual outcome compared to other available IOLs following cataract surgery. However, the imported IOLs are expensive and are not affordable by all subset of patients in low-to middle-income countries like India. The aim of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a relatively low cost indigenous IOL (Acriol EC) with an imported aspheric IOL (AcrySof IQ). Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre. Two hundred and five eyes of 137 patients >45 years of age with uncomplicated age-related cataract were recruited. All cases underwent standard phacoemulsification and randomly assigned to one of the IOL implantations (Group I: AcrySof IOL; Group II: Acriol EC IOL). Primary outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included visual function (VF) score, spherical equivalent, contrast sensitivity, optical aberrations, and posterior capsular opacification. Independent t-test to compare two means; Mann-Whitney test; Pearson's Chi-square test, and McNemar's test were used for analyzing the nonparametric data such as incidence of posterior capsule opacification. Results: There was no significant difference in the mean postoperative BCVA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in either group (P > 0.05). The contrast sensitivity, wavefront aberrations, VF score, and posterior capsular opacification were comparable between the groups except for higher-order aberrations and spherical aberration, which were higher in Group II. Conclusions: Acriol EC IOL provides visual outcomes comparable to other commonly used aspheric IOLs with comparable safety and efficacy at an affordable cost.

AB  - Background: The temporary anchorage devices (TADs) which include miniscrew implants (MSIs) have evolved as useful armamentarium in the management of severe malocclusions and assist in complex tooth movements. Although a multitude of factors is responsible for the primary and secondary stability of miniscrew implants, contemporary research highlights the importance of biological interface of MSI with bone and soft tissue in augmenting the success of implants.
   The inflammation and remodeling associated with MSI insertion or loading are reflected through biomarkers in peri-miniscrew implant crevicular fluid (PMICF) which is analogous to the gingival crevicular fluid. Analysis of biomarkers in PMICF provides indicators of inflammation at the implant site, osteoclast differentiation and activation, bone resorption activity and bone turnover. The PMICF for assessment of these biomarkers can be collected non-invasively via paper strips, periopaper or micro capillary pipettes and analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunoassays. The markers and mediators of inflammation have been previously studied in relation to orthodontic tooth movement include interleukins (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8), growth factors and other proteins like tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), chondroitin sulphate (CS) and osteoprotegerin (OPG).
   Studies have indicated that successful and failed MSIs have different concentrations of biomarkers in PMICF. However, there is a lack of comprehensive information on this aspect of MSIs. Therefore, a detailed review was conducted on the subject.
   Results: A literature search revealed six relevant studies: two on IL-1 beta; one on IL-2, IL-6 and IL-8; one on TNF-alpha; one on CS; and one on RANKL/OPG ratio. One study showed an increase in IL-1 beta levels upon MSI loading, peak in 24 hours (h), followed by a decrease in 21 days to reach baseline in 300 days. A 6.87% decrease in IL-2 levels was seen before loading and a 5.97% increase post-loading. IL-8 showed a 6.31% increase after loading and IL-6 increased by 3.08% before MSI loading and 15.06% after loading. RANKL/OPG ratio increased in loaded compared to unloaded MSIs.
   Conclusions: Cytokines (mainly ILs and TNF-alpha) and RANKL/OPG ratio showed alteration in PMICF levels upon loading of MSIs as direct or indirect anchorage.

AB  - Introduction: There is shortage of specialists for the diagnosis of children with neuromotor impairments (NMIs), especially in resource limited settings. Existing International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) instrument for diagnosing NMI have been validated for children aged 29 years. The current study modified the same including wider symptomatology and age group (1 month to 18 years).
   Methods: The Modified INCLEN diagnostic tool (INDT) was developed by a team of experts by modifying the existing tool to widen the age range (1 month to 18 years) and include broader symptomatology (inclusion of milestones from the first 2 years of life and better elucidation of cerebellar and extrapyramidal features) in a tertiary care teaching hospital of North India between January and April 2015. A trained medical graduate applied the candidate tool, which was followed by gold standard evaluation by a Pediatric Neurologist (both blinded to each other).
   Results: A total of 197 children (102 with NMI and 95 without NMI) were enrolled for the study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, positive and negative likelihood ratio of the modified NMI tool were 90.4% (82.695.5), 95.5% (88.798.7), 95.5% (88.998.7), 90.3% (82.495.5), 19.9 (12.132.6), and 0.13 (0.080.12), respectively.
   Conclusion: The All India Institute of Medical Sciences modified INDT NMI tool is a simple and structured instrument covering a wider symptomatology in the 1 month to 18 years age group with acceptable diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Experimental and clinical evidence have demonstrated aberrant expression of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors in patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) and focal cortical dysplasia (FCD). However, there is limited information regarding the modulation of cytokine/chemokine-regulatory networks, suggesting contribution of miRNAs and downstream transcription factors/receptors in these pathologies. Hence, we studied the levels of multiple inflammatory mediators (IL1 beta, IL1Ra, IL6, IL10, CCL3, CCL4, TNF alpha and VEGF) along with transcriptional changes of nine related miRNAs and mRNA levels of downstream effectors of significantly altered cytokines/chemokines in brain tissues obtained from patients with HS (n = 26) and FCD (n = 26). Up regulation of IL1 beta, IL6, CCL3, CCL4, STAT-3, C-JUN and CCR5, and down regulation of IL 10 were observed in both HS and FCD cases (p < 0.05). CCR5 was significantly up regulated in FCD as compared to HS (p < 0.001). Both, HS and FCD presented decreased miR-223-3p, miR-21-5p, miR-204-5p and let-7a-5p and increased miR-155-5p expression (p < 0.05). As compared to HS, miR-204-5p (upstream to CCR5 and IL1 beta) and miR-195-5p (upstream to CCL4) were significantly decreased in FCD patients (p < 0.01). Our results suggest differential alteration of cytokine/chemokine regulatory networks in HS and FCD and provide a rationale for developing pathology specific therapy.

AB  - AIM: To elucidate the mechanism of multidrug resistance in retinoblastoma, and to acquire more insights into in vivo drug resistance.
   METHODS: Three anticancer drug resistant Y79 human RB cells were generated against vincristine, etoposide or carboplatin, which are used for conventional chemotherapy in RB. Primary cultures from enucleated eyes after chemotherapy (PCNC) were also prepared. Their chemosensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, etoposide and carboplatin) were measured using MTT assay. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression of p53, Bcl-2 and various multidrug resistant proteins in retinoblastoma cells.
   RESULTS: Following exposure to chemotherapeutic drugs, PCNC showed less sensitivity to drugs. No significant changes observed in the p53 expression, whereas Bcl-2 expression was found to be increased in the drug resistant cells as well as in PCNC. Increased expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) was observed in drug resistant Y79 cells; however there was no significant change in the expression of P-gp found between primary cultures of primarily enucleated eyes and PCNC. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (Mrp-1) expression was found to be elevated in the drug resistant Y79 cells as well as in PCNC. No significant change in the expression of lung resistance associated protein (Lrp) was observed in the drug resistant Y79 cells as well as in PCNC.
   CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that multidrug resistant proteins are intrinsically present in retinoblastoma which causes treatment failure in managing retinoblastoma with chemotherapy.

AB  - Progression of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV 1)infection in children is faster than adults. HIV-1 subtype C is responsible for more than 50% of the infections globally and more than 90% infections in India. To date, there is no effective vaccine against HIV-1. Recent animal studies and human Phase I trials showed promising results of the protective effect of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Interaction between CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and CD4 receptor on the host immune cells is the primary event leading to HIV-1 infection. The CD4bs is a highly conserved region, comprised of a conformational epitope, and is a potential target of bnAbs such as VRCO1 that is presently under human clinical trials. Recombinant scFvs can access masked epitopes due to their small size and have shown the potential to inhibit viral replication and neutralize a broad range of viruses. Pediatric viruses are resistant to many of the existing bnAbs isolated from adults. Therefore, in this study, pooled peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 9 chronically HIV-1 subtype C infected pediatric cross-neutralizers whose plasma antibodies exhibited potent and cross-neutralizing activity were used to construct a human anti-HIV-1 scFv phage library of 9 x 108 individual clones. Plasma mapping using CD4bs-specific probes identified the presence of CD4bs directed antibodies in 4 of these children. By extensive biopanning of the library with CD4bsspecific antigen RSC3 core protein, we identified two cross neutralizing scFv monoclonals 2B10 and 2E4 demonstrating a neutralizing breadth and GMT of 77%, 17.9 mu g/ml and 32%, 51.2 mu g/ml, respectively, against a panel of 49 tier 1, 2 and 3 viruses. Both scFvs competed with anti CD4bs bnAb VRCO1 confirming their CD4bs epitope specificity. The 2B10 scFv was effective in neutralizing the 7 subtype C and subtype A pediatric viruses tested. Somatic hypermutations in the VH gene of scFvs (10.1-11.1%) is comparable with that of the adult antibodies. These cross-neutralizing CD4bs-directed scFvs can serve as potential reagents for passive immunotherapy. A combination of cross neutralizing scFvs of diverse specificities with antiretroviral drugs may be effective in suppressing viremia at an early stage of HIV-1 infection and prevent disease progression.

AB  - To overcome the limitations of conventional chemotherapy, nanoparticle-mediated combinatorial delivery of siRNA and drugs represents a new approach to overcome its associated side effects. Designing safe and efficient vehicles for their codelivery has emerged as a potential challenge in the clinical translation of these formulations. Herein, we have demonstrated a novel "two-in-one" polyplex nanosystem developed from redox sensitive, short chain polyethylenimine modified poly[(poly(ethylene)glycol methacrylate]-s-s-polycaprolactone copolymer synthesized by atom-transfer free-radical polymerization (ATRP), which can deliver doxorubicin and polo-like kinase I (plk1) siRNA, simultaneously for an enhanced chemotherapeutic effect. The nanoparticles were found to be stable at physiological buffer with and without fetal bovine serum (FBS). The developed polymeric nanosystem was found to be biocompatible and hemocompatible in vitro and in vivo at repeated dose administrations. The polymer could easily self-assemble into similar to 100 nm spherical nanoparticles with enhanced doxorubicin loading (similar to 18%) and effective siRNA complexation at a polymer to siRNA weight ratio of 15. The doxorubicin loaded nanoparticles exhibited similar to 4-fold higher drug release in endosomal pH (pH 5) containing 10 mmol of GSH compared to pH 7.4, depicting their redox-sensitive behavior. The polyplexes were capable of delivering both cargos simultaneously to cancer cells in vitro as observed by their excellent colocalization in the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 and HeLa cells using confocal laser microscopy. Moreover, in vitro transfection of the cells with polyplexes exhibited 50-70% knockdown of plk1-mRNA expression in both cell lines. In vivo administration of the drug loaded polyplexes to EAT tumor bearing (EAT, Ehrlich ascites tumor) Swiss albino mice showed a similar to 29-fold decrease in percent tumor volume in comparison to the control group. The results highlight the therapeutic potential of the polyplexes as a combined delivery of doxorubicin and plk1-siRNA in cancer therapy.

AB  - Background: Super obese patients remain a challenge for management because of large liver size resulting in decreased work space and associated comorbidities. Objectives: To study outcomes in super obese patients undergoing Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). Methods: Retrospective data of 123 patients undergoing LSG from January 2008 to March 2015 were analyzed prospectively. Results: Mean age and body mass index (BMI) of 123 patients (2 standard deviation [SD]) were 39.9 +/- 23.3 years and 55.6 +/- 10.54kg/m(2), respectively. Mean percentage excess weight loss (%EWL) (+/- 2 SD) at 1, 3, 5, and 7 years was 63%+/- 36.7%, 62.3%+/- 29.0%, 56.5%+/- 35.8%, and 58.6%+/- 40.3%, respectively. The preoperative BMI correlated with %EWL at 1 year (r(2)=0.0397, P=.044). Staple line leak, bleeding, deep venous thrombosis, and 30-day mortality occurred in 1.6%, 0%, 0.8%, and 0% of the patients, respectively. Stricture formation and new onset gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurred in 0.8% patients each. Of the diabetic patients, 72.2% had remission and the rest required decreased dosage of oral hypoglycemic medications. Hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and GERD improved in 68.2%, 100%, and 25% of the patients, respectively. However, 25% of patients had worsening in GERD symptoms. Conclusions: Super obese patients undergoing LSG as the primary procedure have reasonable weight loss of 62% and 56% at 3 and 5 years, respectively, with significant resolution of comorbidities.

AB  - The plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene has been found to be associated with the pathogenesis and progression of vascular diseases including stroke. A 4G/5G, PAI-1 gene polymorphism has been found to be associated with the plasma PAI-1 levels in different ethnic populations but results are still controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the potential association of 4G/5G polymorphism and plasma PAI-1 levels in the development of ischemic stroke (IS) in young Asian Indians. One hundred patients with IS and an equal number of age- and sex-matched controls were studied. The 4G/5G polymorphism was genotyped in the study population through allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Plasma PAI-1 levels were evaluated using a commercial kit. The PAI-1 levels were significantly higher in patients when compared to the controls (P = .03). The variant 4G allele for the PAI-I 4G/5G polymorphism showed both genotypic (P = .0013, chi(2) = 10.303; odds ratio [OR] = 3.75) as well as allelic association (P = .0004, chi(2) = 12.273; OR = 1.99) with IS. The homozygous variant 4G/4G also was found to be associated with the higher PAI-1 levels (0.005). The variant allele 4G of PAI-1 4G/5G polymorphism and higher plasma PAI-1 levels were found to be significantly associated with IS in young Asian Indians.

AB  - Aim To evaluate circulating plasma dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) levels in non-obese Asian Indians with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to correlate these with metabolic profile and measures of anthropometry, skinfolds, abdominal adipose tissue depots, pancreatic volume, and liver span.
   Methodology Non-obese (body mass index (BMI) <25 kg/m(2)) patients with T2DM (cases, n=93), diagnosed within 1 year from recruitment, on metformin therapy and BMI-matched, and nondiabetic subjects (controls, n=40) were compared. Measurements of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma insulin levels, lipid profile, hepatic transaminases and plasma DPP4 levels, and quantification of abdominal fat depots, pancreatic volume and liver span (MRI scan), were done.
   Results Significantly higher (p<0.001) circulating plasma DPP4 levels were observed in cases as compared to controls. Specifically, in patients with T2DM with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) (n=48), the mean plasma DPP4 level (52.6 +/- 27.8 ng/ mL) was significantly higher (p<0.05) as compared with those without NAFLD (n=43; 47 +/- 28.3 ng/mL). Significant positive correlation was observed for circulating plasma DPP4 levels with waist-to-hip ratio, total intra-abdominal adipose volume, and liver span. Fasting serum insulin, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triceps skinfolds, total intra-abdominal adipose tissue volume and presence of T2DM were significant determinants of circulating plasma DPP4 levels.
   Conclusion Non-obese Asian Indian patients with T2DM and on metformin therapy have significantly higher circulating plasma DPP4 levels as compared to non-obese non-diabetic controls, and these levels correlate with fasting insulin and LDL-C levels, upper limb subcutaneous adipose tissue, intra-abdominal adiposity and presence of diabetes.

TI  - Errors of inclusion and exclusion in income-based provisioning of public healthcare: Problems associated with below poverty line cards
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - This study examined the effect of out-of-pocket expenditure of patients on their illness and other household changes impacting on their well-being, and assessed the socioeconomic status and below poverty line (BPL) card status among patients at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We did a hospital-based cross-sectional study of 374 inpatients and outpatients. Among the 374 study subjects, more than 69% of poor did not possess a BPL card. On the other hand, 5.5% of the above poverty line patients among the respondents possessed a BPL card. Of those having BPL cards, 84.4% belonged either to the lower middle, upper lower and lower socioeconomic status categories. Our data suggest that the inaccuracies in providing BPL cards limit access of the genuine poor to healthcare. In the light of national-level surveys on accessing healthcare and out-of-pocket expenditure by patients there is a case against 'targeting' in the delivery of public health services and user charges have an adverse impact on access to healthcare by the poor.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome, toxicity, survival, and quality of life in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.
   Methods: One hundred sixty-seven patients were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent baseline Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT scans. Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy was administered quarterly along with oral capecitabine therapy in group 1 patients (n = 88), whereas group 2 patients (n = 79) were treated only with Lu-177-DOTATATE. Hematologic, kidney function, liver function tests and chromogranin A levels were recorded before and after therapy at 2-week, 4-week, and 3-month intervals. Biochemical and morphological responses were assessed with the trend in chromogranin A levels and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, respectively.
   Results: There was no significant difference in the hemoglobin levels after Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy (P = 0.4892). In most patients, there was a decrease in the platelet levels; however, all the patients had platelet counts greater than 100,000/mu L with no platelet toxicity. There was no toxicity related to leukocytes. Two patients showed renal insufficiencies. No hepatotoxicity was observed in any of the patients. According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, in group 1 patients, the response was partial response in 34% of the patients, stable disease in 50.2%, and progressive disease in 6.8% versus partial response in 6.3%, stable disease in 60.9%, and progressive disease in 26.5% among group 2 patients. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached in group 1 patients. The median OS and PFS in group 2 patients were 48 months. Ki-67 tumor proliferation index was significantly associated with increased risk of disease progression.
   Conclusions: Addition of capecitabine therapy with Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy lengthens the OS and PFS. Patients with aggressive disease may benefit from this synergetic therapeutic approach.

AB  - 46, XY differences of sex development (DSD) constitute a heterogenous group of rare genetic defects. Definitive aetiological diagnosis cannot be made in more than half of these cases. The aim of our study was to prospectively evaluate and assign a probable diagnosis based on clinical and biochemical parameters in children with 46, XY DSD. Prospective clinical and biochemical screening was performed in a series of 46, XY children referred to paediatric endocrine services of our centre. Forty children with 46, XY DSD were investigated, and presumptive aetiological diagnoses of 5-alpha reductase deficiency (5 alpha RD), partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD), partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), congenital bilateral anorchia (CBA), congenital lipoid adrenal hyperplasia (CLAH), ovotesticular DSD (OT-DSD) and Frasier syndrome (FS) were made. The most frequent cause of 46, XY DSD in our cohort was 5aRD (40%) followed by PGD (27.5%). Our study illustrates the complexity of 46, XY DSD with a significant overlap of phenotype and endocrine parameters between the different conditions. 5aRD was considered to be the predominant cause in our cohort.

AB  - The literature notes high prevalence of cognitive function (CF) impairment among hemodialysis patients. Renal transplantation by reversing metabolic factors should improve cognitive function; however, results in post-transplant patients are inconsistent. Lack of longitudinal studies, variable and small patient population, variable renal function and post-transplantation period and use of non-specific tests make results difficult to interpret. We looked at CF in stable hemodialysis patients just prior to live renal transplantation and approximately 3 months subsequently using well-validated electrophysiological study of P300 cognitive potential obtained by auditory oddball paradigm using multiple scalp electrodes.
   Ten healthy age- and gender-matched controls (group 1) and 20 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) male patients on maintenance hemodialysis with no other comorbidities that affect CF were studied before (group 2) and 3 months after successful transplantation (group 3).
   ESKD population had mean age of 29.7 +/- 7.5 years, with mean dialysis vintage and post-transplant period being 10.3 +/- 6.9 and 3.2 +/- 0.4 months, respectively. Mean P300 latencies in groups 1, 2 and 3 were 319 +/- 33.6, 348.6 +/- 27.8 and 316.4 +/- 33.4 ms, respectively (P < 0.001 group 1 vs 2 and group 2 vs 3; group 1 vs 3 NS). Mean P300 amplitude in groups 1, 2 and 3 was 27.9 +/- 12.8, 13.4 +/- 8.6 and 14.6 +/- 9.4 A mu V, respectively (P < 0.001 group 1 vs 2 and group 1 vs 3; group 2 vs 3 NS). P300 latencies correlated negatively with hemoglobin and serum albumin.
   ESKD patients have impaired CF as documented by prolonged P300 latencies. There was normalization of P300 latencies post-transplantation indicating role of uremic toxins in CF impairment.

AB  - Objective: The present study evaluates the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of edge-to-edge repair for moderate secondary/functional mitral regurgitation in patients undergoing aortic valve/root interventions.
   Methods: Sixteen patients underwent transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair. Mitral regurgitation was 2+ in 8 patients and 3+ in 6 patients. Two patients in whom cardiac arrest developed preoperatively had severe (4+) mitral regurgitation. Patients underwent operation for severe aortic regurgitation +/- aortic root lesions. The mean left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters were 51.5 +/- 12.8 mm and 70.7 +/- 10.7 mm, respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction ranged from 20% to 60%. Primary surgical procedure included Bentall's +/- hemiarch replacement in 10 patients, aortic valve replacement in 5 patients, and noncoronary sinus replacement with aortic valve repair in 1 patient.
   Results: Severity of mitral regurgitation decreased to trivial or zero in 13 patients, 1+ in 2 patients, and 2+ in 1 patient. There were no gradients across the mitral valve in 9 patients, less than 5 mm Hg in 6 patients, and 9 mm Hg in 1 patient. There was no operative mortality. Follow-up ranged from 2 weeks to 54 months. Echocardiography showed trivial or no mitral regurgitation in 12 patients, 1+ in 2 patients, and 2+ in 2 patients. None of the patients had significant mitral stenosis. The mean left ventricular systolic and diastolic diameters decreased to 40.5 +/- 10.3 mm and 58.7 +/- 11.6 mm, respectively. Ejection fraction also improved slightly (22%-65%).
   Conclusions: Transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve repair is a safe and effective technique to abolish secondary/functional mitral regurgitation. However, its impact on overall survival needs to be studied.

AB  - Objectives: Severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with high mortality due to systemic inflammatory response syndrome in the early phase and secondary infection in the later phase. Concomitant intestinal ischemia often results in gut injury. We studied intestinal fatty acid binding protein (IFABP) and citrulline levels as markers of gut injury to predict prognosis in AP.
   Methods: Acute pancreatitis patients at admission and controls were studied. Serum IFABP was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plasma citrulline by high-performance liquid chromatography technique. Ultrastructural changes in duodenal biopsy were also compared between the 2 groups.
   Results: The IFABP concentration was significantly higher in AP cases (n = 94) compared with controls (n = 100) (mean [standard deviation], 592.5 [753.6] vs 87.8 [67.6] pg/mL; P < 0.001) and in patients with severe AP versus mild AP (738.3 [955.3] vs 404.0 [263.3] pg/mL, P = 0.03). Citrulline concentration was lower in AP versus controls (29.9 [33.8] vs 83.9 [60.1] mu g/L, P < 0.001). We propose a model by which these biomarkers (IFABP >350 pg/mL and citrulline <18 mu g/L) are able to predict poor prognosis in 33.9% of patients with AP. The gut injury was also validated via ultrastructural changes.
   Conclusions: Intestinal fatty acid binding protein is a promising prognostic marker in acute pancreatitis.

AB  - The geriatric population is at a high risk of developing deficiencies of essential micronutrients such as minerals, vitamins, and trace elements and their related deficiency signs and symptoms. Scarce data is available on the dietary intake of essential micronutrients among geriatric subjects in India. Hence, to fill the gap in the existing knowledge, a community-based cross-sectional study was conducted during 2015-2016 in District Nainital, Uttarakhand State, India. A total of 255 geriatric subjects were enrolled from 30 clusters (villages) identified by using population proportionate to size sampling methodology. Data were collected on sociodemographic profile and dietary intake of essential micronutrients (24-h dietary recall, food frequency questionnaire) from all the geriatric subjects. A high percentage of geriatric subjects did not consume the recommended daily intake for essential micronutrients such as energy (78%), protein (78%), calcium (51%), thiamine (33%), riboflavin (64%), niacin (88%), vitamin C (42%), iron (72%), folic acid (72%), magnesium (48%), zinc (98%), copper (81%) and chromium (89%) adequately. Food groups rich in essential micronutrients such as pulses, green leafy vegetables, roots and tubers, other vegetables, fruits, nonvegetarian food items, and milk and milk products were consumed irregularly by the subjects. The overall intake of energy and essential micronutrients was inadequate among the geriatric population in India, possibly due to poor quality and quantity of the diet consumed.

AB  - Patients with patent ductus arteriosus and significant left-to-right shunt develop Eisenmenger syndrome at an early age and are not operable after development of irreversible pulmonary artery hypertension. Patients with mitral stenosis, however, are treatable even with suprasystemic pulmonary artery pressures. A combination of these two lesions is rare. We document a patient with differential cyanosis who improved after corrective surgery of both the lesions. The importance of post-capillary pulmonary artery hypertension in shunt lesions needs to be better appreciated.

AB  - PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to comparatively evaluate angle dysgenesis in vivo, among congenital, juvenile, and adult-onset open angle glaucoma patients.
   METHODS. A cross-sectional evaluation of 96 glaucoma patients, 22 children with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) old enough to cooperate for optical coherence tomography (OCT), 34 juvenile-onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG) patients, 40 adult-onset primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), and 30 healthy subjects, was carried out using high-resolution anterior segment spectral domain (SD)-OCT Subgroup analysis was done for presence/ absence of angle dysgenesis as defined by presence of abnormal tissue/hyperreflective membrane within angle recess and/or absence of Schlemm's canal (SC).
   RESULTS. Morphologic features suggestive of angle dysgenesis such as the presence of abnormal tissue at the angle and a hyperreflective membranous structure covering the meshwork were seen in all PCG eyes (100%), in 14 (40%) JOAG eyes, and none of the POAG eyes in comparison to healthy eyes (P = 0.01, P = 0.03, and P = 0.23 for PCG, JOAG, and POAG, respectively). SC could be seen in 27 (90%) healthy eyes compared with only 7 (30%) in PCG (P = 0.01) 20 (60%) JOAG eyes (P = 0.03), and 26 (65%) adult-onset POAG eyes (P 0.23; chi(2) test).
   CONCLUSIONS. Angle dysgenesis in the form of abnormal tissue at the angle/hyperreflective membrane and/or absence of SC could be identified on anterior segment SD-OCT, which can be used for in vivo evaluation of eyes with developmental glaucoma.

AB  - Objective: Cytology specimens are considered to be a promising alternative for detecting driver mutations in lung cancer patients. We aimed to explore the suitability and utility of various cytology samples of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients for mutation testing. In addition to mutation detection, the importance of preanalytic factors was discussed. Design: A total of 116 cytology samples including 32 controls comprising pleural effusions, bronchial washings, and direct fine-needle aspiration (FNA) smears were included in the study for the detection of EGFR, KRAS, and Her-2/neu gene mutations. Tumor content was checked by microscopic evaluation. Tumor enrichment was done by scraping direct smears. DNA yield was assessed before selecting the method of mutation detection. Sanger sequencing and real-time PCR-based methods were used. Results: Overall, 20.23% EGFR mutations and 2.74% KRAS mutations were observed in this study. Nondriver genetic polymorphisms were observed in EGFR exon 20 in 37% cases. The coexistence of the EGFR mutation and EGFR polymorphism was seen in 7 cases. DNA yield was better in pleural effusions and bronchial washings. Real-time PCR was used in specimens of low DNA yield. Conclusions: Cytology samples are useful in ascertaining molecular diagnostic information for treatment purposes if they are optimized judiciously in their preanalytic phase. (C) 2017 S.

AB  - Most pathologists are familiar with the microscopic features of tuberculosis and the need to examine special stains for acid-fast bacteria (AFB) in cases of granulomatous lung disease. However, misconceptions do exist, including the concept that finding AFB in "caseating granulomas" confirms the diagnosis of tuberculosis. This dogma is attributable to the high prevalence of tuberculosis in many countries, as well as unfamiliarity with the microscopic spectrum of non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease. This review aims to provide surgical pathologists with practical tips to identify AFB, illustrate the histologic overlap between pulmonary tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacterial lung disease, and highlight the importance of cultures in this setting. M. tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria cannot be reliably differentiated either on the basis of the tissue reaction or by bacterial morphology on acid-fast stains. Although a presumptive clinical diagnosis of tuberculosis can be made without culture-confirmation, the only definitive means to determine the true identity of AFB is by cultures or molecular methods. Making this distinction is most critical when AFB are found in incidentally detected lung nodules in geographic locations where the incidence of tuberculosis is low, because in such settings AFB in necrotizing granulomas of the lung are more likely to be non-tuberculous mycobacteria than M. tuberculosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Benzodiazepines (BZD) are widely prescribed to substance users. However, the nonmedical use of prescription BZD often leads to abuse and dependence. Therefore, it is important to detect BZD among substance users seeking treatment. The aim of the present study was to develop an efficient method for testing BZD on dried urine spot (DUS) and evaluating its clinical applicability.
   METHODS: This involved optimization of conditions for the detection, recovery, and stability of BZD from dried urine, spotted on filter paper. Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay was used for screening whereas confirmation was done by gas chromatography. For clinical applicability, urine samples of BZD users were tested.
   RESULTS: The recovery was found to be 99.7% in de-ionized water from 20 mu l spotted urine samples. Limit of detection, inter-day and intra-day CV were found to be 100 ng/ml, 4.22% and 3.83%, respectively. BZD were found stable in DUS for 3 weeks at room temperature, and for 3 months at 4 degrees C and -20 degrees C. All the urine samples of benzodiazepine users were found positive by conventional method as well as the DUS method.
   CONCLUSION: DUS method proved to be efficient for BZD testing with advantages of ease of collection, transportation, minimal invasiveness and small sample volume. It offers a useful alternative for BZD testing especially in developing countries where logistics of sample collection and transportation could be an important concern.

AB  - Objective To identify risk factors for microbiologically confirmed intrathoracic tuberculosis in children.
   Methods Children, 6 mo to 15 y of age, attending the outpatient department of a tertiary care centre in India, with probable intrathoracic tuberculosis were enrolled. Microbiological confirmation of tuberculosis was defined as positivity on smear (Ziehl-Neelsen staining) and/or Xpert MTB/RIF and/or MGIT-960 culture. Association of various factors with microbiological confirmation were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis.
   Results Microbiologic confirmation was documented in 39 (25%) of 153 patients enrolled. On univariate analysis, microbiological positivity was associated with female gender, higher mean (SD) age [136.6 (31.8) vs. 117.3 (41.4) mo], parenchymal lesion on chest radiograph, low body mass index for age, having symptoms of cough and weight loss, lower mean (SD) hemoglobin [10.4 (1.37) g/dl vs. 11(1.52) g/dl; p = 0.04], and higher mean (SD) monocyte: lymphocyte ratio [0.38 (0.30) vs. 0.24 (0.02); p = 0.37]. Higher proportion of microbiologically negative children were BCG vaccinated (95% vs. 79%; p = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, microbiological positivity showed significant association with low body mass index for age (p = 0.033) and higher monocyte: lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.037).
   Conclusions Low body mass index for age and higher monocyte: lymphocyte ratios were associated with microbiological confirmation in children with intrathoracic tuberculosis.

AB  - Background and Aims: Early objective markers for failure of intravenous[iv] corticosteroid for acute severe colitis [ASC] can avoid delay in rescue therapy or colectomy. We investigated faecal calprotectin [FC], C-reactive protein [CRP], and endoscopy using the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity [UCEIS] as predictors of steroid failure following intensive therapy of ASC.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with ASC satisfying Truelove and Witts' criteria, hospitalised at a single centre from May 2015 to November 2016, were included; all received iv corticosteroids. The primary outcome measure was steroid failure defined as colectomy and/or rescue therapy with ciclosporin or infliximab during admission. FC levels were measured at admission and on Day 3 of intensive therapy. UCEIS was scored at admission, and CRP on Day 3 of intensive therapy.
   Results: Of 49 patients, 21 [43%] failed iv corticosteroids and 15 [31%] underwent surgery. FC levels were significantly higher in steroid failures (2522 [590-9654] mu g/g) compared with steroid responders (1530 [352-10 278] mu g/g) at admission [p = 0.04], as well as on Day 3 of iv corticosteroid therapy (2718 [222-9175] mu g/g vs 727 [218-4062] mu g/g, p = 0.001). Steroid failures had a higher median [range] UCEIS score than responders (6 [4-8] vs 5 [4-7] [p = 0.001]). CRP level did not differ significantly between steroid failures and responders. A UCEIS > 6 at admission and FC > 1000 mu g/g on Day 3 were independent predictors of steroid failure and need for rescue therapy/colectomy.
   Conclusions: All patients with UCEIS > 6 and Day 3 FC > 1000 mu g/g failed iv corticosteroids. The UCEIS score on admission and Day 3 FC are early predictors of failure of ivcorticosteroid therapy.

AB  - Purpose: Overexpression of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins have been demonstrated in a variety and of solid tumors including melanomas and nonmelanomas skin cancers. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is an inhibitor of apoptosis which prevents apoptosis by inhibiting caspases 9, 7, and 3. The prognostic value of XIAP in sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC) remains unexplored. Methods: The immunohistochemical expression of XIAP was evaluated in 29 SGC cases. Results: The cytoplasmic overexpression of XIAP was detected in 62% SGC cases. XIAP expression was found to be significantly associated with advanced age, large tumor size, and with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0.0174). XIAP expression and advance tumor Grade III emerged as significant risk factors on univariate analysis. On stepwise multivariate analysis, both increased cytoplasmic XIAP expression and high tumor grade were found to be significantly associated with recurrence. Patients with low XIAP immunoexpression had a longer disease-specific survival than those with high expression in the 5-year follow-up. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates at the immunohistochemical level that XIAP is overexpressed in SGC and that high expression could be of biological significance in the development of eyelid SGC. Our finding suggests that up-regulation of XIAP may aggravate tumor metastasis in SGC.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the proportion of products meeting Indian government labelling regulations and to examine the Na levels in packaged foods sold in India.
   Design: Nutritional composition data were collected from the labels of all packaged food products sold at Indian supermarkets in between 2012 and 2014. Proportions of products compliant with the Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulations and labelled with Na content, and mean Na levels were calculated. Comparisons were made against 2010 data from Hyderabad and against the UK Department of Health (DoH) 2017 Na targets.
   Setting: Eleven large chain retail stores in Delhi and Hyderabad, India.
   Subjects: Packaged food products (n 5686) categorised into fourteen food groups, thirty-three food categories and ninety sub-categories.
   Results: More packaged food products (43 v. 34 %; P<0.001) were compliant with FSSAI regulations but less (32 v. 38 %; P<0.001) reported Na values compared with 2010. Food groups with the highest Na content were sauces and spreads (2217 mg/100 g) and convenience foods (1344 mg/100 g). Mean Na content in 2014 was higher in four food groups compared with 2010 and lower in none (P<0.05). Only 27 % of foods in sub-categories for which there are UK DoH benchmarks had Na levels below the targets.
   Conclusions: Compliance with nutrient labelling in India is improving but remains low. Many packaged food products have high levels of Na and there is no evidence that Indian packaged foods are becoming less salty.

AB  - Aims: To explore the demographics and clinical outcome of patients with thymoma treated with a multimodality approach at our institute.
   Methods: A total of 71 patients with thymoma (Masaoka stage II-IV and WHO subtype AB-B3) treated from 19992013 were included in this retrospective analysis. Age, stage, WHO subtypes, details of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were noted. Progression-free survival (PFS) was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and SPSS (version 21.0) was used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Male: female ratio was 56: 15 with median age at presentation of 41 years. Stage-wise distribution was 6: 46: 19 for stage II, stage III, and stage IV, respectively. A total of 31 patients (44%) had associated myasthenia gravis and 3 had pure red cell aplasia. A total of 57 patients (80%) underwent radical thymectomy and all of these patients received adjuvant radiotherapy. A total of 15 patients and 7 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. At median follow-up of 19.3 months (range 7.9-72.3 months), 2-year and 3-year PFS rate for the entire cohort was 78.3% and 57.1%, respectively. On univariate analysis, surgery (hazard ratio [HR] 3.881; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.784-19.220; p = 0.006) and stage (HR 5.457; 95% CI 1.567-18.996; p = 0.0001) were significant prognostic factors and association with myasthenia gravis (HR 0.404; 95% CI 0.151-1.078; p = 0.078) trended towards better PFS. Stage retained its prognostic significance (HR 5.501; 95% CI 2.076-14.573; p = 0.0006) on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: Multimodality management of locally advanced thymoma yields decent survival outcomes. Masaoka stage is an independent prognostic factor for survival and radical surgery should be contemplated in all cases of locoregionally limited thymoma.

AB  - The vital signs are an integral part of clinical methods. In diabetes, determination of plasma glucose can be taken as the fifth vital sign. The sixth vital sign is well being, which can easily be measured by two item questionnaires designed to assess distress, depression and coping skills. This sign is essential for the screening and follow up of persons living with diabetes, as it provides an idea of quality of care, helps plan therapeutic interventions, and serves as a surrogate for prognosis or outcome. Inclusion of the sixth vital sign reflects the relevance of the bio-psychosocial model of health to diabetes care.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an acute, self-limiting hepatitis in healthy individuals and leads to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. HEV infection in pregnant women results in a more severe outcome, with the mortality rate going up to 30%. Though the virus usually causes sporadic infection, epidemics have been reported in developing and resource-starved countries. No specific antiviral exists against HEV. A combination of interferon and ribavirin therapy has been used to control the disease with some success. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that plays crucial roles in multiple cellular processes. Zinc salts are known to be effective in reducing infections caused by few viruses. Here, we investigated the effect of zinc salts on HEV replication. In a human hepatoma cell (Huh7) culture model, zinc salts inhibited the replication of genotype 1 (g-1) and g-3 HEV replicons and g-1 HEV infectious genomic RNA in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of a replication-defective mutant of g-1 HEV genomic RNA under similar conditions ruled out the possibility of zinc salts acting on replication-independent processes. An ORF4-Huh7 cell line-based infection model of g-1 HEV further confirmed the above observations. Zinc salts did not show any effect on the entry of g-1 HEV into the host cell. Furthermore, our data reveal that zinc salts directly inhibit the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), leading to inhibition of viral replication. Taken together, these studies unravel the ability of zinc salts in inhibiting HEV replication, suggesting their possible therapeutic value in controlling HEV infection.
   IMPORTANCE Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a public health concern in resource-starved countries due to frequent outbreaks. It is also emerging as a health concern in developed countries owing to its ability to cause acute and chronic infection in organ transplant and immunocompromised individuals. Although antivirals such as ribavirin have been used to treat HEV cases, there are known side effects and limitations of such therapy. Our discovery of the ability of zinc salts to block HEV replication by virtue of their ability to inhibit the activity of viral RdRp is important because these findings pave the way to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation therapy in HEV-infected patients. Since zinc supplementation therapy is known to be safe in healthy individuals and since high-dose zinc is used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, it may be possible to control HEV-associated health problems following a similar treatment regimen.

AB  - PurposeQuantitative analysis in intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging commonly uses voxel-wise estimation of the bi-exponential model, which might not be reliable for clinical interpretation. Improving model fitting performance and qualitative and quantitative parametric estimation, two novel methodologies are proposed here.
   MethodsFive IVIM analyses methodologies: (a) Bi-exponential (BE) model, (b) Segmented BE method with two-parameter fitting (BEseg-2), (c) Segmented BE method with one-parameter fitting (BEseg-1), (d) BE with adaptive Total Variation penalty function (BE+TV) and (e) BE with adaptive Huber penalty function (BE+HPF) were evaluated. Relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE), relative bias (RB) and relative parameters (Drel,Drel,&frel) were calculated to estimate the accuracy of methods in simulations. Empirical datasets from 14 patients with bone tumor were analyzed using these methodologies. Coefficient of variation (CV) were estimated for each IVIM parameter in tumor volume to measure the precision of the estimation methods invivo.
   ResultsBoth BE+TV and BE+HPF showed consistently lower RRMSE (10-42%) and lower RB (-4 to 8%) at all noise levels, compared to BE, BEseg-2 and BEseg-1 (RRMSE: 15-120% and RB: -20 to 62%). Estimated Drel,frel for both BE+TV and BE+HPF methods were 1 (0.96-1.08), whereas BE, BEseg-2 and BEseg-1 showed sub-optimal parameter estimation (0.80-1.62). For clinical data BE+TV and BE+HPF showed 30-50% improved CV in estimating D, D*, and f than BE and improved CV in estimating D* (7-23%) and f (26-30%) than BEseg-2 and BEseg-1.
   ConclusionsBi-exponential model with penalty function showed quantitatively and qualitatively improved IVIM parameter estimation for both simulated and clinical dataset of bone tumors, thus potentially making this approach suitable for clinical applications in future.

AB  - A sequence alignment of horse cytochrome c (cyt c) with all known cyts c shows that Leu at position 94 is conserved, except in 14 species which have either Val or Ile at this position. It is also known that Leu94 of the mammalian cyt c plays an important role in folding and stability. The important question here is as to what will happen in terms of folding and stability if Leu94 of the mammalian cyt c is substituted by Val or Ile. To answer this question, we introduced natural substitutes of Leu94 by Val and Ile in horse cyt c. The purified L94V and L94I mutants under native condition (pH 6.0, 25 degrees C) were characterized using far UV, near-UV and Soret-circular dichroism, visible absorbance, Trp and ANS (1-anilino-8-napthaline sulphonate) fluorescence and dynamic light scattering measurements. Furthermore, stability parameters T-m (mid-point of denaturation) and Delta G(D)(0) (Gibbs free energy change at 25 degrees C) were also determined using spectroscopic and differential scanning calorimetric methods. All these measurements led us to conclude that both mutants exist as molten globule and are less stable than the wild-type protein. These observations are supported well by examining the structure of horse cyt c (PDB ID, IHRC). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Cyclophosphamide therapy is associated with several urological complications including urinary bladder malignancy. Data on urologic complications of chronic cyclophosphamide therapy for dermatologic conditions is not available.
   Objectives: To study the urocytological profile of pemphigus patients on long-term cyclophosphamide therapy.
   Materials and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, consecutive patients who had received cyclophosphamide therapy for pemphigus for more than 12 months were included. All patients were subjected to urinalysis including microscopy, culture, and urine cytology. Immunocytochemical staining for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20) on urine sediments and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for nuclear membrane protein-22 (NMP-22) were performed in all cases. In patients with urinary symptoms, microscopic hematuria, or those detected with abnormal urine sediment cytology, NMP-22, and CK-20 positivity, cystoscopy, and other relevant investigations were also done.
   Results: A total of 44 patients (43 of pemphigus vulgaris and one of pemphigus foliaceus) were recruited. Mean duration of cyclophosphamide intake was 2.9 +/- 1.7 years (range 1-8 years) with a mean cumulative dose of 53 +/- 28.4 g (range 6.5-141 g). Twenty-one cases (47.7%) each were asymptomatic and symptomatic with episodic urinary symptoms [of which two had urinary tract infection (UTI)] and two patients had gross hematuria. Urine cytology revealed mild urothelial nucleomegaly with hyperchromasia in four patients. However, CK-20 and NMP-22 were negative in all samples. Cystoscopy was performed in 21 cases and did not reveal any sign of bladder malignancy.
   Limitations: A relatively small sample size and lack of long-term follow-up were limitations.
   Conclusions: In our study, no serious urologic complications were found in pemphigus cases on chronic cyclophosphamide therapy.

AB  - Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which has been approved for intravenous use in certain cancers. There is evidence of its efficacy and safety as an intravitreal drug compared with ranibizumab and aflibercept. We have, in our practice, found it to be a cost-effective treatment option for ocular diseases, which could save a large amount of public money used in various national health insurance systems. An alert issued by the Drug Controller General of India led to a virtual ban on its intraocular use in India. However, pro-active advocacy and leadership by national ophthalmological societies helped to resolve the issue quickly.

AB  - The occurrence of full thickness macular hole in Coats' disease is extremely rare. The purpose of this case report is to report pars plana vitrectomy for the treatment of full thickness macular hole in a patient with adult onset Coats disease. A young male presented with decreased vision in his right eye because of full thickness macular hole. The macular hole was found to be associated with adult onset Coats' disease that was evident on ultra-wide field imaging. The patient underwent laser photocoagulation to the vascular telangiectasia followed by pars plana vitrectomy, large internal limiting membrane peeling and gas tamponade. This resulted in regression of exudation, closure of macular hole and improvement in vision. Coats disease of adult onset can present with decreased vision because of full thickness macular hole. Vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling can result in excellent visual outcome.

AB  - Coiled coil domain-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR; CNL) proteins are highly conserved family of plant disease resistance proteins, remarkably comprise of coiled-coil domain, which plays significant role in plant innate immunity. The present study reports that moderately elicited oligomerization of plant CNL like protein fragment (CNL-LPF) in presence of ATP/Mg using various biophysical methods Circular dichroism (CD) results depicted a substantial increase in beta-sheet structure content of CNL-LPF. ATP/Mg induced conformational change in protein was observed by increase in blue shift with extrinsic fluorescence measurement, which indicates the exposure of hydrophobic regions of CNL-LPF and leads to self-association i.e. oligomerization. Likewise, cluster of protein oligomer and alteration in protein surface morphology were observed in presence of ATP/Mg by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Also, augmented antiproliferation of HT1376 cells (urinary bladder cancer cell lines) was observed by CNL-LPF in presence of ATP/Mg. In conclusion, the current study illustrates that extent of CNL-LPF oligomerization was enhanced in presence of ATP/Mg (as compared to its absence). Utilization of enhanced oligomerization property of CNL-LPF as an anti-proliferative agent needs more assessment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gangliogliomas (GGs) are the most commonly diagnosed long-term epilepsy-associated tumors (LEATs). Although molecular characterizations of brain tumors have identified few novel biomarkers among the LEATs, mechanisms of pathogenesis remain poorly understood. In this study, global microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) expression profile on a set of 9 GGs indicated 66 miRNAs to be differentially expressed in GG as compared to normal brain. The differences validated by qRT-PCR indicated microRNA-217 to be the most downregulated. Through insilico analysis, ERK1/2 and casein kinase (CK-2 alpha) were predicted to be miR-217 regulated. As decreased miR-217 expression was concomitant with upregulated ERK1/2 and CK-2 alpha levels in GG; the interplay between these molecules was investigated in primary human neural precursor cells to mimic the glioneuronal characteristics of these tumors. miR-217 over-expression-mediated decrease in pERK, CK-2 alpha, and mGluR1 levels was accompanied with increase in glycogen accumulation. Importantly, increase in miR-217 levels upon CK-2 alpha inhibition indicated inverse correlation between the two. Inhibition of CK-2 alpha also decreased ERK and mGluR1 levels. By demonstrating, for the first time, the existence of miR-217-CK-2 cross talk and its effects on known epileptogenic factors, these findings provide a unique insight into the pathogenesis of ganglioglioma. By highlighting the role of CK-2 in affecting miR-217/ERK/mGluR1 interplay, this study suggests that targeting CK-2 may afford a novel strategy aimed at LEATs.

AB  - Purpose: Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is an inherited optic neuropathy characterized by subacute painless vision loss. The majority of LHON is caused due to one of the three primary mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (m. G3460A, m. G11778A, and m. T14484C). The frequency of these mutations differs in different populations. The purpose of this study is to observe the frequency of three common primary mutations in the North Indian population. Methods: Forty LHON patients within the age group of 10-50 years underwent molecular testing for primary mutations. For two patients, testing for mother and other siblings was also carried out, using bidirectional sequencing. Results: A total of 11 out of 40 (27.5%) patients were found to be carrying m. G11778A mutation. Siblings of two probands were also positive for the same mutation. In one family, two primary mutations (m. G11778A and m. T14484C) were found in the proband and in the mother as well. Conclusion: In this study, 27.5% mutation was detected in North Indian LHON families. These results suggest that m. G11778A mutation is more frequent in this population. The results of the present study are compatible with studies of an Asian population and Northern European population.

TI  - Clinical research training and capacity building for prevention and control of non-communicable diseases: A programme in India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs)-a term which includes diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and mental illness-are now the major cause of death in India and pose healthcare and economic challenges. There is an urgent need for enhanced clinical research training and capacity building for NCD prevention and control in India.
   Methods. We describe a multi-pronged approach funded in part by the US National Institutes of Health Fogarty International Center, which was initiated in 2001, to train Indian present and future scientists/doctors in NCD prevention and control. The approaches used were annual national seminars, intensive training courses, in-house workshops, short-term training sessions in the USA and monthly video conferences.
   Results. During 2001-2016, a total of 3650 undergraduate, postgraduate and faculty from medical colleges and institutes from almost all states in India and several neighbouring countries participated in seminars and other capacity-building workshops held at the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai and at six other medical colleges; 883 delegates participated in the in-house workshops, 463 in the intensive interactive sessions; 244 in workshops on advanced techniques in genomics; and 37 in short-term training sessions held in the USA.
   Conclusion. Through this unique capacity-building programme, more than 5000 individuals representing faculty and students from various medical colleges and research institutes across, and beyond, India, underwent training in the prevention and control of NCDs.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to put forward a novel automatic segmentation algorithm to segment pharyngeal and sino-nasal airway subregions on 3D CBCT imaging datasets.
   A fully automatic segmentation of sino-nasal and pharyngeal airway subregions was implemented in MATLAB programing environment. The novelty of the algorithm is automatic initialization of contours in upper airway subregions. The algorithm is based on boundary definitions of the human anatomy along with shape constraints with an automatic initialization of contours to develop a complete algorithm which has a potential to enhance utility at clinical level. Post-initialization; five segmentation techniques: Chan-Vese level set (CVL), localized Chan-Vese level set (LCVL), Bhattacharya distance level set (BDL), Grow Cut (GC), and Sparse Field method (SFM) were used to test the robustness of automatic initialization.
   Precision and F-score were found to be greater than 80% for all the regions with all five segmentation methods. High precision and low recall were observed with BDL and GC techniques indicating an under segmentation. Low precision and high recall values were observed with CVL and SFM methods indicating an over segmentation. A Larger F-score value was observed with SFM method for all the subregions. Minimum F-score value was observed for naso-ethmoidal and sphenoidal air sinus region, whereas a maximum F-score was observed in maxillary air sinuses region. The contour initialization was more accurate for maxillary air sinuses region in comparison with sphenoidal and naso-ethmoid regions.
   The overall F-score was found to be greater than 80% for all the airway subregions using five segmentation techniques, indicating accurate contour initialization. Robustness of the algorithm needs to be further tested on severely deformed cases and on cases with different races and ethnicity for it to have global acceptance in Katradental radKatraiology workflow.

AB  - In a previous study, we have found that organophosphate (OP) pesticides such as chlorpyrifos (CPF), methyl parathion (MPT), and malathion (MLT) significantly induced genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats. To explore the mechanism of OP-induced genotoxicity, we measured the formation of DNA interstrand cross-links (DICs) and apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats were treated with CPF, MPT, and MLT individually and in combination at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.25 LC50 for 2, 4, 8, and 12 h at 37 degrees C. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was measured as a biomarker of oxidative stress. Apoptosis induced by CPF, MPT, and MLT individually and in combination was determined by measuring the intracellular level of active caspase-3 and caspase-9 by spectrofluorimetry. We found significant dose- and time-dependent increases in LPO, DICs formation and increase of intracellular active caspase-3 and caspase-9 in exposed peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats. These findings suggest that the studied pesticides have potential to induce oxidative stress, cause DNA adduct formation, and cause failure of adduct repair, which leads to apoptosis that is partially mediated by activation of intracellular caspase-3 and caspase-9.

AB  - Background
   The biology of Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), a common cause of epidemic and sporadic hepatitis, is still being explored. HEV exits liver through bile, a process which is essential for its natural transmission by feco-oral route. Though the process of this polarised HEV egress is not known in detail, HEV pORF3 and hepatocyte actin cytoskeleton have been shown to play a role.
   Methods
   Our transcriptome analysis in Hepatitis E virus (HEV) replicon transfected Huh7 cells at 24 and 72 hrs indicated that at 24hrs, both LncBISPR and BST2, expressed by a bidirectional promoter were highly upregulated whereas at 72 hrs, BST2 expression was comparatively reduced accompanied by normal levels of BISPR. These findings were confirmed by qPCR analysis. Co-localisation of BST2 and HEV pORF2 was confirmed in HEV transfected Huh7 by confocal microscopy. To investigate the role of BISPR/BST2 in HEV life cycle, particularly virus egress, we generated Huh7 cells with-8kb deletion in BISPR gene using Crispr-Cas9 system. The deletion was confirmed by PCR screening, Sanger sequencing and Real time PCR. Virus egress in BISPR Huh7 and Huh7 cells was compared by measuring HEV positive strand RNA copy numbers in cell lysates and culture supernatants at 24 and 72 hrs post HEV replicon transfection and further validated by western blot for HEV pORF2 capsid protein.
   Results
   BISPR Huh7 cells showed-8 fold increase in virus egress at 24 hrs compared to Huh7 cells. No significant difference in virus egress was observed at 72hrs. Immunohistochemistry in histologically normal liver and HEV associated acute liver failure revealed BST2 over expression in HEV infected hepatocytes and a dominant canalicular BST2 distribution in normal liver in addition to the cytoplasmic localisation reported in literature.
   Conclusions
   These findings lead us to believe that BISPR and BST2 may regulate egress of HEV virions into bile in vivo. This system may also be used to scale up virus production in vitro.

AB  - Tc-99m-methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m-MDP) bone scintigraphy images have limited number of counts per pixel. A noise filtering method based on local statistics of the image produces better results than a linear filter. However, the mask size has a significant effect on image quality. In this study, we have identified the optimal mask size that yields a good smooth bone scan image. Forty four bone scan images were processed using mask sizes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 pixels. The input and processed images were reviewed in two steps. In the first step, the images were inspected and the mask sizes that produced images with significant loss of clinical details in comparison with the input image were excluded. In the second step, the image quality of the 40 sets of images (each set had input image, and its corresponding three processed images with 3, 5, and 7-pixel masks) was assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians. They selected one good smooth image from each set of images. The image quality was also assessed quantitatively with a line profile. Fisher's exact test was used to find statistically significant differences in image quality processed with 5 and 7-pixel mask at a 5% cut-off. A statistically significant difference was found between the image quality processed with 5 and 7-pixel mask at P=0.00528. The identified optimal mask size to produce a good smooth image was found to be 7 pixels. The best mask size for the John-Sen Lee filter was found to be 7x7 pixels, which yielded Tc-99m-methylene diphosphonate bone scan images with the highest acceptable smoothness.

AB  - Objective: To compare estimates of mean population salt intake in North and South India derived from spot urine samples versus 24-h urine collections.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional survey, participants were sampled from slum, urban and rural communities in North and in South India. Participants provided 24-h urine collections, and random morning spot urine samples. Salt intake was estimated from the spot urine samples using a series of established estimating equations. Salt intake data from the 24-h urine collections and spot urine equations were weighted to provide estimates of salt intake for Delhi and Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh.
   Results: A total of 957 individuals provided a complete 24-h urine collection and a spot urine sample. Weighted mean salt intake based on the 24-h urine collection, was 8.59 (95% confidence interval 7.73-9.45) and 9.46 g/day (8.95-9.96) in Delhi and Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh, respectively. Corresponding estimates based on the Tanaka equation [9.04 (8.63-9.45) and 9.79 g/day (9.62-9.96) for Delhi and Haryana, and Andhra Pradesh, respectively], the Mage equation [8.80 (7.67-9.94) and 10.19 g/day (95% CI 9.59-10.79)], the INTERSALT equation [7.99 (7.61-8.37) and 8.64 g/day (8.04-9.23)] and the INTERSALT equation with potassium [8.13 (7.74-8.52) and 8.81 g/day (8.16-9.46)] were all within 1 g/day of the estimate based upon 24-h collections. For the Toft equation, estimates were 1-2 g/day higher [9.94 (9.24-10.64) and 10.69 g/day (9.44-11.93)] and for the Kawasaki equation they were 3-4 g/day higher [12.14 (11.30-12.97) and 13.64 g/day (13.15-14.12)].
   Conclusion: In urban and rural areas in North and South India, most spot urine-based equations provided reasonable estimates of mean population salt intake. Equations that did not provide good estimates may have failed because specimen collection was not aligned with the original method.

AB  - Background: Lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is a common cause of facial melanosis in the dark-skinned population. At present, information on dermoscopy and patch testing in LPP is limited.
   Objectives: To describe dermoscopic findings and study the role of patch testing in patients with LPP on the face.
   Methods: Facial lesions of 50 patients with LPP were studied dermoscopically, followed by histological evaluation. Patch and photopatch tests with the Indian Standard Series and Scandinavian series, respectively, and patient's own cosmetics were performed on all patients.
   Results: The most common dermoscopic finding was dots and/or globules (43/50, 86%) in different patterns: hem-like (20.9%), arcuate (18.6%), incomplete reticular (39.5%), complete reticular (7%), and not otherwise specified (14%). Other patterns were exaggerated pseudoreticular pattern, accentuation of pigmentation around follicular openings, targetoid appearance, and obliteration of the pigmentary network. There were 26 relevant patch tests in 17 (34%) patients: para-phenylenediamine (n = 5), nickel (n = 3), colophony, perfume mix and fragrance mix (n = 2 each), thiuram mix and 3,3,4,5-tetrachlorosalicylanilide (n = 1 each), and patients' own products (n = 9). The only positive photopatch test was to fentichlor. No clinical or histological finding differed significantly based on patch test results. The only dermoscopic finding to be statistically associated with a positive patch test was the non-characteristic arrangement of dots/globules (P = 0.042).
   Limitations: Dermoscopic features were not correlated with clinical features or disease duration. Implications of patch testing on the management of LPP cannot be commented upon as ours was a cross-sectional study.
   Conclusions: The present study describes the dermoscopic findings of facial lesions in LPP. Our patch test results suggest a probable role of allergens in causing LPP on the face.

AB  - Background & objectives: Earlier reports have shown hypocholesterolaemia in cancer patients and high number of lipid rafts in cancer cells. The primary objective of this study was to compare the intracellular cholesterol turnover in non-cancerous (benign) prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and carcinoma prostate (CAP) with normal prostate cells obtained from patients undergoing radical cystectomy for carcinoma bladder (sham control).
   Methods: ELISA-based estimation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), evaluation of expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and cyclin E, immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, measurement of integrated optical density of the diaminobenzidine (DAB)-stained immunohistograms, isolation of nucleus and cell cytoplasm from prostate tissue by ultracentrifugation followed by estimation of cholesterol spectrophotometrically in isolated nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were performed.
   Results: Seventy five individuals, 25 for each group (BPH n = 25; CAP n = 25 and sham control n = 25), were included in the study. Cholesterol was increased in the cytoplasm and nucleus of the prostate cancer cells along with elevated expression of LDLR. Increased cholesterol concentration in the cell nucleus was found comparable with the increased expression of cholesterol transporter viz. PBR in the prostate tumour tissues as compared to its expression in normal prostate cells obtained from individuals undergoing radical cystectomy for carcinoma bladder. Cell cycle protein cyclin E was also highly expressed in cancer tissues.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The present findings along with increased expression of cell cycle protein cyclin E in the cell nucleus of the tumour tissue suggested the possibility of an intriguing role of cholesterol in the mechanism of cell cycle process of prostate cell proliferation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opinions vary regarding optimal treatment of unstable hangman's fractures, including rigid orthosis and internal fixation. The anatomy of upper cervical spine is complex. The advent of intraoperative 3-dimensional navigation systems facilitates safe and accurate instrumentation.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate radiologic parameters of fracture morphology in unstable hangman's fracture in preoperative and postoperative period and accuracy of inserting axis pedicle screws by using intraoperative computed tomography-based navigation.
   METHODS: Fifteen patients with unstable hangman's fractures with age ranging from 17 years to 81 years were operated using computed tomography-based navigation from September 2011 to march 2016. Patient's age, sex, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, and neurologic status were noted. Clinical outcome, accuracy of screw insertion, preoperative and postoperative displacement, and angulation of C2 over C3 and bony fusion were assessed.
   RESULTS: Overall, 76 screws were inserted including 30 screws in C2 pedicle with 2 (2/60; 6.7%) malplaced screws in C2 pedicle. Mean follow-up period was 34 +/- 18 months (range 7-80 months). Mean hospital stay was 12.8 +/- 2.4 days. Mean preoperative and postoperative displacements were 4.09 mm +/- 1.78 mm and 1.82 mm +/- 1.14 mm respectively with a mean reduction of 2.27 mm +/- 1.49 mm. Mean preoperative angulation was 7.23 degrees +/- 11.96 degrees and postoperative angulation was 2.32 degrees +/- 4.77 degrees with a mean reduction of 5.11 degrees +/- 11.96 degrees. Bony fusion was achieved and rotation was preserved at C1-C2 joint in all cases.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative O-arm-based navigation is a safe, accurate, and effective tool for screw placement in patients with unstable hangman fracture and achieves good anatomical reduction.

AB  - Early and clear recovery from anesthesia is the crux for preventing perioperative complications in the obese undergoing bariatric surgery. Volatile inhalation agents by virtue of high lipid solubility are expected to produce residual anesthetic effects. Prospective randomized trials comparing desflurane and sevoflurane used for anesthesia maintenance (electroencephalograph guided) during bariatric surgery published till 1st of July 2017 were searched in the medical database. Comparisons were made for surrogate markers of recovery from anesthesia that included time to eye-opening (TEo), time to tracheal-extubation (TEx), and Aldrete scores on immediately shifting to recovery (Ald-I). Five trials were included in the final analysis. Patients receiving desflurane began to respond faster by opening eyes on command (five trials) by 3.80 min (95%CI being 1.83-5.76) (random effects, P < 0.01, I-2 = 78.61%), and tracheal extubation was also performed earlier (four trials) by 4.97 min (95%CI being 1.34-8.59). This meant a reduction of 37% in TEo and 33.60% in TEx over sevoflurane. Ald-I scores were higher/better with desflurane by 0.52 (95%CI being 0.19-0.84) (Fixed-effects, P < 0.01, I-2 = 6.67%). Publication bias is likely for TEo (Egger's Test, X-intercept = - 8.57, P = 0.02). No airway-related complications were reported with desflurane's expedited recovery. Use of desflurane compared to sevoflurane for maintenance of anesthesia in morbidly obese patients allows attaining verbal contact faster, and tracheal extubating can be performed earlier without compromising safety. The benefits of better recovery extend into the immediate postoperative phase with patients being more awake upon shifting to the recovery.

AB  - Background: Improving breastfeeding rates is critical. In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), only subtle improvements in breastfeeding rates have been observed over the past decade, which highlights the need for accelerating breastfeeding promotion interventions.
   Objective: The objective of this article is to update evidence on the effect of interventions on early initiation of and exclusive (<1 and 1-5 mo) and continued (6-23 mo) breastfeeding rates in LMICs when delivered in health systems, in the home or in community environments, or in a combination of settings.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and CABI databases to identify new articles relevant to our current review, which were published after the search date of our earlier meta-analysis (October 2014). Nine new articles were found to be relevant and were included, in addition to the other 52 studies that were identified in our earlier meta-analysis. We reported the pooled ORs and corresponding 95% CIs as our outcome estimates. In cases of high heterogeneity, random-effects models were used and causes were explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression.
   Results: Early initiation of and exclusive (<1 and 1-5 mo) and continued (6-23 mo) breastfeeding rates in LMICs improved significantly as a result of interventions delivered in health systems, in the home or community, or a combination of these. Interventions delivered concurrently in a combination of settings were found to show the largest improvements in desired breastfeeding outcomes. Counseling provided in any setting and baby-friendly support in health systems appear to be the most effective interventions to improve breastfeeding.
   Conclusions: Improvements in breastfeeding practices are possible in LMICs with judicious use of tested interventions, particularly when delivered in a combination of settings concurrently. The findings can be considered for inclusion in the Lives Saved Tool model.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the clinical outcomes between sutured transscleral-fixated and intrascleral haptic-fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL).
   Setting: Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.
   Design: A comparative case series.
   Methods: Forty eyes of 40 patients were included; 20 in each group. Patients in group 1 underwent sutured transscleral-fixated IOL and those in group 2 underwent intrascleral haptic-fixated IOL augmented by fibrin glue. Parameters evaluated were uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), central macular thickness (CMT), IOL tilt on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), and pseudophakodonesis on slitlamp and UBM.
   Results: The most common cause of aphakia was complicated cataract surgery (50%). The mean preoperative UCVA in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) was 1.59 +/- 0.24 and 1.63 +/- 0.26 in group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.45). There was significant improvement in UCVA in both groups (P=0.001) at 6 months (group 1: 0.33 +/- 0.17; group 2: 0.22 +/- 0.10); the improvement being greater in group 2 (P < 0.05). Mean percentage endothelial cell loss and IOP change were comparable. Mean CMT (mm) was 250.95 +/- 23.98 and 225.85 +/- 21.13 in group 1 and 2, respectively (P=0.009). Pseudophakodonesis was more in group 1 as assessed on slitlamp (P=0.037) and as assessed on UBM (P=0.046). Macular edema was the most common complication seen more in group 1.
   Conclusions: Intrascleral haptic-fixated IOL provides more stable fixation, better visual outcome, and lesser complication in comparison with sutured transscleral-fixated IOL.

AB  - Objective: Among newer neuroprotectant modalities, hypothermia and progesterone have shown a beneficial role in preliminary studies enrolling patients with severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of progesterone with or without prophylactic hypothermia in acute sTBI patients.
   Materials and Methods: This is a prospective, outcome assessor, statistician blinded, randomized, and placebo-controlled phase II trial of progesterone with or without hypothermia (factorial design). All adult patients (18-65 years) with acute sTBI (Glasgow coma score of 4-8) and presenting to trauma center within 8 h after injury were included in the trial. Computer-generated randomization was done after exclusion; sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope technique was used for allocation concealment. The enrollment duration was from January 2012 to October 2014. The primary endpoint was dichotomized Glasgow outcome score (GOS) [poor recovery = GOS 1-3; good recovery = GOS 4-5], and secondary endpoints were functional independence measure (FIM) score and mortality rate at 6 and 12 months follow-up after recruitment.
   Results: A total of 107 patients were randomized into four groups (placebo [n = 27], progesterone [n = 26], hypothermia alone [n = 27], and progesterone + hypothermia [n = 27]). The study groups were comparable in baseline parameters except for a higher incidence of decompressive craniectomy in the placebo group (P = 0.001). The analysis of GOS at 6 months revealed statistically significant better outcome in the hypothermia group (82%; P = 0.01) and a weaker evidence for progesterone group (74%; P = 0.07) as compared with the placebo group (44%). However, the outcome benefit was marginal at 1-year follow-up for the hypothermia group (82% vs. 58%, P = 0.17). The adjusted odds ratio of poor recovery at 6 months in the hypothermia group was 0.21 (confidence interval = 0.05-0.84, P = 0.03), as compared with the placebo group. Although mean FIM scores at 6 and 12 months respectively were marginally higher in the hypothermia and progesterone groups compared with the placebo group (P = 0.06 and 0.27), the proportion of functionally independent individuals were similar in all the groups (P = 0.79 and 0.51). The mortality rates were similar in all the groups at 6 and 12 months (P = 0.78 and 0.52 respectively).
   Conclusions: A strong evidence for prophylactic hypothermia and a weak evidence for progesterone therapy was observed for a better primary outcome at 6 months as compared to the placebo. A similar trend was observed at a 1-year follow-up. Contrary to our hypothesis, prophylactic hypothermia therapy suppressed the beneficial effects of progesterone therapy in sTBI patients. The complex cascades of factors responsible for such interactions are still unknown and need to be further determined.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the effect of extraretinal proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) on retinal shortening in eyes with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RD) using ultrasound (USG) and objectively prove the presence of intraretinal PVR (iPVR). Methods: This is a double-masked pilot prospective controlled case series. Patients with total RD planned for vitreoretinal surgery were included in the study. USG was used to determine retinal-to-choroidal length ratios (RCRs) in all the quadrants. Group 1 included 10 patients with preoperative PVR more than Grade B while Group 2 had 14 with PVR of Grades A or B. Severe retinal shortening was defined as RCR < 0.8. Primary outcome measures were severe retinal shortening and an early unexplained recurrence of RD within 15 days of surgery. Results: Mean RCRs were significantly low in all the four quadrants of Group 1 upon comparison with Group 2. The mean RCR had a good negative correlation with number of quadrants of PVR (R = -0.66, P <= 0.001). Overall, severe quadrantic retinal shortening was detected in nine patients. In these 9 patients, 11 of the 36 retinal quadrants had severe retinal shortening in the absence of extraretinal PVR (ePVR). Six patients developed early unexplained RD, and all of these belonged to Group 1. Severe quadrantic retinal shortening had the highest odds ratio of developing early unexplained RD (odds ratio = 58, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Retinal shortening occurs both due to ePVR and iPVR, and iPVR occurs independently at least in some cases. Severe quadrantic retinal shortening indicates poor primary anatomical prognoses.

AB  - This report demonstrates the blood flow pattern in a case of choroidal hemangioma (CH) using swept-source-optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA). Fluorescein angiography, SS-OCT, and SS-OCTA images of a patient with CH were obtained using a standard protocol. The internal vascular pattern of the tumor was identified on both OCT and OCTA. Dark areas were identified in the CH. These were interspersed between areas of visible blood flow, as imaged on SS-OCTA. Peripheral vascular arcades were also identified within the tumor. SS-OCTA should be evaluated as an imaging tool to study the blood flow within choroidal tumors.

AB  - Objectives: Arterial switch operation is the treatment of choice in infants with transposed arterial trunks. It is technically challenging to perform in patients having usual atrial arrangement and concordant atrioventricular connections but having a left-sided aorta. Correction in this setting requires surgical expertise and precision. Here we review our experience with such patients. Methods: Between January, 2002 and October, 2013, the arterial switch operation was performed in 20 patients in the combination emphasised above. Patient records were analysed in detail for coronary arterial patterns, and for the techniques used for transfer of the coronary arteries and reconstruction of the great arteries. Outcomes were recorded in terms of in-hospital survival and left ventricular function at the most recent follow-up. Results: All patients survived the procedure. Ages ranged from 3 days to 18 months, with a median of 75 days; the weight of the patients ranged from 3 to 8.8 kg, with a median of 3.85 kg. The LeCompte manoeuvre was performed in only nine patients. The mean cardiopulmonary bypass time was 157.524.9, with a median of 161 minutes, and the mean aortic cross-clamp time was 101.2 +/- 23.8, with a median of 102 minutes. Subsequently, two patients died: the first due to a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation and the second during a crisis of severe pulmonary hypertension. At the last follow-up, which ranged from 23 to 41 months, with a mean of 38.04 +/- 2.32 and a median of 38.4 months, all 18 survivors were in NYHA class I, with none requiring cardiac medications and all having normal bi-ventricular function without residual defects. Conclusion: With appropriate technical modifications, patients with concordant atrioventricular and discordant ventriculo-arterial connections with a left-sided aorta can undergo successful anatomical repair.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the anatomic and haemodynamic data and results of surgery in patients undergoing surgical repair of aortopulmonary window beyond infancy.
   METHODS: Between July 2005 and December 2015, 23 patients, older than 1 year undergoing surgery for aortopulmonary window were analysed retrospectively. Postoperative clinical and echocardiography follow-up were performed.
   RESULTS: Median age and weight at repair was 4 years (range 14 months-12 years) and 12 kg (range 3.5-22 kg), respectively. Fifteen patients had Richardson's Type I, 6 patients had Type II and 2 patients had Type III aortopulmonary window. Six patients had associated defects. Baseline mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure was 101 +/- 14.9 mmHg (range 80-130, median 100 mmHg) and pulmonary vascular resistance index was 9.6 +/- 5.9 (median 7.7 Wood units/m(2), range 3.7-23.5 Wood units/m(2)). Patch repair of aortopulmonary window was performed using the sandwich method (transwindow) (n = 15), transaortic (n = 3) and transpulmonary artery (n = 2) approaches; 2 patients underwent double ligation and 1 underwent division and suturing. Two patients underwent valved patch closure of aortopulmonary window and 1 patient underwent valved patch closure of associated ventricular septal defect. There were 2 in-hospital deaths: one due to intractable pulmonary hypertension and the other due to low cardiac output. Mean follow-up was 36 months (range 2-119 months). Eighteen patients were in NYHA Class I at last follow-up. There were no late deaths or reoperation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery can be safely undertaken beyond infancy in carefully selected patients of aortopulmonary window with acceptable early and mid-term outcomes.

AB  - Breast and cervical cancer are the two most common cancers in female. However, owing to the contrasting risk factors, synchronous breast and cervical cancer has very rarely been reported. However, noncommunicable disease like cardiovascular disease and different infections has tended to make situations complicated because of complex interaction. In recent years, such cases are being seen frequently and their management is challenging. We report such a case of synchronous breast and cervical cancer complicated by HIV infection and myocardial infarction. This highlights the importance of a wide spectrum of clinical knowledge and skill and interdisciplinary coordination.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the intraoperative complications observed during the initial learning curve of small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and their management.
   Methods: Prospective evaluation of 100 consecutive eyes (50 patients) undergoing SMILE was performed at an apex tertiary care ophthalmic center. Patients older than 18 years with a stable refractive error ranging from -1.0 to -10.0 D myopia and up to 3.0 D astigmatism were included. Any intraoperative complications and their management were noted. Postoperative examination including visual acuity was performed on day 1, 1 week, and 1 month.
   Results: Intraoperative difficulties observed in the initial 100 eyes included suction loss (2%), black spots (11%), opaque bubble layer (19%), epithelial defect (2%), and difficult lenticule extraction (9%). Difficult lenticule dissection and extraction was the most surgically challenging step and resulted in posterior stromal damage, anterior cap tear (1%), side-cut tears (4%), partially retained lenticule (1%), and completely retained lenticule (2%). Its incidence decreased from 16% (8/50) in the initial 50 cases to 2% (1/50) in the next 50 cases. Two eyes with completely retained lenticule were re-treated with flap-based excimer laser ablation after 3 months. Optimal visual and anatomical outcomes could be achieved, and no sight-threatening complication was observed in any case.
   Conclusions: The learning curve of SMILE is surgically challenging. Lenticule dissection and extraction is the most difficult step and leads to a multitude of complications. Most complications that result in delayed visual recovery are observed in the initial 50 cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report successful lenticule extraction using intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) in a case of cap-lenticule adhesion during small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
   METHODS: Case report.
   RESULTS: A 22-year-old patient with a refractive error of -5.00 -0.50 x 120 degrees and -5.00 -0.75 x 60 degrees in the right and left eyes, respectively, was scheduled for SMILE. The lenticule was created using the VisuMax femtosecond laser system (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany). The surgeon experienced difficulty while extracting the lenticule in the right eye. The patient was immediately shifted under the surgical microscope integrated with intraoperative OCT. The lenticule was found to be adherent to the anterior stromal cap, which was seen as hyperreflective spikes in the posterior plane, in contrast to the anterior plane, which showed minimal reflectivity, suggesting an inadvertent posterior plane entry. The peripheral edge of the lenticule was lifted from the anterior stromal cap under direct visualization of intraoperative feedback images provided by intraoperative OCT. The edge of the lenticule, which was freed, was then grasped with microforceps and extracted in toto using the continuous curvilinear lenticulerrhexis technique. At the end of surgery, the intrastromal pocket was screened under intraoperative OCT for any lenticule remnants. One week after surgery, the uncorrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 with smooth, regular interface on anterior segment optical coherence tomography.
   CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative OCT is useful in cases of difficult lenticule extraction during SMILE because it provides real-time visualization of the lenticule and helps in discerning its relation with the anterior stromal cap and the underlying stromal bed. By using intraoperative OCT and the continuous curvilinear lenticulerrhexis technique, satisfactory anatomical and visual outcomes were obtained.

AB  - Isolated Growth hormone deficiency is an important and treatable cause of short stature. However, it is often difficult to diagnose the condition with certainty due to the lack of a single robust diagnostic test. Short children, other than those with the classical phenotype of immature chubby facies, truncal obesity and micropenis in boys, or those with history of cranial lesions with known association with hypopituitarism, should be evaluated for growth hormone deficiency only after excluding the other more common conditions. These children typically have height markedly below that expected for their midparental height with low height velocity and delayed bone age. Growth hormone levels should be checked by provocative testing, after ensuring that the child is euthyroid, and after priming with sex steroids if indicated. Low levels of Insulin-like growth factor 1 and Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 and pituitary abnormalities on neuroimaging provide important corroborative evidence to the diagnosis.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of guideline was to provide clear and relevant consensus statements to form a practical guideline for clinicians on the indications, optimal technique, safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound guided celiac plexus neurolysis (EUS-CPN). Methods: Six important clinical questions were determined regarding EUS-CPN. Following a detailed literature review, 6 statements were proposed attempting to answer those questions. A group of expert endosonographers convened in Chicago, United States (May 2016), where the statements were presented and feedback provided. Subsequently a consensus group of 35 expert endosonographers voted based on their individual level of agreement. A strong recommendation required 80% voter agreement. The modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) criteria were used to rate the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. Results: Eighty percent agreement was reached on 5 of 6 consensus statements, 79.4% agreement was reached on the remaining one. Conclusions: EUS-CPN is efficacious, should be integrated into the management of pancreas cancer pain, and can be considered early at the time of diagnosis of inoperable disease. Techniques may still vary based on operator experience. Serious complications exist, but are rare.

AB  - Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) acts as a sliding clamp to support DNA replication and repair. The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73 A resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37 A. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42 about the pore axis and shifted by 7 A and tilted by 16 along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32 A. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-ArgSer-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala-Arg-Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser-Arg-Lys-Tyr- Gly-Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186-Gly-Val-Ser-Asp-Arg 224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226. The enhanced length of this segment in LdPCNA may influence its mode of interaction with DNA and other proteins. The dissociation constants obtained using real time binding studies with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for two peptides, LysArg-Arg-Gln-Thr-Ser-Met-Thr-Asp-Phe-Tyr-His (P1) from human cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-1(CKI-1) and Lys-Thr-Gln-Gly-Arg-Leu-Asp-Ser-Phe-Phe-Thr-Val (P2) from flap endonuclease 1 (Fen-1) as well as with two small molecule inhibitors, (S)-4-(4-(2-amino-3-hydroxypropyl)-2, 6-diiodophenoxy) phenol hydrochloride (ADPH) and N-(3-methylthiophene-2-carboxylicacid)-N'-((3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenyl) methylene) hydrazide (MCMH) are 0.29 +/- 0.09 mu M, 0.37 +/- 0.08 mu M, 0.35 +/- 0.09 mu M and 1.20 +/- 0.0.8 mu M respectively. The corresponding values obtained using fluorescence spectroscopic methods were 0.22 +/- 0.06 OA, 0.68 +/- 0.07 mu M, 0.44 +/- 0.07 mu M and 0.75 +/- 0.05 mu M respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Neurosurgical treatment may improve seizures in children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy, but additional data are needed from randomized trials.
   METHODS
   In this single-center trial, we randomly assigned 116 patients who were 18 years of age or younger with drug-resistant epilepsy to undergo brain surgery appropriate to the underlying cause of epilepsy along with appropriate medical therapy (surgery group, 57 patients) or to receive medical therapy alone (medical-therapy group, 59 patients). The patients in the medical-therapy group were assigned to a waiting list for surgery. The primary outcome was freedom from seizures at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were the score on the Hague Seizure Severity scale, the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient, the social quotient on the Vineland Social Maturity Scale, and scores on the Child Behavior Checklist and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.
   RESULTS
   At 12 months, freedom from seizures occurred in 44 patients (77%) in the surgery group and in 4 (7%) in the medical-therapy group (P<0.001). Between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months significantly favored surgery with respect to the score on the Hague Seizure Severity scale (difference, 19.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.8 to 23.1; P<0.001), on the Child Behavior Checklist (difference, 13.1; 95% CI, 10.7 to 15.6; P<0.001), on the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (difference, 21.9; 95% CI, 16.4 to 27.6; P<0.001), and on the Vineland Social Maturity Scale (difference, 4.7; 95% CI, 0.4 to 9.1; P = 0.03), but not on the Binet-Kamat intelligence quotient (difference, 2.5; 95% CI, -0.1 to 5.1; P = 0.06). Serious adverse events occurred in 19 patients (33%) in the surgery group, including hemiparesis in 15 (26%).
   CONCLUSIONS
   In this single-center trial, children and adolescents with drug-resistant epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery had a significantly higher rate of freedom from seizures and better scores with respect to behavior and quality of life than did those who continued medical therapy alone at 12 months. Surgery resulted in anticipated neurologic deficits related to the region of brain resection.

AB  - Hemoglobin degradation/hemozoin formation, essential steps in the Plasmodium life cycle, are targets of existing antimalarials. The pathway still offers vast possibilities to be explored for new antimalarial discoveries. Here, we characterize heme detoxification protein, PfHDP, a major protein involved in hemozoin formation, as a novel drug target. Using in silico and biochemical approaches, we identified two heme binding sites and a hemoglobin binding site in PfHDP. Treatment of Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 parasites with peptide corresponding to the hemoglobin binding domain in PfHDP resulted in food vacuole abnormalities similar to that seen with a cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64 (I-1). Screening of compounds that bound the modeled PfHDP structure in the heme/hemoglobin-binding pockets from Maybridge Screening Collection identified a compound, ML-2, that inhibited parasite growth in a dose-dependent manner, thus paving the way for testing its potential as a new drag candidate. These results provide functional insights into the role of PfHDP in Hz formation and further suggest that PfHDP could be an important drug target to combat malaria.

KW  - HEPATITIS
AB  - There is a paucity of health policy relevant data for chronic liver disease from India, impeding formulation of an interventional strategy to address the issue. A prospective, multicentric study to delineate the etiology and clinical profile of chronic liver disease in India is reported here. A centrally coordinated and monitored web-based data repository was developed (Feb, 2010 to Jan, 2013) and analyzed. Eleven hospitals from different parts of India participated. Data were uploaded into a web based proforma and monitored by a single centre according to a standardized protocol. 1.28% (n = 266621) of all patients (n = 20701383) attending the eleven participating hospitals of India had liver disease. 65807 (24.68%) were diagnosed for the first time (new cases). Of these, 13014 (19.77%, median age 43 years, 73% males) cases of chronic liver disease were finally analyzed. 33.9% presented with decompensated cirrhosis. Alcoholism (34.3% of 4413) was the commonest cause of cirrhosis while Hepatitis B (33.3%) was predominant cause of chronic liver disease in general and noncirrhotic chronic liver disease (40.8% out of 8163). There was significant interregional differences (hepatitis C in North, hepatitis B in East and South, alcohol in North-east, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in West) in the predominant cause of chronic liver disease. Hepatitis B (46.8% of 438 cases) was the commonest cause of hepatocellular Cancer. 11.7% had diabetes. Observations of our study will help guide a contextually relevant liver care policy for India and could serve as a framework for similar endeavor in other developing countries as well.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the role of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the treatment of advanced dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using multifocal electroretinogram (mf-ERG) and fundus autofluorescence imaging.
   METHODS: Thirty patients (60 eyes) with bilateral central geographic atrophy (GA) were recruited. Worse eye of each patient received autologous bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells (BM-HSCs) (group 1) and the fellow eye with better visual acuity served as control (group 2). The effect of stem cell therapy was determined in terms of visual acuity, amplitude and implicit time in mf-ERG and size of GA on fundus autofluorescence imaging. These tests were performed at presentation and first, third and sixth month follow up. Adverse events (if any) were also monitored.
   RESULTS: At 6mo follow-up there was no statistically significant improvement in median logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in either group. Mf-ERG revealed significant improvement in amplitude and implicit time in the intervention group. A significant decrease was also noted in greatest linear dimension (GLD) of GA in the eyes receiving stem cells [6.78 +/- 2.60 mm at baseline to 6.56 +/- 2.59 mm at 6mo (P=0.021)]. However, no such improvement was noted in the control group.
   CONCLUSION: Electrophysiological and anatomical improvement in the intervention group sheds light on the therapeutic role of BM-HSCs. Further studies are required to determine the stage of disease at which the maximal benefit can be achieved and to standardize the dose and frequency of stem cell injection.

AB  - The prokaryotic ATP-dependent ClpP protease, localized in the relict plastid of malaria parasite, represents a potential drug target. In the present study, we utilized in silico structure-based screening and medicinal chemistry approaches to identify a novel pyrimidine series of compounds inhibiting P. falciparum ClpP protease activity and evaluated their antiparasitic activities. Structure-activity relationship indicated that morpholine moiety at C2, an aromatic substitution at N3 and a 4-oxo moiety on the pyrimidine are important for potent inhibition of ClpP enzyme along with antiparasiticidal activity. Compound 33 exhibited potent antiparasitic activity (EC50 9.0 +/- 0.2 mu M), a 9-fold improvement over the antiparasitic activity of the hit molecule 6. Treatment of blood stage P. falciparum cultures with compound 33 caused morphological and developmental abnormalities in the parasites; further, compound 33 treatment hindered apicoplast development indicating the targeting of apicoplast.

AB  - Background and purpose: Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent but now-a-days its usage is limited in clinical chemotherapy because of its severe nephrotoxic effect on renal tissues. Galangin, a flavonoid obtained from ginger family has been demonstrated to have antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties. This study is aimed to investigate the possible ameliorative effect of galangin in a rodent model of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.
   Material and methods: Adult male albino wistar rats were divided into six groups (n=6) viz normal, cisplatin-control, galangin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg p.o.) and per se (100 mg/kg galangin, p.o.). Galangin was administrated orally to the rats for a period of 10 days. On the 7th day of the treatment, nephrotoxicity was induced in all the groups by a single dose of cisplatin (8 mg/kg, i.p.) (except normal and per se group). On the 11th day, the rats were anaesthetized and blood was withdrawn via direct heart puncture for biochemical estimation. Rats were sacrificed and kidneys were isolated and preserved for evaluation of histopathological, ultra structural immunohistochemical studies and western blot analysis.
   Results: Cisplatin significantly impaired renal function and increased oxidative stress and inflammation. It also increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and caspase-3 and decreased the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Histological and ultrastructural findings were also supportive of renal tubular damage. Pretreatment with galangin (100 mg/kg p.o.) preserved renal function, morphology, suppressed oxidative stress, inflammation and the activation of apoptotic pathways. TUNEL assay showed decreased DNA fragmentation on galangin pre-treatment. Furthermore, galangin (100 mg/kg) pre-treatment also reduced the expression of NF kappa B along with proteins MAPK pathway i.e. p38, JNK and ERK1/2.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, Galangin (100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly ameliorated cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity by suppressing MAPK induced inflammation and

AB  - Telomerase is a Reverse Transcriptase that maintains the telomere length. It is absent in most somatic cells but is found in stem cells, germ cells and around 90% of cancers. It plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining cancer cells. Telomerase, a HLA class-I antigen, is able to stimulate cell mediated immune response by inducing cytotoxic T-cells. This property of telomerase is being exploited in targeting cancers by host's own immune responses; stimulated by various Human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT) derived vaccines. Many approaches and studies including clinical trials have shown effective anticancer responses of these vaccines, without toxicity to non cancer cells. In this article we have compiled different hTERT based anticancer immunotherapy approaches, vaccines and their performances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2017, WHO convened a working group of global experts to develop the Preferred Product Characteristics (PPC) for Next-Generation Influenza Vaccines. PPCs are intended to encourage innovation in vaccine development. They describe WHO preferences for parameters of vaccines, in particular their indications, target groups, implementation strategies, and clinical data needed for assessment of safety and efficacy. PPCs are shaped by the global unmet public health need in a priority disease area for which WHO encourages vaccine development. These preferences reflect WHO's mandate to promote the development of vaccines with high public health impact and suitability in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The target audience is all entities intending to develop or to achieve widespread adoption of a specific influenza vaccine product in these settings. The working group determined that existing influenza vaccines are not well suited for LMIC use. While many developed country manufactures and research funders prioritize influenza vaccine products for use in adults and the elderly, most LMICs do not have sufficiently strong health systems to deliver vaccines to these groups. Policy makers from LMICs are expected to place higher value on vaccines indicated for prevention of severe illness, however the clinical development of influenza vaccines focuses on demonstrating prevention of any influenza illness. Many influenza vaccine products do not meet WHO standards for programmatic suitability of vaccines, which introduces challenges when vaccines are used in low-resource settings. And finally, current vaccines do not integrate well with routine immunization programs in LMICs, given age of vaccine licensure, arbitrary expiration dates timed for temperate country markets, and the need for year-round immunization in countries with prolonged influenza seasonality. While all interested parties should refer to the full PPC document for details, in this article we highlight data needs for new influenza vaccines to better demonstrate the value proposition in LMICs.

AB  - Prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) varies in India; up to one-third of the urban population is affected by the disease. In Asian Indians, presence of NAFLD is driven by multiple factors presence of excess abdominal fat (abdominal subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat) and lifestyle factors (imbalanced diets and physical inactivity), and it is correlated closely with insulin resistance, the metabolic syndrome and dysglycaemia in the background of genetic predisposition (investigated genes in Asian Indians: APOC3, PNPLA-3, PPAR., SREBP-2, adiponectin, SAMM50, PARVB and PZP). Recent studies also show that presence of NAFLD independently correlates with subclinical inflammation and surrogate markers of atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness, impaired flow-mediated vasodilatation) in Asian Indians. A prediction equation (Indian Fatty Liver Index) which includes simple measures has been developed for Asian Indians. On the other hand, increased (more than 15.6 cm) liver span (surrogate marker of fatty liver), in a preliminary study, predicted diabetes in non-obese Asian Indians. Dietary factors are important for the development of NAFLD, and some evidence indicates that regular use of high monounsaturated fatty acid rich oils, and low amount of saturated fat intake are beneficial.

AB  - Early life factors encompassing parental, foetal and postnatal characteristics, have an important influence on individual disease risk. Of particular importance is the role of maternal lifetime nutrition and metabolic reserves, and the impact on offspring birth outcomes. Birth weight, in turn, affects disease risk in later life. Being born small and showing rapid weight gain during childhood are especially important risk determinants for impaired glucose tolerance, higher blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, overweight and obesity in later life. Postnatal growth patterns, socio-environmental factors and genetic influences thus act in concert to increase the predilection for chronic diseases, including type-2 diabetes.

AB  - Interleukin 9 (IL-9)-producing helper T (Th9) cells have a crucial function in allergic inflammation, autoimmunity, immunity to extracellular pathogens and anti-tumor immune responses. In addition to Th9, Th2, Th17 and Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells produce IL-9. A transcription factor that is critical for IL-9 induction in Th2, Th9 and Th17 cells has not been identified. Here we show that the forkhead family transcription factor Foxo1 is required for IL-9 induction in Th9 and Th17 cells. We further show that inhibition of AKT enhances IL-9 induction in Th9 cells while it reciprocally regulates IL-9 and IL-17 in Th17 cells via Foxo1. Mechanistically, Foxo1 binds and transactivates IL-9 and IRF4 promoters in Th9, Th17 and iTreg cells. Furthermore, loss of Foxo1 attenuates IL-9 in mouse and human Th9 and Th17 cells, and ameliorates allergic inflammation in asthma. Our findings thus identify that Foxo1 is essential for IL-9 induction in Th9 and Th17 cells.

AB  - Purpose: The potential of diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in assessing pathologic response and surgical margins in locally advanced breast cancer patients (n = 38) undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy was investigated. Methods: DWI was performed at pre-therapy (Tp0), after I (Tpl) and III (Tp3) NACT at 1.5 T. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of whole tumor (ADC(WT)), solid tumor (ADC(ST)), intra-tumoral necrosis (ADC(Nec)) was determined. Further, ADC of 6 consecutive shells (5 mm thickness each) including tumor margin to outside tumor margins (OM1 to OM5) was calculated and the data analyzed to define surgical margins.
   Results: Of 38 patients, 6 were pathological complete responders (pCR), 19 partial responders (pPR) and 13 were non-responders (pNR). Significant increase was observed in ADC(ST) and ADC(wr) in pCR and pPR following therapy. Pre-therapy ADC was significantly lower in pCR compared to pPR and pNR indicating the heterogeneous nature of tumor which may affect drug perfusion and consequently the response. ADC of outside margins (OM1, OM2, and OM3) was significantly different among pCR, pPR and pNR at Tp3 which may serve as response predictive parameter. Further, at Tp3, ADC of outside margins (OM1, OM2, and OM3) was significantly lower compared to that seen at Tp0 in pCR, indicating the presence of residual disease in these shells.
   Conclusion: Pre-surgery information may serve as a guide to define cancer free margins and the extent of residual disease which may be useful in planning breast conservation surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A very low 5-year survival rate among hepatocelluHar carcinoma (HCC) patients is mainly due to lack of early stage diagnosis, distant metastasis and high risk of postoperative recurrence. Hence ascertaining novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and patient specific therapeutics is crucial and urgent. Here, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression data of 423 HCC patients (373 tumors and 50 controls) downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TOGA) followed by pathway enrichment by gene ontology annotations, subtype classification and overall survival analysis. The differential gene expression analysis using non-parametric Wilcoxon test revealed a total of 479 up-regulated and 91 down-regulated genes in HCC compared to controls. The list of top differentially expressed genes mainly consists of tumor/cancer associated genes, such as AFP, THBS4, LCN2, GPC3, NUF2, etc. The genes over-expressed in HCC were mainly associated with cell cycle pathways. In total, 59 kinases associated genes were found over expressed in HCC, including TTK, MELK, BUB1, NEK2, BUB1B, AURKB, PLK1, CDK1, PKMYT1, PBK, etc. Overall four distinct HCC subtypes were predicted using consensus clustering method. Each subtype was unique in terms of gene expression, pathway enrichment and median survival. Conclusively, this study has exposed a number of interesting genes which can be exploited in future as potential markers of HCC, diagnostic as well as prognostic and subtype classification may guide for improved and specific therapy.

AB  - The literature on resolution of intestinal strictures in patients with intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) after anti-tuberculous therapy (ATT) is sparse and ambivalent. We aimed to assess the frequency of stricture resolution after ATT and its predictors.
   This ambispective cohort study included consecutive ITB patients with strictures who received ATT for ae<yen>6 months and were on regular follow-up between January 2004 and December 2015. Resolution of stricture was assessed at the end of ATT by endoscopy/radiology.
   Of 286 patients, 128 had strictures, and 106 were finally included (63 males, median age 35 years). The stricture location was distal ileum/ileocecal in 52 (49.1%), colon in 37 (34.9%), ileocolonic in 4 (3.8%), proximal small bowel in 10 (9.4%), and gastroduodenal in 4 (3.8%) patients. Although all patients demonstrated mucosal healing (indicating resolution of active infection), stricture resolution occurred only in 25/106 (23.6%) patients. Symptoms pertaining to stricture (pain abdomen/recurrent SAIO) were present in 104/106 (98%) patients, and after a median of 6 (6-9) months of ATT, these symptoms resolved only in half, 88% (22/25) in patients with stricture resolution and 38% (30/79) in patients with persistent strictures. Colonic strictures had the least resolution (5.4%) followed by proximal small intestinal (20%) and distal ileal/ileocecal (36.5%). Although not statistically significant, stricture resolution was less frequent in patients with multiple strictures, longer strictures (> 3 cm), and strictures in which scope was not negotiable prior to ATT.
   Only one-fourth of ITB patients with strictures show resolution of stricture following ATT. The resolution of strictures is dependent on disease location, and majority of them exhibit symptoms pertaining to stricture even after ATT.

AB  - Neuromediators produced by enteric nervous system regulate inflammatory processes via interacting with enteric immune system. Role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also a neuromediator, has been implicated in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis, where they modulate the immune responses. However, its role in ulcerative colitis (UC) has not been defined.
   This study was carried out to investigate the role of GABA and its signaling components in pathogenesis of UC.
   Peripheral blood, colon mucosal biopsy, and fecal specimens were collected from UC and control groups. Quantification of GABA was done using ELISA. Expression of GABAergic signal system components was analyzed through RT-PCR analysis. Enumeration of GABA-producing bacteria was done by qPCR analysis. Activity of p38 MAPK and expression of proinflammatory cytokines were determined by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR analysis, respectively.
   GABA levels were significantly reduced in patients with UC as compared to control group when measured in serum and colon biopsy. Altered expression of GABAergic signal system was observed in UC patients. Reduced abundance of selected GABA-producing bacteria was detected in stool samples of UC patients as compared to control. p38 MAPK activity and expression of its downstream effector cytokines were found to be increased in UC patients as compared to control.
   Reduced levels of GABA were observed in patients with UC, and this leads to hyperactivation of p38 MAPK and overexpression of downstream effector cytokines suggesting a role of GABA in pathogenesis of UC.

AB  - Pro-inflammatory signal generated from the interaction of oxLDL with its cognate receptor LOX-1 has been attenuated successfully by a novel combination siRNA (siLOX-1(Omega)) targeting unique regions of Homo sapien LOX- 1 mRNA. Signalling via LOX-1R was studied in a potentially pro-atherogenic arena recreated in a metabolic, pulse-chase set up. An initial pulse of oxLDL (20 mu g/mL;5 h) was chased (without oxLDL) on a temporal scale upto 72 h. Our study shows that the pro-inflammatory signal generated via oxLDL-LOX-1R interaction was mediated in two rungs, an initial sustained increase in LOX-1R expression up to 12 h, and a renewal after 48 h. TNF-alpha acted as a primary mediator of LOX-1R signalling, presumably also stimulating CD40 and MMP-9. Both TNF-alpha and IL-6 were involved in the second rung of LOX-1R signalling; maximum secretion of both was detected at 48 h. Our study suggests a temporal sustenance of LOX-1R signalling by pro-inflammatory cytokines even on withdrawal of oxLDL. Also, siLOX-1(Omega) successfully abated LOX-1R expression along with its signalling inter mediates, NO and NF-kB. Overall, LOX-1 signalling and the crucial role of cytokines in sustaining it is reported. Attenuation of this receptor may be of therapeutic value in atherosclerosis.

AB  - Juvenile systemic sclerosis (JSSc) is a rare disorder with paucity of information on its treatment and longterm outcome. Herein, we are sharing our experience with this rare entity. Case records of children, diagnosed to have systemic sclerosis attending Pediatric Rheumatology Clinic at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from January 1998 to June 2016 were reviewed. The demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcome details were recorded. Disease outcome was classified arbitrarily as controlled, partly controlled or non-responsive/progressive based on: (A) ability to perform activities of daily life (ADL) and (B) presence or absence of musculoskeletal symptoms, skin changes (ulceration/progressive digital pitting/gangrene), and visceral organ involvement (dyspahgia, cardiopulmonary symptoms). Controlled: ability to perform ADL and absence of B features for at least 6 months. Partly controlled: inability to perform ADL or any of the B features. Non-responsive/progressive disease: presence of both A and any of B features. Thirty-two children (21, girls) diagnosed as systemic sclerosis for whom follow-up of more than 6 months was available were included for this retrospective analysis. Mean (SD) age at presentation was 112.79 (30.05) months, while the median (IQR) delay in diagnosis was 28.5 (9-47.25) months. Of the 32 children 17 (53.12%) had diffuse systemic sclerosis (dSSc), 5 (15.62%) had limited systemic sclerosis (lSSc) and 10 (31.25%) had sclerosis with overlap syndrome. The common clinical features apart from sclerosis/induration proximal to metacarpophalangeal joint were Raynauds phenomenon (n = 22, 68.7%), skin rash (n = 20, 62%), arthritis or arthralgia (n = 16, 50%), and muscular weakness (n = 10, 31.2%). Among those for whom data regarding investigations were available; ANA was positive in 50% (12/24), whereas Anti Scl70 was positive in one out three cases. Treatment regimen included naproxen, methotrexate, calcium channel blockers with or without steroids. HCQ was added in children with skin rash or in children with partial control. Median (IQR) follow-up period was 19.75 (12-31.75) months. With the above treatment protocol, 19 (59.3%) children achieved disease control on treatment, 8 (26.6%) had partial control while 5 (16.6%) showed no response or progressive disease. Esophageal dysmotility and intertitial lung disease (ILD) were documented in three children each. Complication (cataract and herpes zoster) related to immunosuppressive therapy were observed in two children. There was no mortality during the study period. Juvenile Sclerosis though rare is associated with significant morbidities and lacks a curative treatment but a reasonable quality of life to perform daily activities can be achieved using methotrexate and steroid-based immuosuppressive therapy.

AB  - Antithrombin III (AT) is the most important endogenous anticoagulant, and genetic variability in SERPINC1, gene encoding AT, is low. Mutations leading to AT deficiency and increased thrombotic risk are well known; however, only 2 studies have reported mutations in regulatory region of SERPINC1 gene till date. Aim of the present study was to identify genetic variations in SERPINC1 5 ' untranslated region (UTR) in Indian patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) having AT deficiency. DNA sequencing was used to identify underlying genetic defects in SERPINC1 regulatory region. In silico tools TFBIND and PROMO were used to identify transcription factor binding sites in the promoter region. We have identified 2 novel polymorphisms, g.25G > A and g.-1A > T, and 2 known g.67G > A and rs3138521 5 ' UTR polymorphisms in SERPINC1 regulatory region in Indian patients with DVT for the first time. In present study, allele frequencies of rs3138521 (S: 0.37 and F: 0.63) were similar to that reported in Western population and were not associated with low plasma AT levels (P value .5). This is the first report of regulatory region polymorphisms in SERPINC1 gene in Indian population. Our results strongly suggest that similar studies should be included when ever no mutation is detected in protein-coding region of AT gene.

AB  - There are many obstacles in the transport of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor cells that lead to irregular and non-uniform uptake of drugs inside tumors. The study of these transport problems will help with accurate prediction of drug transport and optimizing treatment strategy. To this end, liposome mediated drug delivery has emerged as an excellent anticancer therapy due to its ability to deliver drugs at site of action and reducing the chances of side effects to the healthy tissues. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model based on realistic vasculature of human brain tumor is presented. This model utilizes dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data to account for heterogeneity in tumor vasculature. Porosity of the interstitial space inside the tumor and normal tissue is determined voxel-wise by processing the DCE-MRI images by general tracer kinetic model (GTKM). The CFD model is applied to predict transport of two different types of liposomes (stealth and conventional) in tumors. The amount of accumulated liposomes is compared with accumulated free drug (doxorubicin) in the interstitial space. Simulation results indicate that stealth liposomes accumulate more and remain for longer periods of time in tumors as compared with conventional liposomes and free drug. The present model provides us a qualitative and quantitative examination on the transport and deposition of liposomes as well as free drugs in actual human brain tumors.

AB  - Exposure to global hypoxia and ischemia has been reported to cause neurodegeneration in the hippocampus with CA3 neurons. This neuronal damage is progressive during the initial phase of exposure but maintains a plateau on prolonged exposure. The present study on Sprague Dawley rats aimed at understanding the underlying molecular and epigenetic mechanisms that lead to hypoxic adaptation of CA3 neurons on prolonged exposure to a global hypoxia. Our results show stagnancy in neurodegeneration in CA3 region beyond 14 days of chronic exposure to hypobaria simulating an altitude of 25,000 ft. Despite increased synaptosomal glutamate and higher expression of NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors, we observed decrease in post-synaptic density and accumulation of synaptic vesicles at the pre-synaptic terminals. Molecular investigations involving western blot and real-time PCR showed duration-dependent decrease in the expression of SNAP-25 resulting in reduced vesicular docking and synaptic remodeling. ChIP assays for epigenetic factors showed decreased expression of H3K9Ac and H3K14Ac resulting in SNAP-25 promoter silencing during prolonged hypoxia. Administration of sodium butyrate, a non-specific HDAC inhibitor, during 21 days hypoxic exposure prevented SNAP-25 downregulation but increased CA3 neurodegeneration. This epigenetic regulation of SNAP-25 promoter was independent of increased DNMT3b expression and promoter methylation. Our findings provide a novel insight into epigenetic factors-mediated synaptic remodeling to prevent excitotoxic neurodegeneration on prolonged exposure to global hypobaric hypoxia.

AB  - AimIn multiple myeloma (MM), the growth and survival of myeloma cells is controlled by interleukin-6 (IL-6), the plasma levels of which is controlled by a guanine/cytosine substitution occurring in position -174 of IL-6 gene promoter region. We studied the occurrence of IL-6-174 G/C polymorphism in patients of MM and correlated the presence of genotypes with serum IL-6 levels and tumor staging.
   MethodsOne hundred three patients with MM and 117 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were staged by International Staging System. IL-6 genotypes were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme analysis. Serum levels of IL-6 were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   ResultsFrequency of GG, GC and CC genotypes did not differ significantly between cases (GG 52%, GC 40%, CC 9%) and controls. The median serum level of IL-6 was significantly higher among the GC genotype versus other genotypes (24ng/mL, P=0.007) as compared with the GG versus other genotypes (12ng/mL, P=0.001). GC was associated more with stage 3 disease (27%) than was GG (11%) or CC (22% P=0.001).
   ConclusionsAt position 174 of the IL-6 promoter, patients with GC genotype had higher serum levels of IL-6 and presented with more severe disease compared with patients with GG or CC genotype.

AB  - Objectives: Patients with drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) and a high level of education may differ in their language recovery after surgery. Our aim was to determine whether there were differences in the extent of improvement and pattern of reorganization of language functions on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after surgery to treat refractory temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) between patients with more than 12 years of formal education versus those with a shorter period of regular schooling.
   Methods: After approval by an institutional ethics committee, 60 right-handed, adult patients of left TLE and 20 right-handed, healthy controls were recruited to the study. Multiple aspects of language (Repetition, Naming, Word fluency, Visual word and Comprehension reading) were tested using the Indian Aphasia Battery (IAB) in the Hindi language; fMRI was performed using a standardized Hindi language paradigm (lexical, semantic, syntactic and comprehension components) in both cases and controls, before and after an anterior temporal lobectomy (in cases) with a 1.5 T MR Scanner. An array of performance tests of intelligence and the verbal adult intelligence scale (VAIS) were used to measure the Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Left TLE (LTLE) patients before and after surgery. Language laterality was estimated using the laterality index (LI-toolbox-spm8). Cohen's d test was performed to determine the effect sizes of the differences in the JAB scores, and Pearson's correlation was applied between regional (IFG and STG) activation in controls and TLE patients with more than 12 years of schooling [higher educational status (HES subgroup)] and those with less than 12 years of schooling [lower educational status (LES subgroup)].
   Results: At the baseline, clinical testing with JAB showed better scores in controls than in cases. Better scores were observed in subjects with higher levels of education than in those with lower levels of education. An improvement was observed in IQ scores in both the HES and LES groups after ATLR; significant worsening in the abstract ability subtest was noted in the LES group, whereas in the HES group there was an improvement. Blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) activation during language tasks was observed in both cerebral hemispheres in the TLE cases, while it was observed in the traditional left hemispheric language areas in controls. Postoperatively, greater BOLD activation was observed in the left inferior frontal gyri (IFG, r = 0.65*; p < 0.05), middle frontal gyrus (MFG, r = 0.77**; p < 0.01) superior temporal gyri (STG, r = 0.88* p < 0.02) and angular gyrus (AG, r = 0.73*; p < 0.04) in HES compared to LES subjects. Similarly, LI showed left lateralization of the frontal (LIw = 0.77 & 0.71) and temporal (LIw = 0.74 & 0.5) regions in controls and the TLE group (post-surgery) compared to the pre-surgery group during language tasks.
   Conclusions: Greater improvement in language skills and BOLD activation in the left hemisphere in TLE-patients (after epilepsy surgery) with a high level of education was similar to that of healthy controls, implying that education has an effect on the functional reorganization/recovery of language areas.

AB  - Infectious retinitis postfebrile illness is known to be caused by chikungunya, dengue, West Nile virus, Bartonella, Lyme's disease, Rift Valley fever, rickettsia, Herpes viruses etc. Rickettsia is Gram-negative bacteria transmitted by arthropods vectors. Ocular involvement is common including conjunctivitis, keratitis, anterior uveitis, panuveitis, retinitis, retinal vascular changes, and optic nerve involvement. Retinitis lesions in rickettsia can occur because of an immunological response to the bacteria or because of direct invasion and proliferation of bacteria in the inner retina. We report such a case of bilateral rickettsial retinitis proven by serology which worsened on systemic steroids and responded dramatically to therapy with oral doxycycline and steroid taper. We thus believe that direct bacterial invasion plays a major role in the pathogenesis of rickettsial retinitis.

AB  - Bilateral optic disc edema in a diabetic patient may be caused by diabetic papillopathy. We herein report on a patient with bilateral optic disc drusen simulating diabetic papillopathy. A 55-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes presented with decreased vision of 1-month. Diabetic papillopathy was initially considered as there was disc edema in both eyes with focal hemorrhages at the disc margin and mild visual loss. Ultrasound of the optic nerve head revealed optic disc drusen in both eyes and this was also confirmed by the control photograph. Optic nerve head drusen should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a diabetic patient presenting with disc edema.

AB  - Context: Cysts arising from the hepatobiliary tree are a group of heterogeneous lesions with regard to pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and radiological finding. They can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic, developmental, secondary to infective/inflammatory etiologies, as well as neoplastic. This study was conducted to determine the spectrum of hepatobiliary cysts in surgically intervened cases, with regard to their prevalence, histological spectrum, and clinicoradiological correlation, wherever possible. Methods: In this retrospective observational study, hematoxylin and eosin stained slides of all cases of hepatobiliary cystic lesions, operated between 2009 and 2016 were reviewed. Special stains as reticulin, Masson's trichrome, and periodic acid Schiff were done wherever necessary. Overall prevalence, age-sex distribution, clinical presentation and histopathological patterns were studied. Relevant imaging findings were correlated wherever possible. Results: A total of 312 cases of hepatobiliary cysts were identified, the majority in females. Choledochal cysts (CCs) were the most common type (n = 198,63.5%), followed by hydatid cysts (n = 73,23.3%), simple hepatic cysts (n = 10,3.2%), congenital hepatic fibrosis (n = 10,3.2%), biliary cystadenomas (n = 4,1.2%) hepatic mesenchymal hamartomas (n = 7,2.2%), and cavernous hemangiomas (n = 3,0.9%). Fibropolycystic liver disease (n = 2,0.6%), Caroli's disease (n = 1, 0.3%), liver abscess (n = 2, 0.6%), infantile hemangioendothelioma (n = 1,0.3%), and biliary cystadenocarcinomas (n = 1,0.3%) were rare. Lesions noted mostly in 1st decade of life were: CCs, fibrocystic liver disease, Caroli's syndrome, cystic mesenchymal hamartoma, and infantile hemangioendotheliomas. Conclusion: In our cohort of surgically intervened cases of hepatobiliary cystic lesions from a tertiary care hospital in North India, the CCs, followed by hydatid cyst were the most common lesions. Histology can play vital role in characterization, as often clinical findings and radiology can overlap.

AB  - Introduction: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is diagnosed traditionally by cytopathology (CP) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Role of flow cytometry (FC) to diagnose CNS involvement has not been extensively investigated.
   Methods: We aimed to detect CNS involvement in 42 ALL patients (33 B-ALL, nine T-ALL) at diagnosis by FC and comparing it with CP and to correlate it with known risk factors for CNS disease like Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the cutoff of LDH to predict CSF involvement. For the analysis of categorical/quantitative variables, Fisher's exact test was used. For the analysis of continuous variables, Mann-Whitney test was used. A P value of <.05 was taken as significant.
   Results: CP and FC were positive in five (11.9%) and 11 patients (26.14%) respectively with FC detecting a significantly higher level of involvement (P=.001). All CP-positive cases were FC positive. A LDH value of >472U/L had a sensitivity of 61% and specificity of 62.5% for diagnosis of CSF involvement by FC.
   Conclusions: CSF FC detects CNS disease in ALL patients at diagnosis at a rate double than CP alone and is statistically associated with an elevated LDH level. It should be incorporated in the evaluation of CSF to detect CNS involvement.

AB  - One of the challenges in designing a successful drug-delivery vehicle is the control over drug release. Toward this, a number of multifunctional nanoparticles with multiple triggers and complex chemistries have been developed. To achieve an efficient and maximum therapeutic effect, a trigger dependent drug-delivery system with sustained release is desirable. In this paper, we report the use of a combination of thermoresponsive gold core and polymeric shell nanoparticles that can provide a sustained, triggered release of doxorubicin, making the system more efficient compared to individual nanoparticles. The selection of the system was dependent on the best trigger applicable in biological systems and a component responsive to that trigger. Because of the best tissue penetration depth observed for radiofrequency (rf), we chose rf as a trigger. Whereas the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) provided hyperthermia trigger on exposure to rf fields, the thermoresponsiveness was endowed by poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAm)-based polymer shells. AuNPs with three different compositions of shells, only pNIPAm and p(NIPAm-co-NIPMAm) with the ratio of NIPAm/N-(isopropylmethacrylamide) (NIPMAm) 1:1 (pNIPMAm(50)) and 1:3 (pNIPMAm(75)), were synthesized. We observed that the polymer coating on the AuNPs did not affect the heating efficiency of AuNPs by rf and exhibited a temperature-dependent release of the chemotherapeutic drug, doxorubicin. The nanoparticles were biocompatible, stable in biologically relevant media, and were able to show a burst as well as a sustained release, which was rf-dependent. Interestingly, we observed that when HeLa cells were treated with doxorubicin-loaded gold core-polymeric shell NPs and exposed to rf for varying times, the mixture of the two polymeric shell nanoparticles induced more cell death as compared to the cells treated with single nanoparticles, suggesting that such multi-nanoparticle systems can be more efficacious delivery systems instead of a single multicomponent system.

AB  - Background and Aim: The literature on possible factors that could trigger a relapse in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission on long-term follow up is scarce. To determine the relapse rate in patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission and identify factors that may influence the risk of relapse.
   Methods: Patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission were enrolled between January and July 2010 and followed up for 1year to determine the effect of clinical, dietary, and psychological factors on relapse. Information regarding factors that may affect relapse such as infection, antibiotic, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use and any other factor that the patient felt important and compliance with medications was obtained.
   Results: Ninety-seven patients (59 males, mean age 3911.9years) were followed up for a mean duration of 9 +/- 2.3months. Eighteen (18.6%) relapsed with the median time to relapse being 3.5months. On univariate analysis, more relapsers had significantly higher NSAIDs use within 15days of relapse, respiratory tract infection within 4weeks, use of steroids more than once in past, higher consumption of calcium, riboflavin, and vitamin A, and lower consumption of sugars. On multivariate analysis, NSAIDs use (HR [95% CI]: 6.41 [1.88-21.9]) and intake of vitamin A (HR [95% CI]: 1.008 [1.000-1.016]) were statistically significant predictors of relapse.
   Conclusion: With a relapse rate of 18.6% over a follow up of 9months in patients with UC in clinical, endoscopic, and histological remission, independent predictors of relapse were history of NSAIDs use within 15days of relapse and higher intake of vitamin A.

AB  - Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare locally aggressive odontogenic neoplasm. These tumors are most commonly found to arise from mandible. Because of rarity, there is limited information about the clinical behaviour of such patients. We intended to perform this review of published literature to assess the demographic profile, pattern of care and assess survival outcomes. Two authors independently searched PubMed, Google search, and Cochrane library for eligible studies from 1950 until July 1 2016 published in English language. Data of 199 patients were retrieved from 94 publications for statistical analysis. Median age of the entire cohort was 49 years (range 7-91 years). The analysis revealed that a clear twofold higher incidence in male with male-to-female ratio was 2.4:1 (140:57). Mandible was found to be the commonest tumor location in 66.7% (n = 132) cases followed by maxilla (31.8%) (n = 64). The present analysis revealed that median PFS of 57 months (95% CI 39-120 months) with 5- and 10-year PFS was found to be 47.88 and 29.48%, respectively. Median OS for the entire cohort which was 122 months (95% CI 96-153 months) with 2- and 5-year OS for the entire cohort was 87.16 and 69.08%, respectively. In univariate analysis, patients with an R0 resection were found to have a favourable survival. In addition, patients with localized disease and younger age were found to have a better survival. Adjuvant radiation did not confer any survival advantage. The present analysis revealed excellent outcome for patients treated with an R0 resection. Older patients with high-risk factor may benefit from adjuvant radiation. Role of chemotherapy needs to be evaluated.

AB  - Background: Planning a comprehensive program addressing neonatal mortality will require a detailed situational analysis of available neonatal-specific health infrastructure.
   Methods: We identified facilities providing essential and sick neonatal care (ENC, SNC) by a snowballing technique in Ballabgarh Block. These were assessed for infrastructure, human resource and equipment along with self-rated competency of the staff and compared with facility-based or population-based norms.
   Results: A total of 35 facilities providing ENC and 10 facilities for SNC were identified. ENC services were largely in the public-sector domain (68.5% of births) and were well distributed in the block. SNC burden was largely being borne by the private sector (66% of admissions), which was urban-based. The private sector and nurses reported lower competency especially for SNC. Only 53.9% of government facilities and 17.5% of private facilities had a fully equipped newborn care corner.
   Conclusions: Serious efforts to reduce neonatal mortality would require major capacity strengthening of the health system, including that of the private sector.

AB  - Background & objectives: Pioglitazone was suspended for manufacture and sale by the Indian drug regulator in June 2013 due to its association with urinary bladder carcinoma, which was revoked within a short period (July 2013). The present questionnaire-based nationwide study was conducted to assess its impact on prescribing behaviour of physicians in India.
   Methods: Between December 2013 and March 2014, a validated questionnaire was administered to physicians practicing diabetes across 25 centres in India. Seven hundred and forty questionnaires fulfilling the minimum quality criteria were included in the final analysis.
   Results: Four hundred and sixteen (56.2%) physicians prescribed pioglitazone. Of these, 281 used it in less than the recommended dose of 15 mg/day. Most physicians (94.3%) were aware of recent regulatory events. However, only 333 (44.8%) changed their prescribing pattern. Seventeen of the 416 (4.1%) physicians who prescribed pioglitazone admitted having come across at least one type 2 diabetes mellitus patient (T2DM) who had urinary bladder carcinoma, and of these 13 said that it was in patients who took pioglitazone for a duration of more than two years. Only 7.8 per cent of physicians (n= 58) categorically advocated banning pioglitazone, and the rest opined for its continuation or generating more evidence before decision could be taken regarding its use in T2DM.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Majority of the physicians though were aware of the regulatory changes with regard to pioglitazone, but their prescribing patterns were not changed for this drug. However, it was being used at lower than the recommended dose. There is a need for generating more evidence through improved pharmacovigilance activities and large-scale population-based prospective studies regarding the safety issues of pioglitazone, so as to make effectual risk-benefit analysis for its continual use in T2DM.

AB  - DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase maintains the topology of DNA by introducing negative supercoils using energy generated by ATP hydrolysis. It is composed of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB (GyrA(2)GyrB(2) hetero-tetramer). GyrB comprises two domains, a 43 kDa amino N-terminus (GBNTD) and 47 kDa carboxyl C- terminus (GBCTD). Till now no study has been reported in terms of stability of Gyrase B and its domains using chemical denaturants related to its function. To understand the role of each domain in GyrB subunit, we estimated the thermodynamic stability of GBF and its individual domains using urea and GdmCl. Changes in secondary and tertiary structures were monitored using circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The Cm values for GBNTD, GBCTD and GBF proteins were found to be 2.25, 1.65 and 1.82 M during GdmCl-induced denaturation and 2.95, 2.25 and 2.67 M for urea-induced denaturation. It is observed that GBNTD is more stable than GBCTD and it contributes to overall stability of GyrB. The lower Cm and Delta G values reflect the flexibility of GBCTD to form the catalytic site along with GANTD for cleavage or religation reaction. Both GdmCl- and urea-induced denaturation of GyrB domains were reversible over the entire range of concentration. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Leishmaniasis manifests as visceral (VL), cutaneous (CL) or a dermal sequel of VL, known as Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical and laboratory features of cases diagnosed with leishmaniasis.
   Methods: This hospital-based retrospective study included all cases of VL, PKDL, and CL diagnosed between Jan 2011 to Jan 2016 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Clinical and laboratory profile of the diagnosed cases were analyzed in detail. All diagnosed cases were mapped according to the state and the district from which the cases originated.
   Results: A total of 91 VL cases and 4 PKDL cases were reviewed. Only one case of CL (1 female) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (1 female) were observed during the study period. Majority of the cases of VL (75/91) originated from Bihar. The most common presenting symptoms in all our patients were fever (97.8%), weight loss (40.6%) and abdominal discomfort (17.6%) while the most common presenting signs were hepatosplenomegaly (45.8%), isolated splenomegaly (23.1%) and skin pigmentation (11%). The most common laboratory abnormality was anaemia followed by thrombocytopenia and leucopenia.
   Conclusion: VL is globally recognized as a neglected tropical disease. Even after continued effort to bring down its transmission in India, it continues to affect the endemic states with reports from new pockets.

AB  - Introduction: Collagen distribution alterations are well known in dilated cardiomyopathy. There are also changes in microvasculature along with other histomorphorphological features. Aims and Objectives: To study the histomorphological features of DCM along with their quantitative correlation with LVEF. Alterations in collagen IV distribution pattern and microvasculature in DCM were also evaluated. Materials and Methods: The present study includes 34 right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, 7 explanted native hearts and 41 autopsy control hearts. Sections were taken from lower half of right interventricular septum and stained for H and E, Masson trichrome and immunohistochemistry for CD34, SMA and Collagen IV to study the histological features, pattern of fibrosis, capillary and arteriolar distribution and collagen IV expression respectively. Morphometric analysis was carried out in all cases and controls using Image analysis software Image pro plus 7 and correlated with left ventricular ejection fraction. Results: The histomorphological changes of DCM include myocyte hypertrophy, nucleomegaly, and interstitial fibrosis. Interfiber fibrosis was the commonest. There was evidence of myocarditis, ischemic change and vessel wall alterations. Considerable alteration in Collagen IV distribution was observed with reduction in intensity and proportion of staining around myocytes quantified using Allred scoring against uniform pericellular staining in controls. Morphometric analysis revealed significant increase in nuclear area, myocyte width, percentage of fibrosis and reduction in capillary myocyte ratio in cases as compared to controls. There was no significant difference in arteriolar density. No significant association was observed between morphometric parameters and LVEF. Conclusion: Histomorphological changes in DCM are non-specific. Quantitation of histological parameters cannot be used to predict the disease progression as there was no significant correlation with LVEF. There is appreciable alteration in Collagen IV distribution in DCM owing to extracellular matrix alterations.

AB  - Background & objectives: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition resulting in chronic respiratory infections, pancreatic enzyme insufficiency and associated complications. This pilot study was undertaken to assess the glucose tolerance and insulin secretion and sensitivity among Indian children with CF.
   Methods: Children with CF under regular follow up at the Paediatric Pulmonology Clinic of a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India, were enrolled. Children who had a history of acute exacerbation or intake of systemic steroids within the last two weeks were excluded. Anthropometry, pulmonary function and disease severity (Shwachman) score were assessed. Fasting venous sample was drawn to assess glucose, insulin, haemoglobin and calcium. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed, and blood glucose and insulin were assessed at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min. Insulin secretion and sensitivity indices were calculated.
   Results: Twenty nine patients with a mean age of 11.2 +/- 4.1 yr were enrolled. Stunting, thinness, anaemia and hypocalcaemia were present in 31.0, 13.8, 37.0 and 48.3 per cent of the patients, respectively. Abnormal glucose tolerance (AGT) was present in 21.4 per cent. Insulin secretion was similar in individuals with AGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT), but insulin sensitivity index was lower (0.12 +/- 0.02 vs 0.15 +/- 0.01, P<0.001) and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance higher [1.63 (0.53-1.76) vs 0.83 (0.28-4.43), P<0.05] in individuals with AGT compared to NGT.
   Interpretation & conclusions: AGT was observed in 21.4 per cent of children with CF. The CF patients with AGT had significantly lower insulin sensitivity compared to patients with NGT. Future multicentric studies with a large sample should be conducted to assess insulin secretion and sensitivity indices in CF patients compared to healthy controls.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of our study was to assess serum Adiponectin, Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and their correlation with conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes in overweight/obese Indian children. Methods: Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting serum adiponectin, IL-6, hsCRP, blood glucose, triglycerides, and total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were measured in children aged 7-15 years with BMI > 85th centile. Results: 84 overweight/obese children (48 boys) with mean (SD) age 10.2 (1.9) years were enrolled. Mean (SD) adiponectin, hsCRP and median (IQR) IL-6 levels were 6.0 (3.1) mu g/mL, 3.4 (2.4) mg/L and 12.7 (5.0-90.0) pg/mL, respectively. Low adiponectin, high hsCRP and high IL-6 were noted in 16.5%, 49.4% and 54.4% participants, respectively. Adiponectin was inversely correlated with waist circumference, and IL-6 positively with BMI and blood glucose. Conclusions: Inflammatory mediators, hsCRP and IL-6 were elevated in half of the overweight children. Adiponectin and IL-6 correlated well with traditional risk markers.

AB  - In this retrospective study, patients with idiopathic frequentlyrelapsing nephrotic syndrome (FRNS) (n = 27) and steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome (SDNS) (n = 13) who received enteric coated mycophenolate sodium (ECMS) for at least 6 months, were included for analysis. Primary outcome was response to ECMS, which was defined as complete if there were no relapses, partial response if there was 1 relapse and no response if there were 2 or more relapses within 6 months of initiation. The mean (SD) dose of ECMS was 985.24 (190.82) mg/m(2)/day. Thirty patients(75%) had complete response, eight (20%) had partial and two (5%) patients did not respond at 6 months. ECMS seems to be a safe and effective as steroid sparing agent in children with FRNS/SDNS.

AB  - Suturing is the joining of tissues with needle and thread so that the tissues will bind together and that healing occurs by primary intention with least scarring. Professionals like tailor and cobbler are also involved with suturing. Although both professions are involved with suturing, they are not dealing with live tissue, so there are no problems like poor healing, ischemia and wound edge necrosis. These complications, which are common with live tissue, may finally lead to wound dehiscence and increased risk of surgical site infection, and ugly scar. Every surgeon should be cognizant of principles of wound healing and aesthetics.

AB  - Objective: This compares hospital suction negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with conventional gauze dressings in traumatic soft-tissue injury at a tertiary care centre.
   Methods: A prospective control study was conducted between September 2012 and November 2014. Patients with one or more traumatic soft-tissue injuries with contaminated wounds were allocated to either a test group (received NPWT) or control group (received conventional gauze). Wounds were assessed by two orthopaedic surgeons. If grade A was achieved, the wound was covered with split-thickness skin graft, flap or delayed primary closure; otherwise, revision debridement and NPWT/saline gauze dressings were applied. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation and proportions) were used to summarise the study variables. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for difference of mean were used. Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used to observe an association between the qualitative data and outcome variables. Unpaired T-Test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for analysis of the quantitative data. A p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: A total of 104 patients were included. The mean number of dressings per patient was significantly lower in the NPWT group (3.4) than in the control group (20.7) (p<0.001). The time between injury and complete closure (12.5 versus 21.4 days) as well as duration of hospital stay (17.3 versus 23.8 days) was significantly less in the NPWT group (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: NPWT has a role in healing traumatic wounds and can be delivered effectively through hospital suction NPWT, which can also reduce the cost of therapy. We recommend its regular use in all patients presenting with post-traumatic, soft-tissue injuries when primary coverage is not possible.

AB  - Introduction: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains one of the most common nosocomial infections in the Intensive Care Unit. In the face of extremely high rates of antimicrobial resistance, it is essential to gauge the clinical significance of isolation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens from clinical samples. This study details the trend of VAP and the clinical significance of isolation of MDR pathogens from respiratory samples at an Indian tertiary care hospital. Methods: The study was conducted over a 5-year period. VAP was diagnosed on the basis of centres for disease control and prevention criteria. The trend in the rates was compared with preventive measures. Phenotypic and genotypic resistance to beta-lactamases was determined using standard methods. The correlation of isolation of a multi-resistant pathogen with the clinical outcome, length of stay and cost of antimicrobial was ascertained. A clone of Acinetobacter baumannii identified through multilocus sequence typing was used to answer the question of whether resistant bugs always have a fatal outcome. Results: The total ventilator days (VDs) for these patients amounted to 36,278. A total of 433 episodes of VAP occurred during the study, amounting to an overall VAP rate of 11.9/1000 VDs. There Was a decline in the rates of VAP over the 5-year period, due to intensive surveillance and preventive activities. .4. baumannii (54%) was the most common pathogen, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21%). A high rate of MDR was seen, with the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC and carbapenemase genes. The presence of MDR was not always associated with a fatal outcome. Conclusions: Isolation of MDR pathogens from bronchoalveolar lavage does not always adversely affect the outcome of patients. It requires an interdisciplinary team of clinical microbiologists, physicians and hospital infection control nurses, to collectively manage these patients.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate clinic based and laboratory tests of otolith function for their sensitivity and specificity in demarcating unilateral compensated complete vestibular deficit from normal.
   Study Design: Prospective cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Tertiary care hospital vestibular physiology laboratory.
   Subjects: Control group-30 healthy adults, 20-45 years age; Case group-15 subjects post vestibular shwannoma excision or post-labyrinthectomy with compensated unilateral complete audio-vestibular loss.
   Intervention: Otolith function evaluation by precise clinical testing (head tilt test-HTT; subjective visual vertical-SVV) and laboratory testing (headroll-eye counterroll-HR-ECR; vesibular evoked myogenic potentials-cVEMP).
   Main Outcome Measure: Sensitivity and specificity of clinical and laboratory tests in differentiating case and control subjects.
   Results: Measurable test results were universally obtained with clinical otolith tests (SVV; HTT) but not with laboratory tests. The HR-ECR test did not indicate any definitive wave forms in 10% controls and 26% cases. cVEMP responses were absent in 10% controls. HTT test with normative cutoff at 2 degrees deviations from vertical noted as 93.33% sensitive and 100% specific. SVV test with normative cutoff at 1.3 degrees noted as 100% sensitive and 100% specific. Laboratory tests demonstrated poorer specificities owing primarily to significant unresponsiveness in normal controls.
   Conclusions: Clinical otolith function tests, if conducted with precision, demonstrate greater ability than laboratory testing in discriminating normal controls from cases with unilateral complete compensated vestibular dysfunction.

TI  - Atypical morphology of anogenital warts is not a marker of atypical histology or of infection to the high-risk human papillomavirus genotypes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - CONDYLOMA ACUMINATUM
KW  - LESIONS
AB  - Background The clinical morphology of anogenital warts may vary from flat, filiform, papular, or verrucous to giant condyloma acuminatum. Clinically atypical-looking genital warts may alarm the clinician because of their suspected malignant potential, which may cause anxiety, often leading to aggressive interventions. Objective To study if clinically atypical-looking anogenital warts are more likely to be premalignant or malignant as compared to typical warts.
   Method Data of 41 (37 males, 4 females) patients with anogenital warts was retrospectively analyzed. After a detailed literature review and in-house discussions, criteria for anogenital warts with typical and atypical clinical morphology were defined. Clinical photographs were independently reviewed by three dermatologists, and human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping results, histological evaluation, and immunohistochemical analysis for p53 expression were evaluated.
   Results Fifteen (36.6%) anogenital warts were classified as atypical by at least two of three blinded dermatologists. The histological examination showed mitotic figures in 31/41 (75.6%) specimens, dysplasia in 14/41 (44.1%) specimens, and p53 positivity in 34/41 (82.9%) specimens. There was no significant difference in the high-risk HPV genotyping (P = 0.67), frequency of dysplastic changes on histology (P = 0.19), and immunohistochemistry with p53 (P = 0.08) between clinically typical and atypical-appearing anogenital warts. Similarly, no significant difference was found in the frequency of dysplastic changes (P = 0.67) or p53 expressions (P = 0.41) based on the HPV genotypes.
   Conclusions The atypical clinical morphology of anogenital warts may not be a marker of increased malignant potential. High-risk HPV genotypes do not have a statistically significant association with dysplasia or positive immunohistochemistry with p53.

AB  - Coats' disease is characterized by retinal vascular telangiectasia and subretinal and intraretinal exudation. A relatively benign form of the disease that occurs in adults is referred to as adult-onset Coats' disease. Involvement of macula in the form of macular edema and exudation are the common presenting features in both forms of the disease. We describe a rare case of adult-onset Coats' disease that presented with epiretinal membrane (ERM). Laser photocoagulation of retinal vascular telangiectasia resulted in worsening of patient's symptoms and ERM. Early pars plana vitrectomy resulted in resolution of the patient's symptoms. Utility of ultra-wide-field imaging and rationale of early vitrectomy in such cases are discussed.

AB  - CECT scan is considered essential for selective non-operative management (SNOM) of patients with abdominal trauma. However, CECT has its own hazards and limitations. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of selective non-operative management of patients with abdominal trauma without the mandatory use of CECT scan in a prospective study. Patients with peritonitis and ongoing intra-abdominal bleed were excluded. Consenting FAST positive, hemodynamically stable patients with blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma between 18 and 60 years of age were included and admitted for SNOM and detailed ultrasonography of the abdomen (in all) with or without CECT abdomen (selectively). Eighty-four patients with abdominal trauma were admitted during the study period. Twenty-two patients did not satisfy the inclusion criteria and 18 required immediate laparotomy based on primary survey. Remaining 44 patients were admitted for SNOM: mean +/- SD age of these patients was 27 +/- 8.7 years; 40 (89 %) were males. Thirty-five patients (79.54 %) sustained blunt trauma (RTI = 16, Fall = 16, others= 3) while nine patients (20.45 %) sustained penetrating trauma. SNOM without CECT was successful in 36 (81.82 %) patients. Five (11.36 %) patients underwent delayed emergency laparotomy based on clinical and detailed USG evaluation. CECT was not done in these patients. Three patients underwent CECT for various reasons; however, they were managed with SNOM. Thus, SNOM without abdominal CECT was successful in 36 (81.82 %) patients. SNOM failed in five patients but abdominal USG was sufficient. SNOM can be practised safely in patients of abdominal trauma with limited use of CECT scan.

AB  - An essential protein for bacterial growth, GTPase-Obg (Obg), is known to play an unknown but crucial role in stress response as its expression increases in Mycobacterium under stress conditions. It is well reported that Obg interacts with anti-sigma-F factor Usfx; however, a detailed analysis and structural characterization of their physical interaction remain undone. In view of above-mentioned points, this study was conceptualized for performing binding analysis and structural characterization of Obg-Usfx interaction. The binding studies were performed by surface plasmon resonance, while in silico docking analysis was done to identify crucial residues responsible for Obg-Usfx interaction. Surface plasmon resonance results clearly suggest that N-terminal and G domains of Obg mainly contribute to Usfx binding. Also, binding constants display strong affinity that was further evident by intermolecular hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions in the predicted complex. Strong interaction between Obg and Usfx supports the view that Obg plays an important role in stress response, essentially required for Mycobacterium survival. As concluded by various studies that Obg is crucial for Mycobacterium survival under stress, this structural information may help us in designing novel and potential inhibitors against resistant Mycobacterium strains.

   This paper is a cross-sectional observational study of 22 eyes of 11 patients (mean age 23.44 years) with Stargardt disease-fundus flavimaculatus who presented with decrease of vision at a tertiary eye care center. UWF short-wave AF images were obtained from all the patients using an Optos TX200 instrument. The main outcome measures were to assess patterns of AF changes seen on UWF AF imaging.
   All eyes showed a central area of hypoautofluorescence at the macula along with retinal flecks extending centrifugally as well as to the nasal side of the optic disc. Peripapillary sparing was seen in 100% of the eyes. Flecks were seen to be hypoautofluorescent in the center and hyperautofluorescent in the periphery in 77.8% eyes and were only hyperfluorescent in 27.2%. A background-increased fluorescence was visible in 100% of eyes, the outer boundary of which was marked by distribution of flecks in 81.9% eyes. A characteristic inferonasal vertical line was seen separating the nasal hypoautofluorescent area from the temporal hyperautofluorescent area in all the eyes.
   UWF AF changes in STGD1 are not limited to the posterior pole and may extend more peripherally. UWF imaging is a useful tool for the assessment of patients with Stargardt macular dystrophy.

AB  - Statement of problem. It is unclear how pathogenic bacteria adhere to different implant materials and whether biomarker matrix metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) level provides a reliable method of evaluating the connective tissue status of peri-implant tissues.
   Purpose. The purpose of this pilot clinical study was to evaluate peri-implant connective tissue response by assessing the MMP-8 levels in peri-implant crevicular fluid around titanium and zirconia abutments.
   Material and methods. The study was designed as a prospective, within-subject comparison with left-right randomization low. Twelve participants with partial edentulism were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Peri-implant sulcal fluid sampling and pocket probing depths were assessed at 1, 3, and 12 months after placing the abutments. The MMP-8 protein level of the peri-implant sulcal fluid was determined by MMP-8-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system. The independent t test or Wilcoxon test was used to compare MMP-8 levels and probing depth assessment between the zirconia and titanium groups at different time points (1, 3, and 12 months). Repeated measures ANOVA was used for within group comparison of the MMP-8 levels at 3 time points (alpha=.05).
   Results. At 1 and 3 months, the titanium abutments showed significantly higher MMP-8 levels and probing depths than the zirconia abutments (P<.05), but no significant differences were found at 12 months for either variable (P>.05).
   Conclusions. This study suggests the presence of more remodeling and/or inflammatory phenomena around titanium implant abutments than around zirconia abutments of a different design during the early stages but not at 1 year.

AB  - Clubroot disease is a serious threat to canola production in western Canada and many parts of the world. Rcr1 is a clubroot resistance (CR) gene identified recently and its molecular mechanisms in mediating CR have been studied using several omics approaches. The current study aimed to characterize the biochemical changes in the cell wall of canola roots connecting to key molecular mechanisms of this CR gene identified in prior studies using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The expression of nine genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism was also studied using qPCR. Between susceptible (S) and resistance (R) samples, the most notable biochemical changes were related to an increased biosynthesis of lignin and phenolics. These results were supported by the transcription data on higher expression of BrPAL1. The up-regulation of PAL is indicative of an inducible defence response conferred by Rcr1; the activation of this basal defence gene via the phenylpropanoid pathway may contribute to clubroot resistance conferred by Rcr1. The data indicate that several cell-wall components, including lignin and pectin, may play a role in defence responses against clubroot. Principal components analysis of FTIR data separated non-inoculated samples from inoculated samples, but not so much between inoculated S and inoculated R samples. It is also shown that FTIR spectroscopy can be a useful tool in studying plant-pathogen interaction at cellular levels.

AB  - Context: Family accommodation (FA) is the phenomenon whereby caregivers assist or facilitate rituals or behaviours related to obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). There is a need for a self-rated instrument to assess this construct in resource-strained clinical settings of India.
   Aim: To explore the factor structure of Hindi version of Family Accommodation Scale-Self Rated version (FAS-SR) and compare its validity with the gold standard Family Accommodation Scale-Interviewer Rated (FAS-IR) scale.
   Material & methods: The Hindi version of FAS-SR scale and FAS-IR scale was applied on 105 caregivers of patients with OCD.
   Results: The initial factor analysis yielded three-factor models with an eigenvalue of > 1 and the total variance explained by these factors was 72.017%. The internal consistency of the 19-item scale was 0.93 indicating good inter-item correlation. There was a significant positive correlation between FAS-IR scale total score and all the factors of the FAS-SR Scale. The average measure ICC was 0.889 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.783 to 0.981 (F (62,84) = 37.547, p < 001) indicating high degree of reliability between the Hindi version of FAS-SR and the FAS-IR scale.
   Conclusions: FAS-SR is a practical alternative to FAS-IR and has the potential to be used widely in an Indian setting.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to compare white matter structural changes in specific tracts by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) I, non-ill first-degree relatives (FDR) of the patients, and healthy controls (HC).
   Methods: In a cross-sectional study, we studied right-handed subjects consisting of 16 euthymic BD I patients, 15 FDR, and 15 HC. The anterior thalamic radiation, uncinate fasciculus, corpus callosum, and cingulum bundle were reconstructed by DTI tractography. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared for group differences followed by post-hoc analysis.
   Results: The three groups did not differ in terms of sociodemographic variables. There were significant group differences in the FA values among the BD I patients, their FDR, and the HC for the corpus callosum, the dorsal part of the right cingulum bundle, the hippocampal part of the cingulum bundle bilaterally, and the uncinate fasciculus (P < 0.001). The FA values in the patients were significantly lower than in controls, and FDR also showed similar differences; however, they were smaller than those in patients. No significant difference was found between the groups for FA values of the dorsal part of the left cingulum bundle and anterior thalamic radiation. Significant differences were present for ADC values among the groups for the corpus callosum, the dorsal and hippocampal parts of the cingulum, anterior thalamic radiation, and uncinate fasciculus bilaterally (P < 0.01). The FA and ADC values did not correlate significantly with age or any clinical variables.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that BD patients and their FDR show alterations in microstructural integrity of white matter tracts, compared to the healthy population.

AB  - Loss of SMARCB1/INI1 expression is considered to be a hallmark for childhood chordomas (CCs). Although mutation/loss of 22q has strongly established the loss of SMARCB1/INI1 in cancers, the cause in CCs remains elusive. Recent studies suggest role of miRNAs in regulation of SMARCB1/INI1 expressions. We examined 5 reported/target predicted miRNAs to SMARCB1/INI1 in SMARCB1/INI1 immunonegative and immunopositive cases, and found upregulation of miR-671-5p and miR-193a-5p in SMARCB1/INI1-immunonegative cases. Notably, these two miRNAs were significantly predicted to target TGF-beta signaling, suggestive of dysregulation of developmental and osteoblast regulation pathway in CCs. Overall, we suggest miR-671-5p- and miR-193a-5p-mediated epigenetic mode of SMARCB1/INI1 loss and downregulated TGF-beta pathway in CCs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) falls into the top ten leading cancer sites in urban Delhi. The incidence of GBC in females is more than that among males worldwide. The present study evaluates the temporal variation of GBC incidence in an urban Delhi population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 25-year GBC incidence data were obtained from Population-Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) of Delhi which covered nearly 97.5% of the population and 75% of Delhi. We applied joinpoint regression method to determine the trend of GBC incidence from 1988 to 2012. The estimated cumulative risk (0-74) and lifetime risk of developing GBC were also calculated. RESULTS: GBC contributed 6% of total cancer cases in Delhi during the year 2012. In the past 25 years, 12,410 GBC cases (4010 males and 8400 females) were registered and contributed approximately 3% of male cancer cases and 6.5% of female cancer cases. The median age at diagnosis of GBC was 60.13 years and 57.22 years in males and females, respectively. Joinpoint analysis showed an overall increasing trend of age-adjusted rates of GBC incidence over 25 years. In females, a downward trend was observed during 1992-2004, whereas in males, the trend remained consistent during 1991-2005; however, thereafter, it started significant increasing for both the genders. Age-specific trend of GBC also reflects an increasing trend among males and females after 2004. CONCLUSION: The total and age-specific GBC cases have show an increasing trend in the past 25 years in urban Delhi. Stringent steps are required to control the modifiable risk factors for reducing the incidence of GBC in Delhi. In addition, individuals should also practice a healthy lifestyle to reduce the likelihood of GBC as well as other diseases.

   Patients and methods Eighty patients in a barbed suture group and 90 in a traditional group were enrolled in this prospective randomized study.
   Results Barbed suture was associated with 4.1 minutes (P < 0.001) faster closure. It was found to be cheaper in terms of direct material cost [30.4%]. Needle prick injury was found in 6.7% (P = 0.020) of cases in the traditional group. Blood loss, post-operative complication and post-operative function were comparable in both groups.
   Conclusion Barbed suture use in capsular closure of knee arthroplasty is an efficient and cost effective method, and recommended for use in the future.

AB  - Purpose: The aim is to study the clinicodemographic profile and treatment outcome of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of 57 eyes (56 cases) with clinically diagnosed OSSN, presenting in our center over the past year. Results: The median age of presentation was 55 years with male: female ratio being 4.5:1. Systemic predisposing conditions were xeroderma pigmentosa (1) postkidney transplant immunosuppression (1), and human immunodeficiency virus infection (1). Patients with predisposing conditions had a younger median age of onset (33 years). The majority of tumors were nodular (61.4%), gelatinous (61.4%), and had limbal involvement (96%). On ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM), mean tumor height was 2.93 +/- 1.02 mm, and intraocular extension was evident in seven eyes. OSSN with intraocular extension had a mean tumor height of 4.3 +/- 1.32 mm. Nodal metastasis was seen in one case at presentation. As per American Joint Committee for Cancer Classification seventh edition staging-two cases were T1, one was T2, 46 were T3 and eight were T4. Treatment advised included conservative therapy for 39; wide local excision (4 mm margin clearance) with cryotherapy for seven; enucleation in four; and exenteration in four eyes. Overall, complete regression was achieved in 88% of cases during a mean follow-up of 13.5 +/- 4.6 months. Recurrence was seen in three cases, which were treated with exenteration, radical neck dissection, and palliative chemo-radiotherapy, respectively. Conclusion: Although associated with old age, earlier onset of OSSN is seen in patients with systemic predisposing conditions. Thicker tumors in the setting of a previous surgery or immunocompromised status should be considered high-risk features for intraocular extension and should be evaluated on UBM.

AB  - Cardiac myxomas are benign neoplasm of the heart with an incidence of 0.3%. Glandular cardiac myxomas are very rare and accounts for less than 3% of all cardiac myxomas. Here, we report a case of familial glandular cardiac myxoma in a 35 year old male who complained of exertional dyspneoa and weakness of right side of body on clinical presentation. Associated features of Carney's complex were not present. Family history revealed presence of cardiac myxoma in younger brother and sister. Transthoracic echocardiography detected biatrial myxoma. Excision of both lesions was done under cardiopulmonary bypass. Histopathology confirmed myxoma with glandular elements. Postoperative course was uneventful.

AB  - Background: Microbial translocation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14) and IgM Endocab levels have been reported to be associated with disease progression in HIV-1 infection. In this longitudinal study, plasma levels of different microbially translocated products (LPS, sCD14, Endocab) was investigated in HIV-1 infected Indian Individuals stratified as Rapid (R), Viremic slow (VS), Slow progressors (S) and healthy controls.
   Method: Ten healthy and twenty HIV-1 infected individuals were enrolled. Plasma levels of LPS, sCD14, Endocab was examined using commercially available Limulus Amebocyte assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) enzyme linked immunosorbant assay.
   Results: Elevated levels of sCD14, IgM EndoCab and LPS were observed during HIV-1 infection compared to healthy controls. Rapid progressors had higher levels of sCD14, IgM EndoCab, LPS (median% 1553, 3596, 202.2) compared to viremic slow, slow progressors and healthy controls both at baseline and follow up visits. At baseline, LPS correlated positively with IgM Endocab and negatively with sCD14 levels while at follow-up, significant positive correlation was observed between IgM Endocab and sCD14 (IgM EndoCab r = 0.490, p = 0.05; sCD14 r = 0.051, p = 0.830). Plasma levels of sCD14 correlated positively with viral load in rapid, viremic slow and slow progressors while CD + T cell count correlated positively with sCD14 and IgM EndoCab levels in viremic slow and slow progressors.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that elevated levels of sCD14, IgM EndoCab and LPS in HIV-1 infected individuals are strong predictors of disease progression and could be considered as candidate biomarkers for disease monitoring. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Metformin, an antidiabetic drug, is well known for its multifarious properties and its ability to modulate inflammatory cascade. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory condition of the colon where drugs exhibiting anti-inflammatory property have been shown to induce and maintain remission. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of metformin against acetic-acid induced colitis in rat. The study included five groups of rats namely normal control, experimental control, drug treated groups (50 and 500 mg/kg of metformin, MET50, MET500 and 300 mg/kg of mesalazine, MSZ300). Parameters like small intestinal transit and colonic macroscopic changes, ulcer score, weight/length (W/L) ratio, levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, tissue histology and expression of COX-2, iNOS, NFkB(p65) were evaluated. The results of this study show that treatment with metformin significantly decreased colonic mucosal damage, maintained oxidative homeostasis and normalized intestinal transit and W/L ratio in a dose-dependent manner. The restorative effect of metformin on colonic mucosa was accompanied by a marked reduction in the tissue levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and immunoreactivity of COX-2, iNOS and NFkB(p65). Further, its protective effect was found to be comparable to that of mesalazine. This study shows that metformin targets oxidative stress and down regulates transcription factor NFkB(p65) mediated pro-inflammatory signaling and has a therapeutic potential in treating inflammatory conditions of the colon.

AB  - To evaluate the impact of death-to-preservation time (DPT) on effective utilisation of donor corneas. In a prospective observational study conducted at our tertiary eye centre, donated corneas received over a 15-month period from November 2011 to January 2013 were evaluated. Donor age, donor refrigeration (done or not), DPT, endothelial cell density (ECD), corneal grading, clinical utilisation and surgical outcome after graft transplantation were noted. To analyse the impact of different DPT on donor cornea transplantation, primary outcome measures (corneal grading and endothelial cell density) and secondary outcome measures (primary graft failure and graft infection) were analysed. A total of 990 corneas were assessed. Primary outcomes showed no significant difference for higher DPT (P > 0.01). ECD, where DPT was >12 h, was better for refrigerated corneas (P < 0.001). Prolonged DPT had no significant effect on primary graft failure (P = 0.131) and graft infection (P = 0.137) in the first month after transplantation. We find that DPT should not be the only criteria to assess the cornea quality; other donor characteristics should be considered equally important.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major global public health problem with significant gaps in research, care, and policy. In order to mitigate the risks and adverse effects of CKD, the International Society of Nephrology has created a cohesive set of activities to improve the global outcomes of people living with CKD. Improving monitoring of renal disease progression can be done by screening and monitoring albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate in primary care. Consensus on how many times and how often albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate are measured should be defined. Meaningful changes in both renal biomarkers should be determined in order to ascertain what is clinically relevant. Increasing social awareness of CKD and partnering with the technological community may be ways to engage patients. Furthermore, improving the prediction of cardiovascular events in patients with CKD can be achieved by including the renal risk markers albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate in cardiovascular risk algorithms and by encouraging uptake of assessing cardiovascular risk by general practitioners and nephrologists. Finally, examining ways to further validate and implement novel biomarkers for CKD will help mitigate the global problem of CKD. The more frequent use of renal biopsy will facilitate further knowledge into the underlying etiologies of CKD and help put new biomarkers into biological context. Real-world assessments of these biomarkers in existing cohorts is important, as well as obtaining regulatory approval to use these biomarkers in clinical practice. Collaborations among academia, physician and patient groups, industry, payer organizations, and regulatory authorities will help improve the global outcomes of people living with CKD.

AB  - Purpose of review
   With an ultimate aim of improving patients overall outcome and satisfaction, minimally invasive surgical approach is becoming more of a norm. The related anesthetic evidence has not expanded at the same rate as surgical and technological advancement. This article reviews the recent evidence on anesthesia and perioperative concerns for patients undergoing minimally invasive neurosurgery.
   Recent findings
   Minimally invasive cranial and spinal surgeries have been made possible only by vast technological development. Points of surgical interest can be precisely located with the help of stereotaxy and neuronavigation and special endoscopes which decrease the tissue trauma. The principles of neuroanethesia remain the same, but few concerns are specific for each technique. Dexmedetomidine has a favorable profile for procedures carried out under sedation technique. As the new surgical techniques are coming up, lesser known anesthetic concerns may also come into light.
   Summary
   Over the last year, little new information has been added to existing literature regarding anesthesia for minimally invasive neurosurgeries. Neuroanesthesia goals remain the same and less invasive surgical techniques do not translate into safe anesthesia. Specific concerns for each procedure should be taken into consideration.

KW  - obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is commonly associated with morbid obesity. Weight loss following bariatric surgery results in resolution or improvement of OSA. However, few studies have done objective assessment of the impact of bariatric surgery on OSA.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of bariatric surgery on OSA.
   Setting: The study was conducted in the teaching institution of a tertiary care centre.
   Methods: Twenty-seven morbidly obese patients seeking bariatric surgery were administered Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) health questionnaire and subjected to overnight polysomnography. Repeat assessment using ESS and polysomnography was done at 3-6 months after surgery.
   Results: Mean age was 42.4 +/- 10.5 years, and majority (77.8%) were female. The mean pre-operative weight and body mass index (BMI) were 126.4 +/- 24.9 kg and 48.4 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2), respectively. Nearly 29.6% patients had symptoms of excessive daytime somnolence based on ESS score and overnight polysomnography detected the presence of OSA in 96.3% patients, of which 51.9% had severe OSA. At mean follow-up of 5.2 +/- 2.5 months after surgery, mean weight and BMI decreased to 107.4 +/- 24.5 kg and 41.2 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2), respectively. Mean ESS score and mean apnoea-hypopnea index declined from 8.9 +/- 3.2 to 4.03 +/- 2.15 (P < 0.001) and from 31.8 +/- 20.4 to 20.2 +/- 23.1 (P = 0.007), respectively. Number of patients requiring continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy declined from 15 to 3 and average CPAP requirement came down from 11.3 cm of H2O to 6 cm of H2O.
   Conclusion: OSA was present in a significant proportion of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery resulted in significant improvement in both subjective and objective parameters of OSA.

KW  - Neonatal sepsis

AB  - The gold standard for detecting bacterial sepsis is blood culture. However, the sensitivity of blood culture is low and the results take 48-72 h. Molecular assays for the detection of bacterial DNA permit early detection of a bacterial cause as the turnaround time is 6-8 h. We undertook an evaluation of the performance of universal bacterial primer (16S rRNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis at a tertiary care medical college teaching hospital. 16S rRNA PCR was positive in all cases of blood culture proven sepsis. PCR revealed 95.6% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 91.2% negative predictive value and so appears to be a useful tool for the early diagnosis of bacterial neonatal sepsis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A retrospective cohort study of patients with tuberculum sellae meningioma (TSM)-associated sphenoidal pneumosinus dilatans (PSD) over a recent epoch was evaluated using a propensity-matched morphometric analysis.
   METHODS: A total of 38 patients with TSM and sphenoidal PSD were identified and matched by age and sex to 32 patients without tumors (controls).
   RESULTS: Overall, no significant difference between test and control groups was noted in sphenoid sinus size or other parameters; however, significantly greater mean distances from the posterior margin of the planum sphenoidale to the diaphragma sella (0.76 +/- 0.23 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.27, respectively; P = 0.0001) and angle between the planum sphenoidale to anterior face of sella turcica (113.41 +/- 10.58 vs. 123.21 +/- 12.55, respectively; P = 0.001) were seen in patients with TSM and PSD, suggestive of a selective expansion of the tuberculum sellae region. TSM/sphenoid sinus morphologies were divided into 3 types (A, B, and C) based on the extent of tumor and sinus morphology. There was progressive increase in tumor volume and anteroposterior sinus diameter from sphenoidal PSD types A-C, which influenced selection of surgical approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that TSM-associated sphenoidal PSD leads to more selective splaying of the tuberculum sellae region rather than cumulative increase in sinus volume. This may lead to operative corridor expansion for endonasal access to TSM associated with sphenoidal PSD. A radiologic

They are associated with early onset cataract which can make ophthalmoscopy difficult. This report studies the transition between the normal and ectatic area in these cases with ultrasound. We evaluate "posterior hump" as a sign of differentiation between these two conditions.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate recovery and survival of severely wasted children without community management of acute malnutrition programme.
   Design: Single time point follow-up (24th December 2013-2nd April, 2014) of severely wasted children identified in a communitybased cross-sectional survey (September 2012-October 2013).
   Setting: Rural Meerut District, Uttar Pradesh, India.
   Participants: 409 severely wasted (WHO weight-for-height <-3Z), 6- to 59-month-old children.
   Outcome measures: Survival and recovery (weight-for-height >=-2Z).
   Results: Median (IQR) follow-up contact duration was 7.4 (6.6, 10.1) months. Among 11 deaths, there were 5 (case-fatality 1.2%), 6 (1.5%), 8 (2.0%) and 10 (2.4%) events within 1, 1.5, 4 and 6 months of enrolment, respectively. Ten deaths occurred in children aged between 6 and 24 months. Younger age (P=0.04), poorer household-head occupation (P=0.04) and lower enrolment anthropometry (any variable; P < 0.001) were significant predictors of mortality. Children below 18 months of age had higher adjusted mortality risk (HR 4.7; 95% CI 0.95, 22.51; P=0.053). At follow-up, 30% of survivors were still severely wasted, 39% were moderately wasted (weight-for-height -3 to <-2Z) and 31% had recovered spontaneously. Younger age (P < 0.001), female gender (P=0.04) and longer follow-up duration (P=0.003) were significant independent predictors of recovery. The adjusted OR (95% CI) for recovery < 24 months was 2.81 (1.70, 4.65).
   Conclusion: Without community management of acute malnutrition in rural Meerut District, severely wasted children had low (1.2%-2.7%) case-fatality with long-term spontaneous recovery of around 25-30%.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the effect of administration of 40-60 mL/kg of fluids as fluid boluses in aliquots of 20 mL/kg each over 15-20 minutes with that over 5-10 minutes each on the composite outcome of need for mechanical ventilation and/or impaired oxygenation-increase in oxygenation index by 5 from baseline in the initial 6 and 24 hours in children with septic shock.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Pediatric emergency and ICU of a tertiary care institute.
   Patients: Children (< 18 yr old) with septic shock.
   Interventions: We randomly assigned participants to 15-20 minutes bolus (study group) or 5-10 minutes bolus groups (control group).
   Measurements and Main Results: We assessed the composite outcomes in the initial 6 and 24 hours after fluid resuscitation in both groups. We performed logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with need for ventilation in the first hour. Data were analyzed using Stata 11.5. Of the 96 children, 45 were randomly assigned to "15-20 minutes group" and 51 to "5-10 minutes group." Key baseline characteristics were not different between the groups. When compared with 5-10 minutes group, fewer children in 15-20 minutes group needed mechanical ventilation or had an increase in oxygenation index in the first 6 hours (36% vs 57%; relative risk, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99) and 24 hours (43% vs 68%; relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42-0.93) after fluid resuscitation. We did not find any difference in secondary outcomes such as death (1.2; 0.70-2.03), length of stay (mean difference: 0.52; -1.72 to 2.7), or resolution of shock (0.98; 0.63-1.53).
   Conclusion: Children receiving fluid boluses over 5-10 minutes each had a higher risk of intubation than those receiving boluses over 15-20 minutes each. Notwithstanding the lack of difference in risk of mortality and the possibility that a lower threshold of intubation and mechanical ventilation was used in the presence of fluid overload, our results raise concerns on the current recommendation of administering boluses over 5-10 minutes each in children with septic shock.

AB  - For effective control of seizures, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are administered at higher dose which is associated with several adverse effects.This study envisaged antiepileptic and neuroprotective potential of Tulsi, a commonly used herb for its immunomodulatory property. The optimal dose of Ocimum sanctum hydroalcoholic extract (OSHE) was determined using maximal electroshock seizure (MES)- and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure models in Wistar rats (200-250 g) after administering OSHE (200-1000 mg/kg) orally for 14 days. For interaction study, OSHE optimal dose in combination with maximum and submaximal therapeutic doses of valproate was administered for 14 days. Serum levels of valproate were estimated using HPLC for pharmacokinetic study. For pharmacodynamic interaction, antiepileptic effect on above seizure models, neurobehavioral effect using Morris water maze, passive avoidance and elevated plus maze tests, and antioxidant capacity were assessed. Ocimum sanctum hydroalcoholic extract 1000 mg/kg was found to be optimal providing 50% protection against both MES- and PTZ-induced seizures. Combination of OSHE with valproate did not alter antiepileptic efficacy of valproate significantly. However, the combination showed better memory retention potential in neurobehavioral tests and protection against oxidative stress compared with valproate-alone-treated groups. Pharmacokinetic parameters did not reveal any significant change in combination group compared with valproate alone. Ocimum, although having per se antiepileptic action, did not affect antiepileptic action of valproate in combination. However, combination treatment has an edge over valproate alone better neurobehavioral function and reduced oxidative stress predicting adjuvant potential of Ocimum in epilepsy treatment.

AB  - Background/aim Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is the treatment of choice in Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) based on current data. Our objective was to evaluate outcomes and assess prognostic factors in BCS patients undergoing TIPS.
   Patients and methods In this retrospective analysis of a propectively maintained database, all consecutive BCS patients undergoing TIPS from September 2010 to February 2017 were included. Complete response after TIPS was defined as resolution of symptoms (ascites/pedal edema) with no requirement of diuretics at the end of 4 weeks. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to assess predictors of outcome and complications.
   Results Eighty patients with BCS who underwent TIPS were included; 40 (50%) were male. The mean age at onset of symptoms was 24.2 +/- 8.7 years. The median (range) follow-up was 660 (2-2400) days. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year rates for TIPS stent patency were 89, 81, and 81%, respectively. Cumulative encephalopathy-free rates were 91, 86, and 86%, respectively, and survival rates were 93, 89, and 84%, respectively. Eight (10.0%) patients died during follow-up, five within the first year (three of these five had incomplete response). On univariate analysis, serum bilirubin, response to intervention, serum creatinine, Child class, model for end-stage liver disease, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences-hepatic venous outflow tract obstruction score were significantly different between survivors and nonsurvivors. On multivariate analysis, response to therapy after TIPS (hazard ratio: 8.37; 95% confidence interval: 1.60-43.82) was independently associated with mortality. The 1-year survival was 97% in patients with complete response, compared with 59% in those with incomplete response (P < 0.004).
   Conclusion Incomplete symptom response after TIPS is associated with poor outcome and can be used for selection of patients for liver transplantation. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the role of various semiquantitative parameters obtained from fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET/CT in interim treatment response assessment in biopsy-proven non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to find the best parameter, if any.
   Materials and methods Totally, 32 patients (male/female: 25/7) with biopsy proven NSCLC and a mean age of 54.71 +/- 12.65 years were enrolled in the study. Each patient underwent whole-body F-18-FDG PET/CT scan after injecting 5.18-7.77 MBq/kg of F-18-FDG intravenously at baseline and after four cycles of chemotherapy. Five parameters - that is, target-to-background ratio (TBR), maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), average standardized uptake value (SUVavg), whole-body metabolic tumor volume (MTVwb), and whole-body total lesion glycolysis (TLGwb) - were evaluated for both scans along with their percentage changes (Delta). Patients were divided into two response groups as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria: responders and nonresponders. All parameters were compared among the two response groups using appropriate statistical methods; P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results All postchemotherapy parameters were found to have a significant role in the prediction of two response groups. Post-TBR had highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 with a sensitivity and specificity of 75 and 82%, respectively, at a cutoff value of 4. The Delta s, Delta MTVwb, Delta TLGwb, and Delta SUVmax were significant with cutoffs of -56, -75, and -32%, respectively. Delta MTVwb had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 with sensitivity and specificity of 81.25%. In multivariate analysis, post-TBR and Delta MTVwb were found to be the independent variables for prediction of interim treatment response.
   Conclusion Our study proves that a multitude of semiquantitative parameters as documented above differ significantly between two response groups in patients with advanced stage NSCLC receiving chemotherapy. Moreover, parameters in combination (Delta MTV and post-TBR) with appropriate cutoffs can predict response groups with acceptable reliability. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Iatrogenic cervical internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare and potentially lethal complication following tonsillectomy. It can be complicated by thromboembolism, mass effect and eventually may rupture leading to death. Various endovascular treatment options are available for the management of these pseudoaneurysms, including coil embolization, detachable balloon occlusion, or stent graft placement. Parent artery occlusion using detachable balloons can be a therapeutic option in a subset of patients. However, evaluation of cross circulation with preprocedure balloon test occlusion is imperative in such cases.

AB  - We describe the surgical technique of microscope integrated intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided small-incision lenticule extraction. The technique enables manual tracking of surgical instruments and identification of the desired dissection plane. It also helps discern the relation between the dissector and the intrastromal lenticule. The dissection plane becomes hyperreflective on dissection, ensuring complete separation of the intrastromal lenticule from the overlying and underlying stroma. Inadvertent posterior plane entry, cap lenticule adhesion, incomplete separation of the lenticule, creation of a false plane, and lenticule remnants may be recognized intraoperatively so corrective steps can be taken immediately. In cases with a hazy overlying cap, microscope-integrated intraoperative OCT enables localization and extraction of the lenticule. The technique is helpful for inexperienced surgeons, especially in cases with low amplitudes of refractive errors, ie, thin lenticules. (C) 2017 ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) is a growing public health concern, and data on drug resistance are limited.
   MATERIAL AND METHODS: Specimens from 2468 clinically diagnosed EPTB patients received at the Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) of a tertiary centre in India were subjected to Ziehl-Neelsen staining, Xpert (R) MTB/RIF testing, liquid culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) using automated BACTEC MGIT (TM) 960 (TM). Line-probe assay (LPA) was performed on all culture-positive isolates. Gene sequencing was performed on rifampicin-resistant/multidrug-resistant TB (RR/MDR-TB) and phenotypic/genotypic discrepant isolates.
   RESULTS: The culture positivity rate was 18.9% (483/2553). The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert in diagnosing EPTB were respectively 70.8% (95%CI 66.5-74.8) and 97.7% (95 %CI 96.9-98.3), with liquid culture as the reference standard. Prevalence of RR/MDR-TB was 10.1% (49/483). Prevalence of pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR-TB) was 18.4% (09/49), whereas the prevalence of XDR-TB among MDR-TB patients was 2% (01/49). The sensitivity of genotypic DST for the detection of rifampicin resistance was 92.7% (95%CI 81.1-98.5) and specificity was 99.3% (95%CI 97.5-99.9), with 100% concordance between Xpert and LPA.
   CONCLUSION: The burden of drug resistance, including M/XDR-TB, among EPTB patients is high. Novel molecular tests can help in early diagnosis and treatment to prevent disease progression and amplification of resistance.

AB  - Purpose: Children with generalized seizures are often excluded as epilepsy surgery candidates. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the utility of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to refine the location of the "irritative zone" in children with single lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but with generalized ictal electroencephalographic (EEG) findings. Methods: Patients admitted with refractory epilepsy with imaging studies showing focal or hemispheric abnormalities but scalp video EEG showing generalized or multiregional epileptiform abnormalities were included. Patients were encouraged into natural sleep, and simultaneous whole-head MEG/EEG was recorded. Source localization of epileptic spikes on MEG was carried out while blinded to other results. Acceptable dipoles were classified into 3 groups: focal, hemispheric clusters, and single focal cluster with additional widespread dipoles. Results: Nine patients (4 female, 5 males; ages 10 months to 15 years) were included. Two had focal features on clinical semiology, whereas all had generalized or multiregional interictal and ictal EEG. Etiologies included tuberous sclerosis complex (2), postencephalitic sequelae (1), focal cortical dysplasia (1), and unknown (2). Five patients had clear focal lesions on brain MRI whereas the other 2 had focal positron emission tomography (PET) abnormalities. An average of 38 spikes were accepted (average goodness of fit = 85.3%). A single tight cluster of dipoles was identified in 5 patients, 1 had dipoles with propagation from left occipital to right temporal. One patient had 2 distinct dipole clusters. MEG demonstrated focal findings 9 times more often than the simultaneously recorded scalp EEG, and 3 times more often than the associated multiday video EEG recordings. Conclusion: This study shows that neurophysiologic evidence of focal epileptiform abnormalities in patients with focal brain lesions and generalized EEG findings can be strengthened using MEG. Further feasibility of surgical candidacy should be evaluated in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: To determine rate of change over time on scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, HRT, compared to perimetry, and to determine incidence, parametric changes, and risk factors for progression in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and chronic primary angle closure angle glaucoma (CPACG) eyes. Methods: Prospective clinical study of 116 POAG eyes and 129 CPACG eyes of different severities of glaucoma. Standard automated perimetry and optic nerve head topography were studied at baseline and thereafter every 6 months. Changes in HFA and HRT parameters, in response to IOP, were compared over at least 5 years. Results: Fourteen POAG eyes (12.1%) and 20 CPACG eyes (15.5%) showed progression on SAP over time. Percentage drop of IOP was similar in eyes that progressed and in stable eyes. The change in MD in CPACG eyes was 1.8 dB/year on SAP and 1.36 dB/year in POAG eyes, P=0.1. Twenty-nine eyes showed progression on HRT with 24 confirmed on SAP. Trend analysis picked up progression more frequently than other HRT parameters. Eyes that progressed in both groups, in all severities of glaucoma, had intermittent fluctuations of >= 4 mmHg over mean IOP on >= 3 follow up visits, P <= 0.001. Conclusion: IOP fluctuations of >= 4 mmHg over the mean IOP and duration of disease were associated with progression in POAG and CPACG eyes.

AB  - Objectives Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a key indicator of health. However, HRQOL data from representative populations in South Asia are lacking. This study aims to describe HRQOL overall, by age, gender and socioeconomic status, and examine the associations between selected chronic conditions and HRQOL in adults from three urban cities in South Asia.
   Methods We used data from 16 287 adults aged >= 20 years from the baseline survey of the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia cohort (2010-2011). HRQOL was measured using the European Quality of Life Five Dimension-Visual Analogue Scale (EQ5D-VAS), which measures health status on a scale of 0 (worst health status) to 100 (best possible health status).
   Results 16 284 participants completed the EQ5D-VAS. Mean age was 42.4 (+/- 13.3) years and 52.4% were women. 14% of the respondents reported problems in mobility and pain/discomfort domains. Mean VAS score was 74 (95% CI 73.7 to 74.2). Significantly lower health status was found in elderly (64.1), women (71.6), unemployed (68.4), less educated (71.2) and low-income group (73.4). Individuals with chronic conditions reported worse health status than those without (67.4 vs 76.2): prevalence ratio, 1.8 (95% CI 1.61 to 2.04).
   Conclusions Our data demonstrate significantly lower HRQOL in key demographic groups and those with chronic conditions, which is consistent with previous studies. These data provide insights on inequalities in population health status, and potentially reveal unmet needs in the community to guide health policies.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) belongs to mammalian heme peroxidase superfamily, which also includes myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). LPO catalyzes the oxidation of a number of substrates including thiocyanate while TPO catalyzes the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones. LPO is also been shown to catalyze the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones indicating similar functional and structural properties. The binding studies showed that 2-mercaptoimidazole (MZY) bound to LPO with a dissociation constant of 0.63 mu M. The inhibition studies showed that the value of IC50 was 17 mu M. The crystal structure of the complex of LPO with MZY showed that MZY bound to LPO in the substrate-binding site on the distal heme side. MZY was oriented in the substrate-binding site in such a way that the sulfur atom is at a distance of 2.58 angstrom from the heme iron. Previously, a similar compound, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (amitrole) was also shown to bind to LPO in the substrate-binding site on the distal heme side. The amino nitrogen atom of amitrole occupied the same position as that of sulfur atom in the present structure indicating a similar mode of binding. Recently, the structure of the complex of LPO with a potent antithyroid drug, 1-methylimidazole-2-thiol (methimazole, MMZ) was also determined. It showed that MMZ bound to LPO in the substrate-binding site on the distal heme side with 2 orientations. The position of methyl group was same in the 2 orientations while the positions of sulfur atom differed indicating a higher preference for a methyl group.

AB  - Trendelenburg positioning is commonly used to temporarily treat intraoperative hypotension. The Trendelenburg position improves cardiac output in normovolemic or anesthetized patients, but not hypovolemic or non-anesthetized patients. Therefore, the response to Trendelenburg positioning may vary depending on patient population or hemodynamic conditions. We thus tested the hypothesis that the effectiveness of the Trendelenburg position, as indicated by an increase in cardiac output, improves after replacement of a stenotic aortic valve. Secondarily, we evaluated whether measurements of left ventricular preload, systolic function, or afterload were associated with the response to Trendelenburg positioning.
   This study is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial which included patients having aortic valve replacement (AVR) who were monitored with pulmonary artery catheters (NCT01187329). We examined changes in thermodilution cardiac output with Trendelenburg positioning before and after AVR. We also examined whether echocardiographic and hemodynamic measurements of preload, afterload, and systolic function were associated with changes in cardiac output during Trendelenburg positioning.
   Thirty-seven patients were included. The median [IQR] cardiac output change with Trendelenburg positioning was -3% [-10%, 5%] before AVR versus +4% [-4%, 15%] after AVR. Estimated median difference in cardiac output with Trendelenburg was 5% (95% CI 1, 15%, P = 0.04) greater after AVR. The response to Trendelenburg positioning was largely independent of hemodynamic conditions.
   The response to Trendelenburg positioning improved following AVR, but by a clinically unimportant amount. The response to Trendelenburg positioning was independent of hemodynamic conditions.

AB  - The focus of primary prevention is on reducing the disease incidence. Primary prevention in mental health has been given minimal priority in low-resource settings with no significant investments. General hospitals are one of the main providers of mental health services in South Asia. This paper focuses on primary prevention activities, which can be undertaken in a general hospital in South Asia with abysmally low-mental health resources. For implementing primary prevention in psychiatry, a general hospital may be conceptualized as a population unit, located in a well-populated area with easy accessibility where different kinds of communities, for example, students and resident doctors, consultants, patients and their caregivers, and paramedical, nursing, administrative and other supportive staff, coexist and have varied functions. All the functional components of the general hospital psychiatric units (GHPUs) offer scope for introducing primary preventive psychiatry services. Psychiatrists in GHPUs can lead efforts for primary prevention in mental health in the hospital by employing strategies in the framework of universal, selective, and indicated prevention. The preventive strategies could be targeted at the patients visiting the hospital for various health services and their caregivers, employees, and the trainees. Similar principles can be employed in teaching and training.

AB  - Breast cancer in India is becoming the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in urban women. In developed countries, the mortality from breast cancer has decreased in the past few years attributable to better awareness of disease, screening programs, early detection and more effective treatment available. Although widely used, the screening programs running in the western countries have been a point of criticism in the recent years as they lead to increased healthcare cost and detection of otherwise benign and clinically insignificant breast lesion (both benign and malignant). Also in a developing country like ours where the awareness about breast cancer among the ladies is itself poor, whether screening is feasible and cost-effective is a matter of ongoing debate. We conducted this literature review to ascertain the importance of breast cancer awareness, breast self-examination, and clinical breast examination as effective screening tools in a resource deficient country like India.

AB  - Randomized controlled trials have become the most respected scientific tool to measure the effectiveness of a medical therapy. The design, conduct and analysis of randomized controlled trials were developed by Sir Ronald A. Fisher, a mathematician in Great Britain. Fisher propounded that the process of randomization would equally distribute all the known and even unknown covariates in the two or more comparison groups, so that any difference observed could be ascribed to treatment effect. Today, we observe that in many situations, this prediction of Fisher does not stand true; hence, adaptive randomization schedules have been designed to adjust for major imbalance in important covariates. Present essay unravels some weaknesses inherent in Fisherian concept of randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Cutaneous adverse drug reaction (cADR) has limited epidemiological data in India. The older antiepileptic drugs, i.e., carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, phenobarbitone, etc., induce severe cADRs that have a strong associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related genetic risk factors. There is also evidence of association of certain HLA alleles with lamotrigine (LTG)- induced cADRs, but this has not been reported in the Indian population. Here, we report case series of three patients with LTG-induced "Stevens-John son syndrome (SJS)." Their HLA-B typing was also performed which showed the presence of HLA-B*15:02 in one case with SJS.

AB  - Background: Epidemiological studies analysing the course of Bipolar Disorder (BD) are relatively rare in the Asian context, contributing to the uncertainty regarding the prevalent course patterns and factors influencing such patterns. The current review identifies the regional characteristics of BD course patterns and the associated factors.
   Methods: A review of the existing literature was done using 'PubMed' and 'Cochrane' databases which yielded 145 studies including those from all 48 Asian countries. Relevant discussions from the Western literature were incorporated.
   Results: Regional and cross-national studies reveal a mania-predominant course in BD in Asian countries. Prolonged depressive episodes and comorbid anxiety disorders worsen the course of BD-II. Certain risk factors such as the young age of onset and greater episode frequency are useful predictors of bipolar diatheses. Substance use disorder comorbidity is more prevalent in males whereas depression and suicidal behaviours are more frequent in females with BD. Comorbid anxiety and personality disorders also encumber the illness course. Logistic reasons and ignorance of side-effects were specifically associated with poor adherence. An 'eveningness' chronotype and poor sleep quality were associated with frequent recurrences. Seasonal patterns vary among men and women, especially for depressive episodes.
   Limitations: The effects of treatment and childhood BD course features were not discussed.
   Conclusions: There are region-specific characteristics in bipolar illness course and factors influencing such course patterns compared to the rest of the World. Future research from Asia shall attempt to study the neurobiological underpinnings of such characteristics and plan appropriate strategies to address the same.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are known for early age at presentation, large tumor sizes, and overall poor prognosis. However, Indian studies are scarce with limited follow-up data. Hence, the present study is aimed at characterizing nonmetastatic TNBC patients in our population and comparing their outcome with non-TNBC subset. METHODOLOGY: This is a retrospective observational study of nonmetastatic breast cancer patients accrued over 14 years. The demographic, clinical, and pathological profiles of TNBCs and their patterns of recurrences and survivals were compared to that of non-TNBC. Overall and disease-free survival (DFSs) were calculated from the time of initiation of therapy to the occurrence of event, i.e., death or recurrence. RESULTS: TNBC constituted 21.8% of all patients. Patients with triple-negative subtype were significantly younger and more likely to be premenopausal. Higher proportion of TNBC presented in locally advanced stage and had a higher proportion of node-positive patients compared to their non-TNBC counterparts. Although taxane-based neoadjuvant therapy was associated with significantly higher pathological complete responses, recurrences occurred earlier in TNBC. Even though inferior overall and DFSs were encountered in TNBC, statistical significance could not be derived. CONCLUSIONS: TNBCs are a subset of tumors with a poorly understood tumor biology and behavior. Despite being labeled as having an aggressive tumor biology and behavior, not many differences are seen in their clinical outcomes when they present as locally advanced cases.

AB  - This study, for the first time, reveals the role of M.leprae-specific CD4(+)TCR gamma delta(+)FoxP3(+) cells in the progression and pathogenesis of leprosy. Co-culture with CD4(+)CD25(-) cells suggested the immunosuppressive nature of CD4(+)TCR gamma delta(+) cells in dose-dependent manner. Isolation of CD4(+)TCR gamma delta(+) cells from leprosy patients and then culture in presence of M.leprae cell wall antigens (MLCwA) along with TGF beta, IPP and IL-2 suggested that these cells are M.leprae specific. TGF-beta-mediated SMAD3 signalling was turned out to be major factor towards the expression of FoxP3 in these cells. SMAD3 silencing during induction of these cells barely showed the induction of FoxP3. High density of SMAD3 binding at TGF beta RII in CD4(+)TCR gamma delta(+)FoxP3(+) furthermore suggested the TGF-beta-directed SMAD3 signalling in these cells. Taken together the above data, we can conclude that CD4(+)TCR gamma delta(+)FoxP3(+) cells possess the potential to track the severity of the disease in leprosy patients.

AB  - Background: Fracture-dislocation is the extreme variant of injury to the proximal humerus that occurs more commonly in young adults as a result of high-velocity trauma. We evaluated the functional and radiologic outcome of fixation of proximal humeral fracture-dislocations with locked plates.
   Methods: This was a retrospective review of 33 proximal humeral fracture-dislocations in 29 patients with a mean age of 35 years (range, 19-60 years) treated by open reduction and internal fixation with locked plates between January 2009 and December 2013. The fracture-dislocation in 85% was the result of high-energy trauma resulting in 3- or 4-part fracture-dislocation. The fracture-dislocation was anterior in 27 and posterior in 6.
   Results: The average delay from injury to surgery was 7 days (range, 1-35 days), with a mean follow-up of 40 months (range, 24-66 months). All of the fractures united at an average of 15 weeks after surgery. At the final follow-up, the mean forward flexion was 129 degrees (range, 100 degrees-160 degrees), and mean abduction was 128 degrees (range, 100 degrees-150 degrees). The mean Constant score at the final follow-up was 78 points (range, 68-88 points). One case of complete osteonecrosis of the humeral head and 1 case of partial osteonecrosis of the humeral head were noted. Two cases of screw perforation of the humeral head were seen, with subsequent restricted range of motion improving after removal of the offending screws.
   Conclusions: Most young patients with 3- and 4-part proximal humeral fracture-dislocations can achieve good functional outcome after fixation with locked plates. (C) 2017 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pleural tuberculosis (pTB) is a grave form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Microbiological tests are usually found to be inadequate for pTB diagnosis. The absence of a uniform 'composite reference standard' is challenging; therefore, diagnosis is usually performed using a combination of diversified criteria. Nucleic acid tests vary in diagnostic accuracy and have not yet been integrated into clinical decision making. This review assesses the varied criteria used for pTB classification and the challenges afflicting pleural fluid-based DNA diagnostic tests, namely, PCR and Xpert (R) MTB/RIF. In the 58 studies (PCR: n = 33; Xpert: n = 25) analyzed, reference standards were heterogeneous and PCR/Xpert pooled sensitivity values (range: 0-100%) were inadequate. However, the consistent high specificity of Xpert (range: 90-100%) indicated its utility as a 'rule-in' test. There is an urgent need to evaluate existing and new molecular tests in well-designed studies to accurately assess their utility for pTB diagnosis. To conclude, rapid and accurate tests are warranted for pTB diagnosis.

KW  - PROGNOSIS
AB  - A 15-year old male patient presented to us with dyspnoea for four days. He had a history of fever, pseudo-membranous tonsillitis and cervical adenopathy twenty-five days prior to the presentation. On examination and laboratory investigations, he had features suggestive of myocarditis with biventricular failure. There was no reliable history of immunisation and he had a positive history of contact. He was planned for anti-diphtheria toxin but before the anti-toxin could be initiated, the patient succumbed to refractory cardiogenic shock. This was a rare case of late onset diphtheritic myocarditis in an unimmunised adult. With the advent of universal immunisation, there has been a significant decline in the incidence but there is still some road to cover.

AB  - To evaluate the shared genetic etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and coronary heart disease (CHD), we conducted a genome-wide, multi-ancestry study of genetic variation for both diseases in up to 265,678 subjects for T2D and 260,365 subjects for CHD. We identify 16 previously unreported loci for T2D and 1 locus for CHD, including a new T2D association at a missense variant in HLA-DRB5 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.29). We show that genetically mediated increase in T2D risk also confers higher CHD risk. Joint T2D-CHD analysis identified eight variants-two of which are coding-where T2D and CHD associations appear to colocalize, including a new joint T2D-CHD association at the CCDC92 locus that also replicated for T2D. The variants associated with both outcomes implicate new pathways as well as targets of existing drugs, including icosapent ethyl and adipocyte fatty-acid-binding protein.

AB  - The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak demonstrates that cost-effective clinical diagnostics are urgently needed to detect and distinguish viral infections to improve patient care. Unlike dengue virus (DENV), ZIKV infections during pregnancy correlate with severe birth defects, including microcephaly and neurological disorders. Because ZIKV and DENV are related flaviviruses, their homologous proteins and nucleic acids can cause cross-reactions and false-positive results in molecular, antigenic, and serologic diagnostics. We report the characterization of monoclonal antibody pairs that have been translated into rapid immunochromatography tests to specifically detect the viral nonstructural 1 (NS1) protein antigen and distinguish the four DENV serotypes (DENV1-4) and ZIKV without cross-reaction. To complement visual test analysis and remove user subjectivity in reading test results, we used image processing and data analysis for data capture and test result quantification. Using a 30-ml serum sample, the sensitivity and specificity values of the DENV1-4 tests and the pan-DENV test, which detects all four dengue serotypes, ranged from 0.76 to 1.00. Sensitivity/specificity for the ZIKV rapid test was 0.81/0.86, respectively, using a 150-mu l serum input. Serum ZIKV NS1 protein concentrations were about 10-fold lower than corresponding DENV NS1 concentrations in infected patients; moreover, ZIKV NS1 protein was not detected in polymerase chain reactionpositive patient urine samples. Our rapid immunochromatography approach and reagents have immediate application in differential clinical diagnosis of acute ZIKV and DENV cases, and the platform can be applied toward developing rapid antigen diagnostics for emerging viruses.

AB  - Background The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of "leaving no one behind". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.
   Methods We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97.5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment.
   Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56.7 (IQR 31.9-66.8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86.8, 95% uncertainty interval 84.6-88.9), Iceland (86.0, 84.1-87.6), and Sweden (85.6, 81.8-87.8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10.9, 9.6-11.9), the Central African Republic (11.0, 8.8-13.8), and Somalia (11.3, 9.5-13.1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past.
   Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations. Copyright The Authors.

AB  - Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates on the importance of addressing risks in context.
   Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined.
   Findings Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124.1 million DALYs [95% UI 111.2 million to 137.0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122.2 million DALYs [110.3 million to 133.3 million], and low birthweight and short gestation (83.0 million DALYs [78.3 million to 87.7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood pressure (89.9 million DALYs [80.9 million to 98.2 million]), high body-mass index (64.8 million DALYs [44.4 million to 87.6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63.8 million DALYs [53.2 million to 76.3 million]). In 2016 in 113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 9.3% (6.9-11.6) decline in deaths and a 10.8% (8.3-13.1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population ageing accounts for 14.9% (12.7-17.5) of deaths and 6.2% (3.9-8.7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of deaths and 12.4% (10.1-14.9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27.3% (24.9-29.7) of the change in DALYs between 2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks.
   Interpretation Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively small part in the past decade. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB  - Background Measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research, policy development, and programme decision making. Using the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016, we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and healthy life expectancy (HALE). We used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Methods We used results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 for all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and non-fatal disease burden to derive HALE and DALYs by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. We calculated DALYs by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location, age group, sex, and year. We estimated HALE using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita. We explored how DALYs and HALE differed from expected trends when compared with the SDI: the geometric mean of income per person, educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years, and total fertility rate.
   Findings The highest globally observed HALE at birth for both women and men was in Singapore, at 75.2 years (95% uncertainty interval 71.9-78.6) for females and 72.0 years (68.8-75.1) for males. The lowest for females was in the Central African Republic (45.6 years [42.0-49.5]) and for males was in Lesotho (41.5 years [39.0-44.0]). From 1990 to 2016, global HALE increased by an average of 6.24 years (5.97-6.48) for both sexes combined. Global HALE increased by 6.04 years (5.74-6.27) for males and 6.49 years (6.08-6.77) for females, whereas HALE at age 65 years increased by 1.78 years (1.61-1.93) for males and 1.96 years (1.69-2.13) for females. Total global DALYs remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (-2.3% [-5.9 to 0.9]), with decreases in communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) disease DALYs offset by increased DALYs due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The exemplars, calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised DALY rates in 2016, were Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Maldives, Peru, and Israel. The leading three causes of DALYs globally were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and lower respiratory infections, comprising 16.1% of all DALYs. Total DALYs and age-standardised DALY rates due to most CMNN causes decreased from 1990 to 2016. Conversely, the total DALY burden rose for most NCDs; however, age-standardised DALY rates due to NCDs declined globally.
   Interpretation At a global level, DALYs and HALE continue to show improvements. At the same time, we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss. Rising SDI was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in CMNN DALYs offset by increased NCD DALYs. Relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions, which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person, education, and family planning. The analysis of DALYs and HALE and their relationship to SDI represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance. Country-specific drivers of disease burden, particularly for causes with higher-than-expected DALYs, should inform health policies, health system improvement initiatives, targeted prevention efforts, and development assistance for health, including financial and research investments for all countries, regardless of their level of sociodemographic development. The presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices, which can help to extend gains, whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust support.

AB  - Background Monitoring levels and trends in premature mortality is crucial to understanding how societies can address prominent sources of early death. The Global Burden of Disease 2016 Study (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of cause-specific mortality for 264 causes in 195 locations from 1980 to 2016. This assessment includes evaluation of the expected epidemiological transition with changes in development and where local patterns deviate from these trends.
   Methods We estimated cause-specific deaths and years of life lost (YLLs) by age, sex, geography, and year. YLLs were calculated from the sum of each death multiplied by the standard life expectancy at each age. We used the GBD cause of death database composed of: vital registration (VR) data corrected for under-registration and garbage coding; national and subnational verbal autopsy (VA) studies corrected for garbage coding; and other sources including surveys and surveillance systems for specific causes such as maternal mortality. To facilitate assessment of quality, we reported on the fraction of deaths assigned to GBD Level 1 or Level 2 causes that cannot be underlying causes of death (major garbage codes) by location and year. Based on completeness, garbage coding, cause list detail, and time periods covered, we provided an overall data quality rating for each location with scores ranging from 0 stars (worst) to 5 stars (best). We used robust statistical methods including the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) to generate estimates for each location, year, age, and sex. We assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific deaths in relation to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of average income per capita, educational attainment, and total fertility, with locations grouped into quintiles by SDI. Relative to GBD 2015, we expanded the GBD cause hierarchy by 18 causes of death for GBD 2016.
   Findings The quality of available data varied by location. Data quality in 25 countries rated in the highest category (5 stars), while 48, 30, 21, and 44 countries were rated at each of the succeeding data quality levels. Vital registration or verbal autopsy data were not available in 27 countries, resulting in the assignment of a zero value for data quality. Deaths from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) represented 72.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 71.2-73.2) of deaths in 2016 with 19.3% (18.5-20.4) of deaths in that year occurring from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases and a further 8.43% (8.00-8.67) from injuries. Although age-standardised rates of death from NCDs decreased globally between 2006 and 2016, total numbers of these deaths increased; both numbers and age-standardised rates of death from CMNN causes decreased in the decade 2006-16-age-standardised rates of deaths from injuries decreased but total numbers varied little. In 2016, the three leading global causes of death in children under-5 were lower respiratory infections, neonatal preterm birth complications, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma, combined resulting in 1.80 million deaths (95% UI 1.59 million to 1.89 million). Between 1990 and 2016, a profound shift toward deaths at older ages occurred with a 178% (95% UI 176-181) increase in deaths in ages 90-94 years and a 210% (208-212) increase in deaths older than age 95 years. The ten leading causes by rates of age-standardised YLL significantly decreased from 2006 to 2016 (median annualised rate of change was a decrease of 2.89%); the median annualised rate of change for all other causes was lower (a decrease of 1.59%) during the same interval. Globally, the five leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were cardiovascular diseases; diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and other common infectious diseases; neoplasms; neonatal disorders; and HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. At a finer level of disaggregation within cause groupings, the ten leading causes of total YLLs in 2016 were ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, road injuries, malaria, neonatal preterm birth complications, HIV/AIDS, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and neonatal encephalopathy due to birth asphyxia and trauma. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of total YLLs in 113 countries for men and 97 countries for women. Comparisons of observed levels of YLLs by countries, relative to the level of YLLs expected on the basis of SDI alone, highlighted distinct regional patterns including the greater than expected level of YLLs from malaria and from HIV/AIDS across sub-Saharan Africa; diabetes mellitus, especially in Oceania; interpersonal violence, notably within Latin America and the Caribbean; and cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, particularly in eastern and central Europe. The level of YLLs from ischaemic heart disease was less than expected in 117 of 195 locations. Other leading causes of YLLs for which YLLs were notably lower than expected included neonatal preterm birth complications in many locations in both south Asia and southeast Asia, and cerebrovascular disease in western Europe.
   Interpretation The past 37 years have featured declining rates of communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases across all quintiles of SDI, with faster than expected gains for many locations relative to their SDI. A global shift towards deaths at older ages suggests success in reducing many causes of early death. YLLs have increased globally for causes such as diabetes mellitus or some neoplasms, and in some locations for causes such as drug use disorders, and conflict and terrorism. Increasing levels of YLLs might reflect outcomes from conditions that required high levels of care but for which effective treatments remain elusive, potentially increasing costs to health systems.

AB  - Lipids are most adaptable molecules that acclimatize to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). The precise molecular mechanism of this acclimatization achieved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) remains elusive. Although lipids of MTB have been characterized to some details, a comparable resource does not exist between drug sensitive (DS) and resistant (DR) strains of MTB. Here, by employing high-throughput mass spectrometry- based lipidomic approach, we attempted to analyze the differential lipidome profile of DS and DR MTB clinical isolates. We analyzed three major classes of lipids viz fatty acyls, glycerophospholipids and glycerolipids and their respective subclasses. Notably, we observed differential fatty acyls and glycerophospholipids as evident from increased mycolic acids phosphatidylinositol mannosides, phosphatidylinositol, cardiolipin and triacylglycerides abundance, respectively, which are crucial for MTB virulence and pathogenicity. Considering the fact that 30% of the MTB genome codes for lipid, this comprehensive lipidomic approach unravels extensive lipid alterations in DS and DR that will serve as a resource for identifying biomarkers aimed at disrupting the functions of MTB lipids responsible for MDR acquisition in MTB.

AB  - Background As mortality rates decline, life expectancy increases, and populations age, non-fatal outcomes of diseases and injuries are becoming a larger component of the global burden of disease. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
   Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER).
   Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57.6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40.8-75.9 million [7.2%, 6.0-8.3]), 45.1 million (29.0-62.8 million [5.6%, 4.0-7.2]), 36.3 million (25.3-50.9 million [4.5%, 3.8-5.3]), 34.7 million (23.0-49.6 million [4.3%, 3.5-5.2]), and 34.1 million (23.5-46.0 million [4.2%, 3.2-5.3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2.7% (95% UI 2.3-3.1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10.4% (95% UI 9.0-11.8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228).
   Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-todate information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

AB  - Background Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016.
   Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone.
   Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016.
   Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

AB  - Purpose: Glutathione S transferase (GST) polymorphisms have been considered risk factors for the development of glaucoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes with juvenile open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) in Indian patients.
   Methods: A case-control study was performed to investigate the associations of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in juvenile open-angle glaucoma. The genotype of GSTM1 and GSTT1 were determined in 73 juvenile open-angle glaucoma patients, and 70 controls matched by age and sex by polymerase chain reaction method. We also performed a meta-analysis of sixteen published studies on GSTM1 and GSTT1 and evaluated the association between the GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms and glaucoma (JOAG & POAG). Published literature from PubMed and other databases were retrieved. All studies evaluating the association between GSTMI and GSTT1 polymorphisms and glaucoma (JOAG & POAG) risk were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random- or fixed-effects model.
   Results: In the present study, we observed there is no association of GSTMI (OR = 0.680; 95% CI = 0.323-1.433; p = 0.311) or GSTT1 (OR = 0.698; 95% CI = 0.307-1.586; p = 0.391) with JOAG. In the present meta-analysis, significantly increased glaucoma (JOAG & POAG) risk was found among subjects carrying GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 1.177; 95% CI = 1.028-1.348; p = 0.018) but not among subjects carrying GSTT1 deletion genotype (OR = 1.186; 95% CI = 0.992-1.417; p = 0.061).
   Conclusions: The present case-control study found that GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphism are not associated with JOAG risk in North Indian population. The present meta-analysis suggested that there might be a significant association of GSTM1 null genotype with glaucoma (JOAG & POAG) risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in the world to investigate role of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms with JOAG susceptibility. Given the limited sample size, the associations between GST polymorphism and glaucoma risk needs further investigation.

AB  - To understand the process of neurogenesis, generation of functional dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) is important. BDNF has been reported to be responsible for inducing neuronal maturation and functionality. Previously, we have reported the efficient generation of neurons from human bone marrow derived MSCs using FGF2 alone. We hypothesize that hMSCs from various tissues [(bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AD) and dental pulp (DP)], if treated with BDNF on 9th day of induction, alongwith FGF2 will generate functional DAergic neurons. Hence, cells were characterized at morphometric, transcription and translational levels for various markers like MAP2, TH, NGN2, PITX3, DAT, synaptophysin, Kv4.2 and SCN5A. Functionality of in vitro generated neurons was studied by calcium ion imaging. Result analysis depicted that BDNF has effect on expression of dopaminergic neuronal markers at gene and protein levels and functionality of neurons. Among these hMSCs, DP-MSC showed significantly better neuronal characteristics in terms of morphology, expression of neuronal markers and foremost, functionality of neurons. From the present study, therefore, we concluded that i) BDNF has additive effect on neuronal characteristics and functionality ii) DP-MSC are better MSC candidate to study DAergic neurogenesis and perform future studies.

AB  - The drift kinetic energy of ionic flow through single ion channels cause vibrations of the pore walls which are observed as open-state current fluctuations (open-channel noise) during single-channel recordings. Vibration of the pore wall leads to transitions among different conformational sub-states of the channel protein in the open-state. Open-channel noise analysis can provide important information about the different conformational sub-state transitions and how biochemical modifications of ion channels would affect their transport properties. It has been shown that c-Jun N-terminal kinase-3 (JNK3) becomes activated by phosphorylation in various neurodegenerative diseases and phosphorylates outer mitochondrion associated proteins leading to neuronal apoptosis. In our earlier work, JNK3 has been reported to phosphorylate purified rat brain mitochondrial voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) in vitro and modify its conductance and opening probability. In this article we have compared the open state noise profile of the native and the JNK3 phosphorylated VDAC using Power Spectral Density vs frequency plots. Power spectral density analysis of open-state noise indicated power law with average slope value alpha approximate to 1 for native VDAC at both positive and negative voltage whereas average alpha value <0.5 for JNK3 phosphorylated VDAC at both positive and negative voltage. It is proposed that 1/f(1) power law in native VDAC open-state noise arises due to coupling of ionic transport and conformational sub-states transitions in open-state and this coupling is perturbed as a result of channel phosphorylation.

AB  - Background We have previously estimated that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was associated with 22% of all episodes of (severe) acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) resulting in 55 000 to 199 000 deaths in children younger than 5 years in 2005. In the past 5 years, major research activity on RSV has yielded substantial new data from developing countries. With a considerably expanded dataset from a large international collaboration, we aimed to estimate the global incidence, hospital admission rate, and mortality from RSV-ALRI episodes in young children in 2015.
   Methods We estimated the incidence and hospital admission rate of RSV-associated ALRI (RSV-ALRI) in children younger than 5 years stratified by age and World Bank income regions from a systematic review of studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2016, and unpublished data from 76 high quality population-based studies. We estimated the RSV-ALRI incidence for 132 developing countries using a risk factor-based model and 2015 population estimates. We estimated the in-hospital RSV-ALRI mortality by combining in-hospital case fatality ratios with hospital admission estimates from hospital-based (published and unpublished) studies. We also estimated overall RSV-ALRI mortality by identifying studies reporting monthly data for ALRI mortality in the community and RSV activity.
   Findings We estimated that globally in 2015, 33.1 million (uncertainty range [UR] 21.6-50.3) episodes of RSV-ALRI, resulted in about 3.2 million (2.7-3.8) hospital admissions, and 59 600 (48 000-74 500) in-hospital deaths in children younger than 5 years. In children younger than 6 months, 1.4 million (UR 1.2-1.7) hospital admissions, and 27 300 (UR 20 700-36 200) in-hospital deaths were due to RSV-ALRI. We also estimated that the overall RSV-ALRI mortality could be as high as 118 200 (UR 94 600-149 400). Incidence and mortality varied substantially from year to year in any given population.
   Interpretation Globally, RSV is a common cause of childhood ALRI and a major cause of hospital admissions in young children, resulting in a substantial burden on health-care services. About 45% of hospital admissions and inhospital deaths due to RSV-ALRI occur in children younger than 6 months. An effective maternal RSV vaccine or monoclonal antibody could have a substantial effect on disease burden in this age group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is on the rise. Apart from the core behavioral issues of impaired communication, impaired social interaction, and restricted and/or repeated behavioral phenotype, comorbidities like sleep problems are increasingly getting recognized as important determinants of management and overall quality of life. METHODS: This study was conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India over a two year period. Children diagnosed with ASD and normally developing children (control subjects) aged 3 to 10 years were enrolled in the study. Both groups underwent sleep evaluation based on the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire. Children with ASD also underwent polysomnography, Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Childhood Behavioral Checklist, and Developmental Profile 3 assessments. RESULTS: The prevalence of poor sleepers among children with ASD and control subjects was 77.5% (confidence interval 66 to 86.5). and 29.2% (confidence interval 18.6 to 41.5), respectively (P < 0.001). The salient findings on polysomnography were reduced sleep efficiency, decreased rapid eye movement and slow wave sleep duration, and desaturation index>1. The Childhood Behavioral Checklist score was significantly high in poor sleepers compared with good sleepers on Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire (P = 0.004). There was no correlation of Childhood Autism Rating Scale or Developmental Profile 3 score with sleep problems in children with ASD. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly three fourths of children with ASD have sleep abnormalities with a possible effect on the behavioral phenotype. The poly-somnographic findings provide further insight with opportunity for pharmacological interventions. Screening for sleep problems is imperative for the appropriate management and overall improvement in quality of life in children with ASD.

AB  - Introduction: There is paucity of data on sofosubvir (SOF)-based therapy in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). The objective of this report is to describe our experience using SOF-based direct antiviral agent (DAA) therapy in MHD patients in India.
   Methods: All patients on MHD and treated with SOF-based therapy were included in this study. Before starting treatment, viral load, genotype, liver fibroscan, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed in all patients. SOF 400 mg/d or on an alternate day, ribavirin 200 mg/d and daclatasvir 60 mg/d were used in different regimens. Hepatitis C virus RNA was assessed at day 10 and at 4 weeks, at end of therapy, and at 12 weeks after stopping therapy.
   Results: A total of 62 treatment-naive patients were included. Mean age was 33.3 +/- 10.2 years; 66% were men. Median number of copies were 106/dl. None had clinical evidence of cirrhosis. The most common genotype was genotype 1 in 64.5% of cases, followed by genotype 3 in 29% of cases. Thirtynine patients were treated with SOF every other day/ribavirin, 2 patients with SOF daily/ribavirin, 6 with SOF every other day/daclatasvir, and 15 patients with SOF daily/daclatasvir. All patients were treated for 12 weeks. Fifty-nine (95.2%) patients had a sustained viral response (SVR). There was no impact of genotype on SVR. Twenty-three patients (37%) had complications while on therapy; 13 (20.3%) had dyspepsia, 4 had tuberculosis, and 3 had bacterial pneumonia. Most of the patients (n = 23; 56%) in the ribavirin group required an increase in the erythropoietin dose. No patient discontinued therapy due to complications.
   Discussion: SOF-based DAAs were well tolerated and efficacious in this cohort of patients on MHD.

AB  - Staphylococcus hominis subsp. novobiosepticus is a new sub-species of S. hominis, thus dividing S. hominis into subsp. hominis and novobiosepticus. This study was designed to identify subsp. novobiosepticus isolates amongst the S. hominis isolated from blood samples of patients with malignancy and septicaemia and to study their resistance profile. The identification was performed by using three simple tests which differentiated between the two sub-species. It was found that 22.8 per cent of S. hominis isolates belonged to subsp. novobiosepticus.

AB  - Objective: Deep brain stimulation of subthalamic nucleus (DBS-STN) is a well-accepted treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) but its effect on motor planning in the disease is yet unclear. This study examines the effect of switching the stimulation ON and OFF on components of bereitschaftspotentials in PD.
   Patients and methods: Scalp bereitschaftspotentials were recorded during self-paced right wrist extensions at Fz, Cz, Pz, C3 and C4 sites in patients on DBS-STN plus medications (DBS-STN group) as treatment modality or on medications only (Med group) and compared with age matched healthy controls. In DBS-STN group, the potentials were recorded in stimulation ON, stimulation OFF, and again after re-switching stimulation ON-2. Offline analysis of potentials was done to calculate peak amplitude, late slope (-500 to 0 ms) and early slope (-1500 to -500 ms).
   Results: We observed that the two components of bereitschaftspotentials in stimulation ON state were comparable to those in age matched controls. The late slope was found to be significantly reduced during stimulation OFF as compared to stimulation ON at Cz (p < 0.001), C3 (p < 0.001) and C4 (p < 0.01) electrode sites. This parameter failed to improve on re-switching stimulation ON at Cz (p < 0.01). No significant change was observed in early part of bereitschaftspotentials among any of the conditions.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that DBS-STN along with anti-parkinsonian medications helps in improving both components of bereitschaftspotentials in PD. Switching stimulation OFF for fifteen minutes principally affects the late component i.e. the execution part of motor planning; which cannot be reversed by re-switching ON. Thus the chronic and acute effects of switching DBS-STN ON are different and principally affect the later part of motor planning.

AB  - Objective: The breathing processes are known to modulate cardiac autonomic tone and improve psychological status. We investigated cardiac autonomic tone following long Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) using heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance level (SCL).
   Methods: Thirty healthy volunteers (age 28.3 +/- 8.4 years; 23 M: 7 F) participated in the study. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and SCL were recorded for 5 min each, before and after long SKY. Long SKY is a combination of pranayama and cyclic rhythmic breathing and is performed by following the guided audio instructions. HRV analysis was used for the assessment of cardiac autonomic tone. Time and frequency domain parameters of HRV were calculated by using RR interval of ECG. SCL was acquired using Galvanic skin response (GSR) amplifier of PowerLab in microSeimens (mu S).
   Results: Time domain parameters of HRV, including mean RR interval (p = 0.000), respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) (p = 0.037), standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN) (p = 0.013), NN50 count divided by the total number of all NN intervals (pNN50) (p = 0.004), and square root of the mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD) (p = 0.002) increased, and mean heart rate decreased (p = 0.000) following long SKY. In frequency domain analysis, power of low-frequency (LF) component (p = 0.010) and LF/HF ratio (p = 0.008) decreased significantly, whereas power of high frequency (HF) significantly increased (p = 0.010). SCL decreased following long SKY, although it did not attain statistical significance.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that long SKY induces significant oscillations in cardiac autonomic tone. Parasympathetic activity increases and sympathetic activity decreases and sympathovagal balance improves following long SKY. Decrease in sympathetic activity is also demonstrated by decrease in conductance although it did not reach statistical significance. From this study it can be concluded that long SKY has a beneficial effect on cardiac autonomic tone, and psychophysiological relaxation. It may serve as a tool to improve HRV, which is the marker of cardiovascular health.

AB  - Occupational dermatoses contribute to a significant portion of work-related diseases, especially in Asia, where a major portion of the workforce is in the unorganized sector. This review article is focussed on the frequency and pattern of occupational skin diseases reported across Asian countries and type of allergens implicated in different occupations. The literature was searched systematically using key words 'occupational dermatoses,' 'occupational skin disease' and name of each Asian country. Ninty five full-text articles were considered relevant and evaluated. Some of the dermatoses seen in industrial workers in Asian countries are similar to those in Western countries, including dermatoses due to chromate in construction and electroplating workers, epoxy resin, and chromate in painters, wood dust in workers in the furniture industry, azo dyes in textile workers and formaldehyde and chromates in those working in the leather and dyeing industries, dermatoses in domestic workers, chefs and health-care workers. Dermatoses in workers engaged in agriculture, beedi (tiny cigars) manufacture, agarbatti (incense sticks) production, fish processing, carpet weaving, sanitation and those working in coffee plantations and coal mines appear to be unique to Asian countries. Recognition of clinical patterns and geographic variations in occupational skin diseases will provide an impetus to further strengthen future research in these areas, as well as improving their management.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the anti-leishmanial and antibacterial activities of a relatively unexplored whole plant of Waldheimia tomentosa (Asteraceae) and the chemical profiling of its most bioactive fraction.
   Methods: The whole plant material was extracted with methanol - water (9 : 1) and fractionated into n-hexane (C6H14 or n-Hex), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2 or DCM), ethyl acetate (C4H8O2 or EtOAc) fractions and aqueous residue. The fractions were screened for leishmanicidal activity against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes of L. donovani, while antibacterial activity was evaluated against four multidrug resistant (MDR) clinical isolates by bioassay guided fractionation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) performed on S. aureus at the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Chemical profiling of the most bioactive fraction was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
   Results: The most significant leishmanicidal activity was exhibited by n-Hex fraction against promastigotes (DD8 strain) with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 of 89.85 +/- 0.84 mu g/mL) and intracellular amastigotes (IC50 of 48.3 +/- 0.40 mu g/mL). The same fraction also exhibited maximum potency against S. aureus and E. coli at MIC of between 62.5 and 125 mu g/mL. The fraction comprised mainly fatty acids and alkyl ketones. SEM examination performed on S. aureus at MIC revealed swelling and multiple blisters on cell surface compared to untreated control.
   Conclusion: The profound antibacterial activity of Waldheimia tomentosa justifies the use of the plant in traditional medicine for stomach ache and food preservation.

AB  - Study objective: A few randomized trials have compared LMA Supreme (TM) with LMA ProSeal (TM) and i-geI (TM) in children but their conclusions varied widely. This systematic review and meta analysis has compared the former device with the latter two devices.
   Design: Meta-analysis and systematic review using the Mantel-Haenszel method and pooled mean difference using inverse variance method.
   Setting: Meta-analysis of published prospective randomized controlled trials.
   Patients: Paediatric patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia.
   Intervention: LMA Supreme (TM) with LMA ProSeal (TM) or i-geI (TM) as airway management device.
   Results: Electronic database searching revealed four randomized trials where LMA Supreme (TM) has been compared with LMA ProSeal (TM) and three trials where a comparison was made between LMA Supreme (TM) and i-geI (TM) in paediatric population. LMA Supreme (TM) provided similar oropharyngeal leak pressure when compared to LMA ProSeal (TM) [mean difference (95% CI) 1.57 (-1.33, 4.47) cm H2O; p = 0.29] and i-geI (TM) [mean difference (95% CI) 1.18 (-2.11,4.47) cm H2O; p = 0.48]. First insertion success rate is also similar when LMA Supreme (TM) is compared to LMA ProSeal (TM) [RR (95% CI) 1.03 (0.97, 1.1); p = 0.74] and i-geI (TM) [RR (95% CI) 0.99 (0.95, 1.03); p = 0.51]. Device insertion is significantly faster with LMA Supreme (TM) than i-geI (TM) [mean difference (95% CI) 1.87 (0.93, 2.81) s; p < 0.0001].
   Conclusion: We suggest that LMA Supreme (TM) may be an alternative to LMA ProSeal (TM) and i-geI (TM) in children for airway management during general anaesthesia. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Combined Hamartoma of the Retina and Retinal Pigment Epithelium: An Optical Coherence Tomography-Based Reappraisal
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - PURPOSE: To analyze the optical coherence tomography (OCT) characteristics of combined hamartoma of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (CHRRPE) involving the macula.
   DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series.
   METHODS: SETTING: Single institutional. STUDY POPULATION: Fourteen consecutive patients of CHRRPE were included. OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: The authors analyzed the clinical features, color fundus photography, and swept-source or spectral-domain OCT of all the involved eyes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OCT characteristics, especially the involvement of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RESULTS: A total of 16 eyes of 5 female and 9 male patients were analyzed. The mean age (+/- SD) was 17.9 +/- 6.4 (range 10-34) years. Mean best-corrected visual acuity (SD) in logMAR was 0.9 +/- 0.5 (20/160 +/- 20/60). The OCT was suggestive of a focal mass-like lesion primarily involving the inner retinal layers limited externally by the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in 15 eyes (93.7%). The OPL appeared to have a saw-tooth appearance ("intraretinal peaks") in 12 eyes (75%). The convolutions of the OPL were broader and deeper in some eyes (5 eyes, 31.2%), giving an "omega sign" (omega) appearance. The ellipsoid zone appeared intact in 13 eyes (81.2%). The RPE band appeared intact in all eyes. "
   CONCLUSIONS: Considering the OCT features, available evidence, and embryology, we propose that the true nature of CHRRPE should be reanalyzed. In our series, CHRRPE was noted to be primarily a hamartoma arising from the inner retinal layers. A majority of cases were limited posteriorly by the OPL without any involvement of the outer retinal layers and RPE. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The metabolic pathways associated with the mitochondrion and the apicoplast in Plasmodium, 2 parasite organelles of prokaryotic origin, are considered as suitable drug targets. In the present study, we have identified functional role of a novel ovarian tumour unit (OTU) domain-containing cysteine protease of Plasmodium falciparum (PfOTU). A C-terminal regulatable fluorescent affinity tag on native protein was utilised for its localization and functional characterization. Detailed studies showed vesicular localization of PfOTU and its association with the apicoplast. Degradationtag mediated knockdown of PfOTU resulted in abnormal apicoplast development and blocked development of parasites beyond early-schizont stages in subsequent cell cycle; downregulation of PfOTU hindered apicoplast protein import. Further, the isoprenoid precursor-mediated parasite growth-rescue experiments confirmed that PfOTU knockdown specifically effect development of functional apicoplast. We also provide evidence for a possible biological function of PfOTU in membrane deconjugation of Atg8, which may be linked with the apicoplast protein import. Overall, our results show that the PfOTU is involved in apicoplast homeostasis and associates with the noncanonical function of Atg8 in maintenance of parasite apicoplast.

AB  - Introduction: Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) have been variably reported in 14% to 75% of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). There is lack of Indian data on incidence of APLA in ITP.
   Objective: We studied the incidence of APLA in patients with pediatric and adult Indian ITP.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively studied 100 patients including acute (n = 37), persistent (n = 13), and chronic (n = 50) ITP. Male to female ratio was 1.22:1. Median age was 18 years (1.5-56). All patients underwent investigations for lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL) immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies, and anti-2 glycoprotein 1 (2GP1) IgG and IgM antibodies. Patients with secondary ITP were excluded. Bleeding manifestations were recorded. Patients with acute and persistent ITP were assessed for steroid response. Response rates were compared between APLA-positive and APLA-negative patients.
   Results: Antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in approximate to 12% of patients with ITP: 8.1% (3 of 37) in acute, 0% (0 of 13) in persistent, and 18% (9 of 50) in chronic ITP. Anti-2GP1 antibodies were most frequent (9%). Only 2 patients each were positive for anti-aCL antibodies and LA. Although platelet counts were significantly higher in APLA-positive patients, there was no significant difference in bleeding between the APLA-positive versus APLA-negative patients with ITP. There was also no significant difference in steroid response between APLA-positive and APLA-negative patients with acute/persistent ITP. In the short follow-up (median 8 months), none of the APLA-positive patients developed thrombosis.
   Conclusions: Incidence of APLA in Indian population was lower than reported in the West, which indicates that not all patients of ITP need to be subjected to these manifestations upfront at diagnosis.

AB  - Abdominal pain is the foremost complication of chronic pancreatitis (CP). Pain can be related to recurrent or chronic inflammation, local complications or neurogenic mechanisms with corresponding changes in the nervous systems. Both pain intensity and the frequency of pain attacks have been shown to reduce quality of life in patients with CP. Assessment of pain follows the guidelines for other types of chronic pain, where the multidimensional nature of symptom presentation is taken into consideration. Quantitative sensory testing may be used to characterize pain, but is currently used in a research setting in advanced laboratories.
   For pain relief, current guidelines recommend a simple stepwise escalation of analgesic drugs with increasing potency until pain relief is obtained. Abstinence from alcohol and smoking should be strongly advised. Pancreatic enzyme therapy and antioxidants may be helpful as initial treatment. Endoscopic treatment can be used in patients with evidence of ductal obstruction and may be combined with extracorporeal shock wave lithothripsy. The best candidates are those with distal obstruction of the main pancreatic duct and in early stage of disease. Behavioral interventions should be part of the multidisciplinary approach to chronic pain management particularly when psychological impact is experienced. Surgery should be considered early and after a maximum of five endoscopic interventions. The type of surgery depends on morphological changes of the pancreas. Long-term effects are variable, but high success rates have been reported in open studies and when compared with endoscopic treatment. Finally, neurolytical interventions and neuromodulation can be considered in difficult patients. (C) 2017 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a rare neurogenetic disorder caused by highly unstable CAG repeat expansion mutation in coding region of SCA7. We aimed to understand the effect of diverse ATXN7 cis-element in correlation with CAG expansion mutation of SCA7. We initially performed an analysis to identify the haplotype background of CAG expanded alleles using eight bi-allelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking an ATXN7-CAG expansion in 32 individuals from nine unrelated Indian SCA7 families and 88 healthy controls. Subsequent validation of the findings was performed in 89 ATXN7-CAG mutation carriers and in 119 unrelated healthy controls of Mexican ancestry. The haplotype analyses showed a shared haplotype background and C allele of SNP rs6798742 (approximately 6kb from the 3-end of CAG repeats) is in complete association with expanded, premutation, intermediate, and the majority of large normal (12) CAG allele. The C allele (ancestral/chimp allele) association was validated in SCA7 subjects and healthy controls from Mexico, suggesting its substantial association with CAG expanded and expansion-prone chromosomes. Analysis of rs6798742 and other neighboring functional SNPs within 6 kb in experimental datasets (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements; ENCODE) shows functional marks that could affect transcription as well as histone methylation. An allelic association of the CAG region to an intronic SNP in two different ethnic and geographical populations suggests a -cis factor-dependent mechanism in ATXN7 CAG-region expansion.

AB  - There is a lack of consensus on how endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided pseudocyst drainage and endoscopic necrosectomy should be performed. This survey was carried out amongst members of the EUS Journal Editorial Board to describe their practices in performing this procedure. This was a worldwide multi-institutional survey amongst members of the EUS Journal Editorial Board in May 2017. The responses to a 22-question survey with respect to the practice of EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage and endoscopic necrosectomy were obtained. Twenty-two endoscopists responded to the questionnaire as follows: 72.7% (16/22) were of the opinion that lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) should be the standard of care for the creation of an endoscopic cystenterostomy in patients with pancreatic walled-off necrosis (WON); 95.5% (21/22) recommended large diameter (d=15 mm) LAMS for drainage in patients with WON; 54.5% (12/22) would not dilate LAMS after placement into the WOPN; 86.4% (19/22) would not perform endoscopic necrosectomy during the same procedure as the creation of the cystenterostomy; 45.5% (10/22) recommend that agents, such as diluted hydrogen peroxide, should be used to lavage the peri-pancreatic fluid collection (PFC) cavity in patients with WON; and 45.5% (10/22) considered a naso-cystic or other tube to be necessary for lavage of WON after initial drainage. The mean optimal interval recommended for endoscopic necrosectomy procedures after EUS-guided drainage was 6.23 days. The mean optimal interval recommended for repeat imaging in patients undergoing endoscopic necrosectomy was 12.32 days. The mean time recommended for LAMS removal was 4.59 weeks. This is the first worldwide survey on the practice of EUS-guided pseudocyst drainage and endoscopic necrosectomy. There were wide variations in practice and randomized studies are urgently needed to establish the best approach for management of this condition. There is also a pressing need to establish a best practice consensus.

AB  - Microscopic earliest preneoplastic lesions of human colon, as aberrant crypt foci and mucin depleted foci, have enormous potential to be used as targets for cancer screening in high risk individual, especially with the advent of chromoendoscopic and narrow band endoscopic techniques. Though, these lesions have been described in human, the exact pit pattern, distribution across different clinical groups and characteristics to identify the high risk ACF/MDF are not clear. In this study 156 human colectomy specimen were screened for these lesions, after shaving the mucosa, away from the tumor mass, fixed, stained with methylene blue/alcian blue stain and observed under 40x magnification of light microscopy, to mimic the chromoendoscopic procedure. We described a 3-tier ACF only crypt pattern, which shows good predictability for presence of dysplasia. Also the features of high risk ACF were described. Colon cancer stem cell markers were studied in these lesions, in comparison to normal colon and carcinoma, and up-regulation of CSCs were noted in ACF, supporting their preneoplastic nature. CSC might play an important role in carcinogenesis.
   Background: During colonoscopic screening, only macroscopic lesions will be identified, and these are usually the result of multiple genetic abnormalities. Magnification endoscopic detection of aberrant crypt foci (ACF), long before they acquire complex genetic abnormalities, is promising. However, the features of high-risk ACF-like lesions need to be identified. Materials and Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, grossly visible normal mucosal flaps were shaved from 152 colectomies, including 96 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 56 controls (22 control specimens with disease with malignant potential and 34 without malignant potential). Methylene and Alcian blue stains were performed directly on the unfixed mucosal flaps to identify ACF and mucin-depleted foci (MDF). Detailed topographic analyses, with immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin and cancer stem cell (CSC) markers (CD44, CD24, and CD166) were performed. Results: ACF, MDF, and beta-catenineaccumulated crypts were detected more in specimens with adjacent CRC. The left colon had ACF with a larger diameter and greater crypt multiplicity, density, and gyriform pit pattern and were considered the high-risk ACF group. MDF, more commonly associated with dysplasia, is also a marker of possible carcinogenesis. The CD44 CSC marker was significantly upregulated in ACF specimens compared with normal controls. Our 3-tier ACF-only pit pattern classification system showed better linearity with mucosal dysplasia than did the 6-tier Kudo classification. Conclusion: High-risk ACF, when detected during chromoendoscopic screening, should be followed up. CSCs might play an important role in pathogenesis. Larger studies and genotypic risk stratification for definite identification of high-risk ACF are needed.

AB  - Background: Gangliogliomas (GGs) are slow-growing glioneuronal tumors seen in children and young adults. They are associated with intractable epilepsy, and have recently been found to harbor BRAF (B-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma) gene mutations. However, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, downstream of BRAF, has not been evaluated extensively in GGs.
   Materials and Methods: GG cases were retrieved, clinical data obtained, and histopathological features reviewed. Sequencing for BRAF V600E mutation, analysis of BRAF copy number by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry for mTOR pathway markers p-S6 and p-4EBP1 were performed.
   Results: Sixty-four cases of GG were identified (0.9% of central nervous system tumors). Of these, 28 had sufficient tumor tissue for further evaluation. Mixed glial and neuronal morphology was the commonest (64%) type. Focal cortical dysplasia was identified in the adjacent cortex (6 cases). BRAF V600E mutation was identified in 30% of GGs; BRAF copy number gain was observed in 50% of them. p-S6 and p-4EBP1 immunopositivity was seen in 57% cases each. Thus, mTOR pathway activation was seen in 81% cases, and was independent of BRAF alterations. 87% patients had Engel grade I outcome, while 13% had Engel grade II outcome. Both the Engel grade II cases analyzed showed BRAF V600E mutation.
   Conclusion: BRAF V600E mutation is frequent in GGs, as is BRAF gain; the former may serve as a target for personalized therapy in patients with residual tumors, necessitating its assessment in routine pathology reporting of these tumors. Evidence of mTOR pathway activation highlights similarities in the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying GG and focal cortical dysplasia, and suggests that mTOR inhibitors may be of utility in GG patients with persistent seizures after surgery.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the role of umbilical cord serum (UCS) and autologous serum (AS) therapy in reepithelialization of corneal graft after keratoplasty in a randomized controlled trial.
   Methods: A total of 105 eyes with epithelial defect (ED) after keratoplasty (penetrating keratoplasty-67 and anterior lamellar keratoplasty-38) on the first postoperative day were included in the study. The eyes were randomized into three groups: UCS (n = 35), AS (n = 35), and artificial tears (AT) (n = 35). All patients received standard postoperative medical therapy. The primary outcome measure was time to epithelialization, and secondary outcome measures were best-corrected visual acuity and graft clarity.
   Results: The ED healed completely in 103 eyes. The mean time for complete reepithelialization was 2.562.1, 3.162.2, and 4.561.4 days in UCS, AS, and AT groups, respectively. The mean percentage decrease in the size of the ED was significantly better in the UCS and AS groups as compared with the AT group (P = 0.001). The rate of reepithelialization was comparable between the AS and UCS groups (P = 0.3). On bivariate analysis, significant correlation was found between the mean size of postoperative ED, grade of the donor cornea (P = 0.001), and the presence of preoperative ED (P = 0.001). No complications were associated with the use of serum therapy.
   Conclusion: Most of the cases of postkeratoplasty corneal ED can be managed with AT only. The serum therapy (AS/UCS) helps in the faster reepithelialization of postkeratoplasty ED as compared with AT and may be considered as a treatment option for early epithelial healing.

AB  - Neurosurgical patients with suspected DIC receive large amount of transfusion support in form of red cell concentrates (RCC), platelet rich plasma (PRP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). However, there are very few studies which have studied the effect of blood components load in the outcome of the patient. We conducted a prospective observational study on 61 post operative neurosurgery patients suspected with DIC and had at least one deranged haemostatic parameter namely platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time. Their blood components load was co-related with the outcome and with the hemostatic derangements. Twenty-eight patients died in our study group. 19/28 died patients had DIC. The red cell load was significantly more in patients who died compared to those who were alive (p = 0.041). On the other hand, load of PRP as well as FFP was significantly different between the patients who were alive and dead. This difference was further heightened when the DIC deaths were compared with the other patients. This is especially true for FFP transfusion which was significantly higher in DIC deaths (p = 0.006). Also, the number of FFPs received by neurosurgical patients suspected with DIC was significantly more in patients > 2 coagulation abnormalities (p = 0.008). However, no correlation was found between PRP and RCC received and number of coagulation abnormalities present. To conclude, the load of FFP was maximum in patients with DIC deaths and the load of RCC was associated with overall mortality.

AB  - Background & objectives: Diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare haematopoietic stem cell disorder, is challenging in patients with bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome like aplastic anaemia (AA). This study was conducted with the aim to test the efficacy of the newly recommended markers viz. anti-CD16 and CD66b antibody over the existing anti-CD55 and CD59 antibody for PNH diagnosis in India.
   Methods: This study was conducted on 193 suspected cases of PNH by flow cytometry using lyse wash technique to stain the granulocytes with CD16/CD66b and CD55/CD59.
   Results: Of the 193 suspected cases, 62 patients showed the presence of PNH clone. Forty six patients were detected by CD55/CD59/CD45, whereas 61 were detected by CD16/CD66b/CD45. CD16/CD66b detected 16 (25.8%) additional patients over CD55/CD59 (P<0.05) and was more sensitive in detecting the PNH clone with higher negative predictive value. Most of the patients (11/16) who were picked up by CD16/CD66b were of AA who had small clone sizes. Further, the PNH clones were more discreetly identified in CD16/CD66b plots than by CD55/CD59. Clone size assessed by CD16/CD66b which reflects the clinical severity of classical PNH (thrombosis/haemolysis), was more representative of the underlying clinical condition than CD55/59.
   Interpretation & conclusions: In our experience of 62 patients of PNH, CD16/CD66b proved to be more efficacious in detecting PNH. The new panel was especially useful in monitoring PNH associated with BMF which had small clone sizes.

AB  - Introduction: Depression and diabetes are highly prevalent worldwide and often co-exist, worsening outcomes for each condition. Barriers to diagnosis and treatment are exacerbated in low and middle-income countries with limited health infrastructure and access to mental health treatment. The INtegrating DEPrEssioN and Diabetes treatmENT (INDEPENDENT) study tests the sustained effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component care model for individuals with poorly-controlled diabetes and depression in diabetes clinics in India.
   Materials and methods: Adults with diabetes, depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score >= 10), and >= 1 poorly-controlled cardiometabolic indicator (either HbA1c >= 8.0%, SBP >= 140 mm Hg, and/or LDL >= 130 mg/dl) were enrolled and randomized to the intervention or usual care. The intervention combined collaborative care, decision-support, and population health management. The primary outcome is the between arm difference in the proportion of participants achieving combined depression response (>= 50% reduction in Symptom Checklist score from baseline) AND one or more of: >= 0.5% reduction in HbAl c, >= 5 mm Hg reduction in SBP, or >= 10 mg/dl reduction in LDL-c at 24 months (12-month intervention; 12-month observational followup). Other outcomes include control of individual parameters, patient-centered measures (i.e. treatment satisfaction), and cost-effectiveness.
   Results: The study trained seven care coordinators. Participant recruitment is complete 940 adults were screened, with 483 eligible, and 404 randomized (196 to intervention; 208 to usual care). Randomization was balanced across clinic sites.
   Conclusions: The INDEPENDENT model aims to increase access to mental health care and improve depression and cardiometabolic disease outcomes among complex patients with diabetes clinics in India

TI  - Approach to family assessment and intervention
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. Family studies are an integral part of teaching of community medicine to all undergraduate medical and nursing students. It enhances the understanding of students about social determinants and multifactorial causation of disease. However, there is no standard approach towards it and it is seen as a clinical presentation with some elements of family included. We describe a systematic and comprehensive approach to a family study.
   Methods. Based on the existing literature and personal experience, we identified 11 domains under the acronym Family ASSESSMENT-Structure, Socioeconomic, Sickness, Nutritional, Educational, Environmental, Affordability, System (health), Mental, Family influence, Threats. Under each domain, we present indicative diagnoses and possible solutions. We also suggest that these domain diagnoses can be integrated into a single 'web of interaction' which provides a comprehensive understanding of the issues and guides us towards identifying the solutions.
   Results. We use a worked out example of a case of tuberculosis to demonstrate the use of this approach and develop a rich web of interaction, which is then linked to identification of possible approaches towards mitigating the impact of disease on the individual and the family. Some suggestions to the departments of community medicine on organizing family studies are also provided.
   Conclusion. Availability of a systematic and comprehensive approach would improve students' understanding of the social model of disease and multifactorial causation of disease. It will also provide a standardized method of teaching this important component of community medicine nationally.

AB  - The timing and role of chemotherapy in the management of Wilms' tumor has long been the matter of debate, with different groups showing equally comparable and encouraging results. Over the last decade, however, both the ideol-ogies seem to be converging and the attempt has been to identify groups benefitting with pre-operative chemotherapy, as well as those, where upfront resection should be attempted. In this article authors intend to discuss pros and cons of both the strategies and their applicability in a resource poor setting in developing countries like India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intracranial schwannomas most commonly arise from the vestibulocochlear nerve and less frequently from trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossal nerves. Intracranial schwannomas unrelated to cranial nerves are very rare; only approximately 50 cases have been reported in the literature. Tentorial schwannoma (TS) is even rarer, with only 13 cases reported to date. We present a rare case of giant TS.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old man presented with generalized headache and dizziness for the past 6 months and worsening of symptoms for the past 2 months. On evaluation, he was found to have a cystic lesion arising from the right tentorium with multiple internal septa and fluid levels, with both supratentorial and infratentorial extension. The presence of a dural tail sign and tentorial origin led us to make a preoperative diagnosis of tentorial meningioma. The patient underwent complete excision, and a diagnosis of TS was made based on histopathologic analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: TSs are extremely rare. Knowledge of radiologic and morphologic features can be helpful in making a preoperative diagnosis. The dural tail sign, which is considered a characteristic feature of meningioma, is commonly seen in TS as well, and thus TS should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions arising from the tentorium.

AB  - AimThe present study was carried out to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antiarthritic activity of Rosa centifolia aqueous extract (RC) in a carrageenan-induced paw edema model and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis.
   MethodsAnti-inflammatory activity of RC was evaluated using the carrageenan-induced paw edema model in rats. Arthritis was induced in rats by sub-plantar administration of CFA. Joint size was measured at regular intervals by using a micrometer screw gauge. Serum and ankle joints of rats immunized with CFA were collected and subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for estimation of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- level and dot blot for secretory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6. An acute and 28-day oral toxicity study was carried out to evaluate the safety of the test drug.
   ResultsPre-treatment with RC produced a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced paw edema and CFA-induced arthritis models and was effective as indomethacin. RC also inhibited the delayed increase in joint diameter as seen in control and indomethacin-treated animals in CFA-induced arthritis. The expression of proinflammatory mediators TNF-, IL-6 and IL-1 was also found to be less in the RC-treated group as compared to controls.
   ConclusionBased on these results, it was suggested that Rosa centifolia could be considered as a potential anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic agent.

AB  - DevR/DosR is a key mediator of 'dormancy' adaptation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in response to gaseous stresses such as hypoxia that inhibit aerobic mode of respiration. In the present study, a temporal analysis over a 1 year period has revealed robust expression of representative DevR regulon genes devR, hspX and tgs1, during long-term 'dormancy' adaptation to hypoxia. Notably, a predominant proportion of long-term hypoxia-adapted bacteria were characterized by their inability to grow on solid media, accumulation of triacylglycerols and recovery of growth in liquid media. Persistent expression of HspX and the accumulation of triacylglycerols reveal a previously underappreciated role of DevR during adaptation to extended hypoxia, and endorse DevR as an effective target for thwarting the sustained survival of 'dormant' subpopulation of M. tuberculosis.

TI  - Nusinersen: The First Option Beyond Supportive Care for Spinal Muscular Atrophy
T2  - CLINICAL DRUG INVESTIGATION
AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by degeneration of spinal motor neurons and poses significant adverse outcome in affected population. Survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) protein encoded by SMN1 gene located on 5q(13) is critical for survival and functioning of motor neurons. Almost identical gene SMN2, present on the same chromosome, produces a small truncated protein (SMN2) because of skipping of exon 7 from translation due to translation silent C6U substitution in exon 7 of SMN2 pre-mRNA transcript. Only 10% of the SMN2 mRNAs produce full length SMN2 protein by including exon 7 in healthy individuals. A large deletion or sometimes a point mutation in SMN1 gene is responsible for SMA. In this case the number of copies of SMN2 genes in an individual determines the severity of disease (the more the number of copies the less severe the disease). Nusinersen (ISIS 396443) binds to intron splicing silencer-N1 (ISS-N1; a site present ten nucleotides down to the junction of exon 7 and intron 7), modulating the splicing of SMN2 pre-mRNA transcript to increase the inclusion of exon 7, thereby increasing the production of full length SMN2 protein. Major evidence of its efficacy came from a sham controlled phase 3 clinical study ENDEAR. The study was stopped early based on significantly favorable results in interim analysis and all the patients were transitioned to receive nusinersen in an ongoing open-label, phase 3 study, SHINE, which will evaluate the long-term efficacy, safety and tolerability of the drug. Nusinersen is globally the first drug approved (by the US FDA) for treatment of SMA in children and adults.

AB  - AIM: Different forms and online tools are available in different countries for spontaneous reporting, one of the most widely used methods of pharmacovigilance. Capturing sufficient information and adequate compatibility of online systems with respective reporting form is highly desirable for appropriate reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study was aimed to compare three major online reporting systems (US, UK, and WHO) of the world and also to check their compatibility with the respective ADR reporting form.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 89 data elements to provide relevant information were found out from above three online reporting systems. All three online systems were compared regarding magnitude of information captured by each of them and scoring was done by providing a score of "1" to each element. Compatibility of ADR reporting forms of India (Red form), US (Form 3500), and UK (Yellow card form) was assessed by comparing the information gathered by them with that can be entered into their respective online reporting systems, namely, "VigiFlow," "US online reporting," and "Yellow card online reporting." Each unmatching item was given a score of "-1".
   RESULTS: VigiFlow scored "74" points, whereas online reporting systems of the US and UK scored "56" and "49," respectively, regarding magnitude of the information gathered by them. Compatibility score was found to be "0," "-9," and "-26" in case of ADR reporting systems of US, UK, and India, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that "VigiFlow" is capable of capturing the maximum amount of information but "Form 3500" and "Online reporting system of US" are maximally compatible to each other among ADR reporting systems of all three countries.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) scan is the mainstay for diagnosis of stroke; but the facility of CT scan is not easily available. A blood-based biomarker approach is required to distinguish ischemic stroke (IS) from hemorrhagic stroke (HS) in pre-hospital settings. To conduct a systematic review of diagnostic utility of blood biomarkers for differential diagnosis of stroke. A comprehensive literature search was carried out till March 7, 2017 in PubMed, Cochrane, Medline, OVID, and Google Scholar databases. Methodological quality of each study was assessed using the modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies questionnaire. Eighteen studies were identified relevant to our systematic review. Ten single biomarkers and seven panels of different biomarkers were identified which showed potential for differentiating IS and HS. Activated Protein C-Protein C Inhibitor Complex (APC-PCI) (sensitivity-96%), Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) (specificity-100%) and a panel of APC-PCI & GFAP (sensitivity-71%) and Retinol Binding Protein 4 (RBP4) & GFAP (specificity-100%) were found to have high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating the two stroke types. Our systematic review does not recommend the use of any blood biomarker for clinical purposes yet based on the studies conducted till date.

AB  - Background: This study compared 2 sequential cohorts to identify the postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) dose requirement for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
   Methods: Two distinct PORT dose regimens were prescribed over 11 years; group 1 received 56 Gy or less, and group 2 received 60 Gy or more. The 2D and 3D techniques were used.
   Results: Two sequential cohorts consisted of 478 patients, with mean and median follow-up for group 1 and 2 as: 37.0 versus 28.5 months and 13.8 versus 13.1 months, respectively. Grades 3-4 mucosal toxicities (11.4% vs 28.3%), hospitalization (3.2% vs 17.4%), and nasogastric feeding (11.9% vs 29.7%) were higher in group 2. The 2-year disease-free survival (DFS) was higher with PORT >60 Gy for the following factors: age <= 50 years (P = .041); >= 4 positive nodes (P = .029); and overall treatment time (OTT) >= 100 days (P = .042).
   Conclusion: Except for the benefit of doses >60 Gy for limited parameters, a lower PORT dose did not compromise the results and can potentially reduce the morbidities and healthcare costs.

AB  - Green space exposure has been positively correlated with better mental-health indicators in several high income countries, but has not been examined in low-and middle-income countries undergoing rapid urbanization. Building on a study of mental health in adults with a pre-existing chronic condition, we examined the association between park availability and major depression among 1208 adults surveyed in Delhi, India. Major depression was measured using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The ArcGIS platform was used to quantify park availability indexed as (i) park distance from households, (ii) area of the nearest park; and within one km buffer area around households - the (iii) number and (iv) total area of all parks. Mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics indicated that relative to residents exposed to the largest nearest park areas (tertile 3), the odds [95% confidence interval] of major depression was 3.1 [1.4-7.0] times higher among residents exposed to the smallest nearest park areas (tertile 1) and 2.1 [0.9-4.8] times higher in residents with mid-level exposure (tertile 2). There was no statistically significant association between other park variables tested and major depression. We hypothesized that physical activity in the form of walking, perceived stress levels and satisfaction with the neighborhood environment may have mediating effects on the association between nearest park area and major depression. We found no significant mediation effects for any of our hypothesized variables. In conclusion, our results provide preliminary and novel evidence from India that availability of large parks in the immediate neighborhood positively impacts mental well-being of individuals with pre-existing chronic conditions, at the opportune time when India is embarking on the development of sustainable cities that aim to promote health through smart urban design - one of the key elements of which is the inclusion of urban green spaces.

AB  - Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an opportunistic viral infection of the central nervous system caused by the reactivation of John Cunningham virus (JCV) in immunocompromised patients, most commonly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and less commonly in those receiving various immunosuppressive regimens. Prognosis of untreated PML is grave and the mainstay of treatment is the reversal of immunosuppression, usually by institution of antiretroviral drugs in HIV patients and cessation of immunosuppressive therapies in others. PML is increasingly being reported in those with minimal or occult immunosuppression. A small fraction of these patients meet the criteria for idiopathic CD4+ T-lymphocytopenia (ICL) after exclusion of all secondary causes of lymphocytopenia, including HIV. A 44-year-old previously healthy male presented with clinical and radiological features suggestive of PML. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were repeatedly negative for JCV. Immunohistochemistry on brain biopsy eventually confirmed PML. Despite extensive work-up, the only abnormality detected was an unexplained and persistently low absolute CD4+ T-lymphocyte count. Based on the limited available literature on the treatment of non-HIV PML, he was treated with a combination of mirtazapine and mefloquine with clinical improvement. Non-HIV PML remains relatively uncommon, and PML as a presenting feature of ICL is rare. It is important to document and follow these patients to be able to assess the relative risks associated with various causes and formulate effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Clinical trials using human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have shown promising results in the treatment of various diseases. Different tissue sources, such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, dental pulp and umbilical cord, are being routinely used in regenerative medicine. MSCs are known to reduce increased oxidative stress levels in pathophysiological conditions. Differences in the ability of MSCs from different donors and tissues to ameliorate oxidative damage have not been reported yet. In this study, for the first time, we investigated the differences in the reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction abilities of tissue-specific MSCs to mitigate cellular damage in oxidative stress. Hepatic Stellate cells (LX-2) and cardiomyocytes were treated with Antimycin A (AMA) to induce oxidative stress and tissue specific MSCs were co-cultured to study the reduction in ROS levels. We found that both donor's age and source of tissue affected the ability of MSCs to reduce increased ROS levels in damaged cells. In addition, the abilities of same MSCs differed in LX-2 and cardiomyocytes in terms of magnitude of reduction of ROS, suggesting that the type of recipient cells should be kept in consideration when using MSCs in regenerative medicine for treatment purposes.

AB  - Pilocytic astrocytomas occur rarely in adults and show aggressive tumor behavior. However, their underlying molecular-genetic events are largely uncharacterized. Hence, 59 adult pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) cases of classical histology were studied (MIB-1 LI: 1%-5%). Analysis of BRAF alterations using qRT-PCR, confirmed KIAA1549-BRAF fusion in 11 (19%) and BRAF-gain in 2 (3.4%) cases. BRAF-V600E mutation was noted in 1 (1.7%) case by sequencing. FGFR1-mutation and FGFR-TKD duplication were seen in 7/59 (11.9%) and 3/59 (5%) cases, respectively. Overall 36% of APAs harbored BRAF and/or FGFR genetic alterations. Notably, FGFR related genetic alterations were enriched in tumors of supratentorial region (8/25, 32%) as compared with other locations (P=0.01). The difference in age of cases with FGFR1-mutation (Mean age +/- SD: 37.2 +/- 15 years) vs. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (Mean age +/- SD: 25.1 +/- 4.1 years) was statistically significant (P=0.03). Combined BRAF and FGFR alterations were identified in 3 (5%) cases. Notably, the cases with more than one genetic alteration were in higher age group (Mean age +/- SD: 50 +/- 12 years) as compared with cases with single genetic alteration (Mean age +/- SD: 29 +/- 10; P=0.003). Immunopositivity of p-MAPK/p-MEK1 was found in all the cases examined. The pS6-immunoreactivity, a marker of mTOR activation was observed in 34/39 (87%) cases. Interestingly, cases with BRAF and/or FGFR related alteration showed significantly lower pS6-immunostatining (3/12; 25%) as compared with those with wild-type BRAF and/or FGFR (16/27; 59%) (P=0.04). Further, analysis of seven IDH wild-type adult diffuse astrocytomas (DA) showed FGFR related genetic alterations in 43% cases. These and previous results suggest that APAs are genetically similar to IDH wild-type adult DAs. APAs harbor infrequent BRAF alterations but more frequent FGFR alterations as compared with pediatric cases. KIAA1549-BRAF fusion inversely correlates with increasing age whereas FGFR1-mutation associates with older age. Activation of MAPK/ERK/mTOR signaling appears to be an important oncogenic event in APAs and may be underlying event of aggressive tumor behavior. The findings provided a rationale for potential therapeutic advantage of targeting MAPK/ERK/mTOR pathway in APAs.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization and the Government of India have set targets to reduce burden of noncommunicable diseases. Information on population level trend of risk factors would provide insights regarding the possibility of achieving them.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine the population trends of cardiovascular disease risk factors in the National Capital Region of Delhi over 2 decades.
   Methods: Two representative cross-sectional surveys were conducted among men and women ages 35 to 64 years, residing in the urban and rural areas (survey 1 [1991 to 1994] and survey 2 [2010 to 2012]) using similar methodology. The urban sample was collected from the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, and the rural sample was from the Ballabgarh block of the adjoining state of Haryana. A total of 3,048 and 2,052 subjects of urban areas and 2,487 and 1,917 subjects of rural areas were surveyed in surveys 1 and 2, respectively. Behavioral (smoking and alcohol use), physical (overweight, abdominal obesity, and raised blood pressure), and biochemical risk factors (raised fasting blood glucose and raised total cholesterol) were measured using standard tools.
   Results: Urban and rural prevalence of overweight, alcohol use, raised blood pressure, and blood glucose increased with increases in age-standardized mean body mass index (urban: 24.4 to 26.0 kg/m(2); rural: 20.2 to 23.0 kg/m(2)), systolic blood pressure (urban: 121.2 to 129.8 mm Hg; rural: 114.9 to 123.1 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (urban: 74.3 to 83.9 mm Hg; rural: 73.1 to 82.3 mm Hg), and fasting glucose (urban: 101.2 to 115.3 mg/dl; rural: 83.9 to 103.2 mg/dl). The smoking prevalence increased in the rural male population. Raised total cholesterol declined in urban and increased significantly in rural populations.
   Conclusions: The study indicates an overall worsening of population levels of all cardiovascular disease risk factors in National Capital Region over past 20 years, though some signs of stabilization and reversal are seen in urban Delhi.

AB  - Background: Ageing process is characterized by a decline in function; different age related diseases and excessive age associated mortality. There has always been a quest for easily accessible biomarkers to monitor and identify the development of age-associated stress for providing new anti-ageing strategies. Forkhead box protein O3A (FOXO3A) and Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) are such potential markers which plays important role in a wide variety of cellular mechanisms and has been proposed to be an ideal candidate to study longevity and are potential candidate for healthy ageing by oxidative burst.
   Objectives: In this study we quantified FOXO3A and SIRT3 proteins in human serum with increasing age and in vitro assessment of modulation of their expression by the treatment of Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha).
   Methodology: Four hundred seventy three subjects were enrolled for the study and were divided into three groups according to increasing age[20-30 years (young), 60-79 years (old) and >= 80 years (oldest)]. Serum levels of FOXO3A and SIRT3 proteins were estimated by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and validated by ELISA and Western blot. The statistical analysis was done with student's unpaired t-test, one way ANOVA by Stata9 and Graph pad prism5. The expression of these proteins were also analysed in stress induced HEK-293 cell line and level was observed by treatment with stress releasing compound Ashwagandha.
   Results: In this cross sectional observational study, the serum concentration of FOXO3A and SIRT3 declined significantly (p < 0.0001) with increasing age and even after adjustment with all geriatric co-morbidities the level remain downregulated with age. In the stress inducible cell line showed reduced level of proteins which gets upregulated by the treatment of Ashwagandha.
   Conclusion: This is the first report of inverse relation of age with human serum FOXO3A and SIRT3 and can be excellent marker for ageing with good therapeutic importance for maintaining healthy ageing. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Although oral metronomic chemotherapy is often used in progressive pediatric solid malignant tumors, a literature review reveals that only small single-arm retrospective or phase 1 and 2 studies have been performed. Skepticism abounds because of the lack of level 1 evidence.
   OBJECTIVES To compare the effect of metronomic chemotherapy on progression-free survival (PFS) with that of placebo in pediatric patients with primary extracranial, nonhematopoietic solid malignant tumors that progress after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted from October 1, 2013, through December 31, 2015, at the cancer center at All India Institute of Medical Sciences in children aged 5 to 18 years with primary extracranial, nonhematopoietic solid malignant tumors that progressed after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy and had no further curative options.
   INTERVENTIONS One arm received a 4-drug oral metronomic regimen of daily celecoxib and thalidomide with alternating periods of etoposide and cyclophosphamide, whereas the other arm received placebo. Disease status was assessed at baseline, 9 weeks, 18 weeks, and 27 weeks or at clinical progression.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was PFS as defined by the proportion of patients without disease progression at 6 months, and PFS duration and overall survival (OS) were secondary end points.
   RESULTS A total of 108 of the 123 patients screened were enrolled, with 52 randomized to the placebo group (median age, 15 years; 40 male [76.9%]) and 56 to the metronomic chemotherapy group (median age, 13 years; 42 male [75.0%]). At a median follow-up of 2.9 months, 100% of the patients had disease progression by 6 months in the placebo group vs 96.4% in the metronomic chemotherapy group (P = .24). Median PFS and OS in the 2 groups was similar (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-1.03 [P = .07] for PFS; and HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50-1.09 [P = .13] for OS). In post hoc subgroup analysis, cohorts receiving more than 3 cycles (HR for PFS, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.23-0.93; P = .03) and those without a bone sarcoma (ie, neither primitive neuroectodermal tumor nor osteosarcoma) (HR for PFS, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.81; P = .01) appeared to benefit from metronomic chemotherapy.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Metronomic chemotherapy does not improve 6-month PFS, compared with placebo, among pediatric patients with extracranial progressive solid malignant tumors. However, patients without bone sarcoma and those able to tolerate therapy for more than 3 cycles (9 weeks) benefit.

KW  - FEATURES
AB  - Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS) is a rare malignant histiocytic proliferation of antigen presenting follicular dendritic cell. It is an uncommon primary malignancy first described by Monda et al. in 1986. Most commonly reported cases are lymph nodal. Occasional cases occur in extra nodal sites. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features, histomorphology and outcome of three patients with extranodal FDCS along with a concise review of literature on the topic. All three patients were adult females. Two patients were in third decade, and one had age of 50years. Among the three cases, two cases are presented as retroperitoneal mass and one as mediastinal mass. CT scans revealed heterogeneously enhancing masses. All the cases showed ovoid to spindle neoplastic cells arranged predominantly in whorling, fascicular and storiform patterns with inflammatory infiltrate. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells are positive for CD21, CD23, CD35 and Clustrin. In view of rarity and variable clinical presentation in FDCS, accurate diagnosis is necessary.

AB  - Major difficulty in development of dengue diagnostics is availability of suitable antigens. To overcome this, we made an attempt to develop a peptide based diagnosis which offers significant advantage over other methods. With the help of in silico methods, two epitopes were selected from envelope protein and three from NS1 protein of dengue virus. These were synthesized in combination as three multiple antigenic peptides (MAPs). We have tested 157 dengue positive sera confirmed for NS1 antigen. MAP1 showed 96.81% sera positive for IgM and 68.15% positive for IgG. MAP2 detected 94.90% IgM and 59.23% IgG positive sera. MAP3 also detected 96.17% IgM and 59.87% IgG positive sera. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study describing the use of synthetic multiple antigenic peptides for the diagnosis of dengue infection. This study describes MAPs as a promising tool for the use in serodiagnosis of dengue. (C) 2017 International Alliance for Biological Standardization. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ochrobactrum anthropi is an unusual emerging pathogen especially in the hospital environment. Most of the reported cases are nosocomially acquired infections in patients with various indwelling and invasive medical devices, such as central venous catheters and drainage tubes. We report a case of nosocomially transmitted invasive catheter related septicaemia with meningitis due to O. anthropi, in an elderly immunocompetent male with a head trauma admitted to a level -1 trauma centre. This report describes clinical and microbiological characteristics of rare pathogen and also highlights the importance of rapid identification, susceptibility testing of such opportunistic pathogens in trauma settings and its unique antibiotic susceptibility profiles. This requires prompt treatment with timely intervention, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy, alongside adherence to strict infection control practices.

AB  - The present study investigated the neuroprotective effects of taurine, an essential amino acid for growth and development of central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) model of cognitive impairment was used in male Wistar rats (270 +/- 20 g). Morris water maze, elevated plus maze and passive avoidance paradigm were used to assess cognitive performance. Taurine (40, 60 and 120 mg/kg) was administered orally for 28 days following STZ administration on day 1. Oxidative stress parameters (malondialdehyde, glutathione, nitric oxide and superoxide dismutase) and cholinesterases (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase) activity were measured at end of the study in the cortex and hippocampus. Levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, expression of rho kinase-II (ROCK-II), glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) were studied in cortex and hippocampus. STZ caused significant cognitive impairment as compared to normal control. Chronic administration of taurine attenuated STZ-induced cognitive impairment. Increased oxidative stress and increased levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta induced by STZ were also significantly attenuated by taurine. Taurine significantly (p < 0.05) decreased the STZ-induced increased expression of ROCK-II in cortex and hippocampus. Further, STZ-induced increased activity of cholinesterases was significantly (p < 0.001) mitigated by taurine. STZ decreased the expression of ChAT in hippocampus which was significantly (p < 0.05) reversed by taurine. However, GSK-3 beta expression was not altered by either STZ or taurine. The present study indicates that taurine exerts a neuroprotective role against STZ-induced cognitive impairment in rats. This effect is probably mediated by modulating oxidative stress, cholinesterases, inflammatory cytokines and expression of ROCK-II. Thus, this study suggests a potential of chronic taurine administration in cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's type. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare neoplasm comprising only 0.2% to 1% of all uterine malignancies and occurs in women between 42 and 59 yr of age. ESSs frequently express estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). However, the published literature contains scant data on the expression and therapeutic/prognostic role of androgen receptor (AR) in ESSs. We undertook this study to characterize the expression of AR along with ER and PR in ESSs and correlate it with clinicopathologic features. The clinical details, slides, and blocks of 25 tumors from 24 patients (September 2010 to February 2016) were retrieved. The diagnosis and grade of ESS were reviewed and immunohistochemistry performed with anti-ER, PR, and AR antibodies. Ages ranged from 18 to 50 yr, with a mean age of 36 yr. Low-grade ESS (LGESS) and high-grade ESS (HGESS) were diagnosed in 15 and 9 patients, respectively. An 18-yr-old woman who initially had LGESS suffered a pelvic recurrence; that exhibited high-grade morphology. Our patients, especially those with HGESS, were much younger compared with published worldwide data. ER, PR, and AR immunoreactivity was observed in 14 (93.3%), 12 (80%), and 11 (73.3%) LGESSs, respectively. This is in contrast to HGESSs, in which 5 (50%) tumors had a triple-negative hormonal profile. AR, like ER and PR, was more frequently expressed in LGESS as compared with HGESS. Whether AR, in addition to ER and PR receptor status, may help guide adjuvant hormonal therapy needs further elucidation.

AB  - Online gaming has greatly increased in popularity in recent years, and with this has come a multiplicity of problems due to excessive involvement in gaming. Gaming disorder, both online and offline, has been defined for the first time in the draft of 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). National surveys have shown prevalence rates of gaming disorder/addiction of 10%-15% among young people in several Asian countries and of 1%-10% in their counterparts in some Western countries. Several diseases related to excessive gaming are now recognized, and clinics are being established to respond to individual, family, and community concerns, but many cases remain hidden. Gaming disorder shares many features with addictions due to psychoactive substances and with gambling disorder, and functional neuroimaging shows that similar areas of the brain are activated. Governments and health agencies worldwide are seeking for the effects of online gaming to be addressed, and for preventive approaches to be developed. Central to this effort is a need to delineate the nature of the problem, which is the purpose of the definitions in the draft of ICD-11.

AB  - Purpose Cavernous malformations (CMs) are rare developmental cerebrovascular malformations of the central nervous system with a childhood prevalence of 0.3 to 0.53%. Our purpose was to assess the clinical features and microsurgical outcome in pediatric central nervous system (CNS) CMs.
   Material and methods We retrospectively enrolled all the CM patients admitted to our institute from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2014. Data was analyzed for their clinical features and surgical outcome.
   Results A total of 50 patients with CMs (30 supratentorial, 14 infratentorial, and 6 spinal) with a mean age of 14 years (318 years, SD +/- 4.64) were enrolled into the study. Most of these patients (78%) were male. Size varied from 1.2 to 6 cm. Three patients had multiple CMs. Symptoms of CMs were site specific. Seizure was the most common symptom (63.3%) of CMs at supratentorial location followed by headache (46%) and neurodeficiency (26%), while all brainstem and spinal CMs presented with neurodeficiencies. History of clinically significant acute hemorrhage was present in 19.2% of supratentorial (ST) superficial CMs, 50% of ST deep CMs, 25% of cerebellar CMs, 44.4% of brainstem CMs, and 50% of spinal CMs. Forty-five CMs in 44 patients were surgically excised. Their follow-up ranged from 6 to 162 months (mean 47.2 months, SD +/- 53). All supratentorial CM patients showed improvement in their symptoms. Patients with preoperative seizure showed good seizure control with Engel scale I in 16 (94.1%) and Engel scale II in 1 (5.9%). In infratentorial (IT) and spinal CM patients, 92.3 and 66.7% had improvement in their neurodeficiencies, respectively. There was no mortality in our series.
   Conclusion Microsurgical excision of CNS CM results in excellent neurological outcome in pediatric patients. Early intervention is necessary in spinal CMs for better outcome.

AB  - Background: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) may be precipitated by various hepatic insults. The present study evaluated the outcomes of ACLF with different acute insults.
   Patients and Methods: A total of 368 ACLF patients were included. Data collected included etiologies of acute hepatic insult and underlying chronic liver disease, and organ failure. Model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), chronic liver failure consortium (CLIF)-C ACLF, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores were calculated. Predictors of survival were assessed by the Cox proportional hazard model.
   Results: The most frequent acute insult was active alcohol consumption [150 (40.8%) patients], followed by hepatitis B virus (HBV) [71 (19.3%) patients], hepatitis E virus (HEV) superinfection [45 (12.2%) patients], autoimmune hepatitis flare [17 (4.6%) patients], antituberculosis drugs [16 (4.3%) patients], and hepatitis A virus superinfection [2 (0.5%) patients]; 67 (18.2%) cases were cryptogenic. Alcohol-ACLF and cryptogenic-ACLF were more severe. Median CLIF-C, MELD, and APACHE II scores in alcohol-ACLF and cryptogenic-ACLF were significantly higher than those in HBV-ACLF and HEV-ACLF (CLIF-C: 47.1, 47.4 vs. 42.9, 42.0, P=0.002; MELD: 29, 29.9 vs. 28.9, 25.2, P=0.02; APACHE II: 16.5, 18.0 vs. 12, 14, P<0.001, respectively). Frequencies of kidney and brain failures were also higher in alcohol/cryptogenic-ACLF than in HBV/HEV-ACLF (kidney failure: 35.3%/34.3% vs. 23.9%/11.1%, P=0.009; brain failure: 26.0%/22.4% vs. 15.5%/4.4%, P=0.01, respectively). Mortality in the alcohol-ACLF group was the highest (64.0%), followed by that in the cryptogenic-ACLF (62.7%), HBV-ACLF (45.1%), and HEV-ACLF (17.8%) groups (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, alcohol-ACLF had significantly higher mortality compared with HEV-ACLF (hazard ratio, 3.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-8.49, P=0.03).
   Conclusions: Alcohol/cryptogenic-ACLF had more severe pheno-typic presentation, more incidence of organ failures, and higher mortality compared with HEV/HBV-ACLF. Alcohol-ACLF had the highest mortality, whereas HEV-ACLF had the best survival.

AB  - Background: A case of orbital emphysema associated with elevated intraorbital pressure, presenting as a complication of a paranasal sinus "blow-out'' fracture after trauma to the orbit and globe is presented. Case Report: A 45-year-old man developed left globe rupture with orbital emphysema after blunt trauma. A large air pocket in the superior orbit with medial wall fracture and globe tenting was identified on noncontrast computed tomography. Direct needle drainage was performed using a 23-gauge needle attached to a saline-filled syringe with the plunger removed. Rapid release of air bubbles with prompt alleviation of pressure symptoms was observed. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: Early diagnosis and management of orbital emphysema can salvage useful function of the globe. The knowledge of this clinical entity and its management can prevent delay and unnecessary referral. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenotypic resistance to activated protein C (APC) is a complex mechanism associated with increased thrombosis risk. Activated protein C resistance (APCR) is mainly influenced by FVLeiden mutation, and various other single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FV gene are known to be associated with APCR. The aim of present study was to investigate the incidence and assess possible mechanisms of APCR in Indian patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Three hundred and ten Doppler-proven patients with DVT were screened for APCR, and 50 APCR positive patients and 50 controls were typed for FVLeiden, Hong Kong, Cambridge, HR2 haplotype, Glu666Asp, Ala485Lys, and Liverpool using either polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism or allele specific PCR. FVLeiden was commonest cause of APCR (50%) in Indian patients with DVT being statistically significant (P = .001) compared to controls. FV Liverpool, FV Glu666Asp and FV Ala485Lys were studied for the first time in Indian population. FV Liverpool, FV Glu666Asp, Hong Kong, and Cambridge were found to be absent. High frequency of Ala485Lys in patients shows that it might be a risk factor contributing to APCR in Indian patients with DVT. HR2 haplotype was not associated with APCR; however, presence of homozygous HR2 haplotype in patients only indicates the role it might play in Indian APCR population. In conclusion, contribution of FVLeiden causing APCR in Indian population is not as strong as previously reported in Western countries. The presence of other SNPs observed in the present study requires such studies on larger sample size to understand the molecular basis of defect.

AB  - Objectives: Sleep duration and disturbances may be risk factors for hypertension. Despite the high burden of hypertension in South Asia, little is known about this relationship in this region.
   Methods: We analyzed population-level cross-sectional data from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) study that recruited representative samples of adults >= 20 years from three cities-Delhi, Chennai (India), and Karachi (Pakistan) during 2010-2011. We defined hypertension as self-reported treatment or measured blood pressure (BP) >= 140/90 mm Hg. Data on usual duration of sleep, insomnia, and snoring were collected using " The Sleep Habits Questionnaire" and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) using Epworth Sleepiness Score. Logistic and linear regression were done with hypertension and BP as outcome variables, respectively. Age, gender, education, wealth index, family history, and body mass index (BMI) were included as covariates. We used multiple imputation to account for missing variables.
   Results: Prevalence of hypertension was 30.1%. The mean (SD) sleep duration was 7.3 (1.2) hours. Insomnia, snoring, and EDS were present in 13.6%, 28.7%, and 4.6%, respectively. Moderate and habitual snoring were associated with increased odds of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 1.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.04 to 1.33] and 1.47 [1.29 to 1.67], respectively), after adjusting for covariates. Rare, occasional, and frequent insomnia were associated with increased hypertension (OR 1.41 [1.12 to 1.77], 1.39 [1.16 to 1.67], and 1.34 [1.09 to 1.65], respectively). Sleep duration and EDS were not associated with hypertension.
   Conclusion: Self-reported snoring and insomnia were associated with hypertension in South Asia. This relationship needs further exploration through robust longitudinal studies in this region.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate specular microscopy of chronic primary angle- closure glaucoma (CPACG) eyes at least 1 year after Nd: YAG iridotomy, and compare them with CPACG eyes without an iridotomy and age- matched, normal eyes.
   Patients and Method: Consecutive patients of CPACG at the Glaucoma service were screened. All patients underwent slit-lamp biomicroscopy, + 90 D examination, and applanation tonometry. A total of 100 eyes of 100 consecutive patients of CPACG with an Nd:YAG iridotomy performed >= 1 year before, who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, 60 consecutive CPACG eyes without an iridotomy, and 60 age and refraction-matched control eyes were enrolled. A specular microscopy was performed in one eye of each patient by an observer masked to diagnosis.
   Results: CPACG patients had a mean age of 62 +/- 8 years, a mean intraocular pressure of 18 +/- 5.3mmHg, a mean specular count of 2536 +/- 224 cells/mm(2), and mean duration after iridotomy of 3.2 +/- 2 years. There was a significant correlation of specular endothelial counts with age (r= - 0.39; P< 0.001) and interval after iridotomy (r= - 0.25; P= 0.01). CPACG eyes without an iridotomy had a mean age of 62 +/- 5 years and a mean specular count of 2469 +/- 199 cells/mm2. Normal control eyes with a mean age of 61 +/- 6 years had a mean specular count of 2729 +/- 299 cells/mm2. There was no significant difference in specular count between CPACG eyes with or without an iridotomy (P= 0.19); however, both CPACG groups had a specular count significantly lower than controls (P= 0.01 and 0.02, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference seen in polymegathism (coefficient of variation) and pleomorphism (% of hexagonal cells) in endothelial cells among the 3 groups.
   Conclusions: An Nd:YAG iridotomy in CPACG eyes did not lead to any significant changes in central corneal specular microscopy in the long term as compared with patients who did not undergo iridotomy. Eyes with CPACG, without and after an iridotomy, had a lower specular count compared with age-matched controls.

AB  - Background & objectives: Pancreatic cancer has a propensity for wide stromal invasion. Matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) is a protease that degrades the peri-tumoural tissue and helps in tumour dissemination. Thus, this study was aimed to assess any association of plasma MMP-2 levels with clinicopathological parameters and survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.
   Methods: Plasma samples from 127 pancreatic cancer patients were analyzed for MMP-2 levels by ELISA. Survival and other clinicopathological parameters of patients were analyzed for any correlation with plasma MMP-2 levels.
   Results: The mean MMP-2 levels in pancreatic cancer patients were 560.3 +/- 222.0 ng/ml which were significantly elevated compared to chronic pancreatitis patients (P<0.001) and healthy individuals (P<0.05). The plasma levels of MMP-2 significantly correlated with tissue expression of this protease (P=0.004). However, MMP-2 levels did not exhibit any association either with clinicopathological parameters or with survival.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Elevated MMP-2 levels were observed in blood of pancreatic cancer patients which correlated with its tissue expression. However, these levels did not associate with survival or any clinicopathological parameters of patients. Further studies need to be done to confirm the prognostic/clinical significance of MMP-2 in cancer patients before and after surgery.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance among patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy and the impact of rectal swab culture-directed antibiotic prophylaxis on postbiopsy infectious complications.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively analyzed all patients undergoing TRUS-guided prostate biopsy from April 2013 to February 2015. Antibiotic prophylaxis was tailored to the results of rectal swab cultures. If the organism was fluoroquinolone-sensitive, oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg with tinidazole 600 mg was prescribed. If the organism was fluoroquinolone-resistant, then a culturedirected antibiotic was prescribed. In both cases the antibiotic was continued for 3 days. All patients were followed for 14 days after biopsy to record infectious complications.
   Results: A total of 247 patients were included, and Escherichia coli was isolated on rectal swab cultures in 99.5% of the patients. Of these, 41.7% harbored fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli. Piperacillin/tazobactam was the most common culture-directed antibiotic prescribed (59.3%), with amoxicillin/clavulanic being the second most common (25.5%) for the fluoroquinolone-resistant group. Only 2 patients (0.9%) developed postbiopsy fever and none had sepsis.
   Conclusions: Colonization of rectal flora with fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was seen in 40% of men undergoing prostate biopsy. Targeted prophylaxis, which uses the results of prebiopsy rectal swab culture to direct antibiotic prophylaxis, results in low rates of postbiopsy infections.

AB  - The present study was carried out with the objectives of genotyping Pneumocystis jirovecii at three distinct loci, to identify the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and to study its clinical implications in patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Analysis of genetic diversity in P. jirovecii from immunocompromised patients was carried out by genotyping at three distinct loci encoding mitochondrial large subunit rRNA (mtLSU rRNA), cytochrome b (CYB), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays followed by direct DNA sequencing. Of the 300 patients enrolled in the present study, 31 (10.33%) were positive for PCP by a specific mtLSU rRNA nested PCR assay, whereas only 15 P. jirovecii could be amplified at the other two loci (SOD and CYB). These positives were further subjected to sequence typing. Important genotypic combinations between four SNPs (mt85, SOD110, SOD215, and CYB838) and clinical outcomes could be observed in the present study, and mt85A, mt85T, and SOD110C/SOD215T were frequently associated with "negative follow-up". These SNPs were also noted to be relatively more prevalent amongst circulating genotypes in our study population. The present study is the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent and demonstrated that potential SNPs of P. jirovecii may possibly be attributed to the clinical outcome of PCP episodes in terms of severity or fatality in different susceptible populations likely to develop PCP during their course of illness.

AB  - Tuberculosis continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is the leading cause of infection-related deaths worldwide. Children are amongst the high-risk groups for developing tuberculosis and often pose a challenge to the clinicians in making a definitive diagnosis. The newly released global tuberculosis report from World Health Organization reveals a 50% increase in fatality from tuberculosis in children. Significantly, diagnostic and treatment algorithms of tuberculosis for children differ from those of adults. Bacteriologic confirmation of the disease is often difficult in children; hence radiologists have an important role to play in early diagnosis of this disease. Despite advancing technology, the key diagnostic imaging modalities for primary care and emergency services, especially in rural and low-resource areas, are chest radiography and ultrasonography. In this article, we discuss various diagnostic imaging modalities used in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis and their indications. We highlight the use of US as point-of-care service along with mediastinal US and rapid MRI protocols, especially in mediastinal lymphadenopathy and thoracic complications. MRI is the ideal modality in high-resource areas when adequate infrastructure is available. Because the prevalence of tuberculosis is highest in lower-resource countries, we also discuss global initiatives in low-resource settings.

AB  - Objectives: To explore the feasibility of multi-isocentric 4 volumetric-modulated arc therapy (MI4-VMAT) for the complex targets of head and neck cancers.
   Methods: Twenty-five previously treated patients of HNC underwent re-planning to improve the dose distributions with either coplanar VMAT technique (CP-VMAT) or noncoplanar MI4-VMAT plans. The latter, involving 3-6 noncoplanar arcs and 2-3 isocenters were re-optimized using the same priorities and objectives. Dosimetric comparison on standard metrics from dose-volume histograms was performed to appraise relative merits of the two techniques. Pretreatment quality assurance was performed with IMRT phantoms to assess deliverability and accuracy of the MI4-VMAT plans. The gamma agreement index (GAI) analysis with criteria of 3 mm distance to agreement (DTA) and 3% dose difference (DD) was applied.
   Results: CP-VMAT and MI4-VMAT plans achieved the same degree of coverage for all target volumes related to near-to-minimum and near-to-maximum doses. MI4-VM plans resulted in an improved sparing of organs at risk. The average mean dose reduction to the parotids, larynx, oral cavity, and pharyngeal muscles were 3 Gy, 4 Gy, 5 Gy, and 4.3 Gy, respectively. The average maximum dose reduction to the brain stem, spinal cord, and oral cavity was 6.0 Gy, 3.8 Gy, and 2.4 Gy. Pretreatment QA results showed that plans can be reliably delivered with mean gamma agreement index of 97.0 +/- 1.1%.
   Conclusions: MI4-VMAT plans allowed to decrease the dose-volume-metrics for relevant OAR and results are reliable from a dosimetric standpoint. Early clinical experience has begun and future studies will report treatment outcome.

Here, we report the standardization and application of multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of molecular markers of pathogenic potential in L. pneumophila in hospital environment.
   Methods: Culture of the standard strains of L. pneumophila was performed in buffered charcoal-yeast extract agar with L-cysteine at pH 6.9. Primers were designed for multiplex PCR, and standardization for the detection of five markers annotated to L. pneumophila plasmid pLPP (11A2), lipopolysaccharide synthesis (19H4), CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (10B12), conjugative coupling factor (24B1) and hypothetical protein (8D6) was done. A total of 195 water samples and 200 swabs were collected from the hospital environment. The bacterium was isolated from the hospital environment by culture and confirmed by 16S rRNA gene PCR and restriction enzyme analysis. A total of 45 L. pneumophila isolates were studied using the standardized multiplex PCR.
   Results: The PCR was sensitive to detect 0.1 ng/mu l DNA and specific for the two standard strains used in the study. Of the 45 hospital isolates tested, 11 isolates had four markers, 12 isolates had three markers, 10 isolates had two markers, nine isolates had one marker and three isolates had none of the markers. None of the isolates had all the five markers.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study showed the presence of gene markers of pathogenic potential of the bacterium L. pneumophila. However, the genomic constitution of the environmental isolates should be correlated with clinical isolates to prove their pathogenic potential. Rapid diagnostic methods such as multiplex PCR reported here, for elucidating gene markers, could help in future epidemiological studies of bacterium L. pneumophila.

AB  - Warthin-like papillary thyroid carcinoma (WLPTC) is a rare morphological variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma which mimics various benign and malignant lesions on thyroid aspiration cytology. As correct cytological diagnosis is the cornerstone for appropriate patient management, awareness of the salient cytomorphological characteristics of this tumor is essential. Here, we present cytological features of a case of WLPTC along with discussion of the common differential diagnoses and a brief review of the literature to ascertain the most consistent cytological findings ofWLPTC. The present case also harboured BRAFV600E mutation which is the commonest molecular alteration seen in WLPTC.

AB  - The prevalence of myopia and its severe/progressive visually impairing forms is increasing all over the globe. Most of the preliminary clinical research has focused on rehabilitation and treatment of its complications. Pharmacological prevention of myopic progression has shown encouraging results recently and currently the scleral structure is believed to be responsible for disease progression. In this article, we have hypothesized injecting a biological cement in the potential space between the choroid and the sclera to halt the progressive elongation of the eye ball while preventing complications related to myopia.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention program in lowering Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk.
   Methods: This was a single-arm, pre-post interventional study including data from a historical cohort with low to moderate risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It was conducted in a tertiary-care hospital. Participants with low (0 or 1 CVD risk factors) to moderately high risk (10-year risk between 10% and 20% and two or more CVD risk factors) were included. Participants with previously diagnosed CVD, defined as a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or cerebrovascular accident, were excluded from the analysis. However, those with controlled hypertension were included. Intervention included a pretested short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention, which included asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), meditation, relaxation techniques, stress management, group support, nutrition awareness program, and individualized advice. The intervention was for 10 days, spread over 2 weeks. However, participants were encouraged to include it in their day-to-day life. Outcomes included changes in FRS, and estimated 10-year CVD risk from baseline to week 2. A gender-based subgroup analysis was also done, and correlation between changes in FRS and cardiovascular risk factors was evaluated.
   Results: Data for 554 subjects were screened, and 386 subjects (252 females) were included in the analysis. There was a significant reduction in FRS (p < 0.001) and estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk (p < 0.001) following the short-term yoga-based intervention. There was a strong positive correlation between reduction in FRS and serum total cholesterol (r = 0.60; p < 0.001). There was a moderate positive correlation between reduction in FRS and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.58; p < 0.001), and a weak but positive correlation between reduction in FRS and triglycerides (r = 0.26; p <= 0.001), serum very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.29; p < 0.001), and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.20; p <= 0.001).
   Conclusions: This yoga-based lifestyle intervention program significantly reduced the CVD risk, as shown by lowered FRS and estimated 10-year CVD risk. Further testing of this promising intervention is warranted in the long term.

AB  - Purpose: The optimal method for fixation of extra-articular distal humerus factures poses a management dilemma. Although various plate configurations have been proposed, anatomic shaped extra-articular distal humerus locking plates have emerged as a viable solution for these complex injuries. We assessed clinico-radiologic outcome in our retrospective case series of extra-articular distal humerus fractures managed with these plates. Methods: Forty-five patients of extra-articular distal humerus fractures, who were operated at our level 1 trauma centre between January, 2012 and December, 2016, were identified. After exclusion, 36 patients were available for the final assessment. All patients were operated with the triceps-reflecting modified posterior approach. Regular clinico-radiologic follow-up was done evaluating elbow functionality, fracture union, secondary displacement, non-union, implant failure and any complications; Mayo Elbow Performance score (MEPS) was used for the final functional assessment. Results: Twenty-four (66.7%) male and 12 (33.3%) female patients constituted the study group, who had an average follow-up of 15 months. Preoperatively three patients and post-operatively one patient had radial nerve palsy; all had neurapraxia and recovered completely. Overall, 34 (94.4%) patients were adjudged to have complete radiological union within 3 months; 2 (5.5%) patients developed non-union. Mean flexion achieved was 122.9 degrees +/- 23 degrees, and mean extension was -4.03 degrees +/- 6.5 degrees; 1 patient with head injury developed flexion deformity of 45 degrees. Average MEPS at the final follow-up was 90.8 degrees +/- 9.9 degrees. Conclusion: Stable reconstruction and early initiation of physiotherapy are utilitarian to envision optimal outcome; the use of precontoured extra-articular distal humerus locking plates has yielded satisfactory results with minimal complications in our hands.

AB  - cSilk biomaterials can be designed to provide an architectural framework comparable to connate extracellular matrix in order to boost cell growth and eventual tissue regeneration. Silk (Bombyx mori) fibroins self-assemble into hydrophobic crystalline beta sheets, which provide mechanical strength and tunable degradability. The next generation of tissue engineering scaffolds aim to provide spatially controlled modulation of cell adhesion and differentiation, which can be achieved by spatially controlled surface functionalization of the scaffolds. In this respect, it is even more important to be able to release molecules at timescales ranging from hours to days, as many biological processes require signals early on to initiate processes, and over prolonged periods to sustain them. Unfortunately, achieving spatio-temporal control over multiple release profiles from silk based substrates is challenging due to their intrinsic slow release behaviour. Here, we report a simple strategy that provides spatio-temporal control over the release of drugs from silk films (SFs). We have developed a UV based strategy to modify the SFs with nanogels, which can provide a fast as well as slow release profile from a single platform. We demonstrate that the release profile of encapsulated molecules on the SF substrate can be tuned from fast (within hours) to slow (within days), thus resulting in a dual release system, which can be eventually utilized to deliver bioactive molecules at specific regions with different rates to achieve the desired multiple biological effects.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory disorder of the colon arises from dysregulated immune response towards gut microbes. Transcription factor NF kappa B is a major regulatory component influencing mucosal inflammation. We evaluated expression of Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Induced Protein3 (TNFAIP3), the inhibitor of NF kappa B activation and its associated partners ITCH, RNF11 and Tax1BP1 in inflamed mucosa of UC patients. We found highly significant up-regulated mRNA expression of TNFAIP3 that negatively correlated with disease activity in UC. mRNA levels of ITCH, RNF11 and Tax1BP1 were significantly down-regulated. Significant positive correlation with disease activity was noted for Tax1BP1. All four genes showed significant down-regulation at protein level. mRNA levels of inducers of TNFAIP3 expression, NF kappa B p65 subunit and MAST3 was determined. There was significant increase in p65 mRNA expression and down-regulated MAST3 expression. This suggested that increase in NF kappa B expression regulates TNFAIP3 levels. Deficiency of TNFAIP3 expression resulted in significant up-regulation of NF kappa B p65 sub-unit as well as its downstream genes such as iNOS, an inflammatory marker, inhibitors of apoptosis like cIAP2 and XIAP and mediators of anti-apoptotic signals TRAF1 and TRAF2. Taken together, decreased expression of TNFAIP3 and its partners contribute to inflammation and up-regulation of apoptosis inhibitors that may create microenvironment for colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Degludec is an ultralong-acting, once-daily basal insulin that is approved for use in adults, adolescents, and children with diabetes. Previous open-label studies have shown lower day-to-day variability in the glucose-lowering effect and lower rates of hypoglycemia among patients who received degludec than among those who received basal insulin glargine. However, data are lacking on the cardiovascular safety of degludec.
   METHODS
   We randomly assigned 7637 patients with type 2 diabetes to receive either insulin degludec (3818 patients) or insulin glargine U100 (3819 patients) once daily between dinner and bedtime in a double-blind, treat-to-target, event-driven cardiovascular outcomes trial. The primary composite outcome in the time-to-event analysis was the first occurrence of an adjudicated major cardiovascular event (death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke) with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.3. Adjudicated severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the American Diabetes Association, was the prespecified, multiplicity-adjusted secondary outcome.
   RESULTS
   Of the patients who underwent randomization, 6509 (85.2%) had established cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, or both. At baseline, the mean age was 65.0 years, the mean duration of diabetes was 16.4 years, and the mean (+/- SD) glycated hemoglobin level was 8.4 +/- 1.7%; 83.9% of the patients were receiving insulin. The primary outcome occurred in 325 patients (8.5%) in the degludec group and in 356 (9.3%) in the glargine group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.06; P<0.001 for noninferiority). At 24 months, the mean glycated hemoglobin level was 7.5 +/- 1.2% in each group, whereas the mean fasting plasma glucose level was significantly lower in the degludec group than in the glargine group (128 +/- 56 vs. 136 +/- 57 mg per deciliter, P<0.001). Prespecified adjudicated severe hypoglycemia occurred in 187 patients (4.9%) in the degludec group and in 252 (6.6%) in the glargine group, for an absolute difference of 1.7 percentage points (rate ratio, 0.60; P<0.001 for superiority; odds ratio, 0.73; P<0.001 for superiority). Rates of adverse events did not differ between the two groups.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Among patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular events, degludec was noninferior to glargine with respect to the incidence of major cardiovascular events.

AB  - Sepsis in early infancy results in one million annual deaths worldwide, most of them in developing countries. No efficient means of prevention is currently available. Here we report on a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of an oral synbiotic preparation (Lactobacillus plantarum plus fructooligosaccharide) in rural Indian newborns. We enrolled 4,556 infants that were at least 2,000 g at birth, at least 35 weeks of gestation, and with no signs of sepsis or other morbidity, and monitored them for 60 days. We show a significant reduction in the primary outcome (combination of sepsis and death) in the treatment arm (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.48-0.74), with few deaths (4 placebo, 6 synbiotic). Significant reductions were also observed for culture-positive and culture-negative sepsis and lower respiratory tract infections. These findings suggest that a large proportion of neonatal sepsis in developing countries could be effectively prevented using a synbiotic containing L. plantarum ATCC-202195.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Rheumatic heart disease remains an important preventable cause of cardiovascular death and disability, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. We estimated global, regional, and national trends in the prevalence of and mortality due to rheumatic heart disease as part of the 2015 Global Burden of Disease study.
   METHODS
   We systematically reviewed data on fatal and nonfatal rheumatic heart disease for the period from 1990 through 2015. Two Global Burden of Disease analytic tools, the Cause of Death Ensemble model and DisMod-MR 2.1, were used to produce estimates of mortality and prevalence, including estimates of uncertainty.
   RESULTS
   We estimated that there were 319,400 (95% uncertainty interval, 297,300 to 337,300) deaths due to rheumatic heart disease in 2015. Global age-standardized mortality due to rheumatic heart disease decreased by 47.8% (95% uncertainty interval, 44.7 to 50.9) from 1990 to 2015, but large differences were observed across regions. In 2015, the highest age-standardized mortality due to and prevalence of rheumatic heart disease were observed in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub-Saharan Africa. We estimated that in 2015 there were 33.4 million (95% uncertainty interval, 29.7 million to 43.1 million) cases of rheumatic heart disease and 10.5 million (95% uncertainty interval, 9.6 million to 11.5 million) disability-adjusted life-years due to rheumatic heart disease globally.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We estimated the global disease prevalence of and mortality due to rheumatic heart disease over a 25-year period. The health-related burden of rheumatic heart disease has declined worldwide, but high rates of disease persist in some of the poorest regions in the world.

AB  - Objective
   To determine the type and nature of traditional eye medicine (TEM), their sources and use and practices related to self-medication for ophthalmic diseases in a rural Indian population.
   Methods
   A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted in 25 randomly selected clusters of Rural Gurgaon, Haryana, India as part of CORE (Cornea Opacity Rural Epidemiological) study. In addition to comprehensive ophthalmic examination, health-seeking behavior and use of self-medication and TEM was assessed in the adult population using a semi-structured questionnaire. Physical verification of available ophthalmic medications in the enumerated households was conducted by the study team. Descriptive statistics were computed along with multivariable logistic regression analysis to determine associated factors for use of self-medication and TEM.
   Results
   Of the 2160 participants interviewed, 396 (18.2%) reported using ophthalmic medications without consulting an ophthalmologist, mainly for symptoms like watering (37.1%), redness (27.7%), itching (19.2%) and infection (13.6%). On physical verification of available eye drops that were being used without prescription, 26.4% participants were practicing self-medication. Steroid, expired/unlabeled and indigenous eye drops were being used by 151 (26.5%), 120(21.1%) and 75 (13.2%) participants respectively. Additionally, 25.7% (529) participants resorted to home remedies like 'kajal'(61.4%), honey (31.4%), ghee (11.7%) and rose water (9.1%).
   Conclusion
   Use of TEM is prevalent in this population. The rampant use of steroid eye drops without prescription along with use of expired or unlabelled eye drops warrants greater emphasis on safe eye care practices in this population. Public awareness and regulatory legislations must be implemented to decrease harmful effects arising due to such practices.

AB  - Objective
   To evaluate the performance of Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 in the diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) in sputum smear-negative pulmonary TB cases.
   Methods
   A total of 572 Ziehl-Neelsen sputum smear-negative samples were selected and subjected to line probe assay (Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0), and culture in mycobacterial growth indicator tube (MGIT-960). Immunochromatographic test was used to confirm the MTB-complex (MTBC) in culture-positive samples and phenotypic drug-susceptibility testing was done using MGIT-960.
   Results
   The line probe assay was able to diagnose MTBC in 38.2% (213/558) of specimens after excluding 14 nontuberculous mycobacteria. Sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 68.4% and 89.3% respectively, considering MGIT-960 culture as gold standard after excluding contaminated and invalid results. On comparing with composite reference standard, the assay had 71.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting resistance to rifampicin (RMP) were 100% and 99.24% respectively and for resistance to isoniazid (INH) were 97.62% and 98.55%, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Genotype MTBDRplus VER 2.0 is a rapid and precise diagnostic tool for detection of MTB in sputum smear-negative samples. It also facilitates accurate diagnosis of RMP and INH resistance within turn around-time.

AB  - Cysticercosis is a preventable and eradicable cause of blindness endemic in the Indian subcontinent, South-East Asia and other developing countries. Ocular and orbital cysticercosis has varied presentations depending upon the site of involvement, number of lesion and the host immune response. In this article we present a review of the various clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management protocol for orbital and ocular cysticercosis. Owing to its varied presentation, cysticercosis may pose a diagnostic challenge to the health professionals. Early diagnosis and management can prevent the vision loss and optimize visual outcomes.

AB  - Objective: DNA extraction prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification in genetic diagnoses of triplet repeat disorders (TRDs) is tedious and labour-intensive and has the limitations of sample contamination with foreign DNA, including that from preceding samples. Therefore, we aimed to develop a rapid, robust, and cost-effective method for expeditious genetic investigation of TRDs from whole blood as a DNA template.
   Methods: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 70 clinically suspected patients of progressive ataxia. The conventional method using genomic DNA and single-step Blood-Direct PCR (BD-PCR) method with just 2 1 of whole blood sample were tested to amplify triplet repeat expansion in genes related to spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) types 1, 2, 3,12 and Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA). Post-PCR, the allele sizes were mapped and repeat numbers were calculated using GeneMapper and macros run in Microsoft Excel programmes.
   Results: Successful amplification of target regions was achieved in all samples by both methods. The frequency of the normal and mutated allele was concordant between both methods, diagnosing 37% positive for a mutation in either of the candidate genes. The BD-PCR resulted in higher intensities of product peaks of normal and pathogenic alleles.
   Conclusions: The nearly-accurate sizing of the normal and expanded allele was achieved in a shorter time (4-5 h), without DNA extraction and any risk of cross contamination, which suggests the BD-PCR to be a reliable, inexpensive, and rapid method to confirm TRDs. This technique can be introduced in routine diagnostic procedures of other tandem repeat disorders. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - HIV-1 Tat transactivates viral genes through strong interaction with TAR RNA. The stem-loop bulged region of TAR consisting of three nucleotides at the position 23-25 and the loop region consisting of six nucleotides at the position 30-35 are essential for viral transactivation. The arginine motif of Tat (five arginine residues on subtype TatC) is critically important for TAR interaction. Any mutations in this motif could lead to reduce transactivation ability and pathogenesis. Here, we identified structurally important residues (arginine and lysine residues) of Tat in this motif could bind to TAR via hydrogen bond interactions which is critical for transactivation. Natural mutant Ser46Phe in the core motif could likely led to conformational change resulting in more hydrogen bond interactions than the wild type Tat making it highly potent transactivator. Importantly, we report the possible probabilities of number of hydrogen bond interactions in the wild type Tat and the mutants with TAR complexes. This study revealed the differential transactivation of subtype B and C Tat could likely be due to the varying number of hydrogen bonds with TAR. Our data support that the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of Tat is involved in the TAR interactions through hydrogen bonds which is important for transactivation. This study highlights the evolving pattern of structurally important determinants of Tat in the arginine motif for viral transactivation.

AB  - Background: Studies to identify an ideal trauma score tool representing prediction of outcomes of the pediatric fall patient remains elusive. Our study was undertaken to identify better predictor of mortality in the pediatric fall patients.
   Methods: Data was retrieved from prospectively maintained trauma registry project at level 1 trauma center developed as part of Multicentric Project-Towards Improving Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO) in India. Single center data retrieved from a prospectively maintained trauma registry at a level 1 trauma center, New Delhi, for a period ranging from 1 October 2013 to 17 February 2015 was evaluated. Standard anatomic scores Injury Severity Score (ISS) and New Injury Severity Score (NISS) were compared with physiologic score Revised Trauma Score (RTS) using receiver operating curve (ROC).
   Results: Heart rate and RTS had a statistical difference among the survivors to nonsurvivors. ISS, NISS, and RTS were having 50, 50, and 86% of area under the curve on ROCs, and RTS was statistically significant among them.
   Conclusions: Physiologically based trauma score systems (RTS) are much better predictors of inhospital mortality in comparison to anatomical based scoring systems (ISS and NISS) for unintentional pediatric falls.

   To investigate the miRNA expression in colonic mucosal biopsies from endoscopically inflamed and non inflamed regions of ulcerative colitis (UC) patients.
   METHODS
   Colonic mucosal pinch biopsies were analyzed from the inflamed and non inflamed regions of same UC patient. Total RNA was isolated and differential miRNA profiling was done using microarray platform. Quantitative Real Time PCR was performed in colonic biopsies from inflamed (n = 8) and non-inflamed (n = 8) regions of UC and controls (n = 8) to validate the differential expression of miRNA. Potential targets of dysregulated miRNA were identified by using in silico prediction tools and probable role of these miRNA in inflammatory pathways were predicted.
   RESULTS
   The miRNA profile of inflamed colonic mucosa differs significantly from the non-inflamed. Real time PCR analysis showed that some of the miRNA were differentially expressed in the inflamed mucosa as compared to non inflamed mucosa and controls (miR-125b, miR-223, miR-138, and miR-155), while (miR-200a) did not show any significant changes. In contrast to microarray, where miR-378d showed downregulation in the inflamed mucosa, qRT-PCR showed a significant upregulation in the inflamed mucosa as compared to the non inflamed. The in silico prediction analysis revealed that the genes targeted by these miRNAs play role in the major signaling pathways like MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, cell adhesion molecules which are all assciated with UC.
   CONCLUSION
   The present study reports disease specific alteration in the expression of miR-125b, miR-155, miR-223 and miR-138 in UC patients and also predict their biological significance.

AB  - Background Most people with stroke in India have no access to organised rehabilitation services. The effectiveness of training family members to provide stroke rehabilitation is uncertain. Our primary objective was to determine whether family-led stroke rehabilitation, initiated in hospital and continued at home, would be superior to usual care in a low-resource setting.
   Methods The Family-led Rehabilitation after Stroke in India (ATTEND) trial was a prospectively randomised open trial with blinded end point done across 14 hospitals in India. Patients aged 18 years or older who had had a stroke within the past month, had residual disability and reasonable expectation of survival, and who had an informal family nominated caregiver were randomly assigned to intervention or usual care by site coordinators using a secure web based system with minimisation by site and stroke severity. The family members of participants in the intervention group received additional structured rehabilitation training-including information provision, joint goal setting, carer training, and task-specific training-that was started in hospital and continued at home for up to 2 months. The primary outcome was death or dependency at 6 months, defined by scores 3-6 on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) as assessed by masked observers. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2013/04/003557), Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000078752), and Universal Trial Number (U1111-1138-6707).
   Findings Between Jan 13, 2014, and Feb 12, 2016, 1250 patients were randomly assigned to intervention (n=623) or control (n=627) groups. 33 patients were lost to follow-up (14 intervention, 19 control) and five patients withdrew (two intervention, three control). At 6 months, 285 (47%) of 607 patients in the intervention group and 287 (47%) of 605 controls were dead or dependent (odds ratio 0.98, 95% CI 0.78-1.23, p=0.87). 72 (12%) patients in the intervention group and 86 (14%) in the control group died (p=0.27), and we observed no difference in rehospitalisation (89 [14%] patients in the intervention group vs 82 [13%] in the control group; p=0.56). We also found no difference in total nonfatal events (112 events in 82 [13%] intervention patients vs 110 events in 79 [13%] control patients; p=0.80).
   Interpretation Although task shifting is an attractive solution for health-care sustainability, our results do not support investment in new stroke rehabilitation services that shift tasks to family caregivers, unless new evidence emerges. A future avenue of research should be to investigate the effects of task shifting to health-care assistants or team-based community care.

AB  - Objective: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease of young with threat to vision if not diagnosed timely. This study looked at the putative predictors of poor visual outcome in patients with IIH at six months after presentation via a cohort study.
   Patients and methods: All patients diagnosed with IIH from January 2011 to May 2015 were enrolled. The study design was ambispective cohort study. The baseline clinical and radiological characteristics assessed were age, sex, body mass index (BMI), duration of symptoms, transient visual obscuration, cranial nerve palsy, diminution of vision, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure, empty sella, optic nerve dilatation, global configuration and transverse sinus stenosis. Follow up of visual outcome at six months was done to know the predictors of poor visual outcome.
   Results: Eighty nine (89) patients were enrolled and 56 patients had follow-up of six months at the time of analysis. Majority of the patients were females (73/89 (82%)). The mean age was 29.9 +/- 11.0 years. Mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.1 +/- 5.4 kg/m(2). Diminution of vision at presentation was seen in 54 (62%) patients. 64 eyes (36%) had visual acuity less than 6/18. Poor visual outcome at six months was seen in 23(41%) patients. Diminution of vision at presentation was found to be a poor predictor.
   Conclusion: We found female sex and obesity to be less prevalent in our setting. Diminution of vision at presentation was a predictor of poor visual outcome at six months.

AB  - Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) is a chronic, progressive, cutaneous and subcutaneous fungal infection following the traumatic implantation of certain dematiaceous fungi. The disease has worldwide prevalence with predominant cases reported from humid tropical and subtropical regions of America, Asia, and Africa. Diagnosis is often delayed or misdirected either due to poor degree of clinical suspicions or clinical simulation of dermatological conditions. The infection is not uncommon in India and several case reports from the sub-Himalayan belt and western and eastern coasts of India have been published; however, very few have reviewed the cases. We reviewed 169 cases published in English literature from India during 1957 through May 2016, including 2 recent cases from our institute. A tremendous increase in the number of reported cases was noticed since 2012, since which, more than 50% of the cases had been published. A majority of the patients (74.1%) were involved in various agricultural activities directly or indirectly. The mean age at presentation was 43.3 years +/- 16.0, with male to female ratio of 4.2:1. The duration of disease at the time of presentation varied from 20 days to 35 years. Any history of trauma was recalled only in 33.8% of the studied cases. The lower extremity was the most common site afflicted, followed by the upper extremity. The culture was positive in 80.3% of the cases with Fonsecaea pedrosoi, isolated as the most common fungal pathogen, followed by Cladophialophora carrionii. Although all the commercially available antifungals were prescribed in these cases, itraconazole and terbinafine were the most commonly used, either alone or in combination with other drugs/physical methods, with variable degrees of outcome. Combinations of different treatment modalities (chemotherapy and physical methods) yielded a cure rate of 86.3%. CBM is refractory to treatment and no single antifungal agent or regimen has demonstrated satisfactory results. Increased awareness with early clinical suspicion of the disease and adequate therapy are necessary to improve the outcome. However, depending upon the causative agent, disease severity, and the choice of antifungals, variable outcomes can be observed.

AB  - Objectives: Herbal drugs are popularly emerging as complementary and alternative medicines in cancer patients because of their cost effectiveness and minimal side-effects. The extract of Operculina turpethum (OT) is known to have antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and purgative properties. Since it is popularly known have antiinflammatory activity, we investigated its anti-tumor activity on four oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (OSCC) namely, (SCC-4, KB, SCC-9 and SCC-25).
   Design: Antitumor activities of Operculina turpathum extract (OTE) was investigated by MTT and clonogenic assay, effect on cell cycle and apoptosis induction by Annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry and invasive potential of the tumor was determined by matrigel assay. The expression of various proteins involved in these mechanisms was analysed by western blotting.
   Results: OTE specifically inhibited the growth and colony formation of OSCC cells in a dose-dependent manner via inhibiting NF-kappa B and its downstream target COX-2. It further arrested cell cycle at G0/G1 phase by inhibiting cyclin-Dl and induced early apoptosis by up-regulating P53 in OSCC cells. It also limits the invasion capacity of OSCC cells by up to 55-60%.
   Conclusions: OTE shows antitumor activities in OSCC cells by inhibiting NF-kappa B, COX-2 and cyclin D1 and upregulation of p53 expression. It may be developed as a safe and promising alternative chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic agent for oral cancer. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a broad heterogeneous construct resolving into several symptom-clusters by factor analysis. The aim was to find the factor structures of MDD as per Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and whether they predict escitalopram response.
   Methods: In a longitudinal study at a tertiary institute in north India, 116 adult out-patients with non-psychotic unipolar MDD were assessed with MADRS before and after treatment with escitalopram (10-20 mg) over 6-8 weeks for drug response.
   Results: For total 116 patients pre-treatment four factor structures of MADRS extracted by principal component analysis with varimax rotation altogether explained a variance of 57%: first factor 'detachment'(concentration difficulty, lassitude, inability to feel); second factor 'psychic anxiety'(suicidal thoughts and inner tension); third 'mood-pessimism'(apparent sadness, reported sadness, pessimistic thoughts) and fourth 'vegetative'(decreased sleep, appetite). Eighty patients (68.9%) who completed the study had mean age 35.37 +/- 10.9 yrs, majority were male (57.5%), with mean pre-treatment MADRS score 28.77 +/- 5.18 and majority (65%) having moderate severity (MADRS<30). Among them 56 (70%) responded to escitalopram. At the end of the treatment there were significant changes in all the 4 factor structures (p < 0.01). Vegetative function was an important predictor of response (p < 0.01, odd's ratio: 1.3 [1.1-1.6] 95% CI). Melancholia significantly predicted nonresponse (p=0.04).
   Conclusions: Non-psychotic unipolar major depression having moderate severity in north Indian patients as per MADRS resolved into four factor-structures all significantly improved with adequate escitalopram treatment. Understanding the factor structure is important as they can be important predictor of escitalopram response.

AB  - Background: The ethnic population of Arunachal Pradesh uses a number of orchids as such, or in decoction for various ailments. Three untapped orchids namely, Rhynchostylis retusa, Tropidia curculioides and Satyrium nepalense, traditionally used in tuberculosis, asthma and cold stage of malaria in folk medicine, were selected for the present study.
   Methods: Dried material of each plant was divided into three parts. Solvent extraction and fractionation afforded altogether 30 extracts and fractions, which were evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv and MDR strain) for antimycobacterial activity; promastigotes and amastigotes of Leishmania donovani for leishmanicidal activity and two gram positive and three gram negative clinical isolates for antibacterial activity.
   Results: The most significant antimycobacterial activity was observed with n-hexane fraction of the flower of Satyrium nepalense with MIC of 15.7 mu g/mL. The most promising leishmanicidal activity was observed with diethyl ether fraction of the roots of Rhynchostylis retusa with IC50 values of 56.04 and 18.4 mu g/mL against promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes respectively. Evaluation of antibacterial activity identified S. nepalense flower n-hexane and R. retusa roots diethyl ether as potential fractions with MIC values of <= 100 mu g/mL against selected clinical isolates.
   Conclusions: This is the first report of the plants possessing antimycobacterial and leishmanicidal activity. The investigation resulted in identification of S. nepalense as the most promising plant, which possessed all three activities in significant proportion. This laboratory outcome could be translated to marketable pharmaceutical products and also to produce maximum benefits to the local of nearby area.

AB  - DNA damage, largely owing to oxidative stress, is a leading cause of defective sperm function. High levels of oxidative stress result in damage to sperm DNA, RNA transcripts, and telomeres and, therefore might provide a common underlying aetiology of male infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss, in addition to congenital malformations, complex neuropsychiatric disorders, and childhood cancers in children fathered by men with defective sperm cells. Spermatozoa are highly vulnerable to oxidative stress owing to limited levels of antioxidant defence and a single, limited DNA-damage detection and repair mechanism. Oxidative stress is predominantly caused by a host of lifestyle-related factors, the majority of which are modifiable. Antioxidant regimens and lifestyle modifications could both be plausible therapeutic approaches that enable the burden of oxidative-stress-induced male factor infertility to be overcome. Lifestyle interventions including yoga and meditation can substantially improve the integrity of sperm DNA by reducing levels of oxidative DNA damage, regulating oxidative stress and by increasing the expression of genes responsible for DNA repair, cell-cycle control and anti-inflammatory effects. Oxidative stress is caused by various modifiable factors, and the use of simple interventions can decrease levels of oxidative stress, and therefore reduce the incidence of both infertility and complex diseases in the resultant offspring.

AB  - Background: As the magnitude of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) in India is low, magnitude of CRC in ulcerative colitis (UC) is also considered low. As a result, screening for CRC in UC although advocated may not be followed everywhere. We report our data of UC-related CRC from a low-incidence area of sporadic CRC.
   Methods: A total of 1012 patients with left-sided colitis/pancolitis having more than one full-length colonoscopy performed at least a year after the onset of symptoms were included in retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained case records. In addition, 136 patients with duration of disease >10 years underwent surveillance white-light colonoscopy prospectively during the study period.
   Results: A total of 1012 individuals were finally included (6542 person-years of follow-up, 68.5% males, disease duration: 6.46.8 years). Twenty (1.97%) patients developed CRC. Two (10%) patients developed CRC during the first decade, 10/20 (50%) during the second and 8/20 (40%) after the second decade of disease. The cumulative risk of developing CRC was 1.5%, 7.2% and 23.6% in the first, second and third decade, respectively. Of 136 high-risk UC cases, five (3.6%) had CRC on screening colonoscopy. Disease duration and increasing age of onset were associated with higher risk of CRC.
   Conclusions: Cumulative risk of CRC in Indian UC patients is as high as 23.6% at 30 years. The risk of CRC increases with increasing age of onset and increasing duration of disease. A low risk of sporadic CRC does not confer a low risk of UC-related CRC, and regular screening is warranted.

AB  - Objectives: The authors examined the changes in the developing gut microbiota of Indian infants enrolled in a colonization study of an oral synbiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum and fructo-oligosaccharides) preparation.
   Methods: Frozen stool samples were available from a previously published clinical study of the synbiotic preparation administered daily for 7 days to full-term Indian infants delivered by C-section. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal bacterial community-DNA was done in 11 infants sampled on day 7 and day 60 of life.
   Results: All infants showed changes in bacterial diversity with age. While Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were predominant in all, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were initially low on day 7. In control infants, we observed a significant increase (P = 0.012) in the proportions of Actinobacteria on day 60. In the treated group, during the 60-day period, there was a 10-fold increase in Bacteroidetes, a somewhat smaller increase in Firmicutes, and a reduction in Proteobacteria. Compared to controls, treated infants were increasingly colonized by different Gram-positive genera including Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium. Relatively less known taxa and some unassigned sequence reads added to enriched diversity observed in the treated group.
   Conclusions: There was a high level of bacterial diversity among infants examined in the present study. Synbiotic treatment induced an increase in overall taxa and Gram-positive diversity, especially in the first week of life. Changes in the microbiota during early infancy should be used as a rationale for selecting probiotics in diverse clinical settings.

AB  - The modified acid fast staining technique is a commonly used procedure for the detection of coccidian parasites in developing countries. The morphological variations observed in these parasites play a significant role to some extent in both identification and diagnosis of these parasitic infections. A prospective cross sectional study was performed over three years. The fecal smears were stained by modified Kinyoun acid-fast staining technique and were extensively studied for morphological variations in the coccidian parasites. Out of a total of two thousand one hundred fifty one (n=2,151) fecal samples received during the study period, 259 samples (12%) were positive for any one of the coccidian parasites. Morphological variations, especially in the staining character was noted in all the three coccidian parasites. This study was an attempt to characterize different variations in size, shape and staining characteristics of the three coccidian parasites.

AB  - Purpose To study the effect of endometrial scratching in infertile couples undergoing ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles.
   Methods A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. One hundred forty-four women with primary/secondary infertility were recruited. Couples were either unexplained or male factor infertility. Subjects were randomized into intervention (scratching) and control group. All patients received ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (day 2-6) 50 mg/day +75 IU HMG on days 6 and 7. In addition, endometrial scratching was done on day 8 of ovulation induction cycle in intervention group. All couples were planned for three cycles of ovulation induction and IUI over 6 months. After each failed cycle, couple was advised to try for natural conception for one cycle. Those who conceived were excluded from further analysis. Primary outcome was clinical pregnancy rate. Secondary outcome measures included conception rate, ongoing pregnancy, abortion and ectopic rate.
   Results Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Clinical pregnancy rate was significantly higher in intervention group (31.9%; 23/72) as compared to control group (16.7%; 12/72) (p value 0.030). On per cycle analysis, first IUI cycle had significantly high pregnancy rate (18.1%; 13/72) as compared to control group (5.6%; 4/72). Three patients in intervention group and one in control group conceived in wash out cycle. Ongoing pregnancy rate was significantly higher in scratching group (30.0%; 21/70) as compared to control group (15.7%; 11/70) (p value0.044).
   Conclusions Endometrial scratching can be used as a low cost-effective tool to improve clinical pregnancy and ongoing pregnancy rate in IUI cycles. Further large number studies are required to document its role in improving live birth rate.

AB  - Anomalies affecting the capillary and venous channels form the bulk of the spectrum of vascular anomalies. As per International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) classification, these are referred to as hemangiomas and venous malformations respectively. The present article is a descriptive note of their management and outcomes. Retrospective records of patients over 17 y (January 2000 through December 2016) were reviewed for presentation, management and outcomes. Outcomes were graded into 3 subgroups based on subjective assessment of clinical images: Group A = near-total response (>90%); Group B = 50-90% and Group C = <50% reduction. Among 90 cases of hemangioma, majority were located in head and neck (86.7%). Outcomes recorded in children who received steroids (n = 36) were: Group A = 61.1%, B = 25% and C = 13.9%; steroids and beta-blockers (n = 8): Group A = 62.5%, B = 25% and C = 12.5%; only beta-blockers (n = 4): Group A = 75% and B = 25%; intralesional sclerotherapy (n = 32): Group A = 55.2% and B = 44.8%; steroids followed by sclerotherapy (n = 7): Group A = 28.6% and B = 71.4%; excision (n = 3): Group A = 100%. Among 171 cases of venous malformation, majority were located in head and neck (49.6%). Outcomes recorded in children who received sclerotherapy (n = 165) were Group A = 20.7%, B = 51% and C = 28.3%; steroids (n = 3): Group A = 100%; beta-blockers (n = 1): Group C = 100%; excision (n = 2): Group A = 100%. Better outcome was noted in smaller-sized lesions and those who required lesser volume of sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS) injection. Thus, to conclude, the decision regarding the choice and timing of each therapeutic modality should be individualized based on location, size and type of the lesion. The goal of management in these lesions should be to improve the quality of life rather than elimination of the lesion.

AB  - Background: Attenuated cardioprotective effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) by reduced nitric oxide (NO) is a hallmark during diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, we reported that the formation of caveolin-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) complex decreases the release of NO, which is responsible for attenuation of IPC-induced cardioprotection in DM rat heart. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) facilitates release of NO by disrupting caveolin-eNOS complex. The activity of HO-1 is decreased during DM. This study was designed to investigate the role of hemin (HO-1 inducer) in attenuated cardioprotective effect of IPC in isolated diabetic rat heart.
   Methods: DM was induced in male Wistar rat by single dose of streptozotocin. Cardioprotective effect was assessed in terms of myocardial infarct size and release of lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase in coronary effluent. The release of NO was estimated indirectly by measuring the release of nitrite in coronary effluent. Perfusion of sodium nitrite, a precursor of NO, was used as a positive control.
   Result: IPC-induced cardioprotection and increased release of nitrite were significantly attenuated in a diabetic rat as compared to a normal rat. Pretreatment with hemin and daidzein, a caveolin inhibitor, alone or in combination significantly restored the attenuated cardioprotection and increased the release of nitrite in diabetic rat heart. Zinc protoporphyrin, a HO-1 inhibitor, significantly abolished the observed cardioprotection and decreased the release of nitrite in hemin pretreated DM rat heart.
   Conclusion: Thus, it is suggested that hemin restores the attenuated cardioprotective effect in diabetic rat heart by increasing the activity of HO-1 and subsequently release of NO.

AB  - We present a rare case of primary pituitary T cell lymphoma/leukemia (T-LBL) in association with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) expressing pituitary adenoma in a 55-year-old woman highlighting the importance of intra-operative squash smears examination. The patient presented with complaints of headache, diminution of vision and recent onset altered sensorium. MRI revealed a mass lesion in the sellar-suprasellar region with non-visualization of pituitary gland separately, extending to involve adjacent structures diagnosed as invasive pituitary macroadenoma. Intraoperative tissue was sent for squash smear examination. The cytology showed a tumor comprising of sheets of immature lymphoid cells intermixed with clusters of pituitary acinar cells with many mitoses and tingible body macrophages. A diagnosis of presence of immature lymphoid cells within the pituitary was offered and differentials of infiltration by lymphoma cells from systemic disease versus primary central nervous lymphoma-like lymphoma arising in the pituitary adenoma were considered. Later paraffin section examination and immunohistochemistry corroborated with the squash findings and a final diagnosis of primary pituitary T cell lymphoma/leukemia in association with ACTH and TSH expressing pituitary adenoma was made. To date, only six cases of primary pituitary T cell lymphomas, including three T-LBL cases, have been reported. This is the seventh case and first one additionally describing cytohistological correlation and importance of intra-operative cytology.

AB  - Juvenile onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG) affects patients before 40years of age, who present with high intraocular pressure and deep steep cupping of the optic nerve head. While it was considered to be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, recent studies have shown an autosomal recessive pattern as well as sporadic occurrence of the disease in several families. In this review, we analyze the genetic basis of the disease along with common mutations and their association with JOAG. We also analyzed the inheritance patterns in a large group of unrelated JOAG patients (n=336) from Northern India wherein the prevalence of familial occurrence was assessed and segregation analysis performed, to determine the mode of inheritance.

AB  - Introduction Rising burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes is a major challenge to the health system in India. Innovative approaches such as mobile phone technology (mHealth) for electronic decision support in delivering evidence-based and integrated care for hypertension, diabetes and comorbid depression have potential to transform the primary healthcare system.
   Methods and analysis mWellcare trial is a multicentre, cluster randomised controlled trial evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of a mHealth system and nurse managed care for people with hypertension and diabetes in rural India. mWellcare system is an Android-based mobile application designed to generate algorithm-based clinical management prompts for treating hypertension and diabetes and also capable of storing health records, sending alerts and reminders for follow-up and adherence to medication. We recruited a total of 3702 participants from 40 Community Health Centres (CHCs), with >= 90 at each of the CHCs in the intervention and control (enhanced care) arms. The primary outcome is the difference in mean change (from baseline to 1 year) in systolic blood pressure and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) between the two treatment arms. The secondary outcomes are difference in mean change from baseline to 1 year in fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, predicted 10-year risk of CVD, depression, smoking behaviour, body mass index and alcohol use between the two treatment arms and cost-effectiveness.
   Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the institutional Ethics Committees at Public Health Foundation of India and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and other mechanisms.

AB  - Moderate to intense light is reported to damage the chick retina, which is cone dominated. Light damage alters neurotransmitter pools, such as those of glutamate. Glutamate level in the retina is regulated by glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamine synthetase (GS). We examined immunolocalization patterns and the expression levels of both markers and of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker of neuronal stress) in chick retina exposed to 2000 lux under 12-h light:12-h dark (12L:12D; normal photoperiod), 18L:6D (prolonged photoperiod), and 24L:0D (constant light) at post-hatch day 30. Retinal damage (increased death of photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons and Muller cell hypertrophy) and GFAP expression in Muller cells were maximal in 24L:0D condition compared to that seen in 12L:12D and 18L:6D conditions. GS was present in Muller cells and GLAST expressed in Muller cell processes and photoreceptor inner segments. GLAST expression was decreased in 24L:0D condition, and the expression levels between 12L:12D and 18L:6D, though increased marginally, were statistically insignificant. Similar was the case with GS expression that significantly decreased in 24L:0D condition. Our previous study with chicks exposed to 2000 lux reported increased retinal glutamate level in 24L:0D condition. The present results indicate that constant light induces decreased expressions of GLAST and GS, a condition that might aggravate glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity and delay neuroprotection in a cone-dominated retina.

AB  - Severe bone loss in patients with complete edentulism poses a treatment challenge. In fabricating a denture, the stability of the prosthesis must be enhanced by recording the cameo surface within the confines of the physiological position of the cheek and tongue muscles (the neutral zone) and by shaping it accordingly. The treatment of a patient with a completely edentulous maxillary arch and severe maxillary anterior bone loss is described. The cameo surface was recorded within the physiological limits during the fabrication of a complete denture by using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

AB  - Nerve growth factors (NGFs), especially the prototype NGF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), have a diverse array of functions in the central nervous system through their peculiar set of receptors and intricate signaling. They are implicated not only in the development of the nervous system but also in regulation of neurocognitive functions like learning, memory, synaptic transmission, and plasticity. Evidence even suggests their role in continued neurogenesis and experience-dependent neural network remodeling in adult brain. They have also been associated extensively with brain disorders characterized by neurocognitive dysfunction. In the present article, we aimed to make an exhaustive review of literature to get a comprehensive view on the role of NGFs in neurocognitive functions in health and disease. Starting with historical perspective, distribution in adult brain, implied molecular mechanisms, and developmental basis, this article further provides a detailed account of NGFs' role in specified neurocognitive functions. Furthermore, it discusses plausible NGF-based homeostatic and adaptation mechanisms operating in the pathogenesis of neurocognitive disorders and has presents a survey of such disorders. Finally, it elaborates on current evidence and future possibilities in therapeutic applications of NGFs with an emphasis on recent research updates in drug delivery mechanisms. Conclusive remarks of the article make a strong case for plausible role of NGFs in comprehensive regulation of the neurocognitive functions and pathogenesis of related disorders and advocate that future research should be directed to explore use of NGF-based mechanisms in the prevention of implicated diseases as well as to target these molecules pharmacologically.

AB  - Aim: There is paucity of research in the putative role of hormonal biomarkers in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The current study aimed to analyze the clinical profile, sociodemographic status, co-morbidity, hormonal biomarkers namely Thyroid hormones and Cortisol in children with ADHD and compare them with healthy controls and to explore the association of the hormonal biomarkers with severity of ADHD.
   Methods: Thirty children with DSM-IV TR diagnosis of ADHD were assessed using semi structured proforma, Conners' Parent Rating Scale revised short (CPRS - R:S), Mini international neuropsychiatric interview for children and adolescents and Childrens' Global Assessment Scale as well as serum levels of total Triiodothyronine (T3), total Thyroxine (T4), Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and Cortisol using chemiluminescent immunometric assay and compared with 30 age-and gender - matched controls.
   Results: The typical profile of cases of ADHD was of a male with mean age of 9.47 years (S.D = 2.43) belonging to Hyperactive subtype of ADHD. Serum T4 was significantly lower in cases compared to controls. No significant difference was found in serum T3, TSH and Cortisol levels. No significant correlation between the CPRS : R-S scores and the hormonal biomarkers.
   Conclusions: There is need for exploration of Serum T4 as putative biomarker for ADHD with replication in future studies. It may also be important to report the negative finding of Cortisol as a biomarker of ADHD in the context of effective utilization of resources for research with special relevance to resource deficit developing countries.

AB  - Several decades ago, penetrating keratoplasty was a challenge to corneal surgeons. Constant effort by the corneal surgeon to improve the outcomes as well as utilization of the available resources has led to a revolutionary change in the field of keratoplasty. All these efforts have led to the evolution of techniques that allow a corneal surgeon to disease-specific transplant of individual layers of corneal "so-called component corneal surgery" depending on the layer of cornea affected. This has led to an improvement in corneal graft survival as well as a better utilization of corneal tissues. This article reviews the currently available literature on component corneal surgeries and provides an update on the available techniques.

AB  - Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a microvascular complication of diabetes, has emerged as an important health problem worldwide. There is strong evidence to suggest that oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis play a pivotal role in the progression of DN. Apigenin has been shown to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, antifibrotic, as well as antidiabetic properties. Hence, we evaluated whether apigenin halts the development and progression of DN in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Male albino Wistar rats were divided into control, diabetic control, and apigenin treatment groups (5-20 mg/kg po, respectively), apigenin per se (20 mg/kg po), and ramipril treatment group (2 mg/kg po). A single injection of STZ (55 mg/kg ip) was administered to all of the groups except control and per se groups to induce type 1 diabetes mellitus. Rats with fasting blood glucose > 250 mg/dl were included in the study and randomized to different groups. Thereafter, the protocol was continued for 8 mo in all of the groups. Apigenin (20 mg/kg) treatment attenuated renal dysfunction, oxidative stress, and fibrosis (decreased transforming growth factor-beta 1, fibronectin, and type IV collagen) in the diabetic rats. It also significantly prevented MAPK activation, which inhibited inflammation (reduced TNF-alpha, IL-6, and NF-kappa B expression) and apoptosis (increased expression of Bcl-2 and decreased Bax and caspase-3). Furthermore, histopathological examination demonstrated reduced inflammation, collagen deposition, and glomerulosclerosis in the renal tissue. In addition, all of these changes were comparable with those produced by ramipril. Hence, apigenin ameliorated renal damage due to DN by suppressing oxidative stress and fibrosis and by inhibiting MAPK pathway.

AB  - Background Astroblastoma (AB) is a rare tumor with significant dilemma regarding diagnostic criteria, behavior, and optimum treatment.
   Materials and methods We searched PubMed, Google Search, and Cochrane Library for eligible studies with the following search words: astroblastoma, high-grade astroblastoma, and anaplastic astroblastoma till July 1, 2016, published in English language and collected data regarding age, sex, site of disease, pathological grade, treatment received, and survival.
   Results Data of 152 patients were retrieved from 63 publications. Median age was 16 years (range 0-71). Females were affected twice more frequently than male (70.3 vs. 29.7%). Tumors were most commonly located in the frontal (39%) followed by parietal lobe (26.7%). Fifty-two and 25% of the patients had headache and seizure at presentation, 76.3% of the patients underwent a gross total resection, 41 out of 89 had a high-grade tumor, and 56 patients received adjuvant radiation with a median dose of 54 Gy (range 20-72). Adjuvant chemotherapy was used in 23 patients. Temozolomide was the most common drug used in 30% of the patients. A combination of cisplatin, etoposide with vincristine, or ifosfamide was used in 17%. Median follow-up duration was 37 months (range 1-238). Median progression-free survival and OS were 36 and 184 months, respectively. Patients with a higher-grade tumor had significantly worse OS with HR 5.260 and p = 0.001. Forty patients experienced local progression. Sixty-five percent patients underwent surgery while 50% underwent radiation as salvage.
   Conclusion AB has two distinct grades with higher-grade tumors having significantly poor survival. Maximal safe surgery followed by adjuvant radiation and temozolomide should be advocated for these tumors.

Infantile tremor syndrome (ITS) is an obscure condition associated with vitamin B12 and other micronutrient deficiencies, described predominantly in Indian subcontinent. We describe an infant presenting with ITS and chronic subdural hemorrhage. He was subsequently diagnosed to have CF. The ITS and subdural hemorrhage is rarely reported in children with CF. In the background of increasing recognition of CF in Indian children, this case demonstrates a new association of this disease.

AB  - Study objective: To compare the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) during perioperative administration of 5% dextrose and normal saline in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blind trial.
   Setting: Operating rooms in a tertiary care hospital of Northern India.
   Patients: One hundred patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists status I to II undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were enrolled in this study.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized into two groups [normal saline (NS) group and 5% dextrose (D) group]. Both the groups received Ringer acetate (Sterofundin ISO) intravenously as a maintenance fluid during intraoperative period. Besides this, patients of group NS received 250 ml of 0.9% normal saline and patients of group D received 5% dextrose @ 100 ml/h started at the time when gall bladder was taken out. It was continued in the postoperative period with the same rate till it gets finished.
   Measurements: Incidence of PONV, Apfel score, intraoperative opioids used and consumption of rescue anti emetics.
   Main results: Demographic data was statistically similar. Out of total 100 patients, 47 patients (47%) had PONV. In group D, 14 patients (28%) had PONV while in group NS, 33 patients (66%) had PONV within 24 h of surgery (p value 0.001). The incidence of PONV was reduced by 38% in group D which is significantly lower when compared with that of group NS (p value 0.001). The consumption of single dose of rescue antiemetics in group D was also reduced by 26% when compared to that of group NS (p value 0.002).
   Conclusions: Perioperative administration of 5% dextrose in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery can reduce PONV significantly and even if PONV occurs, the quantity of rescue antiemetics to combat PONV is also reduced significantly. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Accelerating reduction in infant and other child mortality rates calls for comprehensive child survival strategies. Early recognition of illness and timely seeking of treatment are critical elements to prevent child deaths, and cultural explanation for these care-seeking behaviours is important. The present article reports (i) mothers' recognition of illness and (ii) triggers of treatment related to some childhood illnesses among a migrant tribal community living in Bhubaneswar city, India.
   Methods: From the four tribal dominated slums, 175 Santal tribal households were selected based on the criteria, viz. (i) the family should have migrated within the past 12 years and (ii) having a child aged 0-14 years. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with mothers for data related to illnesses occurred to their youngest child during past 1 year.
   Results: The recognition of illness was made based on multiple symptoms. Triggers of treatment and care-seeking behaviour vary from illness to illness. Usually people wait for 2-3 days after onset of any illness, expecting the symptoms to subside automatically. Late onset symptoms and severity trigger mother to take child for treatment.
   Conclusion: Mothers were able to recognize the childhood illnesses. There was substantial delay in seeking care. Hence, provision of primary health care and health education-based interventions are needed to improve the mothers' recognition and care-seeking behaviour.

AB  - Condyloma acuminatum (CA) of urinary bladder is a rare entity, usually occurring in association with anogenital lesions in females.
   CA is caused by low-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) subtypes, most commonly HPV 11, and despite its propensity for frequent recurrences, it is considered a benign lesion, and conservative management is recommended.
   Isolated urinary bladder CAs occurring in the absence of preceding anogenital lesions are usually seen in immunosuppressed individuals.
   Renal transplant recipients (RTRs) are prone to developing anogenital and cutaneous CAs with an increased risk for malignant transformation.
   CA of the urinary bladder is extremely rare in RTRs, having been reported in only 5 patients to date, with at least 1 of them developing malignancy in the follow-up duration.
   The urinary bladder CA in our patient showed strong p16 accumulation, proliferative activity in superficial layers of the epithelium, and a moderate degree of dysplasia, and recurred multiple times following conservative management.
   The chronic immunosuppressive state in RTRs promotes HPV-induced oncogenesis, and a close followup of such lesions is warranted in recurrent/unresectable cases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Repeat expansions in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) gene have been recognized as a major contributor to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia in the Caucasian population. Intermediate length repeat expansions of CAG (polyQ) repeat in the ATXN2 gene have also been reported to increase the risk of developing ALS in North America and Europe. We screened 131 ALS patients and 127 healthy controls from India for C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansions. We found pathogenic hexanucleotide expansions in 3 of the 127 sporadic ALS patients, in 1 of the 4 familial ALS patients, and in none of the healthy controls. In addition, our findings suggest that the 10 base-pair deletion that masks detection of C9orf72 repeat expansion does not explain the low frequency of this repeat expansion among Indian ALS patients. Intermediate length polyQ expansions (27Qs-32Qs) in the ATXN2 gene were detected in 6 of the 127 sporadic ALS patients and 2 of the 127 of the healthy controls. Long ATXN2 polyQ repeats (> 33Qs) were not present in any of the ALS patients or controls. Our findings highlight the need for large-scale multicenter studies on Indian ALS patients to better understand the underlying genetic causes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of common physical comorbidities, their demographic and clinical correlates and impact on functioning was assessed in 100 patients with schizophrenia. The patients had a mean age of 35.12 +/- 10.7 yr with mean duration of illness of 8.3 +/- 0.58 years. Seventy per cent were detected to have a comorbid physical condition. Common conditions included hypertension (21%), diabetes mellitus (15%) and anaemia (12%). Increasing age, being female, being married, longer duration of illness and longer duration of treatment were associated with higher risk of having a comorbid physical illness. Further studies need to be done with a large sample to confirm these findings.

AB  - The literature on interaction between pregnancy and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is inconsistent, and there are no reports on this aspect from Asia. This study evaluated the impact both IBD and pregnancy have on each other in a large cohort of Indian patients.
   In total, 514 females with ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD) aged between 18 and 45 years attending IBD clinic, at our institute, from July 2004 to July 2013 were screened, and patients with data on pregnancy status were included (n = 406). Pregnancies were categorized as either before, after or coinciding with disease onset. Long-term disease course was ascertained from prospectively maintained records. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were recorded from antenatal records or individual interviews.
   Of 406 patients (UC: 336, CD: 70), 310 became pregnant (UC: 256, CD: 54), with a total of 597 pregnancies (UC: 524, CD: 73). More UC patients with pregnancies were in long-term remission than non-pregnant patients (56.7 vs. 43.4 %, p = 0.04). Long-term remission was less frequent in UC patients in whom pregnancy coincided with disease onset than patients with pregnancies before and after/pregnancy after the disease onset (41.4 vs. 62.5 %, p = 0.023). Pregnancies after the disease onset were associated with more cesarean sections and adverse fetal outcomes than pregnancies before disease onset in both UC and CD patients.
   Long-term disease course in UC patients was better in pregnant as compared to non-pregnant patients. Among pregnant UC patients, disease course was worst when pregnancy coincided with disease onset. Pregnancy and fetal outcomes were worse in pregnancy after disease onset than pregnancy before disease onset.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the timing and microbiology of neonatal sepsis in a population-based surveillance in the Indian community setting.
   STUDY DESIGN: All live born infants in 223 villages of Odisha state were followed at home for 60 days. Suspect sepsis cases were referred to study hospitals for further evaluation including blood culture.
   RESULTS: Of 12 622 births, 842 were admitted with suspected sepsis of whom 95% were 4 to 60 days old. Culture-confirmed incidence of sepsis was 6.7/1000 births with 51% Gram negatives (Klebsiella predominating) and 26% Gram positives (mostly Staphylococcus aureus). A very high level of resistance to penicillin and ampicillin, moderate resistance to cephalosporins and extremely low resistance to Gentamicin and Arnikacin was observed.
   CONCLUSION: The bacterial burden of sepsis in the Indian community is not high. Judicious choice of empiric antibiotics, antibiotic stewardship and alternate modalities should be considered for the management or prevention of neonatal sepsis in India.

AB  - Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, responsible for a number of deaths in humans. Butyrate, one of the short chain fatty acids produced by the gut microbiota during anaerobic fermentation, was shown to be beneficial for inhibiting cancer growth. In this study, we showed that sodium butyrate induced autophagy via reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hepatoma cells. Butyrate (0-6 mM) incubation significantly increased intracellular ROS levels (45.2% compared to control), which in turn inhibited phosphorylation of akt and mTOR, leading to the upregulation of autophagic proteins, such as beclin 1, ATG 5, LC3-II, followed by the increased autophagosome formation (34.4% compared to control cells). Addition of a known antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), reversed these butyrate-induced ROS and autophagy. It was also found that butyrate-induced ROS enhanced MAPK activation, which was inhibited by NAC. In conclusion, our data showed that butyrate induced ROS, which in turn induced autophagy via inhibition of akt/mTOR pathway. Hence, butyrate could be considered as a potential candidate for HCC treatment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Butyrate is one of the short chain fatty acids, produced by the gut microbiota during anaerobic fermentation of dietary fibres. It has been shown that it can inhibit tumor progression via suppressing histone deacetylase and can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, the comprehensive pathway by which butyrate mediates apoptosis and growth arrest in cancer cells still remains unclear. In this study, the role of miR-22 in butyrate-mediated ROS release and induction of apoptosis was determined in hepatic cells. Intracellular expression of miR-22 was increased when the Huh 7 cells were incubated with sodium butyrate. Over-expression of miR-22 or addition of sodium butyrate inhibited SIRT-1 expression and enhanced the ROS production. Incubation of cells with anti-miR-22 reversed the effects of butyrate. Butyrate induced apoptosis via ROS production, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3, whereas addition of N-acetyl cysteine or anti-miR-22 reversed these butyrate-induced effects. Furthermore, sodium butyrate inhibited cell growth and proliferation, whereas anti-miR-22 inhibited these butyrate-mediated changes. The expression of PTEN and gsk-3 was found to be increased while p-akt and beta-catenin expression was decreased significantly by butyrate. These data showed that butyrate modulated both apoptosis and proliferation via miR-22 expression in hepatic cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of definitions have been used for delayed gastric emptying (DGE) after pancreatoduodenectomy and the reported rates varied widely. The International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definition is the current standard but it is not used universally. In this comprehensive review, we aimed to determine the acceptance rate of ISGPS definition of DGE, the incidence of DGE after pancreatoduodenectomy and the effect of various technical modifications on its incidence.
   DATA SOURCE: We searched PubMed for studies regarding DGE after pancreatoduodenectomy that were published from 1 January 1980 to 1 July 2015 and extracted data on DGE definition, DGE rates and comparison of DGE rates among different technical modifications from all of the relevant articles.
   RESULTS: Out of 435 search results, 178 were selected for data extraction. The ISGPS definition was used in 80% of the studies published since 2010 and the average rates of DGE and clinically relevant DGE were 27.7% (range: 0-100%; median: 18.7%) and 14.3% (range: 1.8%-58.2%; median: 13.6%), respectively. Pylorus preservation or retrocolic reconstruction were not associated with increased DGE rates. Although pyloric dilatation, Braun's entero-enterostomy and Billroth II reconstruction were associated with significantly lower DGE rates, pyloric ring resection appears to be most promising with favorable results in 7 out of 10 studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: ISGPS definition of DGE has been used in majority of studies published after 2010. Clinically relevant DGE rates remain high at 14.3% despite a number of proposed surgical modifications. Pyloric ring resection seems to offer the most promising solution to reduce the occurrence of DGE.

AB  - Objective To identify the medical causes of death and contribution of non-biological factors towards infant mortality by a retrospective analysis of routinely collected data using verbal and social autopsy tools.
   Setting The study site was Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), Ballabgarh, North India Participants All infant deaths during the years 20082012 were included for verbal autopsy and infant deaths from July 2012 to December 2012 were included for social autopsy.
   Outcome measures Cause of death ascertained by a validated verbal autopsy tool and level of delay based on a three-delay model using the INDEPTH social autopsy tool were the main outcome measures. The level of delay was defined as follows: level 1, delay in identification of danger signs and decision making to seek care; level 2, delay in reaching a health facility from home; level 3, delay in getting healthcare at the health facility.
   Results The infant mortality rate during the study period was 46.5/1000 live births. Neonatal deaths contributed to 54.3% of infant deaths and 39% occurred on the first day of life. Birth asphyxia (31.5%) followed by low birth weight (LBW)/prematurity (26.5%) were the most common causes of neonatal death, while infection (57.8%) was the most common cause of post-neonatal death. Care-seeking was delayed among 50% of neonatal deaths and 41.2% of post-neonatal deaths. Delay at level 1 was most common and occurred in 32.4% of neonatal deaths and 29.4% of post-neonatal deaths. Deaths due to LBW/prematurity were mostly followed by delay at level 1.
   Conclusion A high proportion of preventable infant mortality still exists in an area which is under continuous health and demographic surveillance. There is a need to enhance home-based preventive care to enable the mother to identify and respond to danger signs. Verbal autopsy and social autopsy could be routinely done to guide policy interventions aimed at reduction of infant mortality.

AB  - Objective: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to association of diseases with high rates of mortality and morbidity. Diagnosis continues to be a clinical challenge as microbiological confirmation is rare and time consuming resulting in delayed treatment. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is a rapid and simple test, which has been endorsed by World Health Organization as an initial diagnostic test for the diagnosis of TBM. However, evidence still lacks for its performance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the diagnosis of TBM especially from India.
   Methods: A total of 267 CSF samples from patients with high clinico-radiological suspicion of TBM were included in this study. Ziehle-Neelsen (ZN) staining, BACTEC Mycobacterial Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT-960) culture system, and Xpert MTB/RIF assay (using cartridge version G4) were tested on all samples.
   Results: Of total 267 samples, all were negative for smear AFB and 52 (19.5%) were culture positive by MGIT-960 culture system. However, out of 52 (19.5%) cultures detected positive by MGIT-960, 5 (9.6%) were detected as resistant to rifampicin. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was positive in 38 (14.2%) samples and negative in 223 (83.5%) samples. Cartridge error was detected in 6 (2.2%) samples, which could not be repeated due to insufficient sample volume. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay in comparison to MGIT-960 was 55.1% (95%, CI: 40.2-69.3) and 94.8% (95%, CI: 90.9-97.4) respectively. Overall, Xpert MTB/RIF assay detected 38 (14.2%) as positive for MTB of which 4 (10.5%), 31 (81.6%) and 3 (7.9%) were found to be rifampicin resistant, sensitive and indeterminate respectively.
   Conclusion: Xpert MTB/RIF assay showed lower sensitivity as compared to MGIT 960 culture for the diagnosis of TBM from CSF samples. (C) 2017 The British Infection Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - PURPOSE To report long-term outcome of inferior oblique anterior and nasal transposition in superior oblique palsy.
   METHODS The medical records of patients with superior oblique palsy who underwent inferior oblique anterior nasal transposition were reviewed retrospectively. A comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation, including prism bar cover test and measurement of torsion, was performed for all cases. One-year postoperative results were evaluated for alignment in primary gaze, contralateral gaze, and upgaze; reduction in inferior oblique overaction and changes in fundus torsion to assess long-term outcome of the procedure.
   RESULTS A total of 12 patients were included. Three cases also underwent horizontal muscle surgery. Mean age at the time of surgery was 20.6 years. The median preoperative hypertropia was 21.5(Delta) (range, 12(Delta) -36(Delta)), corrected to 4.5(Delta) (range, 2(Delta) -10(Delta)) at 12 months postoperatively (P = 0.002). Median inferior oblique overaction decreased from +3 (range, +1 to +4) to 0 (range, 1 to +1). Preoperative fundus extorsion was 19.2 degrees +/- 6.7 degrees; postoperative, 0.58 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees (P < 0.001). No consecutive hypotropia or underaction in elevation was observed in 10patients; 1 patient complained of torsional diplopia in upgaze. Extorsion was eliminated and head tilt improved in all patients.
   CONCLUSIONS Inferior oblique anterior and nasal transposition resulted in good long-term outcomes in our patients with superior oblique palsy presenting with hypertropia, inferior oblique overaction, and extorsion in primary gaze.

AB  - Background & objectives: With improved survival of childhood cancer patients, the number of longterm cancer survivors is increasing. Some studies have assessed the long-term morbidity after childhood cancer treatment in the developing countries. This study was conducted to assess the spectrum of late effects of cancer treatment in paediatric cancer survivors.
   Methods: Evaluation of the first 300 patients who completed five years of follow up in the after treatment completion clinic was done. Details of primary diagnosis, treatment received and current clinical status were noted. The spectrum of late effects was ascertained by appropriate investigations.
   Results: Haematological malignancies comprised 25 per cent of total cases. Most common primary diagnosis comprised acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, retinoblastoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The median age at evaluation and follow up was 14 and 8.5 yr, respectively. Twenty three per cent (69) of the survivors had a minimal disability (growth retardation or underweight), 13 per cent (39) had moderate disabilities needing medical attention (hepatitis B surface antigen positive, myocardial dysfunction, azoospermia and hypothyroidism), while two per cent had major/life-threatening disabilities (mental retardation, liver disease and mortality). Eleven patients relapsed on follow up, of those five patients expired. Two second malignancies were recorded during the period of follow up.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Late effects were of concern; however, severe disability (Grade 3-5) was seen in only two per cent survivors. Lifelong follow up of childhood cancer survivors is required to assess cancer-related morbidity, occurrence of a secondary neoplasm, to facilitate timely diagnosis and to implement remedial or preventive interventions to optimize health outcomes. Awareness towards the existence of late effects of cancer therapy is required among parents, patients and health professionals.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare 1-year outcomes of illuminated microcatheter-assisted circumferential trabeculotomy (IMCT) vs conventional partial trabeculotomy (CPT) for primary congenital glaucoma (PCG).
   DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.
   METHODS: Forty eyes of 31 patients with unilateral or bilateral primary congenital glaucoma aged less than 2 years were randomized to undergo IMCT (20 eyes) or CPT (20 eyes). Primary outcome measure was intraocular pressure (TOP) reduction. The success criterion was defined as IOP <= 12 mm Hg without and with anti glaucoma medications (absolute success and qualified success, respectively).
   RESULTS: The mean age of our study population was 8.35 +/- 1.2 months. The mean preoperative IOP was 24.70 +/- 3.90 mm Hg in the IMCT group and 24.60 +/- 3.31 mm Hg in the CPT group. Both groups were comparable with respect to preoperative IOP, corneal clarity, corneal diameter, vertical cup-to-disc ratio, and refractive error. In the IMCT group, 360-degree cannulation was achieved in 80% (16/20) of eyes. For the IMCT group and CPT groups, respectively, the absolute success rates were 80% (16/20) and 60% (12/20) (P <.001) and qualified success rates were 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/ 20) (P <.001). Both procedures produced a statistically significant reduction in IOP, and eyes undergoing IMCT achieved a lower IOP than CPT group eyes at 12 months follow-up (9.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg and 11.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, respectively, P <.001).
   CONCLUSION: In primary congential glaucoma, illuminated microcatheter-assisted 360-degree circumferential trabeculotomy performed better than conventional partial trabeculotomy at 1 year follow-up and resulted in significantly lower IOP measurements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rectal atresia (RA) and rectal stenosis (RS) are rare anomalies with varied treatment options. A thorough literature review was done on reported cases/series of RA and RS. Based on evidence from cases managed over last 15 years, new insights into embryology were hypothesized. A comprehensive review was compiled with updated knowledge on diagnosis and management. RA is classified into five types I: II: III: IV: V as RS: RA with septal defect: RA with a fibrous cord between two atretic ends: RA with a gap: Multiple RA and/or RS. Current definitive surgical repair of these anomalies preserves the anal canal, dentate line, and sphincter complex. Most neonates with RA undergo sigmoid colostomy except few with RS who can rarely decompress adequately. Membranous RS and septal RA may seldom respond to dilatation or be amenable to transanal repair. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty with an end-to-end/side repair is recommended for RA and most intramural RS. RS may be associated with a presacral mass and colonic/rectal motility disorders. The expected postoperative outcome is good if the normally developed anal sphincter complex is retained undamaged. Early recognition of the type of anomaly is necessary for appropriate management.

AB  - Background: Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is most common chronic infectious disease of childhood. Diagnosis of dental caries has been limited to clinical, visual and radiographic methods but its inflammatory component remained unexplored. Hence, this study aims to evaluate salivary levels of inflammatory cytokines in children with ECC to assess their potential as non-invasive biomarkers.
   Methods: 50 subjects were recruited (25 ECC patients and 25 healthy children). Saliva samples were taken from all subjects and collected again from patients after rehabilitative intervention. Levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-alpha were determined using ELISA. Cytokines level were statistically correlated with each other and with DMF score along with ROC curve analysis.
   Results: Salivary levels of IL-6, IL-8 & TNF-alpha were significantly higher in patients which got significantly reduced after rehabilitative intervention. Levels of these cytokines were significantly associated with severity of dental caries. These cytokines were correlating with each other along with DMF score upon Spearman correlation. ROC curve reveals optimum sensitivity and specificity of these cytokines for diagnosis in ECC with absolute levels observed for IL-6.
   Conclusions: Significant elevation of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a with optimum sensitivity and specificity might imply their involvement as potential non-invasive diagnostic/prognostic markers in ECC.

AB  - Objectives Baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), a functional consequence of vascular stiffness, may be affected by the presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study was designed to assess the effect of diabetic status and NAFLD grade on the BRS in patients with NAFLD.
   Methods Seventy-five individuals (25 NAFLD without DM, 25 NAFLD with DM and 25 controls) were recruited for the study who underwent anthropometric and body composition analysis along with estimation of plasma glucose, serum insulin and serum lipids. BRS and blood pressure variability (BPV) analysis was carried out in both time and frequency domains. Carotid-radial and carotid-dorsalis pedis artery pulse wave velocity, and radial artery augmentation index were computed as measures of arterial stiffness.
   Results BRS was found to be lower in the NAFLD with DM group as well those with grade II NAFLD compared with the controls. Correlation analysis showed a negative correlation of BRS with postprandial blood glucose level (r=-0.39) and BMI (r=-0.467). The diabetic status and grade of NAFLD were associated independently with a decrease in BRS as well as the low-frequency component of diastolic BPV. The augmentation index and carotid-distal pulse wave velocity were higher in the NAFLD with DM group compared with controls.
   Conclusion Both the diabetic status and grade of NAFLD were shown to have an independent effect on the decrease in the BRS with a consequent effect on BPV, with a greater influence of diabetic status rather than NAFLD grade on arterial stiffness.

AB  - Introduction: Emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial bacterial isolates, limits the available treatment options for burn wound infections, among them multi-drug resistant Gram negative bacteria and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are major contributors to the increase in morbidity and mortality rates.
   Material and methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was done in the Department of Microbiology, University College of Medical Sciences & Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi. A total of 818 wound samples from patients admitted in the bum wards and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) examined between 2010-2014 (5 years period). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found as the most common isolate (37%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (15%) and Acinetobacter baumanii (12%) among Gram negative organisms while S. aureus (12%) remained the major isolates among Gram positive organisms. A significant decrease in incidence of Gram positive organisms was observed in comparison with previous study. However, resistance to ceftazidime and aminoglycosides were increased significantly in Gram negative organisms. Multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa (MDR PA) accounted for 15.2%, multi-drug resistant A. baumanii (MDR AB) was prevalent in 13.8% and MRSA in 77.4% of bum wound infections.
   Discussion and conclusion: Emerging bacterial drug resistance has both clinical and financial implications for the therapy of infected bum patients. Spectrum of bacterial drug resistance in an institution is important for epidemiological as well as clinical purposes. Rising frequency of MDR strains in burn patients is alarming for clinicians as it downgrades the treatment efficacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Opioid-sparing analgesia for bariatric surgery in morbidly obese can potentially prevent catastrophic airway complications. Our meta-analysis attempts to consolidate the evidence on dexmedetomidine evaluating its analgesic and safety profile.
   Methods: Trails comparing perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion to conventional analgesic regimens for bariatric surgery were searched. Comparisons were made for 24-hour and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) morphine consumed, PACU pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting pain scores, and heartrate. Meta-regression was performed for length of stay to evaluate various analgesic control subgroups.
   Results: Six trials were included in the final analysis. Dexmedetomidine infusion (reported in 5 intraoperative subgroups and 2 postoperative subgroups) decreased 24-hour morphine by 18.13 +/- 6.11 mg (random effects: P<.001, I-2 = 95.48%). Despite the small number of included studies, the sample size for avoiding a false positive result was adequate as the trial sequential analysis found the present sample size (362) to be well past the required "sample size" (n = 312) for 85% power. Meta-regression for infusion dose on morphine consumption difference found a predictability of 49% (coefficient = 39.93, random-effects, Tau(2) = 396.08), and predictability of the model improved to 68% on inclusion of time of initiation of infusion. The dexmedetomidine group had lower PACU morphine consumption (by 6.91 +/- 1.19, I-2 = 34.37%), lower pain scores (scale of 0-10 +/- 2.27, I-2 = 88.14%), lower postoperative nausea and vomiting incidence (odds ratio = +/- 0.26, I-2 = 0%), and lower heart rate (73.25 versus. 83.50) (mean difference = +/- 10.15 I-2 = 94.04%). No adverse events were reported across trials.
   Conclusion: Perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion in obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery is a promising and safe alternative. Both intraoperative or postoperative infusions lead to significant opioid sparing in early and extend postoperative recovery phase. Morbidly obese patients receiving perioperative dexmedetomidine infusions have overall better pain control and lower incidence of postoperative nausea-vomiting. All the aforementioned merits come with a stable hemodynamic profile and without any reported major adverse events. (C) 2017 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background & objectives: Cannabis is a widely used illicit drug and its use is often associated with co-occurring psychiatric disorders. This systematic review was aimed to provide information on the published Indian studies on co-occurring cannabis use disorders and psychiatric disorders.
   Methods: An electronic search of available Indian literature using relevant search terms was carried out in May 2015 and 52 articles in English language published from India were included in the current review.
   Results: Studies on cannabis and associated psychotic disorders (n=16) chiefly described acute episodes with predominant positive symptoms, following cannabis use. Some studies (n=6) observed an overall increased prevalence of all psychiatric disorders and symptoms owing to cannabis use, while others (n=14) elaborated on high rates of substance use in those with psychiatric disorders. The effect of cannabis use on cognitive function was the focus of some of the Indian studies (n=7). All these studies barring one had all male subjects, and a single study described the service delivery model for those with dual diagnosis disorders in India. Most of the research used cross-sectional observational design and focussed on treatment-seeking population.
   Interpretation & conclusions: A review of Indian literature on cannabis use and its association with psychiatric disorders indicates a high co-prevalence of psychotic disorders, especially in vulnerable individuals as well as high rates of co-occurrence of other psychiatric comorbidities. However, there is limited focus on exploring the aetiological association between cannabis use and psychiatric disorders; understanding the neurobiology of this association and management-related issues.

AB  - Most neonatal deaths worldwide occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Respiratory distress is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The epidemiology of respiratory distress among term neonates who constitute the vast majority of births is under reported. The scarcely available data from LMICs suggest an incidence of 1.2% to 7.2% among term live births and greater morbidity compared to that in high-income countries. Pneumonia and meconium aspiration syndrome are the predominant causes among outborn neonates, but next only to transient tachypnea among inborn neonates. Community management of neonatal sepsis/pneumonia using simplified antibiotic regimens when referral is not feasible, implementation of non-invasive ventilation, and innovative low-cost technologies to deliver respiratory therapy are important advances that have taken place in these settings. There is an urgent need to generate data on respiratory morbidities among term neonates so that the limited resources in these settings can be allocated judiciously. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Mannitol and hypertonic saline (HS) are most commonly used hyperosmotic agents for intraoperative brain relaxation. We compared the changes in ICP and systemic hemodynamics after infusion of equiosmolar solutions of both agents in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial tumors. Forty enrolled adults underwent a standard anesthetic induction. Apart from routine monitoring parameters, subdural ICP with Codmann catheter and cardiac indices by Vigileo monitor, were recorded. The patients were randomized to receive equiosmolar solutions of either 20% mannitol (5 ml/kg) or 3% HS (5.35 ml/kg) for brain relaxation. The time of placement of ICP catheter was marked as To and baseline ICP and systemic hemodynamic variables were noted; it was followed by recording of the same parameters every 5 min till 45 min (Study Period). After the completion of study period, brain relaxation score as assessed by the neurosurgeon was recorded. Arterial blood gas (ABG) was analysed every 30 min starting from To upto one and half hours (T90), and values of various parameters were recorded. Data was analysed using appropriate statistical methods. Both mannitol and HS significantly reduced the ICP; the values were comparable in between the two groups at most of the times. The brain relaxation score was comparable in both the groups. Urine output was significantly higher with mannitol. The perioperative complications, overall hospital stay, and Glasgow outcome score at discharge were comparable in between the two groups. To conclude, both mannitol and hypertonic saline in equiosmolar concentrations produced comparable effects on ICP reduction, brain relaxation, and systemic hemodynamics. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - p40, one of the two isomers of p63, is nowadays widely used for diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, especially in subtyping non-small cell carcinoma on lung biopsies. We describe a case in which lung tumour was misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma due to p40 immunopositivity. A 36-year-old lady presented with cough and left sided chest pain of 2 months duration. Chest imaging revealed a lesion in left lower lobe of the lung and biopsy was suggestive of squamous cell carcinoma. However, past history revealed amputation of great toe for non-healing discharging ulcer which on histopathology was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma. She also had a history of hysterectomy five years ago, details of which were not available. Post-amputation beta-hCG levels were high and she had been treated with multimodality chemotherapy for choriocarcinoma. She had good response to chemotherapy initially, however became resistant later on. Review of the lung biopsy in the light of the past history along with extensive literature review led to the final diagnosis of metastatic trophoblastic tumour to lung. Hence, awareness that p40 immunopositivity can be seen in trophoblastic tumours is essential to avoid misdiagnosis, especially in sites like the lung where squamous cell carcinoma is common.

AB  - Objective: To assess the outcome of amnion vaginoplasty in cases of vaginal agenesis due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome managed at the authors' institution.
   Design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Tertiary care hospital.
   Patient(s): Fifty women with MRKH who underwent neovaginoplasty.
   Intervention(s): Modified McIndoe's vaginoplasty was done in all the patients, using human amnion graft.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Functional status assessed by Female Sexual Function Index, anatomic status (length and width of neovagina), and epithelialization of vagina.
   Result(s): Mean (+/- SD) vaginal length after surgery was 8.2 +/- 1 cm. Mean vaginal length at 6-month follow-up in sexually active patients was significantly longer as compared with the patients who were not sexually active after surgery (8.4 +/- 1.04 cm vs. 6.6 +/- 2.4 cm). Mean Female Sexual Function Index score was 30.8 +/- 2.1. Vaginal biopsy showed complete epithelialization of vaginal mucosa.
   Conclusion(s): In a developing nation like India, McIndoe's method with amnion graft seems to be a promising option owing to its low cost, easy availability, and safety, ease of the procedure not requiring any special instrument, physiologic outcome with respect to epithelialization of the vagina without hair growth, and satisfying functional outcome.

AB  - The scientific basis for antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) for women at risk of preterm birth has rapidly changed in recent years. Two landmark trials-the Antenatal Corticosteroid Trial and the Antenatal Late Preterm Steroids Trial-have challenged the long-held assumptions on the comparative health benefits and harms regarding the use of ACS for preterm birth across all levels of care and contexts, including resource-limited settings. Researchers, clinicians, programme managers, policymakers and donors working in low-income and middle-income countries now face challenging questions of whether, where and how ACS can be used to optimise outcomes for both women and preterm newborns. In this article, we briefly present an appraisal of the current evidence around ACS, how these findings informed WHO's current recommendations on ACS use, and the knowledge gaps that have emerged in the light of new trial evidence. Critical considerations in the generalisability of the available evidence demonstrate that a true state of clinical equipoise exists for this treatment option in low-resource settings. An expert group convened by WHO concluded that there is a clear need for more efficacy trials of ACS in these settings to inform clinical practice.

AB  - Non-hypotensive hypovolemia, observed during mild haemorrhage or blood donation leads to reflex readjustment of the cardiac autonomic tone. In the present study, the cardiac autonomic tone was quantified using heart rate and blood pressure variability during and after non-hypotensive hypovolemia of blood donation. 86 voluntary healthy male blood donors were recruited for the study (age 35 +/- 9 years; weight 78 +/- 12 kg; height 174 +/- 6 cms). Continuous lead II ECG and beat-to-beat blood pressure was recorded before, during and after blood donation followed by offline time and frequency domain analysis of HRV and BPV. The overall heart rate variability (SDNN and total power) did not change during or after blood donation. However, there was a decrease in indices that represent the parasympathetic component (pNN50 %, SDSD and HF) while an increase was observed in sympathetic component (LF) along with an increase in sympathovagal balance (LF:HF ratio) during blood donation. These changes were sustained for the period immediately following blood donation. No fall of blood pressure was observed during the period of study. The blood pressure variability showed an increase in the SDNN, CoV and RMSSD time domain measures in the post donation period. These results suggest that mild hypovolemia produced by blood donation is non-hypotensive but is associated with significant changes in the autonomic tone. The increased blood pressure variability and heart rate changes that are seen only in the later part of donation period could be because of the progressive hypovolemia associated parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic activation that manifest during the course of blood donation.

AB  - In this paper, we have reported fabrication of a label free dopamine biosensor with improved sensitivity and selectivity using an interface based on Prussian blue (PB) modified nickel oxide (NiO) nanoparticles (NPs) and tyrosinase enzyme conjugates. A wet chemical sol-gel method was used to synthesize NiO NPs followed by surface modification with PB and utilized as a matrix to immobilize tyrosinase. The structural and morphological studies of the prepared NPs were conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy and purity of the sample was confirmed through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies. Subsequently, the PB modified NiO NPs were deposited onto a flexible screen printed carbon electrode (SPCE) substrate and tyrosinase enzyme molecules were immobilized onto PB-NiO NPs functionalized SPCE by covalent immobilization for selective and sensitive detection of neurotransmitter dopamine. The enzyme immobilization was confirmed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and FTIR studies and the fabricated electrode was used for electrochemical detection of dopamine using cyclic voltammetry and chrono-amperometric methods. The results of the electrochemical response studies revealed high sensitivity of 60.459 mu A/nanomoles in a broad detection range (0.0075-1.5 nanomoles) with a detection limit of 3.117 picomoles, whereas sample volume was as low as 15 mu L. The proposed sensor exhibited fast response time of 24 seconds; good selectivity in presence of interferents ascorbic and uric acid; descent shelf life of 50 days with excellent reusability (>30 times with 78% residual response). The sensor was also successfully validated with spiked real serum samples.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced expression of the protein frataxin. Frataxin is thought to play a role in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis and heme synthesis. In this study, we used erythroid progenitor stem cells obtained from FRDA patients and healthy donors to investigate the putative role, if any, of frataxin deficiency in heme synthesis.
   We used electrochemiluminescence and qRT-PCR for frataxin protein and mRNA quantification. We used atomic absorption spectrophotometry for iron levels and a photometric assay for hemoglobin levels. Protoporphyrin IX and Ferrochelatase were analyzed using auto-fluorescence. An "IronChip" microarray analysis followed by a protein-protein interaction analysis was performed.
   FRDA patient cells showed no significant changes in iron levels, hemoglobin synthesis, protoporphyrin IX levels, and ferrochelatase activity. Microarray analysis presented 11 genes that were significantly changed in all patients compared to controls. The genes are especially involved in oxidative stress, iron homeostasis and angiogenesis.
   The mystery about the involvement of frataxin on iron metabolism raises the question why frataxin deficiency in primary FRDA cells did not lead to changes in biochemical parameters of heme synthesis. It seems that alternative pathways can circumvent the impact of frataxin deficiency on heme synthesis. We show for the first time in primary FRDA patient cells that reduced frataxin levels are still sufficient for heme synthesis and possibly other mechanisms can overcome reduced frataxin levels in this process. Our data strongly support the fact that so far no anemia in FRDA patients was reported.

AB  - Background: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a variety of cellular roles, including regulation of transcription and translation, leading to alterations in gene expression. Some lncRNAs modulate the expression of chromosomally adjacent genes. Here, we assess the roles of the lncRNA CASC15 in regulation of a chromosomally nearby gene, SOX4, and its function in RUNX1/AML translocated leukemia.
   Results: CASC15 is a conserved lncRNA that was upregulated in pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) with t (12; 21) as well as pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t (8; 21), both of which are associated with relatively better prognosis. Enforced expression of CASC15 led to a myeloid bias in development, and overall, decreased engraftment and colony formation. At the cellular level, CASC15 regulated cellular survival, proliferation, and the expression of its chromosomally adjacent gene, SOX4. Differentially regulated genes following CASC15 knockdown were enriched for predicted transcriptional targets of the Yin and Yang-1 (YY1) transcription factor. Interestingly, we found that CASC15 enhances YY1-mediated regulation of the SOX4 promoter.
   Conclusions: Our findings represent the first characterization of this CASC15 in RUNX1-translocated leukemia, and point towards a mechanistic basis for its action.

AB  - Pediatric tuberculosis (TB) is challenging to diagnose, confirmed by growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis at best in 40% of cases. The WHO has assigned high priority to the development of nonsputum diagnostic tools. We therefore sought to identify transcriptional signatures in whole blood of Indian children, capable of discriminating intra-thoracic TB disease from other symptomatic illnesses. We investigated the expression of 198 genes in a training set, comprising 47 TB cases (19 definite/28 probable) and 36 asymptomatic household controls, and identified a 7-and a 10-transcript signature, both including NOD2, GBP5, IFITM1/3, KIF1B and TNIP1. The discriminatory abilities of the signatures were evaluated in a test set comprising 24 TB cases (17 definite/7 probable) and 26 symptomatic non-TB cases. In separating TB-cases from symptomatic non-TB cases, both signatures provided an AUC of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-1.00), a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI, 71.5-98.5) regardless of culture status, and 100% sensitivity for definite TB. The 7-transcript signature provided a specificity of 80.8% (95% CI, 60.0-92.7), and the 10-transcript signature a specificity of 88.5% (95% CI, 68.7-96.9%). Although warranting exploration and validation in other populations, our findings are promising and potentially relevant for future non-sputum based POC diagnostic tools for pediatric TB.

AB  - Background: The food environment has been implicated as an underlying contributor to the global obesity epidemic. However, few studies have evaluated the relationship between the food environment, dietary intake, and overweight/obesity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was to assess the association of full service and fast food restaurant density with dietary intake and overweight/obesity in Delhi, India.
   Methods: Data are from a cross-sectional, population-based study conducted in Delhi. Using multilevel cluster random sampling, 5364 participants were selected from 134 census enumeration blocks (CEBs). Geographic information system data were available for 131 CEBs (n = 5264) from a field survey conducted using hand-held global positioning system devices. The number of full service and fast food restaurants within a 1-km buffer of CEBs was recorded by trained staff using ArcGIS software, and participants were assigned to tertiles of full service and fast food restaurant density based on their resident CEB. Height and weight were measured using standardized procedures and overweight/obesity was defined as a BMI <= 25 kg/m(2).
   Results: The most common full service and fast food restaurants were Indian savory restaurants (57.2%) and Indian sweet shops (25.8%). Only 14.1% of full service and fast food restaurants were Western style. After adjustment for age, household income, education, and tobacco and alcohol use, participants in the highest tertile of full service and fast food restaurant density were less likely to consume fruit and more likely to consume refined grains compared to participants in the lowest tertile (both p < 0.05). In unadjusted logistic regression models, participants in the highest versus lowest tertile of full service and fast food restaurant density were significantly more likely to be overweight/obese: odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 1.44 (1.24, 1.67). After adjustment for age, household income, and education, the effect was attenuated: 1.08 (0.92, 1.26). Results were consistent with further adjustment for tobacco and alcohol use, moderate physical activity, and owning a bicycle or motorized vehicle.
   Conclusions: Most full service and fast food restaurants were Indian, suggesting that the nutrition transition in this megacity may be better characterized by the large number of unhealthy Indian food outlets rather than the Western food outlets. Full service and fast food restaurant density in the residence area of adults in Delhi, India, was associated with poor dietary intake. It was also positively associated with overweight/obesity, but this was largely explained by socioeconomic status. Further research is needed exploring these associations prospectively and in other LMICs.

AB  - Background National levels of personal health-care access and quality can be approximated by measuring mortality rates from causes that should not be fatal in the presence of effective medical care (ie, amenable mortality). Previous analyses of mortality amenable to health care only focused on high-income countries and faced several methodological challenges. In the present analysis, we use the highly standardised cause of death and risk factor estimates generated through the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) to improve and expand the quantification of personal health-care access and quality for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015.
   Methods We mapped the most widely used list of causes amenable to personal health care developed by Nolte and McKee to 32 GBD causes. We accounted for variations in cause of death certification and misclassifications through the extensive data standardisation processes and redistribution algorithms developed for GBD. To isolate the effects of personal health-care access and quality, we risk-standardised cause-specific mortality rates for each geography-year by removing the joint effects of local environmental and behavioural risks, and adding back the global levels of risk exposure as estimated for GBD 2015. We employed principal component analysis to create a single, interpretable summary measure-the Healthcare Quality and Access (HAQ) Index-on a scale of 0 to 100. The HAQ Index showed strong convergence validity as compared with other health-system indicators, including health expenditure per capita (r= 0.88), an index of 11 universal health coverage interventions (r= 0.83), and human resources for health per 1000 (r= 0.77). We used free disposal hull analysis with bootstrapping to produce a frontier based on the relationship between the HAQ Index and the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a measure of overall development consisting of income per capita, average years of education, and total fertility rates. This frontier allowed us to better quantify the maximum levels of personal health-care access and quality achieved across the development spectrum, and pinpoint geographies where gaps between observed and potential levels have narrowed or widened over time.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2015, nearly all countries and territories saw their HAQ Index values improve; nonetheless, the difference between the highest and lowest observed HAQ Index was larger in 2015 than in 1990, ranging from 28.6 to 94.6. Of 195 geographies, 167 had statistically significant increases in HAQ Index levels since 1990, with South Korea, Turkey, Peru, China, and the Maldives recording among the largest gains by 2015. Performance on the HAQ Index and individual causes showed distinct patterns by region and level of development, yet substantial heterogeneities emerged for several causes, including cancers in highest-SDI countries; chronic kidney disease, diabetes, diarrhoeal diseases, and lower respiratory infections among middle-SDI countries; and measles and tetanus among lowest-SDI countries. While the global HAQ Index average rose from 40.7 (95% uncertainty interval, 39.0-42.8) in 1990 to 53.7 (52.2-55.4) in 2015, far less progress occurred in narrowing the gap between observed HAQ Index values and maximum levels achieved; at the global level, the difference between the observed and frontier HAQ Index only decreased from 21.2 in 1990 to 20.1 in 2015. If every country and territory had achieved the highest observed HAQ Index by their corresponding level of SDI, the global average would have been 73.8 in 2015. Several countries, particularly in eastern and western sub-Saharan Africa, reached HAQ Index values similar to or beyond their development levels, whereas others, namely in southern sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, and south Asia, lagged behind what geographies of similar development attained between 1990 and 2015.
   Interpretation This novel extension of the GBD Study shows the untapped potential for personal health-care access and quality improvement across the development spectrum. Amid substantive advances in personal health care at the national level, heterogeneous patterns for individual causes in given countries or territories suggest that few places have consistently achieved optimal health-care access and quality across health-system functions and therapeutic areas. This is especially evident in middle-SDI countries, many of which have recently undergone or are currently experiencing epidemiological transitions. The HAQ Index, if paired with other measures of health-systemcharacteristics such as intervention coverage, could provide a robust avenue for tracking progress on universal health coverage and identifying local priorities for strengthening personal health-care quality and access throughout the world.

AB  - We report here carbon dots (CDs) that can be utilized for intracellular pH sensing via fluorescence emission monitoring. The carbon dots are synthesized using a simple procedure from an economical carbon source Agaricus bisporus. Along with the excitation dependent fluorescence emission, typical to carbon dots, these CDs were found to have distinct emission maxima peaks at 450 nm and 550 nm when excited by 365 nm and 500 nm respectively. Interestingly, while the fluorescence emission at 450 nm was unaffected by pH changes in solution, the fluorescence emission intensity at 550 nm increased with decrease in pH, making these CDs a potential probe for pH sensing ratiometrically. Further, the CDs were found to be biocompatible and easily internalized in HeLa cells. We also demonstrated the utility of these CDs in sensing the changes in intracellular pH.

AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of death all over the world. Among the strategies that are used for cancer treatment, the effectiveness of chemotherapy is often hindered by factors such as irregular and non-uniform uptake of drugs inside tumor. Thus, accurate prediction of drug transport and deposition inside tumor is crucial for increasing the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic treatment. In this study, a computational model of human brain tumor is developed that incorporates dynamic contrast enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data into a voxelized porous media model. The model takes into account realistic transport and perfusion kinetics parameters together with realistic heterogeneous tumor vasculature and accurate arterial input function (AIF), which makes it patient specific. The computational results for interstitial fluid pressure (IFP), interstitial fluid velocity (IFV) and tracer concentration show good agreement with the experimental results. The computational model can be extended further for predicting the deposition of chemotherapeutic drugs in tumor environment as well as selection of the best chemotherapeutic drug for a specific patient.

AB  - Purpose: Hoffa fractures are uncommon intra-articular fractures of femoral condyle in coronal plane. The purpose of our study is to assess radiologic and functional outcome in operatively treated Hoffa fractures. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 32 patients of isolated Hoffa fracture from January 2010 to March 2015. All were treated with open reduction and internal fixation using lateral approach for lateral Hoffa and medial approach for medial Hoffa fracture. Cancellous screws in lag mode and/or antiglide plate were employed for fixation in accordance with fracture anatomy. All patients were subjected to aggressive physical therapy postoperatively. Knee Society Score (KSS), International Knee Documentation Committee Score (IKDC), and Knee range of motion (ROM) were documented at final follow-up for functional evaluation. Results: All fractures united by mean time of 11.56 +/- 1.5 weeks. No evidence of subsequent displacement or fixation failure, arthritis, Avascular necrosis (AVN) of femoral condyle was elicited in any of the patients. Documented mean KSS and mean IKDC Score at final follow-up were 83.19 +/- 8.43 and 81.62 +/- 6.95, respectively. ROM at final follow-up was ranging from 0 degrees to mean 116.41 degrees +/- 13.98 degrees. Complications included stiffness of the involved knee in four patients, including one patient who developed infection and had to undergo implant removal after fracture union. Conclusion: Operative treatment of Hoffa fractures yields fairly good functional outcome. One must endeavor to achieve adequate intraoperative exposure and stable congruous articular reconstruction. Early aggressive physical therapy is a harbinger of optimal outcome.

AB  - Design of safe and efficient vehicles for the combinatorial delivery of drugs and genetic agents is an emerging requisite for achieving enhanced therapeutic effect in cancer. Even though several nanoplatforms have been explored for the co-delivery of drugs and genetic materials the translation of these systems to clinical phase is still a challenge, mainly due to tedious synthesis procedures, lack of serum stability, inefficient scalability etc. Here in, we report development of reduction and pH sensitive polymeric graft of low molecular weight poly (styrene -alt -maleic anhydride) and evaluation of its efficacy in co-delivering drug and siRNA. The polymer was modified with suitable components, which could help in overcoming various systemic and cellular barriers for successful co-delivery of drugs and nucleic acids to cancer cells, using simple chemical reactions. The polymeric derivative could easily self assemble in water to form smooth, spherical micellar structures, indicating their scalability. Doxorubicin and PLK-1 siRNA were selected as model drug and nucleic acid, respectively. Doxorubicin could be loaded in the self assembling micelles with an optimum loading content of similar to 8.6% w/w and efficient siRNA complexation was achieved with polymer/siRNA weight ratios >40. The polyplexes were stabilized in physiological saline by coating with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Stable drug loaded nanoplexes, for clinical administration, could be easily formulated by gently dispersing them in physiological saline containing appropriate amount of albumin. Drug release from the nanoplexes was significantly enhanced at low pH (5) and in the presence of 10 mM glutathione (GSH) showing their dual stimuli sensitive nature. In vitro cell proliferation assay and in vivo tumor regression study have shown synergistic effect of the drug loaded nanoplexes in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Facile synthesis steps, scalability and ease of formulation depict excellent clinical translation potential of the proposed nanosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - There is wide variation in the management of acute kidney injury (AKI) and the practice of renal replacement therapy (RRT) around the world. Clinicians in developing countries face additional challenges due to limited resources, reduced availability of trained staff and equipment, cultural and socioeconomic aspects, and administrative and governmental barriers. In this article, we report the consensus recommendations from the 18th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative conference in Hyderabad, India. We provide the minimal requirements for provision of acute RRT in developing countries, including patient selection, choice of RRT modality and monitoring, transition, and termination of acute RRT. We also discuss areas of uncertainty and propose themes for future research. These recommendations can serve as a foundation for clinicians to implement renal support for AKI in low resource settings.

AB  - Objective Easy large-scale production, easy availability, cost-effectiveness, long half-life, and favorable radiation characteristics have made lutetium-177 (Lu-177) a preferred radionuclide for use in therapy. Lutetium-177-labeled stannous (Lu-177-Sn) colloid particles were formulated for application in radiosynovectomy, followed by in-vitro and in-vivo characterization.
   Methods Stannous chloride (SnCl2) solution and Lu-177 were heated together, the pH was adjusted, and the particles were recovered by centrifugation. The heating time and amount of SnCl2 were varied to optimize the labeling protocol. The labeling efficiency (LE) and radiochemical purity (RCP) of the product were determined. The size and shape of the particles were determined by means of electron microscopy. In-vitro stability was tested in PBS and synovial fluid, and in-vivo stability was tested in humans.
   Results LE and RCP were greater than 95% and approximate to 99% (R-f=0-0.1), respectively. Aggregated colloidal particles were spherical (mean size: 24147nm). The product was stable in vitro for up to 7 days in PBS as well as in synovial fluid. Injection of the product into the infected knee joint of a patient resulted in its homogenous distribution in the intra-articular space, as seen on the scan. No leakage of activity was seen outside the knee joint even 7 days after injection, indicating good tracer binding and in-vivo stability.
   Conclusion Lu-177-Sn colloid was successfully prepared with a high LE (>95%) and high RCP (99%) under optimized reaction conditions. Because of the numerous benefits of Lu-177 and the ease of preparation of tin colloid particles, Lu-177-Sn colloid particles are significantly superior to its currently available counterparts for use in radiosynovectomy.

AB  - Background: Increased Oxidative Stress (OS) is implicated in the pathogenesis of Chronic Pancreatitis (CP). Whether or not OS contributes to disease progression through the stages of Recurrent Acute Pancreatitis(RAP), to CP is not known. Increased OS, if present in RAP could be an important therapeutic target in preventing progression of RAP to CP.
   Objective: To assess the oxidative stress and antioxidant status in patients with idiopathic RAP.
   Methods: 50 consecutive patients with Idiopathic Recurrent Acute Pancreatitis (IRAP) were included. Markers of OS [4-hydroxynonenol (4-HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA) and serum SOD (S-SOD)] and antioxidant status [ferric reducing the ability of plasma (FRAP), Glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and Vitamin C (Vit C)] were measured in quiescent phase and during an episode of pancreatitis. Their levels were compared with those in age and sex matched healthy controls and patients with CP.
   Results: The mean age of patients with IRAP was 22.2 +/- 7.7 years and 39 (78%) were males. Levels of 4-HNE were significantly increased in patients with IRAP compared with healthy controls (3.03 +/- 2.35 vs. 2.12 +/- 1.29 ng/ml; p = 0.03) and were even higher during an episode of acute pancreatitis (5.21 +/- 3.51 ng/ml; p = 0.03). Antioxidant levels were reduced in IRAP compared with healthy controls as measured by FRAP (707.0 +/- 144.9 vs. 528.8 +/- 120.0 mu mol/Fe2+liberated; p = 0.0001) and GPX (1472 +/- 375.7 vs. 910.0 +/- 558.5 pg/ml; p = 0.001). OS and antioxidant profiles were similar in IRAP and CP with no significant difference.
   Conclusion: OS is increased in patients with IRAP, more so during an acute episode. Antioxidant levels are also reduced suggesting that OS may play a role in the pathogenesis of IRAP and its progression to CP. (C) 2017 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: While nuclear myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) offers many benefits to patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease, concerns exist regarding radiation-associated health effects, Little is known regarding MPI practice in Africa. We sought to characterise radiation doses and the use of MPI best practices that could minimise radiation in African nuclear cardiology laboratories, and compare these to practice worldwide.
   Methods: Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected for a consecutive sample of 348 patients from 12 laboratories in six African countries over a one-week period from March to April 2013. Radiation effective dose (ED) was estimated for each patient. A quality index (QI) enumerating adherence to eight best practices, identified a priori by an IAEA expert panel, was calculated for each laboratory. We compared these metrics with those from 7 563 patients from 296 laboratories outside Africa.
   Results: Median (interquartile range) patient ED in Africa was similar to that of the rest of the world [9.1 (5.1-15.6) vs 10.3 mSv (6.8-12.6), p = 0,14], although a larger proportion of African patients received a low ED, <= 9 mSv targeted in societal recommendations (49.7 vs 38.2%, p < 0.001). Best-practice adherence was higher among African laboratories (QI score: 6.3 +/- 1.2 vs 5.4 +/- 1.3, p = 0.013). However, median ED varied significantly among African laboratories (range: 2.0-16.3 mSv; p < 0.0001) and QI range was 4-8.
   Conclusion: Patient radiation dose from MPI in Africa was similar to that in the rest of the world, and adherence to best practices was relatively high in African laboratories. Nevertheless there remain opportunities to further reduce radiation exposure to African patients from MPI.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is increasingly common around the world. Because of the low availability of effective therapies and resource limitations, early preventive and therapeutic measures are essential to decrease morbidity, mortality, and cost. Timely recognition and diagnosis of AKI requires a heightened degree of suspicion in the appropriate clinical and environmental context. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), early detection is impaired by limited resources and low awareness. In this article, we report the consensus recommendations of the 18th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting in Hyderabad, India, on how to improve recognition of AKI. We expect these recommendations will lead to an earlier and more accurate diagnosis of AKI, and improved research to promote a better understanding of the epidemiology, etiology, and histopathology of AKI in LMICs.

AB  - Objective To determine the range and heterogeneity of outcomes reported in randomized controlled trials of interventions for children with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Study design The Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Specialized Register was searched to March 2016. Randomized trials involving children across all stages of CKD were selected. All outcome domains and measurements were extracted from included trials. The frequency and characteristics of the outcome domains and measures were evaluated.
   Results From 205 trials included, 6158 different measurements of 100 different outcome domains were reported, with a median of 22 domains per trial (IQR 13-41). Overall, 52 domains (52%) were surrogate, 38 (38%) were clinical, and 10 (10%) were patient-reported. The 5 most commonly reported domains were blood pressure (76 [37%] trials), relapse/remission (70 [34%]), kidney function (66 [32%]), infection (61 [ 30%]), and height/pubertal development (51 [25%]). Mortality (14%), cardiovascular disease (4%), and quality of life (1%) were reported infrequently. The 2 most frequently reported outcomes, blood pressure and relapse/ remission, had 56 and 81 different outcome measures, respectively.
   Conclusions The outcomes reported in clinical trials involving children with CKD are extremely heterogeneous and are most often surrogate outcomes, rather than clinical and patient-centered outcomes such as cardiovascular disease and quality of life. Efforts to ensure consistent reporting of outcomes that are important to patients and clinicians will improve the value of trials to guide clinical decision-making. In our study, non-English articles were excluded.

AB  - A total of 21 Trichosporon spp. isolates from blood over a period of 5 years (January 2009 to December 2013) were included in the study. The most common underlying diseases found were pancreatitis (33.3%) and cancer (33.3%). Trichosporon asahii (80.9%) was the commonest species followed by Trichosporon mycotoxinivorans (14.2%) and Trichosporon faecale (4.7%). On IGS1 region sequencing the most predominant T. asahii type in our region was genotype 1 (16/17 isolates; 94.1%) and one isolate belonged to genotype 4. Following the interpretative breakpoints for Candida albicans according to CLSI guidelines amphotericin B minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were <= 1 mu g/ml for 38% of isolates. Fluconazole MICs were <= 4 mu g/ml for 33.3% of the isolates. Itraconazole MICs were <= 0.5 mu g/ml for 52.3% of the isolates. However, the MICs to posaconazole and voriconazole were <= 0.5 mu g/ml for all the isolates. The MICs to caspofungin and micafungin were <= 0.5 mu g/ml for only 0.09% of the isolates. This study reemphasizes that IGS1 sequencing is the most reliable technique for accurate identification of Trichosporon spp. and also to identify the newer species like T. mycotoxinivorans, which still remains rare. Surveillance of antifungal susceptibility patterns can provide the local drug resistance data to the clinicians which can further aid better management of patients.

AB  - Background: Congenital cytomegalovirus infection (cCMV) is a leading nongenetic cause of permanent congenital or early-onset hearing loss (PCEHL). Although cCMV rates are high despite near-universal seroimmunity, the contribution of cCMV to PCEHL in the developing world is unclear.
   Methods: Neonates at a rural North Indian hospital were screened for cCMV by saliva polymerase chain reaction and hearing by distortion-product otoacoustic emission testing. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive infants and those not passing newborn hearing screening (NHS) were evaluated by auditory brainstem response to confirm PCEHL. Infants with cCMV and those with PCEHL were tested for mutations within the GJB2 gene.
   Results: Of the 1720 infants screened, 40 (2.3%) did not pass NHS and 20 (1.2%) were CMV positive. Auditory brainstem evoked response testing confirmed unilateral or bilateral PCEHL in 11 (0.64%) children who either did not pass NHS or CMV positive. PCEHL was 20-fold higher in neonates with cCMV (2/20, 10%) than those without (9/1700, 0.5%; P < 0.01). None of 11 infants with PCEHL had connexin 26 mutations.
   Conclusion: PCEHL incidence is high in India, with cCMV contributing significantly despite near-universal seroimmunity. Our findings also demonstrate the feasibility and the utility of simultaneous newborn screening for both cCMV and hearing loss in a resource-limited setting.

AB  - The Wnt/beta-catenin is a highly conserved signaling pathway involved in cell fate decisions during various stages of development. Dysregulation of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling has been associated with various diseases including cancer. p-Catenin, the central component of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is a multi-functional protein playing both structural and signaling roles. p-Catenin is composed of three distinct domains: N-terminal domain, C-terminal domain and a central armadillo repeat domain. N-terminal domain of beta-catenin harbours almost all of the cancer causing mutations, thus deciphering its critical structural and functional roles offers great potential in cancer detection and therapy. Here, in this review, we have collected information from pharmacological analysis, bio-physical and structural studies, molecular modeling, in-vivo and in-vitro assays, and transgenic animal experiments employing various N-terminal domain variants of beta-catenin to discuss the interaction of beta-catenin with its binding partners that specifically interact with this domain and the implications of these interactions on signaling, cell fate determination, and in tumorigenesis. A thorough understanding of interactions between p-catenin and its binding partners will enable us to more effectively understand how P-catenin switches between its multiple roles, and will lead to the development of specific assays for the identification of small molecules as chemotherapeutic agents to treat diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, where Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is dysregulated.

AB  - Background: The frequency of metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is increasing worldwide, with over 500,000 cases performed every year. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is present in 35%-94% of MBS patients. Nevertheless, consensus regarding the perioperative management of OSA in MBS patients is not established.
   Objectives: To provide consensus based guidelines utilizing current literature and, when in the absence of supporting clinical data, expert opinion by organizing a consensus meeting of experts from relevant specialties.
   Setting: The meeting was held in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
   Methods: A panel of 15 international experts identified 75 questions covering preoperative screening, treatment, postoperative monitoring, anesthetic care and follow-up. Six researchers reviewed the literature systematically. During this meeting, the "Amsterdam Delphi Method" was utilized including controlled acquisition of feedback, aggregation of responses and iteration.
   Results: Recommendations or statements were provided for 58 questions. In the judgment of the experts, 17 questions provided no additional useful information and it was agreed to exclude them. With the exception of 3 recommendations (64%, 66%, and 66% respectively), consensus (>70%) was reached for 55 statements and recommendations. Several highlights: polysonmography is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA; continuous positive airway pressure is recommended for all patients with moderate and severe OSA; OSA patients should be continuously monitored with pulse oximetry in the early postoperative period; perioperative usage of sedatives and opioids should be minimized.
   Conclusion: This first international expert meeting provided 58 statements and recommendations for a clinical consensus guideline regarding the perioperative management of OSA patients undergoing MBS. (C) 2017 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. All rights reserved.

AB  - Substance use disorder (SUD) is a major problem worldwide, including in India, and contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, addresses the prevention and rehabilitation aspect of substance use through the establishment of "rehabilitation centers" run by nongovernmental organizations. The Drug De-addiction Programme (DDAP) was initiated in 1988 under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and was mandated with provision of treatment for SUDs. Through the DDAP, de-addiction centers (DACs) have been established in government hospitals by providing a one-time financial grant by the central government, with the recurring expenses to be borne by the state governments. In addition, some premier institutions as well as DACs from Northeastern region are provided annual recurring grants for their functioning. Capacity building has been a major focus area of DDAP in which nonspecialist medical officers working in government hospitals have been trained, and various training materials have been developed. Another major area of work is the development of "drug abuse monitoring system" to track the pattern of drug use and profile among individuals seeking treatment in the DACs. Monitoring and evaluation exercises carried out show that the existing model of inpatient treatment and of shared responsibility between central and state governments is partially successful. The establishment of drug treatment clinics on pilot basis with a focus on outpatient treatment and direct support from the DDAP for staff as well as for medicines is showing encouraging results.

AB  - India has one of the largest proportion of children and adolescents in the world, but the threat posed by child substance use remains under-researched. Only recently a large study, the first of its kind in India, was carried out with a sample of nearly 4000 children using substances (school-going, out-of-school as well as street children) across more than a hundred cities/towns. We discuss (i) the existing knowledge on the prevalence of child substance abuse in India; (ii) perspectives and insights gained from the recent nation-wide study on its pattern and profile; and (iii) recommendations for substance use prevention and treatment among children in the Indian context. A multipronged approach involving all stakeholders is required to address the issues of prevention and treatment.

AB  - This review covers a broad range of well-established and novel diagnostic platforms which are currently being considered for use in commercial point-of care (POC) diagnostics utilizing aptamers instead of antibodies as the molecular recognition elements. Relevant technologies include traditional enzyme-linked colorimetric plate assays, lateral flow test strips, more exotic homogeneous "lights on" fluorescence assays, as well as new nanoparticle-based, electrochemical, electrochemiluminescence and other technologies suitable for rapid and facile POC clinical diagnostics. Advantages of using aptamers over antibodies in such POC diagnostic platforms are elucidated in each case. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Most data on mortality and prognostic factors in patients with heart failure come from North America and Europe, with little information from other regions. Here, in the International Congestive Heart Failure (INTER-CHF) study, we aimed to measure mortality at 1 year in patients with heart failure in Africa, China, India, the Middle East, southeast Asia and South America; we also explored demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables associated with mortality.
   Methods We enrolled consecutive patients with heart failure (3695 [66%] clinic outpatients, 2105 [34%] hospital in patients) from 108 centres in six geographical regions. We recorded baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and followed up patients at 6 months and 1 year from enrolment to record symptoms, medications, and outcomes. Time to death was studied with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, medications, socioeconomic variables, and region. We used the explained risk statistic to calculate the relative contribution of each level of adjustment to the risk of death.
   Findings We enrolled 5823 patients within 1 year (with 98% follow-up). Overall mortality was 16.5%: highest in Africa (34%) and India (23%), intermediate in southeast Asia (15%), and lowest in China (7%), South America (9%), and the Middle East (9%). Regional differences persisted after multivariable adjustment. Independent predictors of mortality included cardiac variables (New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV, previous admission for heart failure, and valve disease) and non-cardiac variables (body-mass index, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). 46% of mortality risk was explained by multivariable modelling with these variables; however, the remainder was unexplained.
   Interpretation Marked regional differences in mortality in patients with heart failure persisted after multivariable adjustment for cardiac and non-cardiac factors. Therefore, variations in mortality between regions could be the result of health-care infrastructure, quality and access, or environmental and genetic factors. Further studies in large, global cohorts are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Damage control surgery (DCS) has been a well-established practice in the management of trauma victims for more than 2 decades now. The primary aim of this study was to review and analyze the presentation and outcome of patients with torso trauma who underwent DCS at Level I trauma center.
   METHODS: Retrospective study was conducted using database records prospectively maintained over period of 6 years from 2008 through 2013 at an urban Level I trauma center. Data available from hospital medical records were analyzed to study presentation, mechanism of injury, organs injured, associated injuries, and outcome in patients who underwent DCS following torso trauma. Primary outcome measure was survival.
   RESULTS: Total of 61 patients were identified who had undergone DCS during the study period. Majority of these patients were males (n=59), had sustained blunt trauma as result of road traffic injury, and had presented with shock (n=49). The 30-day mortality rate was 54%. Mortality was significantly associated with shock (63% cases died; p=0.008), and with Glasgow Coma scale 58 (85% died; p=0.001). Injuries significantly associated with high mortality were hepatic injury (n=15; I I died), major vascular injury (n=10; 3 died), cardiac injury (n=5; 3 died), and pelvic fracture (n=17; 10 died). Re-exploration was required in 28 cases with 13 deaths. Mesh laparostomy was performed in 24 cases, with mortality in 58%.
   CONCLUSION: In the absence of more effective alternative, especially at facilities with limited resources, DCS may be appropriate in critically injured patients; however, it continues to be associated with significant morbidity and high mortality, even at tertiary care centers.

AB  - Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among individuals with HIV infection. Screening for proteinuria in HIV-infected children will help in early detection and treatment, and thus prevention and progression to CKD to end-stage kidney disease (ESRD). We screened 139 HIV-infected children aged 18 months to 18 years for proteinuria by urinary dipstick and confirmed by spot urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. If proteinuria was absent by the above methods, patients were screened for microalbuminuria by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio. We found proteinuria in 11.5% and microalbuminuria in 10.6% of our study population. The prevalence of proteinuria was higher in the advanced stages; 8.05% in stage 1, 12.12% in stage 2 and 26.32% in stages 3 + 4.

AB  - Objective: To document bone mineral density of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Tertiary-care center of Northern India, July 2012 to August 2015.
   Participants: 52 children aged 6-18 years with cystic fibrosis and 62 healthy controls of similar age and sex.
   Methods: Both patients and controls were stratified into two groups, as pre-pubertal and perk/post-pubertal, and compared for whole body bone mineral density, measured using dual energy Xray absorptiometry. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone were measured in children with cystic fibrosis.
   Results: Compared with controls, the mean (SD) bone mineral density of children with cystic fibrosis was significantly lower in both the pre-pubertal (0.7 (0.1) g/cm(2) vs 0.9 (0.1) g/cm(2); P<0.001)) and ped-/post-pubertal groups (0.9 (0.1) g/cm(2) vs 1.1 (0.1) g/cm(2); P<0.001). Also, the mean (SD) bone mineral apparent density of pre-pubertal and perk/post-pubertal cystic fibrosis patients was lower than the controls (P <0.001 and P= 0.01, respectively). Thirty-seven (71.2%) cystic fibrosis patients had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level below 15 ng/mL.
   Conclusion: Bone mineral density of children with cystic fibrosis was significantly lower than controls; majority of them were vitamin-D deficient. Intervening at an early stage of the disease and providing optimal therapy involving simultaneous management of the several factors affecting bone mineral accretion may be beneficial in improving bone health of these patients.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess inter- and intra-observer variability of arm muscle thickness measured by critical care physicians using bedside ultrasonography (USG). Methodology: This prospective study included twenty patients admitted with sepsis. Three measurements of thickness of right arm muscles of each patient using B-mode USG were taken by two critical care fellows, independently. Intra- and inter-observer reliability was tested using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The mean 1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd) measurements of muscle thickness recorded by observer 1 and 2 were 23.620 (4.171) versus 23.840 (3.849) mm, 23.235 (3.620) versus 23.625 (4.062) mm, and 24.125 (4.098) versus 23.965 (3.651) mm, respectively. The average muscle thickness measured by first and second observer was 23.660 (3.834) mm and 23.810 (3.674) mm, respectively. ICC for intra-observer variability for observer 1 and 2 was 0.964 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.924u0.985) and 0.949 (95% CI 0.892u0.978), respectively. ICC for inter-observer variability was 0.995 (95% CI 0.988u0.998). Conclusions: USG is a reliable tool for assessment of arm muscle thickness by critical care physicians.

AB  - Surgical excision of meningioma is often complicated by significant blood loss requiring blood transfusion with its attendant risks. Although tranexamic acid is used to reduce perioperative blood loss, its blood conservation effect is uncertain in neurosurgery. Sixty adults undergoing elective craniotomy for meningioma excision were randomized to receive either tranexamic acid or placebo, initiated prior to skin incision. Patients in the tranexamic acid group received intravenous bolus of 20 mg/kg over 20 min followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h till the conclusion of surgery. Intraoperative blood loss, transfusion requirements and estimation of surgical hemostasis using a 5-grade scale were noted. Postoperatively, the extent of tumor excision on CT scan and complications were observed. Demographics, tumor characteristics, amount of fluid infusion, and duration of surgery and anesthesia were comparable between the two groups. The amount of blood loss was significantly less in tranexamic acid group compared to placebo (830 ml vs 1124 ml; p = 0.03). The transfusion requirement was less in tranexamic acid group (p > 0.05). The patients in tranexamic acid group fared better on a 5-grade surgical hemostasis scale with more patients showing good hemostasis (p = 0.007). There were no significant differences between the groups with regards to extent of tumor removal, perioperative complications, hospital stay or neurologic outcome. To conclude, administration of tranexamic acid significantly reduced blood loss in patients undergoing excision of meningioma. Fewer patients in the tranexamic acid group received blood transfusions. Surgical field hemostasis was better achieved in patients who received tranexamic acid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas. The currently available treatment of CP is aimed at controlling symptoms and managing complications. Unfortunately, no specific treatment is available to halt the progression of the disease process because the pathophysiological perturbations in CP are not well understood. In this review, we discuss various therapeutic targets and investigational agents acting on these targets. Among these, therapies modulating immune cells and those acting on pancreatic stellate cells appear promising and may translate into clinical benefit in near future. However, these experimental therapies are mostly in animal models and they do not recapitulate all aspects of human disease. Still they may be beneficial in developing effective therapeutic modalities to curb inflammation in chronic pancreatitis.

AB  - Introduction: Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is a rare disorder, reported mainly in European adults, with occasional childhood cases. We report a series of 6 patients with pediatric MMF from the Indian subcontinent. Methods: Clinical details, creatine kinase levels, and results of electromyography are described for patients diagnosed with MMF. Fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed muscle biopsies were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining, histochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Results: Six of 2,218 muscle biopsies were diagnosed as MMF; patient charts were reviewed. The 6 patients were all children; all presented with hypotonia and/or motor delay. Mean age at diagnosis was 16.2 months. There were 4 boys and 2 girls. All had a history of hepatitis B vaccination. Histopathology revealed infiltration by sheets of large periodic acid-Schiff stain-positive histiocytes. Ultrastructural examination demonstrated needle-shaped crystals within histiocytes. One patient had a co-existent neuromuscular disorder, merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy. Conclusions: MMF is a rare inflammatory myopathy that should be considered in the differential diagnosis of congenital myopathies in children.

AB  - This communication focuses on an important, yet neglected, aspect of medicine, which has an impact on diabetes care as well. Betel quid (paan) chewing is a commonly encountered, socioculturally accepted, "culture-bound" addictive disorder. Betel quid chewing has unwanted psychotropic, carcinogenic and dysmetabolic effects. Thus, it should be discouraged as strongly as tobacco use. This communication calls for raised awareness among physicians and community leaders regarding this addictive disorder, and highlight the need for research on this topic.

AB  - Low plasma TFPI levels have been associated with an increased risk of DVT; however its association with TFPI gene polymorphisms is controversial and not yet studied in India. The aim of our study was to analyze prevalence of TFPI gene polymorphisms, evaluate their effects on its plasma levels and determine its association with DVT. Plasma level and genetic polymorphisms (33T > C, 399C > T and 536C > T) of TFPI were screened in subjects (100 DVT patients and 100 controls). Mean TFPI level in patients was significantly lower than controls (Patients: 33.55 +/- 11.72 ng/ml, Controls: 48.05 +/- 13.68 ng/ml, p < 0.001). DVT patients had significantly higher prevalence of 399C > T (p = 0.001, ORa: 5.69, CI: 1.14-28.46) and lower prevalence of 33T > C polymorphism (p < 0.001, ORa: 0.239, CI: 0.065-0.871). The wild type (TT genotype) of 33T > C and variant form (CT and TT genotype) of 399C > T polymorphism was significantly associated with low TFPI levels. TFPI 536C > T polymorphism was absent in all subjects. In conclusion, dual nature of TFPI gene polymorphisms were established in our association study; 33T > C being protective and 399C > T as an important risk factor in Indian DVT patients, probably mediated by alteration in TFPI levels. These findings may prove a vital role in risk stratification and treatment of DVT.

AB  - The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) among acutely ill patients is reportedly very high and has vexing consequences on patient outcomes and health care systems. The risks and impact of AKI differ between developed and developing countries. Among developing countries, AKI occurs in young individuals with no or limited comorbidities, and is usually due to environmental causes, including infectious diseases. Although several risk factors have been identified for AKI in different settings, there is limited information on how risk assessment can be used at population and patient levels to improve care in patients with AKI, particularly in developing countries where significant health disparities may exist. The Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus conference work group addressed the issue of identifying risk factors for AKI and provided recommendations for developing individualized risk stratification strategies to improve care. We proposed a 5-dimension, evidence-based categorization of AKI risk that allows clinicians and investigators to study, define, and implement individualized risk assessment tools for the region or country where they practice. These dimensions include environmental, socioeconomic and cultural factors, processes of care, exposures, and the inherent risks of AKI. We provide examples of these risks and describe approaches for risk assessments in the developing world. We anticipate that these recommendations will be useful for health care providers to plan and execute interventions to limit the impact of AKI on society and each individual patient. Using a modified Delphi process, this group reached consensus regarding several aspects of AKI risk stratification.

AB  - Background: In view of the growing human activities in Antarctica and increasing exposure of humans to prolonged isolation under extreme conditions, such as space travel and deep sea diving, it is necessary to study the psychological adaptation to such an environment. The current study aimed to assess the psychological adaptation of Indian expeditioners to prolonged residence in Antarctica.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-four winter team members of 27th Indian Scientific Expedition to Antarctica were administered seven instruments 5 times during the expedition. The instruments measured cognition and memory, general psychological health and tobacco, and alcohol consumption.
   Results: Alcohol consumption was maximum during the initial days of arrival on the continent and decreased thereafter, with another spike during the peak of the winter season. Externalized psychological reactions peaked during the midwinter period. Anxiety and insomnia peaked during the coldest period whereas depressive symptoms did not change throughout the expedition. Cognition was at its worst during the final phase of Antarctic residence. No significant change was noted in the third quarter of wintering.
   Conclusion: Each phase of Antarctic residence could be equated with a particular stage in psychological adaptation. There was no third quarter phenomenon.

AB  - Timely recognition of patients at risk or with possible acute kidney injury (AKI) is essential for early intervention to minimize further damage and improve outcome. Initial management of patients with suspected and persistent AKI should include thorough clinical assessment of all patients with AKI to identify reversible factors, including fluid volume status, potential nephrotoxins, and an assessment of the underlying health of the kidney. Based on these assessments, early interventions to provide appropriate and adequate fluid resuscitation while avoiding fluid overload, removal of nephrotoxins, and adjustment of drug doses according to the level of kidney function derangement are important. The judicious use of diuretics for fluid overload and/or in cardiac decompensated patients and introduction of early enteral nutritional support need to be considered to improve outcomes in AKI. Although these basic principles are well recognized, their application in clinical practice in low resource settings is often limited due to lack of education, availability of resources, and lack of trained personnel, which limits access to care. We report the consensus recommendations of the 18th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative meeting in Hyderabad, India, on strategies to evaluate patients with suspected AKI and initiate measures for prevention and management to improve outcomes, particularly in low resource settings. These recomendations provide a framework for caregivers, who are often primary care physicians, nurses, and other allied healthcare personnel, to manage patients with AKI in resource poor countries.

AB  - Purpose. Resistant Gram-negative bacterial (GNB) infections, apart from tremendously escalating the cost of treatment, are a cause for substantial morbidity and mortality among hospitalized patients. Such bacteria are rapidly acquiring resistance to many antimicrobial agents, especially the beta-lactams which are the most frequently prescribed antimicrobials in hospital and community patient care settings, and now also to colistin; a last-line drug to treat infections with such bacteria. The greatest threat to antimicrobial treatment is the production of metallo beta-lactamases, and plasmid-mediated serine carbapenemases.
   Methodology. We conducted a two-year study to observe the pattern of beta-lactamase enzyme production (extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC and carbapenemases) among the nosocomial GNB isolated from intensive care units (ICUs) of North and South Indian hospitals. A total of 761 non-duplicate GNB were included in the study from North (554; 73 %) and South India (207; 27 %). All strains were subjected to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommended screening tests for detection of beta-lactamase production, followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of clinically important beta-lactamase genes mediating resistant phenotypes among these isolates.
   Results. Out of the 761 GNB, Acinetobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and others were 27, 23, 21, 17, 5 and 7% respectively. A high prevalence of ESBL was found across all genera in these strains. The carbapenem resistance was higher in North than in South Indian GNB. The level of AmpC production was comparatively lower in both North and South Indian strains.
   Conclusion. Beta-lactamases showed tremendous variation in geographic distribution. Thus, their detection and characterization is important from a clinical-epidemiological, laboratory and infection control point of view. Knowledge of this epidemiology can predict the empiric antimicrobial treatment.

AB  - Background: Factor V Leiden is the most common genetic variation among the blood coagulation pathway which leads to prothrombotic state, therefore, is considered an important gene for understating the stroke mechanism. Aim: The aim of the present study is to determine the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphism at G1691A position of Factor V gene and risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in North Indian population. Materials and Methods: In a retrospective case-control study, 250 patients with IS and 250 age-and gender-matched controls were enrolled in the period of October 2012 to September 2014 from in-and out-patient department of Neurology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Deoxyribonucleic acid for each case and control was isolated from peripheral blood using phenol-chloroform extraction method. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method was used to determine the polymorphism. Data were analyzed using STATA Software Version 13. Results: The mean age of IS patient was 52.8 +/- 12.5 years and in control group was 50.97 +/- 12.7 years. Genotypic frequency distributions were in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and controls. As expected hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, heavy alcohol intake, family history of stroke, and poor economic status were significantly associated with the risk of IS. Multivariate analysis revealed 5.17 times higher odds for developing the risk of large vessel subtype of IS in patients carrying Factor V Leiden G1691A gene variation as compared to control subjects (OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 1.32-20.3, P = 0.01). Conclusion: The present study suggests that Factor V Leiden G1691A polymorphism may be significantly associated with the risk of large vessel subtype of IS. Large sample size studies using prospective cohort designs are required to corroborate the present findings.

AB  - Calotropis procera latex fractions possessing anti-inflammatory property were characterized for their biochemical properties, compared for their efficacy in ameliorating fever in rats and their mechanism of action was elucidated. Aqueous fraction and methanol extract (AqDL and MeDL) were derived from the dried latex (DL) and proteins were separated from the fresh latex (LP). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis carried out under denaturing conditions showed the presence of proteins with some similarity in LP and AqDL and both of these fractions exhibited proteinase activity by gelatin zymography. A further analysis revealed that only the LP fraction possesses cysteine proteinase activity. Oral administration of both AqDL and MeDL produced a dose-dependent reduction in body temperature in rats where fever was induced by yeast and their effect was comparable to that of standard drug paracetamol while intravenous administration of LP was not so effective. Both AqDL and MeDL produced a significant reduction in the levels of TNF-alpha, PGE(2), and immunoreactivity of COX-2 in the hypothalamus as compared to yeast control group. This study shows that both AqDL and MeDL, the orally effective anti-inflammatory fractions of latex, have therapeutic potential in treating various febrile conditions.

KW  - subinternal limiting membrane hemorrhage
AB  - Purpose Retinal arteriolar macroaneurysms are a common cause of vision loss in elderly patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Their occurrence in the young, however, is not well known. The purpose of this article is to describe an unusual cause of retinal arteriolar macroaneurysm in a healthy young man.
   Case report A 30-year-old man presented with preretinal hemorrhage and macular exudation due to ruptured retinal artery macroaneurysm. The patient was treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and laser photocoagulation to the macroaneurysm. The exudation and preretinal hemorrhage resolved over several months. Fluorescein angiogram at this stage revealed a congenital anomalous retinal artery.
   Conclusions Congenital anomalous retinal artery may be associated with retinal artery macroaneurysm even in the young age in the absence of any other predisposing factors. The presentation and treatment of such retinal artery macroaneurysm, however, may remain the same to those that occur in older patients.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Background. Stones in the urinary tract are a common condition but there is paucity of data on their population based estimates in India. We describe our findings of the burden of urinary stones during a cross-sectional study with another primary goal.
   Methods. We conducted the study at Ballabgarh Health and Demographic Surveillance System, Haryana, among residents aged 18 years or above. We used simple random sampling to enrol participants. Self-reported history of urinary stones was elicited through an interview schedule.
   Results. of the descriptive analysis were described as proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or as mean wherever applicable. Bivariate analysis was done using t-test and chi-square test as applicable. Results. The response rate for our study was 86.6%; lifetime prevalence (95% CI) of urinary stones was 7.9% (5.7, 10.8). In a majority of participants, urinary stones were diagnosed at an age of 20-40 years (55.9%), mostly by an ultrasonography examination (94.1%).
   Conclusions. A high burden of urinary stones is indicated in the working-age population in northern India at the community level. Untreated urinary stones can lead to an acute emergency (colic) or may have long-term adverse consequences, e.g. hydronephrosis, which have implications for the healthcare delivery system.

KW  - AIRWAY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Giant encephalocele, a rare entity, makes anesthesiologists wary of challenging anesthetic course. Apart from inherent challenges of pediatric anesthesia, the anesthesiologist has to deal with unusual positioning, difficult tracheal intubation, and associated anomalies during the perioperative course.
   Materials and Methods: Medical records of 29 children with giant encephalocele, who underwent excision and repair, during a period of 13 years, were retrospectively analyzed. Data pertaining to anesthetic management, perioperative complications, and outcome at discharge were reviewed.
   Results: The average age at admission was 164 days. Hydrocephalus and delayed milestones were present in 19 (65.5%) and 7 (24.1%) children, respectively. Difficulty in tracheal intubation was encountered, in 15 (51.7%) children. Tracheal intubation was attempted with direct laryngoscopy, most often, in lateral position (24 [82.8%]). Intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory complications were observed in 9 (31.0%) and 5 (17.2%) children, respectively. Intraoperative hypothermia was observed in 4 (13.8%) children. The average stay in the intensive care unit was 2.7 days and average hospital stay was 11.5 days. The condition at discharge remained same as the preoperative period in 24 children (82.7%), deteriorated in 2 (6.9%), and 3 children (10.3%) died.
   Conclusions: Management of children with giant encephalocele requires the updated knowledge on possible difficulties encountered during the perioperative period. They need specialized anesthetic care for dealing with difficult tracheal intubation, associated congenital anomalies, unusual positioning, electrolyte abnormalities, hypothermia, and cardiorespiratory disturbances. For securing the airway, we suggest the practice of direct laryngoscopy in lateral position after inhalational induction. Muscle relaxant should be administered only after visualization of the glottis.

AB  - Delineating the factors leading to the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) during natural HIV-1 infection and dissecting their epitope specificities generates useful information for vaccine design. This is the first longitudinal study to assess the plasma-neutralizing antibody response and neutralizing determinants in HIV-1-infected children from India. We enrolled 26 and followed up 20 antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, asymptomatic, chronic HIV-1-infected children. Five (19.2 %) baseline and 10 (50 %) follow-up plasma samples neutralized >= 50 % of subtypes A, B and C tier 2 viruses at an ID50 titre >= 150. A modest improvement in neutralization breadth and potency was observed with time. At baseline, subtype C-specific neutralization predominated (P=0.026); interestingly, follow-up samples exhibited cross-neutralizing activity. Epitope mapping revealed V3C reactive antibodies with significantly increased Max(50) binding titres in follow-up samples from five infected children; patient #4's plasma antibodies exhibited V3-directed neutralization. A salient observation was the presence of CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-specific NAbs in patient #18 that improved with time (1.76-fold). The RSC3 wild-type (RSC3WT) protein-depleted plasma eluate of patient #18 demonstrated a more than 50% ID50 decrease in neutralization capacity against five HIV-1 pseudoviruses. Further, the presence of CD4bs-neutralizing determinants in patient #18's plasma was confirmed by the neutralizing activity demonstrated by the CD4bs-directed IgG fraction purified from this plasma, and competition with sCD4 against JRFLgp120, identifying this paediatric donor as a potential candidate for the isolation of CD4bs-directed bnAbs. Overall, we observed a relative increase in plasma-neutralizing activity with time in HIV-1-infected children, which suggests that the bnAbs evolve.

AB  - Craniopharyngiomas (CP) are rare benign epithelial tumors, with two histological variants, namely the adamantinomatous variant (ACP) and the rarer papillary variant (PCP). They are locally infiltrative and surgically challenging tumors with severe long term morbidity. CTNNB1 mutations with beta-catenin immunopositivity and BRAFV600E mutations with anti-VE immunopositivity have been recently described in ACPs and PCPs respectively. We aimed to study BRAF and CTNNB1 gene mutations in CPs operated at our institute, and correlate it with clinicopathological parameters including histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for proteins VE-1 and beta-catenin. A total of 54 CPs diagnosed over 3-year duration were included. IHC for beta-catenin and VE-1 proteins, and Sanger sequencing for CTNNB1 (exon 3) and BRAF (exon 15) genes were performed. CTNNB1 mutations were identified in 63% (27/43) of ACPs while nuclear immunopositivity for beta-catenin was observed in 79% (34/43) of them. Seven ACPs showed beta-catenin immunopositivity in the absence of mutations. BRAFV600E (p.Val600Glu) mutations were observed in 57% of PCPs (4/7), while cytoplasmic immunopositivity for anti-VE1 antibody was observed only in 43% of PCPs (3/7), all of which also harboured BRAFV600E mutations. The mutations and IHC staining patterns of ACPs and PCPs were non-overlapping. Four cases with uncertain histological pattern could be subcategorised into specific variants only following mutation analysis/IHC. The identification of hallmark molecular signatures in the two CP variants holds promise for alternate improved treatment modalities, emphasizing the need for sub-categorization in routine histopathology reporting. IHC for beta-catenin and targeted sequencing for BRAFV600E serve as useful adjuncts.

AB  - To identify novel coding association signals and facilitate characterization of mechanisms influencing glycemic traits and type 2 diabetes risk, we analyzed 109,215 variants derived from exome array genotyping together with an additional 390,225 variants from exome sequence in up to 39,339 normoglycemic individuals from five ancestry groups. We identified a novel association between the coding variant (p.Pro50Thr) in AKT2 and fasting plasma insulin (FI), a gene in which rare fully penetrant mutations are causal for monogenic glycemic disorders. The low-frequency allele is associated with a 12% increase in FI levels. This variant is present at 1.1% frequency in Finns but virtually absent in individuals from other ancestries. Carriers of the FI-increasing allele had increased 2-h insulin values, decreased insulin sensitivity, and increased risk of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio 1.05). In cellular studies, the AKT2-Thr50 protein exhibited a partial loss of function. We extend the allelic spectrum for coding variants in AKT2 associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and demonstrate bidirectional effects of variants within the pleckstrin homology domain of AKT2.

AB  - Sterile pyuria is a highly prevalent condition with a wide aetiological spectrum, which often challenges the diagnostician. We describe the case of a middle-aged female admitted to the medical Intensive Care Unit for acute gastroenteritis, whose urinalysis revealed persistent sterile pyuria. Polymerase chain reaction assay in urine was positive for Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma hominis. She responded to antimicrobial therapy. We hereby reflect on the approach to a case of sterile pyuria and review the available literature on this entity.

AB  - Introduction: Prehospital notification of injured patients enables prompt and timely care in hospital through adequate preparation of trauma teams, space, equipment and consumables necessary for resuscitation, and may improve outcomes. In India, anecdotal reports suggest that prehospital notification, in those few places where it occurs, is unstructured and not linked to a well-defined hospital response. The aim of this manuscript is to describe, in detail, a study protocol for the evaluation of a formalised approach to prehospital notification.
   Methods and analysis: This is a longitudinal prospective cohort study of injured patients being transported by ambulance to major trauma centres in India. In the preintervention phase, prospective data on patients will be collected on prehospital assessment, notification, inhospital assessment, management and outcomes and recorded in a new tailored multihospital trauma registry. All injured patients arriving by ambulance and allocated to a red or yellow priority category will be eligible for inclusion. The intervention will be a prehospital notification application to be used by ambulance clinicians to notify emergency departments of the impending arrival of a patient. The proportion of eligible patients arriving to hospital after notification will be the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes evaluated will be availability of a trauma cubicle, presence of a trauma team on patient arrival, time to first chest X-ray and inhospital mortality.
   Progress: Ethical approval has been obtained from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and site-specific approval granted by relevant trauma services. The trial has also been registered with the Monash University Human Research and Ethics Committee; Project number: CF16/1814 - 2016000929. Results will be fed back to prehospital and hospital clinicians via a series of reports and presentations. These will be used to facilitate discussions about service redesign and implementation. It is expected that evidence for improved outcomes will enable widespread adoption of this intervention among centres in all settings with less established tools for prehospital assessment and notification.

AB  - The relation between dietary intake and metabolic profile in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was evaluated. Patients with NSCLC were recruited and their caloric requirement and resting energy expenditure (REE) were calculated using the Harris-Benedict equationand Katch-McArdle formula respectively. Hypermetabolic state was defined as REE more than 10% above the basal metabolic rate (BMR). Body composition parameters were calculated by bioelectric impedance method. The 24-h dietary intake method and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool assessed nutritional intake. One hundred and forty-eight subjects were included (87% males). Of these, 46.6% subjects were hypermetabolic and 31% cachexic, with lower calorie and protein intakes than recommended, although per cent of total energy derived from protein, fat and carbohydrates were similar. Hypermetabolic patients had lower BMI, though the per cent deficit in energy and protein consumption was similar. Cachexia was associated with lower BMR but not with deficit in energy or protein consumption. No correlation was seen between dietary intake and body composition parameters. The calorie and protein intake of NSCLC patients is lower than recommended. The discordance between elevated REE and dietary intake implies that the relationship between increased energy demands and food intake may be altered.

AB  - Back ground: Glandular cardiac myxoma has varying clinical presentation with uncertain histogenesis and debatable immunohistochemical profile. Glandular epithelial differentiations are rare phenomenon known to be present as an intrinsic component of the tumor. The origin of the glands has been attributed to epithelial differentiation of a totipotent cardiomyogenic precursor cells or the entrapped foregut rests in the tumor. Materials and Methods: Retrospective study includes six cases of glandular cardiac myxoma collected over a perior of 4 years. Sections were examined to define the histogenesis, histological and immunohistochemical profile of the glandular elements. Results: Incidence of glandular cardiac myxoma was 6.6% with a male to female ratio of 1:2. Mean age was 49.9 years. Left atrium was the commonest site. Five were sporadic and one was familial. Chest pain and dyspnea were the commonest clinical symptoms. Histologically all myxoma showed well formed glandular structures with typical myxomatous area. No atypia, mitosis or necrosis was identified in the glandular elements. Markers in six cases of glandular cardiac myxoma were immunopositive for CK7, CK 19, EMA, CEA, focally for E-cadherin while immunonegative for CK20, Chromogranin, Synaptophysin, calretenin, vimentin, B-catenin, TTF-1 and GCDFP-15 favoring enteric differentiation. Conclusion: Glandular cardiac myxoma is a rare entity which shows characteristics similar to those of classical cardiac myxoma with benign glandular elements showing enteric differentiation. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice with good prognosis. It is important to recognize this entity to avoid an erroneous diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma.

AB  - A cross-sectional examination was conducted on quality of life (QOL) among women living with HIV (WLWH) in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. Baseline data were collected from 400 WLWH and their children. QOL was measured with 10 items from the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Findings revealed low QOL scores; on a scale from 0 to 3, the mean QOL score was 0.38 (SD = 0.30). Depression symptoms were reported by 25.5%, internalized stigma was high, and most reported little to no social support. Multivariable analysis revealed positive associations between QOL and CD4+ T cells (b = .0011, p = .021) and social support (b = .260, p < .0001), and a negative relationship between QOL and internalized stigma (b = -.232, p < .0001). Interventions focused on improving QOL for WLWH should incorporate strategies to improve social support and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, while mitigating internalized stigma.

AB  - We systematically reviewed the role of bronchial artery embolization (BAE) in hemoptysis. Literature search was done for studies on BAE published between 1976 and 2016. Twenty-two studies published in English, with sample size of at least 50 patients, reporting indications, technique, efficacy, and follow-up were included in the final analysis. Common indications for BAE included tuberculosis (TB), post-tubercular sequelae, bronchiectasis, and aspergillomas. Most common embolizing agent used was polyvinyl alcohol (size, 300-600 mu m) with increasing use of glue in recent years. Overall immediate clinical success rate of BAE, defined as complete cessation of hemoptysis, varied from 70%-99%. However, recurrence rate remains high, ranging from 10%-57%, due to incomplete initial embolization, recanalization of previously embolized arteries, and recruitment of new collaterals. Presence of nonbronchial systemic collaterals, bronchopulmonary shunting, aspergillomas, reactivation TB, and multidrug resistant TB were associated with significantly higher recurrence rates (P < 0.05). Rate of major complications remained negligible and stable over time with median incidence of 0.1% (0%-6.6%). Despite high hemoptysis recurrence rates, BAE continues to be the first-line, minimally invasive treatment of hemoptysis in emergency settings, surgically unfit patients, or in patients with diffuse or bilateral lung disease.

AB  - Background & objectives: Evidence-based planning has been the cornerstone of India's response to HIV/AIDS. Here we describe the process, method and tools used for generating the 2015 HIV estimates and provide a summary of the main results.
   Methods: Spectrum software supported by the UNAIDS was used to produce HIV estimates for India as a whole and its States/Union Territories. This tool takes into consideration the size and HIV prevalence of defined population groups and programme data to estimate HIV prevalence, incidence and mortality over time as well as treatment needs.
   Results: India's national adult prevalence of HIV was 0.26 per cent in 2015. Of the 2.1 million people living with HIV/AIDS, the largest numbers were in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka. New HIV infections were an estimated 86,000 in 2015, reflecting a decline by around 32 per cent from 2007. The declining trend in incidence was mirrored in most States, though an increasing trend was detected in Assam, Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Sikkim, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh. AIDS-related deaths were estimated to be 67,600 in 2015, reflecting a 54 per cent decline from 2007. There were variations in the rate and trend of decline across India for this indicator also.
   Interpretation & conclusions: While key indicators measured through Spectrum modelling confirm success of the National AIDS Control Programme, there is no room for complacency as rising incidence trends in some geographical areas and population pockets remain the cause of concern. Progress achieved so far in responding to HIV/AIDS needs to be sustained to end the HIV epidemic.

AB  - FDG-PET/CT is an integral part of modern-day practice of medicine. By detecting increased cellular metabolism, FDG-PET/CT can help us detect infection, inflammatory disorders, or tumors, and also help us in prognostication of patients. However, one of the most important challenges is to correctly differentiate the abnormal uptake that is potentially pathologic from the physiological uptake. So while interpreting a PET/CT, one must be aware of normal biodistribution and different physiological variants of FDG uptake.
   Skeletal muscles constitute a large part of our body mass and one of the major users of glucose. Naturally, they are often the site of increased FDG uptake in a PET study. We as a nuclear medicine physician must be aware of all the pitfalls of increased skeletal muscle uptake to differentiate between physiological and pathologic causes. In this review, we have discussed the different causes and patterns of physiological FDG uptake in skeletal muscles. This knowledge of normal physiological variants of FDG uptake in the skeletal muscles is essential for differentiating pathologic uptake from the physiological ones. Also, we reviewed the role of FDG-PET/CT in various benign and malignant diseases involving skeletal muscle. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institute medical records of PAC treated during 2007-2014 were retrieved. Demographics, treatment, and outcome in patients who were intended to receive adjuvant chemoradiation after curative resection were analyzed. Patients received first cycle chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil folinic acid/capecitabine, followed by external radiotherapy 45 Gy/ 25 fractions/5weeks and second and third cycle concurrent chemotherapy. Fourth and fifth cycle chemotherapy were administered after radiotherapy). Various prognostic factors, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were evaluated. Median age was 50 years. 96.9% patients completed the intended course of radiation and overall adherence to chemotherapy was 86.2%. Median follow-up and DFS were 20 and 29.64 months, respectively (range: 1.9-97.3 months). Estimated 1-, 2-, 5-year DFS was 77.8%, 59.3%, and 37.6%, respectively. One-year estimated OS was 92.7%. Median DFS for node-negative and node-positive patients was 88.6 and 24.33 months (P = 0.06). Grade >= III hematological toxicity was 20%. CONCLUSION: Positive node indicated a trend toward poor survival. The study highlights high compliance to multimodal management of PAC with acceptable toxicity in and out of clinical trial setting in a tertiary cancer center in India.

AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) causes microcephaly in congenital infection, neurological disorders, and poor pregnancy outcome and no vaccine is available for use in humans or approved. Although ZIKV was first discovered in 1947, the exact mechanism of virus replication and pathogenesis remains unknown. Recent outbreaks of Zika virus in the Americas clearly suggest a human-mosquito cycle or urban cycle of transmission. Understanding the conserved and adaptive features in the evolution of ZIKV genome will provide a hint on the mechanism of ZIKV adaptation to a new cycle of transmission. Here, we show comprehensive analysis of protein evolution of ZIKV strains including the current 2015-16 outbreak. To identify the constraints on ZIKV evolution, selection pressure at individual codons, immune epitopes and co-evolving sites were analyzed. Phylogenetic trees show that the ZIKV strains of the Asian genotype form distinct cluster and share a common ancestor with African genotype. The TMRCA (Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor) for the Asian lineage and the subsequently evolved Asian human strains was calculated at 88 and 34 years ago, respectively. The proteome of current 2015/16 epidemic ZIKV strains of Asian genotype was found to be genetically conserved due to genome-wide negative selection, with limited positive selection. We identified a total of 16 amino add substitutions in the epidemic and pre-epidemic strains from human, mosquito, and monkey hosts. Negatively selected amino acid sites of Envelope protein (E-protein) (positions 69, 166, and 174) and NS5 (292, 345, and 587) were located in central dimerization domains and C-terminal RNA-directed RNA polymerase regions, respectively. The predicted 137 (92 CD4 TCEs; 45 CD8 TCEs) immunogenic peptide chains comprising negatively selected amino acid sites can be considered as suitable target for sub-unit vaccine development, as these sites are less likely to generate immune-escape variants due to strong functional constrains operating on them. The targeted changes at the amino acid level may contribute to better adaptation of ZIKV strains to human-mosquito cycle or urban cycle of transmission. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TGCTs) arise from the synovium of joint, bursa, and tendon sheath, and are classified into localized and diffuse types. Diffused type often affects the large joint, and has more recurrence, metastasis, and malignant transformation potential compared to the localized type. Malignant diffused TGCT (D-TGCT) usually occurs as a large tumor (>5 cm), in older patients, and its histopathologic features include necrosis, cellular anaplasia, prominent nucleoli, high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, brisk mitosis, discohesion of tumor cells, paucity of giant cells, and a diffuse growth pattern. At least five of these criteria are required for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant TGCT because the benign TGCT also shares many of these morphological features. We describe the cytomorphologic features of a malignant D-TGCT from an unusual case of pulmonary metastasis in an adult patient. Fine needle aspiration cytologic features of malignant D-TGCT have not been described earlier in the English literature.

AB  - Background and objectives Despite being one of the leading risk factors of cardiovascular mortality, there are limited data on changes in hypertension burden and management from India. This study evaluates trend in the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in the urban and rural areas of India's National Capital Region (NCR).
   Design and setting Two representative cross-sectional surveys were conducted in urban and rural areas (survey 1 (1991-1994); survey 2 (2010-2012)) of NCR using similar methodologies.
   Participants A total of 3048 (mean age: 46.8 +/- 9.0 years; 52.3% women) and 2052 (mean age: 46.5 +/- 8.4 years; 54.2% women) subjects of urban areas and 2487 (mean age: 46.6 +/- 8.8 years; 57.0% women) and 1917 (mean age: 46.5 +/- 8.5 years; 51.3% women) subjects of rural areas were included in survey 1 and survey 2, respectively.
   Primary and secondary outcome measures Hypertension was defined as per Joint National Committee VII guidelines. Structured questionnaire was used to measure the awareness and treatment status of hypertension. A mean systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg was defined as control of hypertension among the participants with hypertension.
   Results The age and sex standardised prevalence of hypertension increased from 23.0% to 42.2% (p<0.001) and 11.2% to 28.9% (p<0.001) in urban and rural NCR, respectively. In both surveys, those with high education, alcohol use, obesity and high fasting blood glucose were at a higher risk for hypertension. However, the change in hypertension prevalence between the surveys was independent of these risk factors (adjusted OR (95% CI): urban (2.3 (2.0 to 2.7)) rural (3.1 (2.4 to 4.0))). Overall, there was no improvement in awareness, treatment and control rates of hypertension in the population.
   Conclusion There was marked increase in prevalence of hypertension over two decades with no improvement in management.

Based on the recent immunohistochemical study showing PSMA expression in adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder, we hypothesized that PSMA expression in adenocarcinoma of urinary bladder can be demonstrated in vivo using Ga-68-PSMA 11 PET/CT. We present a man with exstrophy bladder, presenting with adenocarcinoma urinary bladder referred for staging PET/CT. Both 18F-FDG and Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT were done, which showed PSMA expression in the primary tumor as well as metastatic lymph nodes.

AB  - Cataract is a cardinal manifestation of hypoparathyroidism. Although patients with hypoparathyroidism require cataract surgery at a younger age than individuals without hypoparathyroidism, there is limited information on the outcome of this surgery. We assessed long-term complications of cataract surgery in patients with idiopathic hypoparathyroidism (IH) and its relationship with their clinical and biochemical parameters. Twenty-seven patients with IH and 25 nonhypoparathyroid controls with a minimum follow-up of 2 years after cataract surgery were assessed for visual acuity, intraocular pressure, lens centricity, Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, and the severity of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) and anterior capsular opacification. High-resolution optical slit-lamp images were analyzed by an ophthalmologist. Patients with IH had cataract surgery at a younger age than controls (34.0 +/- A 16.4 years vs 58.0 +/- A 11.2 years, P < 0.001). A higher proportion of IH patients had dense white PCO (75.0 % vs 39.4 %, P = 0.004), Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy (44.2 % vs 10.0 %, P = 0.001), anterior capsular opacification (97.7 % vs 84.2 %, P = 0.03), and a decentric lens (28.3% vs 2.6 %, P = 0.001) at a comparable time after surgery (8.6 +/- A 6.1 years vs 8.7 +/- A 6.8 years, P = 0.85). On regression analysis, the severity of PCO in IH correlated only with male sex and not with other factors, including serum total calcium and inorganic phosphorus levels at the baseline and during follow-up. To conclude, patients with IH are likelier than individuals without IH to develop PCO and to require Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy after cataract surgery. Proper precautions should be taken during surgery to minimize this complication in IH.

AB  - A 19 year old female presented with painful postaural swelling of three years duration with preceding history of trauma. Clinically and radilogically the diagnosis of mastoid osteoma was made. As patient was symptomatic the osteoma was removed and cortical mastoidectomy was done. We emphasise that symptomatic mastoid osteomas must be treated early even if they are small in size to prevent the development of giant osteomas. The case is reported for its rarity with relevant review of literature. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report in which there is a definitive history of trauma preceding the development of osteoma suggesting its possible role as an inciting factor.

AB  - Background: FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations are considered to be the major determinants of the patient response to therapy and outcome. The primary aim of this study was to establish the correlation between these molecular mutations and the clinico-hematologic parameters as well as the prognostic outcome of the Indian acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Materials and Methods: This prospective study involved newly diagnosed nonpromyelocytic AML patients who had undergone complete diagnostic workup, including immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetics and molecular analysis for NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutation by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction at presentation. Results: Overall, the prevalence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations was found to be 14.4% and 10.8%, respectively. Among patients with normal karyotype, leukocytosis was significantly associated with NPM1+ group than the NPM1-group (P = 0.0019) and more severe degree of anemia was observed in the FLT3-ITD+ patients than the other groups (P = 0.025). No significant correlation was found in terms of age at presentation (P = 0.56), sex ratio (P = 0.467), median platelet count (P = 0.27), and blast percentage between NPM1+ and FLT3-ITD+ groups. Complete remission (CR) rates were better in the NPM1+/FLT3-ITD-group than the other three groups. Unlike most other studies, improved CR rates as well as disease-free survival were observed in the NPM-/FLT3-ITD-group than the FLT3-ITD+ groups although not reaching statistically significant levels. Conclusion: Some differences in the clinical behavior of the Indian AML patients in comparison to that of the West in the presence of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD suggests that comprehensive studies are required to confirm the definitive role of these mutations among AML patients, especially with normal karyotype.

Thirty-three children, aged 1 to 5 years, with infantile spasms were enrolled if pretreatment EEG records were available, after completion of 1 year of onset of spasms. Neurodevelopment was assessed by Development Profile 3 and Gross Motor Function Classification System. Epilepsy severity in the past 1 year was determined by the Early Childhood Epilepsy Severity Score (E-Chess). Kramer Global Score of hypsarrhythmia severity was computed. Kramer Global Score (8) and E-Chess (9) in the past 1 year were associated with favorable epilepsy outcome but not neurodevelopmental or motor outcome.

AB  - Aims: The MeRes-1 trial sought to study the safety and effectiveness of a novel sirohmus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (MeRes100 BRS) in treating de novo native coronary artery lesions by clinical evaluation and using multiple imaging modalities.
   Methods and results: The MeRes-1 first-in-human trial was a single-arm, prospective, multicentre study, which enrolled 108 patients with de novo coronary artery lesions (116 scaffolds were deployed to treat 116 lesions in 108 patients). At six mouths, quantitative coronary angiography revealed in-scaffold late lumen loss of 0.15 +/- 0.23 nun with 0% binary restenosis. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated minimum scaffold area (6.86 +/- 1.73 mm(2)) and percentage neointimal strut coverage (99.30%). Quantitative intravascular ultrasound analysis confirmed a 0.14 +/- 0.16 mm(2) neointimal hyperplasia area. At one year, major adverse cardiac events, a composite of cardiac death, any myocardial infarction and ischaemia-driven target lesion revascularisation, occurred in only one patient (0.93%) and there was no scaffold thrombosis reported. At one year, computed tomography angiography demonstrated that all scaffolds were patent and ill-scaffold mean percentage area stenosis was 11.33 +/- 26.57%.
   Conclusions: The MeRes-1 trial demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of MeRes100 BRS. The favourable clinical outcomes and effective vascular responses have provided the basis for further studies in a larger patient population. The MeRes-1 trial is registered at the Clinical Trials Registry-India.

AB  - Many cancers fail to respond to immunotherapy as a result of immune suppression by the tumor microenvironment. The exogenous expression of immune cytokines to reprogram the tumor microenvironment represents an approach to circumvent this suppression. The present studies describe the development of a novel dual nanoparticle (DNP) system for driving DNA expression vectors encoding inflammatory cytokines in tumor cells. The DNP system consists of a DNA expression vector-cationic peptide nanocomplex (NC) surrounded by a diblock polymeric NP. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) was selected as the prototype cytokine for this system, based on its pleotropic inflammatory and anti-cancer activities. Our results demonstrate that the DNP system is highly effective in driving expression of TNF in tumor cells. We also demonstrate that the DNPs are effective in inducing apoptosis and anti-tumor activity. These findings support a novel immunotherapeutic approach for the intratumoral delivery of DNA vectors that express inflammatory cytokines. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute kidney injury (AKI) is independently associated with new-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. However, only a minority of patients receive follow-up care after an episode of AKI in the developing world, and the optimal strategies to promote rehabilitation after AKI are ill-defined. On this background, a working group of the 18th Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative applied the consensus-building process informed by a PubMed review of English-language articles to address questions related to rehabilitation after AKI. The consensus statements propose that all patients should be offered follow-up within 3 months of an AKI episode, with more intense follow-up (e.g., < 1 month) considered based on patient risk factors, characteristics of the AKI event, and the degree of kidney recovery. Patients should be monitored for renal and nonrenal events post-AKI, and we suggest that the minimum level of monitoring consist of an assessment of kidney function and proteinuria within 3 months of the AKI episode. Care should be individualized for higher risk patients, particularly patients who are still dialysis dependent, to promote renal recovery. Although evidence-based treatments for survivors of AKI are lacking and some outcomes may not be modifiable, we recommend simple interventions such as lifestyle changes, medication reconciliation, blood pressure control, and education, including the documentation of AKI in the patient's medical record. In conclusion, survivors of AKI represent a high-risk population, and these consensus statements should provide clinicians with guidance on the care of patients after an episode of AKI.

TI  - Evaluation of the Role of Monocular Video Game Play as an Adjuvant to Occlusion Therapy in the Management of Anisometropic Amblyopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY & STRABISMUS
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the role of monocular video game play as an adjuvant to occlusion therapy in the treatment of anisometropic amblyopia.
   Methods: In a prospective randomized study design, 68 children with ages ranging from 6 to 14 years who had anisometropic amblyopia with a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the amblyopic eye of better than 6/36 and worse than 6/12 and no manifest strabismus were recruited. They were randomly allocated into two groups: 34 children received 1 hour per day of video game play for the first month plus 6 hours per day of occlusion therapy (video game and occlusion group) and 34 children received 6 hours per day of occlusion therapy alone (occlusion only group). Patients were then evaluated at baseline and 1 and 3 months after treatment for BCVA, stereoacuity, and contrast sensitivity.
   Results: In the video game and occlusion group, BCVA improved from 0.61 +/- 0.12 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) at baseline to 0.51 +/- 0.14 logMAR (P = .001) at 1 month and 0.40 +/- 0.15 logMAR (P =.001) at 3 months. In the occlusion only group, BCVA improved from 0.65 +/- 0.09 logMAR at baseline to 0.60 +/- 0.10 logMAR (P = .001) at 1 month and 0.48 +/- 0.10 logMAR (P = .001) at 3 months. There was significantly more improvement in the video game and occlusion group compared to the occlusion only group (P = .003 at 1 month and P = .027 at 3 months).
   Conclusions: Video game play plus occlusion therapy enhances the visual recovery in anisometropic amblyopia.

AB  - Intracerebral hemorrhage is the second most common cause of mortality (after infections) in acute leukemia and is responsible for approximately 20% of deaths due to acute leukemia. Management of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is mostly conservative but there exist certain patients who need emergent surgery due to the poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) despite their coagulopathic state.
   We present here two such cases which were successfully managed with decompressive craniectomy which was done as a damage control surgery thus stating the importance of surgical intervention in the management of acutely deteriorating patients rather than the commonly employed conservative management due to their coagulopathic state.

AB  - Introduction: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a thrombohemorrhagic disorder characterized by hyperactivation of coagulation and secondary fibrinolysis.
   Aim: The primary aim of this prospective study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of fibrin monomer (FM) and d-dimer (DD) for the preemptive diagnosis of DIC in the early stages.
   Materials and Methods: The patients were categorized into 3 groups: overt DIC, nonovert DIC, and non-DIC based on the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis scoring for overt DIC and the modified nonovert-DIC criteria. Coagulation tests were performed on freshly obtained plasma. Quantitative determination of FM and DD was done by immunoturbidimetric assay.
   Results: Median DD and FM levels in patients with overt DIC were significantly higher in comparison to the other 2 groups. Interestingly, unlike DD, the difference in FM levels was also found to be statistically significant between patients with nonovert DIC and non-DIC patients (P = .0001). At receiver-operator characteristic curve-generated cutoff values, FM had higher specificity and negative predictive value than DD for predicting onset of overt DIC. Multivariate analysis showed that only FM was as an independent predictive factor useful in differentiating patients with overt DIC from non-DIC patients (odds ratio [OR]: 43.3; confidence interval [CI] 4.61-406.68; P value = .001) as well as in distinguishing nonovert DIC from non-DIC patients (OR:18.3; CI 3.45-97.19; P value = .001).
   Conclusion: Fibrin monomer is a better indicator than DD in distinguishing patients with overt and nonovert DIC from non-DIC patients, raising the possibility for its diagnostic utility as a marker for impending overt DIC, aiding in early diagnosis and prompt therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Mephentermine is structurally related to amphetamines and is banned for its use as a performance-enhancing drug in competitive sports. Limited literature is available on management of mephentermine dependence. Here, we describe a case of mephentermine dependence followed by review of literature and a discussion about its management. A 20-year-old professional wrestler presented with high-dose intravenous mephentermine use, and rapid development of dependence, in the absence of any comorbid substance use or psychiatric disorder. The client showed improvement with bupropion and individual counseling sessions. The present report highlights the need to explore effective treatment options for individuals who have been addicted to mephentermine.

AB  - Studies of nephrotic syndrome show that substitution of calcineurin inhibitors by mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) enables sustained remission and corticosteroid sparing and avoids therapy associated adverse effects. However, controlled studies in patients with steroid resistance are lacking. Here we examined the effect of switching from therapy with tacrolimus to MMF on disease course in an open-label, one-to-one randomized, controlled trial on children (one to 18 years old), recently diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, at a referral center in India. Following six months of therapy with tacrolimus, patients with complete or partial remission were randomly assigned such that 29 received MMF while 31 received tacrolimus along with tapering prednisolone on alternate days for 12 months. On intention-to-treat analyses, the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (sustained remission, infrequent relapses) at one year was significantly lower (44.8%) in the MMF group than in the tacrolimus group (90.3%). The incidence of relapses was significantly higher for patients treated with MMF than tacrolimus (mean difference: 1.05 relapses per person-year). While there was no difference in the proportion of patients with sustained remission, the risk of recurrence of steroid resistance was significantly higher for patients receiving MMF compared to tacrolimus (mean difference: 20.7%). Compared to tacrolimus, patients receiving MMF had a significantly (71%) lower likelihood of a favorable outcome and significantly increased risk of treatment failure (frequent relapses, steroid resistance). Thus, replacing tacrolimus with MMF after six months of tacrolimus therapy for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in children is associated with significant risk of frequent relapses or recurrence of resistance. These findings have implications for guiding the duration of therapy with tacrolimus for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Background & objectives: Antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhoea, is a subject of worldwide attention. The present study was undertaken to examine the rates of ciprofloxacin resistance, to correlate mutations in gyrA and parC genes with the level of resistance and to look for a variation in mutation pattern, if any, in isolates from across the country.
   Methods: A total of 113 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae collected from sexually transmitted infection patients in six centres during November 2010 to October 2013 were investigated. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination was done by E-test and results interpreted as per Calibrated Dichotomous Sensitivity criteria. DNA sequence analysis of gyrA and parC genes was done.
   Results: Of the 113 isolates, only three (2.6%) were susceptible whereas eight (7.07%) were less susceptible, 32 [28.3%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 20.4-37.6%] resistant (MIC 1-3 mu g/ml) and 70 (61.9%, 95% CI: 52.2-70.7%) exhibited high-level resistance (HLR) (MIC = 4 mu g/ml) to ciprofloxacin. A S91F substitution in gyrA gene was demonstrated in all ciprofloxacin non-susceptible isolates. All resistant and HLR isolates had a double mutation in gyrA gene. However, only 5.7 per cent of HLR isolates showed double mutations in parC gene. One isolate (MIC 32 mu g/ml) had a previously undescribed G85D substitution in the parC gene.
   Interpretation & conclusions: A S91F substitution in gyrA gene was seen in all non-susceptible isolates of N. gonorrhoeae. It may be used as a marker for ciprofloxacin resistance for molecular surveillance approaches to complement the culture-based methods.

   MethodsA retrospective review of medical records of all patients (n=146) who underwent resection of a SubAM for discrete subaortic stenosis between 1990 and 2015 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India was undertaken.
   ResultsMedian age at surgery was 9.0 years (9 months-47 years). There was one early death. Preoperative peak left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) Doppler gradient was 83.426.2 mmHg (range: 34-169 mmHg). On preoperative echocardiography, aortic regurgitation (AR) was absent in 69 (47.3%), mild in 35 (24%), moderate in 30 (20.5%), and severe in 12 (8.2%). After surgery, the LVOT gradient was reduced to 15.1 +/- 6.2mmHg (P<0.001). Fourteen patients (9.6%) who had residual/recurrent significant gradients are currently being followed-up or awaiting surgery. There was improvement in AR for operated patients with freedom from AR of 92.6 +/- 0.03% at 15 years. Kaplan-Meier survival at 25 years was 93.0 +/- 3.9% (95% confidence interval: 79.6, 97.7). Freedom from re-operation at 25 years was 96.9 +/- 1.8%.
   ConclusionsLong-term results of surgery for discrete SubAM are good. Resection of the membrane along with septal myectomy decreases the risk of recurrence.

AB  - Purpose: To report the unique clinical and surgical characteristics encountered in eyes with vitreous amyloidosis. Systemic evaluation and visual outcome after vitrectomy are discussed. A novel mutation in the transthyretin gene (TTR) in Indian patients with familial amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) is described.
   Design: Retrospective, observational study.
   Participants: Ten eyes of 5 patients from 2 pedigrees with a diagnosis of vitreous amyloidosis.
   Methods: Detailed history, pedigree charting, systemic and ocular examination of 10 eyes (5 patients from 2 pedigrees) were carried out. Tests were performed to rule out vitreitis, retinal vasculitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and systemic amyloidosis. Genetic analysis to identify the mutation was performed in 1 patient. Vitreous biopsy, followed by 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy, was performed in the same sitting in all cases. Samples were sent for Congo red staining and polarized microscopy. Patients were followed up on days 1, 7, and 28 and then every 2 months. Visual acuity assessment, intraocular pressure measurement, and fundus examination were performed each time.
   Main Outcome Measures: Mutations in TTR and postoperative visual acuity.
   Results: Mean age at presentation was 32 years, with a 3: 2 male-to-female distribution. Family history was positive in all patients. Nine eyes had pseudopodia lentis, whereas all 10 had glass wool-like vitreous. Glaucoma developed in 1 patient (2 eyes). Waxy paper-like vitreous with firm vitreous adhesions beyond major arcades and along retinal vessels was noted during surgery in all eyes. Congo red staining and apple green birefringence demonstrated vitreous amyloidosis. The mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 1.39 +/- 0.64 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), whereas the postoperative BCVA improved to 0.17 +/- 0.07 logMAR (P = 0.004). Gene sequencing revealed a phenylalanine/isoleucine mutation in the 33rd position of exon 2 of TTR in 1 patient of 1 pedigree, confirming the diagnosis of FAP. Two patients subsequently were found to have sensorimotor autonomic neuropathy, whereas 2 others had subclinical autonomic dysfunction.
   Conclusions: The clinical clues, management strategy, surgical characteristics, vitrectomy outcomes, and significance of systemic evaluation in vitreous amyloidosis are highlighted. A novel single mutation (Phe33Ile) in a case of FAP with vitreous amyloidosis from India is reported. (C) 2017 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology

AB  - Background & objectives: Accurate histopathological subtyping of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is essential for targeted therapeutic agents. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is helpful in identification of different tumour subtypes. In this study two marker approaches, one each for glandular and squamous cell differentiation was applied to maximize the proportion of accurately subtyped NSCLC not otherwise specified (NOS) tumours on small biopsy samples.
   Methods: Two hundred and sixty three consecutive lung biopsies of primary lung carcinoma were prospectively studied. These were subtyped first morphologically and then by IHC for p40 and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). The diagnosis of NSCLC-NOS before and after addition of IHC was evaluated. Results were correlated and validated with morphologically proven cases and matched surgical specimens.
   Results: Based on morphology, only 140 of the 263 (53.2%) cases of NSCLC were characterized, whereas 123 (46.7%) were classified as NSCLC-NOS type. With addition of IHC (p40 and TTF-1), the latter category reduced to 14.4 per cent and a sum of 225 (85.5%) cases were accurately subtyped into squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma. p40 showed 100 per cent sensitivity and specificity for squamous differentiation whereas TTF-1 showed sensitivity of 85.3 per cent and specificity of 98.1 per cent. Ninety per cent correlation of morphologic subtypes was achieved with matched resected specimens.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that an approach of using only a two-antibody panel (p40 and TTF-1) might help in reduction of diagnostic category of NSCLC-NOS significantly and contribute in saving tissue for future molecular testing.

AB  - Objective: Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive organ-specific autoimmunity. There is scant information on APS1 in ethnic groups other than European Caucasians. We studied clinical aspects and autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutations in a cohort of Indian APS1 patients. Design: Twenty-three patients (19 families) from six referral centres in India, diagnosed between 1996 and 2016, were followed for [median (range)] 4 (0.2-19) years.
   Methods: Clinical features, mortality, organ-specific autoantibodies and AIRE gene mutations were studied.
   Results: Patients varied widely in their age of presentation [3.5 (0.1-17) years] and number of clinical manifestations [5 (2-11)]. Despite genetic heterogeneity, the frequencies of the major APS1 components (mucocutaneous candidiasis: 96%; hypoparathyroidism: 91%; primary adrenal insufficiency: 55%) were similar to reports in European series. In contrast, primary hypothyroidism (23%) occurred more frequently and at an early age, while kerato-conjunctivitis, urticarial rash and autoimmune hepatitis were uncommon (9% each). Six (26%) patients died at a young age [5.8 (3-23) years] due to septicaemia, hepatic failure and adrenal/hypocalcaemic crisis from non-compliance/unexplained cause. Interferon-a and/or interleukin-22 antibodies were elevated in all 19 patients tested, including an asymptomatic infant. Eleven AIRE mutations were detected, the most common being p.C322fsX372 (haplotype frequency 37%). Four mutations were novel, while six others were previously described in European Caucasians.
   Conclusions: Indian APS1 patients exhibited considerable genetic heterogeneity and had highly variable clinical features. While the frequency of major manifestations was similar to that of European Caucasians, other features showed significant differences. A high mortality at a young age was observed.

AB  - Background: Inflammation remains a crucial factor for progression of cardiac diseases and cardiac hypertrophy remains an important cause of cardiac failure over all age groups. As a key regulator of inflammation, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in pathogenesis of cardiac diseases. Being an important regulator of innate immunity, the precise pathway of TLR4-mediated cardiac complications is yet to be established. Therefore, the primary objective of the present study was to find the role of TLR4 in cardiac hypertrophy and the molecular mechanism thereof.
   Methods: Cardiac hypertrophy was induced with administration of isoproterenol (5 mg/kg/day, sc).TLR4 receptor inhibitor RS-LPS (lipopolysaccharide from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides; 5 mu g/day) and agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (from Escherichia coli; 3.12 mu g/day) were administered through osmotic pump along with isoproterenol. Cardiac hypertrophy as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial parameters were evaluated.
   Results: Cardiac hypertrophy was confirmed with increased heart weight/body weight ratio as well as assessment of hypertrophic markers in heart. There was a marked increase in the TLR4 expression and oxidative stress along with mitochondrial dysfunction in ISO group. TLR4 inhibition significantly decreased heart weight/body weight ratio and ANP, collagen, and beta-MHC expression and restored the disturbed cellular antioxidant flux. The mitochondrial perturbations that were observed in hypertrophy heart was normalized after administration of TLR4 inhibitor but not with the agonist. TLR4 agonism further exaggerated the oxidative stress in heart and hence accelerated the disease development and progression.
   Conclusion: Our data show that increased TLR4 ligand pool in cardiac hypertrophy may exaggerate the disease progression. However, inhibition of TLR4 attenuated cardiac hypertrophy through reduced cardiac redox imbalance and mitochondrial dysfunction.

AB  - The black turtle bean (BTB) is most widely consumed legume all over the world having anticancer activity. The aim of the study was to analyse the apoptotic effects of BTB extracts on human breast cancer cell lines. Plant extract was prepared by homogenization and centrifugation. The cytotoxic effects of BTB was evaluated by MTT assay and their apoptotic effects were characterized by DNA fragmentation, nuclear staining assay, mitochondrial membrane potential analysis, annexin-V FITC and caspase 3/7 activity assay. The changes in cell cycle and gene expression of cell lines were analysed by flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. BTB extract showed cytotoxicity with -IC50 values of 50 mu g/ml in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells. The caspase 3/7 was activated in the cancer cells treated with BTB extract leading to cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, there was significant increase in the expression of Bax as well as decrease in the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression with in a dose dependent manner in both cells. It induces cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M phase in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 cells, respectively. The mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased in BTB treated cells thereby transducing the apoptotic signal through the mitochondrial pathway and it also causes DNA fragmentation. Thus, it can be concluded that BTB induces the apoptosis in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells through intrinsic and extrinsic pathway and can be explored further for promising candidate to combat breast cancer. BTB extract exhibit anti-cancer activity by inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate ocular surface changes and its correlation with the central corneal subbasal nerve fibre layer in chronic glaucoma patients.
   METHODS: A prospective comparative study of ocular surface evaluation was performed in 50 eyes of 25 patients using two or more antiglaucoma medications for at least 6mo and 50 eyes of 25 normal subjects without any ocular problems as controls. The study parameters evaluated included visual acuity, intraocular pressure, ocular surface evaluation parameters [fluorescein break-up time (FTBUT), Schirmer's I test, ocular surface staining scores and ocular surface disease index score (OSDI)], central corneal sensation (Cochet Bonnett aesthesiometer), central subbasal nerve fiber layer density (SBNFLD) by confocal microscopy.
   RESULTS: The mean values in the glaucoma cases and control groups respectively were as follows: OSDI score (35.89 +/- 16.07/6.02 +/- 3.84; P=0.001), Schirmer's I test score (7.63 +/- 2.64 mm/12.86 +/- 1.93 mm; P=0.001), FTBUT (9.44 +/- 2.76s/11.8 +/- 1.88s; P=0.001), corneal (5.7 +/- 2.33/ 1.1 +/- 0.58; P=0.001) and conjunctival staining score (5.06 +/- 1.94/0.84 +/- 0.46; P=0.001), corneal sensitivity (4.68 +/- 0.44/5.07 +/- 0.37; P=0.076), mean subbasal nerve fiber number (3.58 +/- 0.99/5.40 +/- 1.70; P=0.001), SBNFL length (1101.44 +/- 287.56 mu m/1963.70 +/- 562.56 mu m; P=0.001) and density (6883.94 +/- 1798.03 mu m/mm(2)/12 273.15 +/- 3516.04 mu m/mm(2); P=0.001). Dry eye severity of level 2 and 3 was seen in 66% of glaucoma group. Corneal (R-2=0.86) and conjunctival staining (R-2=0.71) and OSDI score (R-2=0.67) showed statistically significant negative correlation with central corneal SBNFLD while FTBUT (R-2=0.84), corneal sensitivity (R-2=0.52) showed positive correlation to central corneal SBNFLD in the long term topical antiglaucoma medication group.
   CONCLUSION: Ocular surface changes and antiglaucoma therapy induced dry eye is found to be associated with decreased SBNFLD in eyes on long term topical antiglaucoma medications.

AB  - Background: Rotavirus remains the leading cause of diarrhoea among children <5 years. We assessed immunogenic non-inferiority of a tetravalent bovine-human reassortant rotavirus vaccine (BRV-TV) over the licensed human-bovine pentavalent rotavirus vaccine RV5.
   Methods: Phase III single-blind study (parents blinded) in healthy infants randomized (1:1) to receive three doses of BRV-TV or RV5 at 6-8,10-12, and 14-16 weeks of age. All concomitantly received a licensed diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine (DTwP-HepB-Hib) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). Immunogenic non-inferiority was evaluated in terms of the inter-group difference in anti-rotavirus serum IgA seroresponse (primary endpoint), and seroprotection/seroresponse rates to DTwP-HepB-Hib and OPV vaccines. Seroresponse was defined as a >= 4-fold increase in titers from baseline to D28 post-dose 3. Non-inferiority was declared if the difference between groups (based on the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI]) was above -10%. Each subject was evaluated for solicited adverse events 7 days and unsolicited & serious adverse events 28 days following each dose of vaccination.
   Results: Of 1195 infants screened, 1182 were randomized (590 to BRV-TV; 592 to RV5). Non-inferiority for rotavirus serum IgA seroresponse was not established: BRV-TV, 47.1% (95%CI: 42.8; 51.5) versus RV5, 61.2% (95%CI: 56.8; 65.5); difference between groups, -14.08% (95%CI: -20.4; -7.98). Serum IgA geometric mean concentrations at D28 post-dose 3 were 28.4 and 50.1 U/ml in BRV-TV and RV5 groups, respectively. For all DTwP-HepB-Hib and OPV antigens, seroprotection/seroresponse was elicited in both groups and the 10% non-inferiority criterion between groups was met. There were 16 serious adverse events, 10 in BRV-TV group and 6 in RV5 group; none were classified as vaccine related. Both groups had similar vaccine safety profiles.
   Conclusion: BRV-TV was immunogenic but did not meet immunogenic non-inferiority criteria to RV5 when administered concomitantly with routine pediatric antigens in infants. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) is a Gram-negative, coccobacilli aerobic pathogen which causes nosocomial infections in hospitals worldwide. A. baumannii has been identified as one of the six important and highly drug resistant hospital pathogens by the "Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)"(Talbot et al., 2006; Boucher et al., 2009). A. baumannii rapidly acquired antibiotic resistance, leading to wide-spread multidrug-resistant isolates, which are impervious to nearly all antibiotic treatments (Fournier et al., 2006; Vashist and Rajeswari, 2006; Perez et al., 2007; Rocaet al., 2012). Therefore, dissection of the molecular details at gene level of A. baumannii biology is urgently needed which can greatly help in our understanding of the resistance mechanisms that are evolved by the pathogen. Recently, some efforts were made to understand the relation between junk DNA, mutation frequencies with respect to antibiotic resistance in bacteria (Martinez and Baquero, 2000; Gil and Latorre, 2012) and in A. baumannii (Tiwari et al., 2012). However, very little is known about the role of specific virulence factors and cellular processes that are associated with the development of resistance in A. baumannii. A small fraction of genomic DNA is known to adopt non-canonical B-DNA (unusual) structures, and can cause genomic instability. This fact is well known in eukaryotes, however, is also suggested that it can apply in bacteria also (Mart-nLozano et al., 2002). In this connection, the purine repeat sequences attract special attention due to their high ability to convert the double stranded DNA structures to triple stranded DNA structures. The poly(purine) tracts by forming DNA triplex structures are prone to induce mutations as well as interventions in various cellular processes including replication, transcription etc. (Wells, 2008; Singh and Rajeswari, 2015). Therefore, it is interesting to look at the genes containing purine repeats in bacterial infection and in resistance and as an example, we performed a systematic search in susceptible and drug resistant strains of A. baumannii for exclusively poly(purines).
   It is important to mention that the DNA triplex was first proposed by Pauling and Corey (1953) which was later proved to exist in solution by Felsenfeld et al. (1957). DNA-triplex structure, as the name suggests, is formed between three strands of DNA, the third strand forms Hoogsteen basepairs with that strand which is rich in purines; while the Watson-Crick basepairs remains intact. DNA triplexes could be of either intra-molecular where the third strand is part of the DNA or intermolecular if the third strand is from external DNA. Further, DNA-triplex is known as "Purinemotif (R)"if the third strand is rich in purines, alternately it is called "Pyrimidine motif (Y)"where the third strand contains largely pyrimidines (Lyamichev et al., 1986; Frank-Kamenetskii and Mirkin, 1995; Rajeswari, 2012; Dyke, 2013).
   It has been reported that purine repeats have potential to form DNA-triplex which can induce mutation and/or genetic instability which can further influence DNA replication, repair and transcription in eukaryotes (Bacolla et al., 2004, 2006; Jain et al., 2008). Keeping in view of the above discussion on the importance of purine repeats in causing genomic instability via DNA-triplex formation, we investigated the whole genome of A. baumannii to see if there are any potential purine repeat sequences which can form intra-molecular DNA triplex in causing drug resistance.

AB  - Prolonged treatment of tuberculosis (TB) often leads to poor compliance, default and relapse, converting primary TB patients into category II TB (Cat IITB) cases, many of whom may convert to multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). We have evaluated the immunotherapeutic potential of Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP) as an adjunct to Anti-Tubercular Treatment (ATT) in Cat II pulmonary TB (PTB) patients in a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentric clinical trial. 890 sputum smear positive Cat II PTB patients were randomized to receive either six intra-dermal injections (2 + 4) of heat-killed MIP at a dose of 5 x 10(8) bacilli or placebo once in 2 weeks for 2 months. Sputum smear and culture examinations were performed at different time points. MIP was safe with no adverse effects. While sputum smear conversion did not show any statistically significant difference, significantly higher number of patients (67.1%) in the MIP group achieved sputum culture conversion at fourth week compared to the placebo (57%) group (p = 0.0002), suggesting a role of MIP in clearance of the bacilli. Since live bacteria are the major contributors for sustained incidence of TB, the potential of MIP in clearance of the bacilli has far reaching implications in controlling the spread of the disease.

AB  - Nutritional modulation remains central to the management of metabolic syndrome. Intervention with cinnamon in individuals with metabolic syndrome remains sparsely researched.
   Methods: We investigated the effect of oral cinnamon consumption on body composition and metabolic parameters of Asian Indians with metabolic syndrome. In this 16-week double blind randomized control trial, 116 individuals with metabolic syndrome were randomized to two dietary intervention groups, cinnamon [6 capsules (3 g) daily] or wheat flour [6 capsules (2.5 g) daily]. Body composition, blood pressure and metabolic parameters were assessed.
   Results: Significantly greater decrease [difference between means, (95% CI)] in fasting blood glucose (mmol/L) [0.3 (0.2, 0.5) p = 0.001], glycosylated haemoglobin (mmol/mol) [2.6 (0.4, 4.9) p = 0.023], waist circumference (cm) [4.8 (1.9, 7.7) p = 0.002] and body mass index (kg/m2) [1.3 (0.9, 1.5) p = 0.001] was observed in the cinnamon group compared to placebo group. Other parameters which showed significantly greater improvement were: waist-hip ratio, blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Prevalence of defined metabolic syndrome was significantly reduced in the intervention group (34.5%) vs. the placebo group (5.2%).
   Conclusion: A single supplement intervention with 3 g cinnamon for 16 weeks resulted in significant improvements in all components of metabolic syndrome in a sample of Asian Indians in north India.

AB  - Evidence-based management can reduce deaths and suffering of older adults with hip fractures. This study investigates the evidence-practice gaps in hip fracture care in three major hospitals in Delhi, potential barriers and facilita-tors to improving care, and consequently, identifies contextually appropriate interventions for implementing best practice for management of older adults with hip fractures in India.
   Purpose Hip fracture in older adults is a significant public health issue in India. The current study sought to document current practices, identify barriers and facilitators to adopting best practice guidelines and recommend improvements in the management of older adults with hip fractures in Delhi, India.
   Methods This mixed methods observational study collected data from healthcare providers, patients, carers and medical records from three major public tertiary care hospitals in Delhi, India. All patients aged >= 50 years with an X-ray confirmed hip fracture that were admitted to these hospitals over a 10-week period were recruited. Patients' data were collected at admission, discharge and 30 days post-injury. Eleven key informant interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted with healthcare providers. Descriptive data for key quantitative variables were computed. The qualitative data were analysed and interpreted using a behaviour change wheel framework.
   Results A total of 136 patients, 74 (54%) men and 62 women, with hip fracture were identified in the three participating hospitals during the recruitment period and only 85 (63%) were admitted for treatment with a mean age of 66.5 years (SD 11.9). Of these, 30% received surgery within 48 h of hospital admission, 95% received surgery within 39 days of hospital admission and two (3%) had died by 30 days of injury. According to the healthcare providers, inadequate resources and overcrowding prevent adequate caring of the hip fracture patients. They unanimously felt the need for protocol-based management of hip fracture in India.
   Conclusion The development and implementation of national guidelines and standardized protocols of care for older people with hip fractures in India has the potential to improve both care and patient-related outcomes.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus which presents with symptoms of fever, rash, arthralgia, and occasional neurologic disease. While outbreaks have been earlier reported from India and other parts of the world, the recent outbreak in India witnessed more than 1000 cases. Various systemic and rarely neurological complications have been reported with CHIKV. We report two cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) with CHIKV. GBS is a rare neurological complication which may occur after subsidence of fever and constitutional symptoms by several neurotropic viruses. We describe two cases of severe GBS which presented with rapidly progressive flaccid quadriparesis progressing to difficulty in swallowing and breathing. Both required mechanical ventilation and improved partly with plasmapharesis. The cases emphasize on (1) description of the rare complication in a setting of outbreak with CHIKV, (2) acute axonal as well as demyelinating neuropathy may occur with CHIKV, (3) accurate identification of this entity during outbreaks with dengue, both of which are vector borne and may present with similar complications.

AB  - Dramatic advancement has been made in the management of children with hepatoblastoma (HB) over the past 3 decades owing to the improvement in diagnostic imaging, new chemotherapeutic agents, better surgical care and availability of liver transplantation. These advances are the end results of contributions from 4 major study groups across the globe including International Society of Pediatric Oncology Liver Tumor Strategy Group (SIOPEL), Children's Oncology Group (COG), German Pediatric Hematology Oncology Group (GPOH) and Japanese Pediatric Liver Tumor Study Group (JPLT). The current manuscript is written with the objective of developing a consensus guideline for practitioners at a National level. Based on literature and personal experience over last 3 decades, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Expert group has made recommendations for management of children with HB in resource-challenged nations including India.

AB  - With the introduction of cisplatin, the outcome of children with malignant germ cell tumors (MGCT) has improved to nearly 90% 5 year survival. Over the years, through the results of various multinational co-operative trials, the chemotherapy and surgical guidelines for both the gonadal and extra-gonadal MGCTs have been refined to decrease the early and late morbidities and at the same time improve survival. Introduction of risk categorization has further added to this effort. There has been no recommendation on how the children with malignant germ cell tumors should be treated in India. The current manuscript is written with the objective of developing a consensus guideline for practitioners at a National level. Based on extensively reviewed literature and personal experience of the major pediatric oncology centres in India, the ICMRExpert group has made recommendations for management of children with MGCT India.

AB  - Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) is a major threat to TB control worldwide. Globally, only 40% of the 340,000 notified TB patients estimated to have multidrug-resistant-TB (MDR-TB) were detected in 2015. This study was carried out to evaluate the utility of high-resolution melt curve analysis (HRM) for the rapid and direct detection of MDR-TB in Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum samples. A reference plasmid library was first generated of the most frequently observed mutations in the resistance-determining regions of rpoB, katG, and an inhA promoter and used as positive controls in HRM. The assay was first validated in 25 MDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates. The assay was evaluated on DNA isolated from 99 M. tuberculosis culture-positive sputum samples that included 84 smear-negative sputum samples, using DNA sequencing as gold standard. Mutants were discriminated from the wild type by comparing melting-curve patterns with those of control plasmids using HRM software. Rifampin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) monoresistance were detected in 11 and 21 specimens, respectively, by HRM. Six samples were classified as MDR-TB by sequencing, one of which was missed by HRM. The HRM-RIF, INH-katG, and INH-inhA assays had 89% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52, 100%), 85% (95% CI, 62, 97%), and 100% (95% CI, 74, 100%) sensitivity, respectively, in smear-negative samples, while all assays had 100% sensitivity in smear-positive samples. All assays had 100% specificity. Concordance of 97% to 100% (kappa value, 0.9 to 1) was noted between sequencing and HRM. Heteroresistance was observed in 5 of 99 samples by sequencing. In conclusion, the HRM assay was a cost-effective (Indian rupee [INR] 400/US$6), rapid, and closed-tube method for the direct detection of MDR-TB in sputum, especially for direct smear-negative cases.

AB  - Background: Endothelial dysfunction is the initial step for atherogenesis. Children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome are at risk of endothelial dysfunction due to altered cholesterol metabolism which can lead to early atherosclerosis.
   Methods: In this analytical study with longitudinal follow up 25 children with first episode of nephrotic syndrome (FENS) aged 1-16 years along with 25 age and gender matched healthy controls were enrolled. Endothelin 1 (ET 1) levels were measured by ELISA (Cloud Clone Corp. and assembled by USCN Inc, U.S.A). Other variables were measured using standard biochemical methods. Primary outcome measure was plasma ET 1 level in children with FENS and in controls. Secondary outcome measure was to observe the levels of ET 1 in children with FENS at 12 weeks in remission.
   Results: The level of ET 1 was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in children with FENS as compared to controls. The level of ET 1 was significantly higher (p = 0.006) in SSNS at the onset of nephrotic syndrome and was significantly lower (p = 0.04) after 12weeks of drug induced remission as compared to controls. SRNS children had higher levels of ET 1 than the steroid sensitive patients at onset but in was not statistically significant (p = 0.062). ET 1 showed significant positive correlation with total cholesterol (r = 0.462; p = 0.001) and negative correlation with serum albumin (r = -0.565; p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Plasma ET 1 levels are raised in children with FENS posing a risk of endothelial dysfunction, which persists at least in short term. Long term effects of raised plasma ET 1 needs to be studied. (C) 2017 Association for Research into Arterial Structure and Physiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Both diabetes and drug addiction are common phenomena across the world. Drug abuse impacts glycaemic control in multiple ways. It becomes imperative, therefore, to share guidance on drug deaddiction in persons with diabetes. The South Asian subcontinent is home to specific forms and patterns of drug abuse. Detailed study is needed to ensure good clinical practice regarding the same. This communication provides a simple and pragmatic framework to address this issue, while calling for concerted action on drug deaddiction in South Asia.

AB  - Neuroblastoma (NBL) is the most common extra-cranial solid tumor in childhood. High-risk NBL is considered challenging and has one of the least favourable outcomes amongst pediatric cancers. Primary tumor can arise anywhere along the sympathetic chain. Advanced disease at presentation is common. Diagnosis is established by tumor biopsy and elevated urinary catecholamines. Staging is performed using bone marrow and mIBG scan (FDG-PET/bone scan if mIBG unavailable or non-avid). Age, stage, histopathological grading, MYCN amplification and 11q aberration are important prognostic factors utilized in risk stratification. Low-risk disease including Stage 1 and asymptomatic Stage 2 disease has an excellent prognosis with non-mutilating surgery alone. Perinatal adrenal neuroblastoma may be managed with close observation alone. Intermediate-risk disease consisting largely of unresectable/symptomatic Stage 2/3 disease and infants with Stage 4 disease has good outcome with few cycles of chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Paraspinal neuroblastomas with cord compression are treated emergently, typically with upfront chemotherapy. Asymptomatic Stage 4S disease may be followed closely without treatment. Organ dysfunction and age below 3 mo would warrant chemotherapy in 4S. High-risk disease includes older children with Stage 4 disease and MYCN amplified tumors. High-risk disease has a suboptimal outcome, though the survival is improving with multimodality therapy including autologous stem cell transplant and immunotherapy. Relapse after multimodality therapy is difficult to salvage. Late presentation, lack of transplant facility, malnutrition and treatment abandonment are additional hurdles for survival in India. The review provides a consensus document on management of NBL for developing countries, including India.

AB  - Objectives: Despite of advancement in intensive care medicine, sepsis and septic shock carry a high mortality. Levosimendan, an inodilator, may be promising for septic shock patients with myocardial dysfunction; however, firm evidence is lacking. In this meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, levosimendan has been compared with dobutamine in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock.
   Design: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Intensive-care unit.
   Participants: Adult septic shock patients.
   Intervention: Adult septic shock patients received dobutamine or levosimendan.
   Main outcome measure: Mortality at longest follow-up, blood lactate level, cardiac index and noradrenaline requirement.
   Results: Data from 7 randomized trials have been included in this meta-analysis. Levosimendan has no benefit in terms of mortality at longest follow up in comparison to dobutamine (Odds ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.45,132; p = 034) and length of ICU stay (MD 4.7 days, 95% CI 10.3, 0.9 days, p = 0.10). Patients received levosimendan had less blood lactate level (standardized mean difference 0.95; 95% CI 1.64, 0.27; p = 0.006) and higher cardiac index (mean difference 0.44; 95% CI 0.17, 0.71; p = 0.001). Noradrenaline requirements are similar in both the groups.
   Conclusion: There is no evidence that levosimendan is superior to dobutamine in adult patients with sepsis and septic shock. Further large randomized trials are necessary in this area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhinitis, allergic or non-allergic, is an inflammatory condition of the nose. It is associated with a wide range of sleep disorders that are generally attributed to nasal congestion and presence of inflammatory mediators like cytokines and interleukins. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms behind these sleep disorders remain unclear. On the other hand, the trigeminocardiac reflex (TCR) has recently been linked to various sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea, sleep bruxism and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep apnea. TCR can be incited by stimulation of the trigeminal nerve or the area innervated by its branches including the nasal mucosa. Trigeminal nasal afferents can be activated on exposure to noxious stimuli (mechanical or chemical) like ammonia vapors, carbon-dioxide, nicotine, hypertonic saline, air-puffs and smoke. In rhinitis, there is associated neuronal hyper-responsiveness of sensory nasal afferents due to inflammation (which can be suppressed by steroids). This may further lead to increased occurrence of TCR in rhinitis. Moreover, there is involvement of autonomic nervous system both in rhinitis and TCR. In TCR, parasympathetic over activity and sympathetic inhibition leads to sudden onset bradycardia, hypotension, apnea and gastric motility. Also, the autonomic imbalance reportedly plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of rhinitis. Thus, considering these facts we hypothesize that the TCR could be the link between rhinitis and sleep disorders and we believe that further research in this direction may yield significant development in our understanding of sleep disorders in rhinitis.

AB  - In view of the significant cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and concerns raised about the CV safety of some glucose-lowering drugs, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued guidance for the industry in 2008 to demonstrate CV safety for the approval of all new antihyperglycemic drugs. Seven randomized controlled trials involving around 60,000 participants have been completed so far and have demonstrated the CV safety of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (saxagliptin, alogliptin and sitagliptin), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (lixisenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide) and a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (empagliflozin) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Three of these trials have in fact reported superiority of the study drug over placebo in terms of CV outcomes. However, all these trials were primarily designed as non-inferiority trials to exclude an unacceptable risk of CV events with these drugs in the shortest possible time period. The potential long-term benefit or risks were not assessed effectively as the median follow-up in these studies was limited to 1.5-3 years. Also, these trials included patients with relatively long duration of diabetes, advanced atherosclerosis and higher CV risk. Thus, these trials were not intended to assess CV benefit and are best interpreted as evidence for CV safety of these antihyperglycemic medications.

AB  - The nonrandomized phase 2 APEC trial investigated first-line once-every-2-weeks cetuximab plus chemotherapy (investigator's choice of FOLFOX or FOLFIRI) studied patients with KRAS/RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. We observed an activity and safety profile similar to that reported in prior first-line pivotal studies involving weekly cetuximab, suggesting that once-every-2-weeks cetuximab is effective and tolerable as first-line therapy.
   Background: In patients with KRAS wild-type (wt) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), outcomes with first-line chemotherapies are improved by adding weekly cetuximab. The APEC study investigated first-line once-every-2weeks cetuximab plus chemotherapy for patients with KRAS wt mCRC; additional biomarker subgroups were also analyzed. Patients and Methods: APEC was a nonrandomized phase 2 trial conducted in the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (n = 289) received once-every-2-weeks cetuximab with investigator's choice of chemotherapy (FOLFOX or FOLFIRI). The primary end point was best confirmed overall response rate (BORR); progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were secondary end points. Early tumor shrinkage (ETS) and depth of response (DpR) were also evaluated. Results: In the KRAS wt population, BORR was 58.8%, median PFS 11.1 months, and median OS 26.8 months. Expanded RAS mutational analysis revealed that patients with RAS wt mCRC had better outcomes (BORR = 64.7%; median PFS = 13.0 months; median OS = 28.4 months). The data suggest that ETS and DpR may be associated with survival outcomes in the RAS wt population. Although this study was not designed to formally assess differences in outcome between treatment subgroups, efficacy results appeared similar for patients treated with FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. There were no new safety findings; in particular, grade 3/4 skin reactions were within clinical expectations. Conclusion: The observed activity and safety profile is similar to that reported in prior first-line pivotal studies involving weekly cetuximab, suggesting once-every-2-weeks cetuximab is effective and tolerable as first-line therapy and may represent an alternative to weekly administration.

AB  - Dermatophytes are associated with superficial infections in humans worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the species distribution and susceptibility patterns of clinical dermatophytes. Samples received for routine mycological processing from 124 suspected cases attending a dermatologic clinic in a tertiary care hospital were included in the study. On direct microscopy, 74.1% (92/124) were positive and 53.2% (66/124) grew on culture. The isolates were comprised of Trichophyton interdigitale (56%) followed by Trichophyton tonsurans (25.7%), Trichophyton rubrum (7.5%), Trichophyton violaceum (4.5%), Microsporum gypseum (4.5%), and Trichophyton verrucosum (1.5%). Conventional mycological identification was concordant with ITS sequencing except for T. mentagrophytes. High minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values (geometric mean, >1 mu g/mL) were observed for T. tonsurans and T. rubrum to terbinafine and griseofulvin. This study highlights the shift in epidemiology from T. rubrum to T. interdigitale. It also raises a concern of high MICs of terbinafine and griseofulvin among our isolates. Surveillance of antifungal susceptibility patterns can provide clinicians with local MIC data that can further aid in guiding better management in relapse cases of dermatomycosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) is increasing in prevalence in low-and middle-income countries creating a large health care burden. Clinical management may require substantial resources but little consideration has been given to which treatments are appropriate for less advantaged countries.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The aim of this review was to systematically appraise published data on the costs and effectiveness of PAD treatments used commonly in high-income countries, and for an international consensus panel to review that information and propose a hierarchy of treatments relevant to low-and middle-income countries.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Pharmacotherapy for intermittent claudication was found to be expensive and improve walking distance by a modest amount. Exercise and endovascular therapies were more effective and exercise the most cost-effective. For critical limb ischemia, bypass surgery and endovascular therapy, which are both resource intensive, resulted in similar rates of amputation-free survival. Substantial reductions in cardiovascular events occurred with use of low cost drugs (statins, ACE inhibitors, anti-platelets) and smoking cessation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The panel concluded that, in low-and middle-income countries, cardiovascular prevention is a top priority, whereas a lower priority should be given to pharmacotherapy for leg symptoms and revascularisation, except in countries with established vascular units.

AB  - Phenotypic characteristics are known to vary substantially among different ethnicities around the globe. These variations are mediated by number of stochastic events and cannot be attributed to genetic architecture alone. DNA methylation is a well-established mechanism that sculpts our epigenome influencing phenotypic variation including disease manifestation. Since DNA methylation is an important determinant for health issues of a population, it demands a thorough investigation of the natural differences in genome wide DNA methylation patterns across different ethnic groups. This study is based on comparative analyses of methylome from five different ethnicities with major focus on Indian subjects. The current study uses hierarchical clustering approaches, principal component analysis and locus specific differential methylation analysis on Illumina 450K methylation data to compare methylome of different ethnic subjects. Our data indicates that the variations in DNA methylation patterns of Indians are less among themselves compared to other global population. It empirically correlated with dietary, cultural and demographical divergences across different ethnic groups. Our work further suggests that Indians included in this study, despite their genetic similarity with the Caucasian population, are in close proximity with Japanese in terms of their methylation signatures.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a high-protein meal replacement (HPMR) on weight and metabolic, lipid and inflammatory parameters in overweight/obese Asian Indians. In this 12-week open-label, parallel-arm randomised controlled trial, 122 overweight/obese men and women were administered either a HPMR or a control diet after 2 weeks of diet and exercise run-in. Body weight, waist circumference (WC), percentage body fat (%BF), fasting blood glucose, post-oral glucose tolerance test (post-OGTT) blood glucose, fasting and post-OGTT serum insulin, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), kidney function and hepatic aminotransferases were assessed before and after the intervention. Additional improvement in mean values for the following parameters in the HPMR group compared with the control group was observed: body weight, 4.9 % (95 % CI 3.8, 6.1; P<0.001); WC, 3.8 % (95 % CI 2.5, 5.1; P<0.001); %BF, 6.3 % (95 % CI 4.3, 8.2; P<0.001); systolic blood pressure, 2.8 % (95 % CI 0.4, 5.1; P = 0.002); diastolic blood pressure, 3.5 % (95 % CI 0.7, 6.3; P = 0.01); post-OGTT blood glucose, 7.3 % (95 % CI 1.4, 13.1; P = 0.02); total cholesterol, 2.5 % (95 % CI 1.6, 3.5; P<0.001); LDL-cholesterol, 7.3 % (95 % CI 1.7, 12.9; P<0.01); alanine aminotransferase, 22.0 % (95 % CI 2.1, 42; P = 0.03) and aspartate aminotransferase, 15.2 % (95 % CI 0.9, 29.5; P = 0.04). The absolute reduction in BMI was 0.9 units in the intervention arm compared with the control arm (-0.9 %, 95 % CI -1.4, -0.5; P<0.001) and in serum TAG was 11.9 mg/dl (-11.9 mg/dl, 95 % CI -21.1, -2.7; P<0.01). The reduction in fasting serum insulin in the intervention v. the control arm was 3.8 v. 0 % (P = 0.002); post-OGTT serum insulin was 50.3 v. 77.3 mU/l (P = 0.005); and hs-CRP, 16.7 % v. 0 % (P = 0.002). These findings show that intervention with HPMR may lead to significant weight loss and improvement in obesity measures, metabolic, lipid and inflammatory parameters and hepatic transaminases in overweight/obese Asian Indians.

AB  - Background Pediatric glioblastoma (pGBM) is an uncommon entity. The importance of concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide is not known in this subset of patients.
   Methods We retrospectively analyzed our database between 2000 and 2015. All patients were treated with maximally safe surgical resection. This was followed by a uniform treatment schedule of post-operative radiation with concurrent daily temozolomide at 75 mg/m(2). Radiation dose was 60 Gy in 30 fractions planned by 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy. Concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide was used in all patients treated after 2007. Four weeks later, adjuvant temozolomide was started at 150 mg/m(2), day 1 to 5 every 28 days and escalated to 200 mg/m(2) from the second cycle onwards if well tolerated. Log-rank test was used to compare survival distribution. The data was analyzed using SPSS (version 16).
   Results Fifty-one patients were analyzed. Median age was 14 years (range: 5 to 21 years). Thirty-five males and 16 females were noted. Median symptom duration was 4 months. Twenty-eight patients underwent a gross total resection (GTR) while 17 underwent a subtotal resection; six patients underwent decompression. Thirty-three patients received concurrent chemotherapy while 27 received adjuvant chemotherapy. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.1 months. One-and 3-year PFS was 54.4% and 3-year PFS was 24.6.7%. The median overall survival was 17.4 months. In univariate analysis survival was better for gross total resection (17.4 months vs. 11.5 months; p = 0.037), and significance maintained after multivariate analysis p = 0.026, HR 3.069, 95% CI 1.14-8.23. In univariate analysis, survival was better for patients receiving temozolomide but did not achieve significance. However, in multivariate analysis, use of temozolomide was associated with significantly improved survival p = 0.036, HR 3.315, 95% CI 1.07-10.19.
   Conclusions GTR improves survival significantly in pGBM. Adjuvant temozolomide may improve survival in pGBM.

AB  - Polymorphisms in genes coding for imatinib transporters and metabolizing enzymes may affect imatinib pharmacokinetics and clinical response. Aim of this study was to assess the influence of polymorphisms in MDR1 and CYP3A5 genes on imatinib trough levels, cytogenetic and molecular response in patients with CML. Newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML started on imatinib therapy were enrolled and followed up prospectively for 24 months. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped; C1236T, C3435T, G2677T/A in MDR1 gene and A6986G in CYP3A5 gene. Genotyping was done using PCR-RFLP method and validated by direct gene sequencing. Trough levels of imatinib were measured using LC-MS/MS. Cytogenetic response was assessed by conventional bone-marrow cytogenetics. Molecular response was assessed by qRTPCR using international scale. A total of 173 patients were included, out of which 71 patients were imatinib responders, while 102 were non-responders. Marked inter-individual variability in trough levels of imatinib was seen. Patients with GG genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G (P = 0.016) and TT genotype for MDR1-C3435T (P = 0.013) polymorphisms had significantly higher trough levels of imatinib. Patients with AA genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G [RR = 1.448, 95% CI (1.126, 1.860), P = 0.029] and CC genotype for MDR1-C1236T [RR = 1.397, 95% CI (1.066, 1.831), P = 0.06] & MDR1-C3435T [RR = 1.508, 95% CI (1.186, 1.917),P = 0.018] polymorphisms were at high risk for failure of imatinib therapy. Patients with CGC haplotype for MDR1 polymorphisms had significantly lower imatinib trough levels and were at a higher risk of imatinib failure [RR = 1.547, 95% CI (1.324, 1.808), P < 0.001]. GG vs. non-GG genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G [adjusted OR: 0.246; 95% CI (0.116, 0.519); P < 0.001] and TT vs. non-TT genotype for MDR1-C1236T [adjusted OR: 0.270; 95% CI (0.110, 0.659); P = 0.004] & MDRI-C3435T [adjusted OR: 0.289; 95% CI (0.135, 0.615); P = 0.001] polymorphisms were independent factors predicting imatinib response in multivariate analysis. To conclude, MDR1 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms significantly influence plasma trough levels and therapeutic response of imatinib in patients with CML. Genotyping of these polymorphisms could be of value to individualize the therapy and optimize the clinical outcomes. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a globally prevalent, chronic, debilitating psychiatric disorder affecting youth. With comorbidities including major depression, substance abuse, lower educational and work attainment, and increased suicide risk, it has a significant public health burden. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of SAD in urban Indian undergraduate students and to study their Facebook (FB) usage patterns.
   Methods: In this exploratory cross-sectional study, 316 undergraduate students were screened for social anxiety using validated instruments, Social Interaction Anxiety Scale (SIAS) and Social Phobia Scale (SPS), and divided into two groups based on scores obtained. The groups were then compared with regards to behaviors and attitudes toward Facebook, obtained from a self-report questionnaire.
   Results: SAD was estimated to be a significant, prevalent (7.8%) disorder in otherwise productive youth, and showed female preponderance. Higher specific social phobia scores were associated with the inability to reduce Facebook use, urges toward increasing use, spending more time thinking about Facebook, negative reactions to restricting use, and using it to forget one's problems.
   Conclusions: SAD was estimated to have a prevalence of 7.8% in our study, and was associated with stronger FB usage attitudes and patterns. We recommend that the relationship between social anxiety and Internet use be explored further, to study the possibility of Internet-based screening and intervention strategies having wider reach and appeal in socially anxious individuals.

AB  - Human lymphatic filariasis, the parasitic disease caused by the filarial nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori, is ranked as the second most complex clinical condition leading to permanent and long-term disability. The multiple antigen peptide (MAP) approach is an effective method to chemically synthesize and deliver multiple T and B cell epitopes as the constituents of a single immunogen. Here, we report on the design, chemical synthesis, and immunoprophylaxis of three epitopes that have been identified from promising vaccine candidates reported in our previous studies, constructed as MAP on an inert lysine core for human lymphatic filariasis in Jird model. Two epitopes from Thioredoxin and one epitope from Transglutaminase were constructed as MAP in an inert lysine core. The immunoprophylaxis of the synthetic vaccine construct studied in Jird models showed protective antibody (1 in 64,000 titer) and cellular immune response. Thioredoxin-Transglutaminase MAP (TT MAP) conferred a significantly high protection of 63.04% compared to control (8.5%). Multi-antigen peptide vaccine is one best approach to provide immunity against multiple antigens delivered by the complex filarial parasite.

AB  - Insulinomas are rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The genetic causes underlying insulinoma are still being investigated. Recently, 3 independent studies reported a recurrent somatic mutation in YY1 gene (C > G; Thr372Arg) among insulinoma patients belonging to Chinese and Western Caucasian populations, which was found to increase insulin secretion by beta-cells. However, the status of this key gene variation remains unknown in patients of other ethnicities. We, therefore, screened Indian sporadic insulinoma patients for YY1 T372R mutation in the present study. Seventeen patients diagnosed with insulinoma were recruited retrospectively and their records of family history and clinical parameters were collected. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were used to extract genomic DNA, which was subjected to PCR amplification of YY1 exon 5, followed by Sanger sequencing. Nucleotide sequences thus obtained were aligned against the documented sequence of YY1 exon 5. We found absence of C to G mutation at YY1 codon 372 in all 17 (100 %) insulinoma tissues analyzed. On comparison with the mutation frequency observed in the Chinese patients, our results point to genetic heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of insulinoma. This is the first report on the status of YY1 T372R in insulinoma cases of Indian origin. This also warrants analysis of other documented as well as novel mutations in genes in insulinoma tumorigenesis.

AB  - Metabolic alterations are known to occur with oncogenesis and tumor progression. During malignant transformation, the metabolism of cells and tissues is altered. Cancer metabolism can be studied using advanced technologies that detect both metabolites and metabolic activities. Identification, characterization, and quantification of metabolites (metabolomics) are important for metabolic analysis and are usually done by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or by mass spectrometry. In contrast to the magnetic resonance imaging that is used to monitor the tumor morphology during progression of the disease and during therapy, in vivo NMR spectroscopy is used to study and monitor tumor metabolism of cells/tissues by detection of various biochemicals or metabolites involved in various metabolic pathways. Several in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo NMR studies using H-1 and P-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) nuclei have documented increased levels of total choline containing compounds, phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters in human breast cancer tissues, which is indicative of altered choline and phospholipid metabolism. These levels get reversed with successful treatment. Another method that increases the sensitivity of substrate detection by using nuclear spin hyperpolarization of C-13-lableled substrates by dynamic nuclear polarization has revived a great interest in the study of cancer metabolism. This review discusses breast tissue metabolism studied by various NMR/MRS methods.

AB  - Introduction: The superficial laminae of the spinal cord are crucial sites for the transmission of incoming noxious information. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is released from the presynaptic nerve terminals in these laminae. One of the objectives was to evaluate the temporospatial pattern of expression of CGRP following paw incision in rats. Paw incision-induced nociception mimics postoperative pain in humans. The next objective was to administer a specific CGRP receptor antagonist directly into the intrathecal space and observe the antinociceptive effect, which was then compared to morphine.
   Material and methods: Sprague Dawley rats were subjected to incision on the right hind paw. The related spinal cord segments (L4-5) were isolated at different time intervals after incision and immunostained for CGRP. A different set of rats were implanted with intrathecal catheter and administered saline (control) or BIBN 4096 (CGRP antagonist) or morphine (10 mu g/10 mu l) and then subjected to paw incision. Nociception was evaluated at different time intervals up to day 7.
   Results: Expression of CGRP was observed over laminae I and outer part of lamina II. Synaptic terminals could be discerned containing CGRP. Following incision, the expression decreased abruptly at 2 h. However, at 12 h, the expression had increased. Between days 1-5, the expression decreased again towards basal levels. The antinociceptive effect of BIBN was comparatively less than morphine, which robustly inhibited all three pain parameters at 2 h after incision.
   Discussion: Immunohistochemistry revealed that CGRP was involved in the transmission of nociception. However, blocking its action did not produce a robust antinociceptive effect. (C) 2017 Anatomical Society of India. Published by Elsevier, a division of RELX India, Pvt. Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose of Review Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is now the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Industrialization and economic growth have led to an unprecedented increment in the burden of CVD and their risk factors in less industrialized regions of the world. While there are abundant data on CVD and their risk factors from longitudinal cohort studies done in the West, good-quality data from South Asia are lacking.
   Recent Findings Several multi-institutional, observational, prospective registries, and epidemiologic cohorts in South Asia have been established to systematically evaluate the burden of CVD and their risk factors. The PINNACLE (Practice Innovation and Clinical Excellence) India Quality Improvement Program (PIQIP), the Kerala Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), and Trivandrum Heart Failure registries have focused on secondary prevention of CVD and performance measurement in both outpatient and inpatient settings, respectively. The Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE), Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS), and other epidemiologic and genetic studies have focused on primary prevention of CVD and evaluated variables such as environment, smoking, physical activity, health systems, food and nutrition policy, dietary consumption patterns, socioeconomic factors, and healthy neighborhoods.
   Summary The international cardiovascular community has been responsive to a burgeoning cardiovascular disease burden in South Asia. Several collaborations have formed between the West (North America in particular) and South Asia to catalyze evidence-based and data-driven changes in the federal health policy in this part of the world to promote cardiovascular health and mitigate cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Background Core needle biopsy is replacing fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) as the modality of choice for breast cancer diagnosis. This study was carried out to determine the usefulness of FNAC in breast cancer patients in a tertiary care center in North India.
   Methods Case files of patients managed in the breast cancer clinic of a single surgical unit between 1993 and 2014 were reviewed. All patients who underwent FNAC at our institute or had their slides reviewed at our institute were included in the study. Patients operated on outside our center and those with FNAC reports which were not available for review were excluded. Data were entered in Microsoft Excel and analyzed with SPSS version 21. True positives and false negatives for FNAC were noted from which sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated.
   Results FNAC was performed in 698 of 1310 patients. Mean age was 48.3 years. There were 9 (1.3%) male breast cancer patients. 696 (99.7%) patients had a palpable lump with a mean tumor size of 5.3 cm. 54.2% of the patients were clinically node positive. While over 80% of patients were diagnosed on the basis of FNAC before 2000, less than 50% of the patients had an FNAC after 2010. FNAC diagnosed malignancy in 627 patients, while it was inconclusive in 69 and false negative in two patients. No false-positive results were seen. These figures yield an absolute sensitivity of 89.8% and a complete sensitivity of 99.7% for FNAC with a 100% PPV.
   Conclusions FNAC is a reliable tool for diagnosing cancer in suspicious breast lesions with a good sensitivity and PPV in hands of an experienced cytopathologist. Surgical treatment may be safely undertaken based on FNAC particularly in early operable breast cancers suitable for breast conservation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cathepsin L (CTSL) and B (CTSB) have a crucial role in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and tissue remodeling, which is a prominent feature of fibrogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the role and clinical significance of these cathepsins in liver fibrosis.
   METHODS: Hepatic histological CTSL and CTSB expression were assessed in experimental models of liver fibrosis, patients with liver cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis, and controls by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Plasma levels of CTSL and CTSB were analyzed in 51 liver cirrhosis patients (Child-Pugh stages A, B and C) and 15 controls.
   RESULTS: Significantly enhanced CTSL mRNA (P = 0.02) and protein (P = 0.01) levels were observed in the liver of carbon tetrachloride-treated mice compared with controls. Similarly, hepatic CTSL and CTSB mRNA levels (P = 0.02) were markedly wincreased in Abcb4(-/-) (ATP-binding cassette transporter knockout) mice compared with wild-type littermates. Elevated levels of CTSL and CTSB were also found in the liver (P = 0.001) and plasma (P < 0.0001) of patients with hepatic cirrhosis compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, CTSL and CTSB levels correlated well with the hepatic collagen (r = 0.5, P = 0.007; r = 0.64, P = 0.0001). CTSL and CTSB levels increased with the Child-Pugh stage of liver cirrhosis and correlated with total bilirubin content (r = 0.4/0.2; P <= 0.05). CTSL, CTSB, and their combination had a high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve: 0.91, 0.89 and 0.96, respectively) for distinguishing patients from controls.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the overexpression of CTSL and CTSB in patients and experimental mouse models, suggesting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for chronic liver diseases.

T2  - INDIAN PEDIATRICS
KW  - PREBIOTICS
AB  - This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted involving 400 children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Patients received one daily dose of a blend of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis and Lactobacillus rhamnosus (10 billion colony-forming units, 50:50) or placebo during hospitalization followed by an 8- to 12-week outpatient treatment period, depending on patients' recovery rate. The primary outcome was number of days with diarrhea during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included other diarrhea outcomes, pneumonia, weight gain, and recovery. There was no difference in number of days with diarrhea between the probiotic (n=200) and placebo (n=200) groups during inpatient treatment (adjusted difference +0.2 days, 95% confidence interval -0.8 to 1.2, P=0.69); however, during outpatient treatment, probiotics reduced days with diarrhea (adjusted difference -2.2 days 95% confidence interval -3.5 to -0.3, P=0.025). Twenty-six patients died in the probiotic versus 20 in the placebo group (P=0.38). The authors concluded that these probiotics had no effect on diarrhea in children with SAM during hospitalization, but reduced the number of days with diarrhea in outpatient treatment by 26%.

AB  - Post-translational modification pathways such as SUMOylation are integral to all cellular processes and tissue homeostasis. We investigated the possible involvement of SUMOylation in the epithelial signalling in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), the two major forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Initially in a murine model of IBD, induced by dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS mice), we observed inflammation accompanied by a lowering of global SUMOylation of colonic epithelium. The observed SUMOylation alteration was due to a decrease in the sole SUMO E2 enzyme (Ubc9). Mass-spectrometric analysis revealed the existence of a distinct SUMOylome (SUMO-conjugated proteome) in DSS mice with alteration of key cellular regulators, including master kinase Akt1. Knocking-down of Ubc9 in epithelial cells resulted in dramatic activation of inflammatory gene expression, a phenomenon that acted via reduction in Akt1 and its SUMOylated form. Importantly, a strong decrease in Ubc9 and Akt1 was also seen in endoscopic biopsy samples (N = 66) of human CD and UC patients. Furthermore, patients with maximum disease indices were always accompanied by severely lowered Ubc9 or SUMOylated-Akt1. Mucosal tissues with severely compromised Ubc9 function displayed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and compromised wound-healing markers. Thus, our results reveal an important and previously undescribed role for the SUMOylation pathway involving Ubc9 and Akt1 in modulation of epithelial inflammatory signalling in IBD.

AB  - Forensic Science is the application of science to the criminal and civil laws that are enforced by police agencies in a criminal justice system. It is a science which relies on physical evidence; one of the important physical evidences being blood. The purpose of this research was to determine the efficacy of luminol reagent in detecting bloodstains on different surfaces, concealed by multiple layers of paint, over a period of time and also to compare the intensities of chemiluminescence exhibited by them. In this study, dry wall, wooden planks and metal surfaces were identified as commonly encountered surfaces at crime scenes and hence 25 of each surface were simulated and blood was spattered, which were then concealed by progressive layers of paint specific to each surface. Thereafter, each surface was critically observed for the intensity of chemiluminescence, following the application of luminol and the results were documented as photographs. The research was conducted for duration of 50 days, in order to study the effect of ageing of concealment upon detection of bloodstains using luminol. Varying intensities of chemiluminescence were displayed by all the three simulated surfaces deposited with paint over bloodstains up to three layers of concealment, depending on the nature of the surface which were captured using photography. The highest intensity of chemiluminescence was shown by concealed bloodstains on dry wall and metal surfaces, despite the number of layers of concealment. However, an increase in the number of layers of concealment produced a significant decrease in the intensity of chemiluminescenece displayed by the bloodstains concealed by paint upon reacting with luminol on metal sheets, which was not found to be uniform and consistent on the other surfaces. These findings highlight the fact that bloodstains concealed by paint could be effectively detected by luminol reagent, despite the nature and ageing of concealment and thereby provide a lead to the investigation.

AB  - Objective: Comparison of cardiac output (CO) obtained using electric cardiometry (EC) and pulmonary artery catheterization (PAC) in pediatric patients with congenital structural heart disease.
   Design: Prospective, observational study.
   Setting: A tertiary hospital.
   Participants: The study comprised 50 patients scheduled to undergo cardiac catheterization.
   Interventions: CO data triplets were obtained simultaneously from the cardiometry device ICON (Osypka Medical, Berlin, Germany) and PAC at the following predefined time points-(1) T1: 5 minutes after arterial and venous cannulation and (2) T2: 5 minutes postprocedure; the average of the 3 readings was calculated. Reliability analysis and Bland-Altman analysis were performed to determine the limits of agreement, mean bias, and accuracy of the CO measured with EC.
   Measurements and Main Results: The measured EC-cardiac index 4.22 (3.84-4.60) Umin/m(2) and PAC-cardiac index 4.26 (3.67-4.67) Umin/m(2) were statistically insignificant (p value > 0.05) at T1. Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean bias of 0.0051 Umin/m(2) and precision limits of +/- 0.4927 Umin/m(2). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.789 and Cronbach's alpha was 0.652, indicating good reproducibility and internal consistency between the two techniques. Postcatheterization analysis also revealed strong agreement and reliability between the two techniques.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated that cardiac indices measured in children with a variety of structural heart diseases using EC reliably represent absolute values obtained using PAC. EC technology is simple and easy to use and offers noninvasive beat-to-beat tracking of CO and other hemodynamic parameters in children with structurally abnormal hearts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Redox sensitive, folate conjugated multiblock polymeric system of (-PLGA-PEG-PLGA-urethane-ss-) demonstrated self-assembly into stable nanoplatforms. The polymeric nanocarriers were encapsulated with doxorubicin and highly crystalline-gamma Fe2O3 superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), for co-delivery of the same to cancer cells, with average particle size of similar to 170 nm and zeta potential of similar to-33 mV. Furthermore, the designed formulation was evaluated for protein adsorption, hemo-cytocompatibility and stability. Glutathione (GSH) induced redox sensitivity of the nanocarriers was depicted by similar to 4.47 fold increase in drug release in the presence of 10 mM GSH. In vitro cellular uptake studies of the designed nanocarriers showed synergistic cytotoxic effect in folate overexpressing cells (HeLa and MDA-MB-231), after subjecting the cells to radio frequency (RF) induced hyperthermia (similar to 43 degrees C). Negligible effect of the combinatorial therapy was observed in normal cells (L.929). The developed polymeric system depicted facile synthesis, reproducibility and potential for achieving combinatorial and targeted delivery of drug and SPIONs to cancer cells. This combinatorial approach can help in achieving better therapeutic effect with minimal side effects of chemotherapy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We report the case of a 25-year-old immunocompetent female, who presented with a 15-month history of headache, seizures, left-sided proptosis and ophthalmoplegia, and right hemiparesis. Recovery from the symptoms and decrease in the lesion size seen on the radiological assessment were achieved through two decompressive craniotomies followed by prolonged combined systemic antifungal therapies. Although the initial neuroimaging suggested a mitotic pathology, the surgical sample confirmed ICA. Now the patient is on single antifungal therapy (Tab. voriconazole, 200 mg twice daily) and doing her daily activities, but with a reduced intelligent quotient. We report a challenging case of ICA where multiple courses of combined antifungal therapies and repeat surgeries paved the way for a good prognosis.

AB  - Bone metastases, often a consequence of breast, prostate, and lung carcinomas, are characterized by an increased bone turnover, which can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET), as well as single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Bisphosphonate complexes of Tc-99m are predominantly used as SPECT tracers. In contrast to SPECT, PET offers a higher spatial resolution and, owing to the Ge-68/Ga-68 generator, an analog to the established Tc-99m generator exists. Complexation of Ga(III) requires the use of chelators. Therefore, DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid), NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid), and their derivatives, are often used. The combination of these macrocyclic chelators and bisphosphonates is currently studied worldwide. The use of DOTA offers the possibility of a therapeutic application by complexing the beta-emitter Lu-177. This overview describes the possibility of diagnosing bone metastases using [Ga-68]Ga-BPAMD (Ga-68-labeled (4-{[bis-(phosphonomethyl))carbamoyl]methyl}-7,10-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododec-1-yl)acetic acid) as well as the successful application of [Lu-177]Lu-BPAMD for therapy and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools based on this structure. Improvements concerning both the chelator and the bisphosphonate structure are illustrated providing new Ga-68- and Lu-177-labeled bisphosphonates offering improved pharmacological properties.

AB  - Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common renal tumor of childhood. Although multidisciplinary care including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have greatly improved the survival rates in WT, there is a scope for further improvement in India and other resource-poor settings. In resource-limited settings, the majority of patients present with large tumors, which may either be unresectable or risky to resect; making preoperative chemotherapy followed by delayed surgery the preferred approach. Histology and staging are used for risk stratification. The imaging procedure of choice is Contrast Enhanced CT scan (CECT) of thorax/abdomen and pelvis, which is to be done at presentation, as well as for re-evaluation. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment in WT and Radical Nephroureterectomy and Lymph node sampling is the procedure of choice, to be performed at week 5 in Non Metastatic WT and week 7 in Metastatic WT. WT is an extremely chemosensitive and radiosensitive tumor. Preoperative chemotherapy for Non Metastatic WT consists of 4 wk of Vincristine /Actinomycin and 6 wk of Vincristine /Actinomycin/Adriamycin for Metastatic WT, with post-operative chemotherapy depending on stage and histology. Radiation therapy is recommended mainly in Stage III and Stage IV WT, with other indications given in the text. Other recommendations, such as treatment of WT in special situations and for supportive care are also detailed in the text.

AB  - Activation of pluripotency regulatory circuit is an important event in solid tumor progression and the hypoxic microenvironment is known to enhance the stemness feature of some cells. The distinct population of cancer stem cells (CSCs)/tumor initiating cells exist in a niche and augment invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. Previously, studies have reported global hypomethylation and site-specific aberrant methylation in gliomas along with other epigenetic modifications as important contributors to genomic instability during glioma progression. Here, we have demonstrated the role of hypoxia-mediated epigenetic modifications in regulating expression of core pluripotency factors, OCT4 and NANOG, in glioma cells. We observe hypoxiamediated induction of demethylases, ten-eleven-translocation (TET) 1 and 3, but not TET2 in our cell-line model. Immunoprecipitation studies reveal active demethylation and direct binding of TET1 and 3 at the Oct4 and Nanog regulatory regions. Tet1 and 3 silencing assays further confirmed induction of the pluripotency pathway involving Oct4, Nanog, and Stat3, by these paralogues, although with varying degrees. Knockdown of Tet1 and Tet3 inhibited the formation of neurospheres in hypoxic conditions. We observed independent roles of TET1 and TET3 in differentially regulating pluripotency and differentiation associated genes in hypoxia. Overall, this study demonstrates an active demethylation in hypoxia by TET1 and 3 as a mechanism of Oct4 and Nanog overexpression thus contributing to the formation of CSCs in gliomas.

AB  - AimTo present a direct comparison between chemotherapy-enhanced radiotherapy (CERT) and biotherapy-enhanced radiotherapy (BERT) in locally advanced head and neck cancer.
   MethodsIt is a retrospective analysis of 53 patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer treated from August 2006 to December 2008. For CERT, patients received weekly cisplatin (40 mg/m(2)) and for BERT, a loading dose of 400 mg/m(2) of cetuximab given one week prior to radiotherapy followed by 250 mg/m(2) given weekly along with radiotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were computed with Kaplan-Meier curve with log-rank test for comparison between the two groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to estimate the impact of known relevant prognostic factors on DFS and OS.
   ResultsThe median DFS was significantly better with CERT than BERT group (50.82 vs 11.66 months; P = 0.031). The 3 years DFS was significantly higher in CERT group than in BERT group (60.0% vs 14.3%; P = 0.022). The median OS was significantly better with CERT than BERT group (53.61 vs 32.55 months; P = 0.044). The 3 years OS was also significantly higher in CERT group than in BERT group (74.0% vs 42.1%; P = 0.032). There were no significant differences in acute toxicities of all grade and grade 3 between the two groups. The compliance to treatment and assisted feeding dependency for more than 6 months duration were also not significantly different.
   ConclusionCERT is associated with better outcome with no significantly increased acute toxicities compared to BERT.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the risk factors associated with Candida auris candidaemia, as this fungus now poses a global threat.
   Methods: We performed a subgroup analysis of a previously reported study of 27 Indian ICUs. The clinical data of candidaemia cases due to C. auris and other Candida species were compared to determine significant risk factors associated with C. auris infection.
   Results: Of the 1400 candidaemia cases reported earlier, 74 (5.3%) from 19 of 27 ICUs were due to C. auris. The duration of ICU stay prior to candidaemia diagnosis was significantly longer in patients with C. auris candidaemia (median 25, IQR 12-45 days) compared with the non-auris group (median 15, IQR 9-28, P < 0.001). Based on logistic regression modelling, admission to north Indian ICUs [OR 2.1 (1.2-3.8); P = 0.012], public-sector hospital [OR 2.2 (1.2-3.9); P = 0.006], underlying respiratory illness [OR 2.1 (1.3-3.6); P = 0.002], vascular surgery [OR 2.3 (1.00-5.36); P = 0.048], prior antifungal exposure [OR 2.8 (1.6-4.8); P < 0.001] and low APACHE II score [OR 0.8 (0.8-0.9); P = 0.007] were significantly associated with C. auris candidaemia. The majority (45/51, 88.2%) of the isolates were clonal. A considerable number of isolates were resistant to fluconazole (n = 43, 58.1%), amphotericin B (n = 10, 13.5%) and caspofungin (n = 7, 9.5%).
   Conclusions: Although C. auris infection has been observed across India, the number of cases is higher in public-sector hospitals in the north of the country. Longer stay in ICU, underlying respiratory illness, vascular surgery, medical intervention and antifungal exposure are the major risk factors for acquiring C. auris infection even among patients showing lower levels of morbidity.

AB  - To determine incidence of hypoglycemia in exclusively breastfed, high-risk but healthy newborns, and risk factors for its development.
   This observational study enrolled 407 exclusively breastfed high-risk (low birth weight newborns (1800-2499 g), late preterms, small-for-gestation, large-for-gestation and infant of diabetic mother), who did not require admission to neonatal intensive care unit and were kept in postnatal wards with mother. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose ae<currency>46 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Blood glucose was monitored till 48 hours of life.
   27% of the screened newborns developed hypoglycemia in first 48 hours. 31 (7.6%) developed recurrent (> 2) episodes, 28 (6.8%) had moderate (< 37mg/dL) while 8 (1.9%) developed symptomatic hypoglycemia. With increase in birthweight, risk of hypoglycemia reduced significantly (P=0.003). Hypoglycemia was observed more frequently in first 2 hours as compared to next 48 hours (P=0.0001). Low birth-weight, preterm gestation and male gender was significantly associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia.
   Healthy, high-risk exclusively breastfed newborns in postnatal wards need close monitoring for hypoglycemia in first 24 hrs of life.

AB  - Introduction: The present review is based on the study of various classifications of pneumatization of temporal bone and their comparison. The air cells are classified based on their location in the temporal bone in a radiograph or based on their interpretation by a radiologist or otolaryngologist with the help of different reference structures.
   Methods: The analysis of pneumatization in temporal bone is done by reviewing research articles related to pneumatization of temporal bone in pig, sheep, macaque and humans published in Pubmed, Sciencedirect, Scopus, and Medline, Indexed journals.
   Results and discussion: According to classical classification the temporal bone is divided into five regions viz., middle ear, squamomastoid(mastoid), perilabyrinthine, petrous apex and accessory. The cells are named accordingly and they are further classified into various grades by the degree of pneumatization and density of cells present in the respective regionsMost recent work which has been cited in various articles, is done by Han et al. [19] In this pneumatization is classified based on the visualization of various reference structures such as, sigmoid sinus, labyrinth, and internal carotid artery. The lack of consensus among surgeons and otolaryngologists regarding the classification of the pneumatization of temporal bone may be a cause of failure in a few otologic surgeries such as 10 mastoidectomies etc and postoperative care of skull base surgeries.

AB  - Bone marrow microenvironment plays a crucial role in the growth of hemopoietic cells and bone marrow function, which in turn depends on an intact microvasculature. Our study assesses the microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow of aplastic anemia (AA) patients, compares with MVD of controls and MVD among the different types of AA. Bone marrow specimens from 60 patients with AA and 17 controls were studied. There were 33 patients with non severe AA (NSAA), 12 patients with severe AA (SAA) and 15 patients with very severe AA (VSAA). MVD was calculated on sections stained immunohistochemically for CD34. The mean bone marrow MVD in AA group was 1.28 +/- 0.36, being significantly lower than that in control group (6.80 +/- 1.59, p < 0.001). MVD of SAA and NSAA patients were 1.16 +/- 0.35 and 1.49 +/- 0.27, respectively, being significantly different (p = 0.003). MVD of VSAA was 0.93 +/- 0.25 and the difference with NSAA is significant, however there was no significant difference between SAA and VSAA. Bone marrow MVD is low in AA patients and is likely to have a role in pathophysiology of bone marrow failure. Proangiogenic agents together with specific therapy might accelerate the recovery of hematopoiesis in AA patients.

AB  - The majority of patients attending breast clinics are found to be suffering from benign conditions. The detailed investigations of every patient would add to the cost of care and burden the laboratories. A detailed clinical evaluation might limit the use of thorough investigations for suspicious lesions only. This cross sectional study involved the patients with various benign and malignant conditions of breast, who attended outpatient clinic and surgical ward at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from June 2009 to May 2011. The study started with a training of the resident (observer 2) in various breast examination techniques by a professor of surgery (observer 1), who was well trained in the discipline of breast surgery by internationally renowned breast experts. The different techniques of breast examination were validated after calculation of intra and inter-observer variation. Excellent agreement was observed between both the observers. The diagnostic accuracy ratio for most variables ranges from 0.9 to 1. The dimpling of skin on inspection had a low kappa (coefficient of agreement = 0.48) and consistency of lymph node on palpation had a kappa 0.38. All other variables showed high agreement. The present study was successful in training the resident and validating the different techniques in physical examination of breast.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to compare the bidirectional superior cavopulmonary anastomosis (BDG) with or without cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Methods: 100 patients undergoing BDG were randomized into two groups: Off-CPB or on-CPB groups. All patients underwent near-infrared spectrophotometry (NIRS) and bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and pre-and postoperative serum 100 beta protein measurements (S beta 100) and neuro-cognitive evaluation. Postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) parameters were also studied.
   Results: The median age of patients in the on-CPB and off-CPB group were 42 and 48 months, respectively (p = 0.11). Median weights in the on-CPB group and off-CPB group were 13.5 (5-50) kg and 15 (7-36) kg, respectively (p = 0.927). There was a significant rise in superior vena cava (SVC) pressure on SVC clamping in the off-CPB group (23.12 +/- 6.84 vs 2.98 +/- 2.22 mmHg) on-CPB group (p < 0.001). There was a significant fall in NIRS and BIS values from baseline in the off-CPB group during the anastomosis but there was no statistically significant change in serum S beta 100 from pre-clamp to post-clamp in either group. Inotropic support, duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay were significantly less in the off-CPB group (p < 0.001). Assessment of Social Adaptive Functioning revealed no adverse sequelae. There were significant cost savings if surgery was performed off-CPB (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Off CPB-BDG is an economical and safe procedure. Duration of inotropic and mechanical ventilatory support, ICU, and hospital stay is significantly less. We did not observe any early adverse neurologic sequelae in patients undergoing off-CPBBDG.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to comparatively evaluate the morphology of cataract, intraoperative and postoperative complications (IPC), and surgical outcomes of phacoemulsification in post 23G vitrectomized eyes in silicone oil versus air/gas group. This prospective interventional clinical study took place in the Dr. RP Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. Eighty-nine eyes of 89 consecutive vitrectomized patients with cataract were included. All underwent phacoemulsification and evaluated for cataract morphology, surgical difficulties, IPC, visual acuity, and specular count. Mean age of patients was 50.24 +/- 15.19 years. There were 65 males and 24 females and 48 eyes in silicone oil group and 41 in air/gas group. Combination type was the commonest morphology seen in both silicone oil (52.08 %) and air/gas group (70.33 %) followed by posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) in 31.25 % silicone group and 12.2 % air/gas group. Posterior capsular plaque (PCP) was seen in 41.67 % of silicone oil versus 7.32 % air/gas group; p < 0.005. Pupillary abnormalities were significantly more in oil (31.25 %) than in air/gas group (9.76 %); p = 0.014. Mean duration between vitrectomy and phacoemulsification in oil group versus air/gas group was 8.39 +/- 4.7 months and 10.9 +/- 5.22 months, respectively; p < 0.005. Mean postoperative logMAR visual acuity was better in air/gas (0.43 +/- 0.25) than in oil (0.66 +/- 0.29) group, p < 0.005. There was no significant difference in mean endothelial cell loss postoperatively in either groups (p = 0.25). Morphology of cataract differs in the two groups with PSC being more common in oil group. The mean time of cataract onset was significantly less in patients with oil group, and poor visual outcome in oil group may be attributable to the increased PCP noted.

AB  - To assess the impact of family-centered care in delivery of care to sick newborns, on nosocomial infection rate.
   Randomized controlled trial
   Tertiary referral nursery (October 2010 to March 2012).
   295 neonates randomized at the time of hospitalization in neonatal intensive care unit.
   Parent-attendant of intervention group were trained using an indigenously developed and pretested, culturally sensitive, simple audio-video tool that covered domains of personal hygiene, hand washing, danger signs recognition and feeding of sick neonate. Control group received routine care by nurses and doctors.
   Primary: culture positive nosocomial infection rate. Secondary: culture negative nosocomial infection rate, duration of hospitalization, mortality and breastfeeding rate.
   Two-thirds of family caregivers were fathers/ mothers and about 20% were grandparents. About 60% of family care givers were either illiterate (25%) or primary/middle pass (34%). Incidence of nosocomial episodes of sepsis was not different between groups (incidence rate difference 0.74, 95 % CI -4.21, 5.6, P = 0.76). Pre-discharge exclusive breastfeeding rates were significantly higher in intervention group [80.4% vs 66.7% (P=0.007)].
   There was no significant difference in nosocomial infection rate between the two groups. Translating and adapting principles of family-centered care was feasible, and improved the pre-discharge exclusive breastfeeding rates.

AB  - A positive direct antiglobulin test has been reported in 1:1000 to 1:14,000 blood donors and 1-15 % of hospital patients. Drugs may cause a positive direct antiglobulin test result and/or immune-mediated haemolysis with an incidence of approximately 1 in a 1 million population. Our aim is to highlight the importance of following strict transfusion protocols and management insight in a direct antiglobulin test positive patient showing incompatibility with multiple units possibly due to drug induced immune haemolytic anaemia (DIIHA). We also aim to highlight importance of autologous blood transfusion in an orthopaedic procedure in which homologous transfusion may be needed. We are presenting case of a 36 year old male with alleged h/o of road traffic accident with comminuted intra-articular fracture of the distal femur. He had h/o of ankylosing spondylitis since last 20 years on medication with indomethacin and methotrexate. A review of the literature was performed which showed use of drug methotrexate as an uncommon clinical entity for DIIHA; sporadic reports exist in the medical literature to support this view. The review of the literature in combination with our own data showed methotrexate can be a cause of DIIHA. We therefore advocate proper immunohaematological work up and use of autologous blood for management of at-risk-patients of DIIHA.

AB  - Comparison of Latin American (LA) nuclear cardiology (NC) practice with that in the rest of the world (RoW) will identify areas for improvement and lead to educational activities to reduce radiation exposure from NC.
   INCAPS collected data on all SPECT and PET procedures performed during a single week in March-April 2013 in 36 laboratories in 10 LA countries (n = 1139), and 272 laboratories in 55 countries in RoW (n = 6772). Eight "best practices" were identified a priori and a radiation-related Quality Index (QI) was devised indicating the number used. Mean radiation effective dose (ED) in LA was higher than in RoW (11.8 vs 9.1 mSv, p < 0.001). Within a populous country like Brazil, a wide variation in laboratory mean ED was found, ranging from 8.4 to 17.8 mSv. Only 11% of LA laboratories achieved median ED < 9 mSv, compared to 32% in RoW (p < 0.001). QIs ranged from 2 in a laboratory in Mexico to 7 in a laboratory in Cuba. Three major opportunities to reduce ED for LA patients were identified: (1) more laboratories could implement stress-only imaging, (2) camera-based methods of ED reduction, including prone imaging, could be more frequently used, and (3) injected activity of Tc-99m could be adjusted reflecting patient weight/habitus.
   On average, radiation dose from NC is higher in LA compared to RoW, with median laboratory ED < 9 mSv achieved only one third as frequently as in RoW. Opportunities to reduce radiation exposure in LA have been identified and guideline-based recommendations made to optimize protocols and adhere to the "as low as reasonably achievable" (ALARA) principle.

AB  - Purpose To correlate expression of Glypican-3 in Wilms tumor with histopathology, stage, and outcome.
   Methods Glypican-3 mRNA expression by real-time PCR on tumor and normal germline samples from 75 fresh nephrectomies for Wilms tumor with fold change after normalization against GAPDH was compared. Survival analysis for event-free and overall survival (EFS, OS) with 2-year follow-up for Glypican-3 overexpression (> 1.5 times) and clinicopathological parameters was performed.
   Results Glypican-3 was overexpressed in 37/75 (49.3%). It was overexpressed in 77% (10/13) cases with blastema predominance or anaplastic histology, as compared to 44% of other histologies (27/62) (p = 0.03). OS was 73 and 93%, respectively (p = 0.016), for those with and without GPC-3 overexpression. EFS was not significantly different with Glypican-3 overexpression (p = 0.11). All 5 deaths among blastema predominant tumors and 4/5 deaths among triphasic tumors had overexpressed Glypican-3. Most deaths in Stage IV, Stage III, and Stage I + II (5/7, 3/3, 1/1) had GPC-3 overexpression. On multivariate analysis, only histology and stage were found to have independent prognostic value.
   Conclusion Glypican-3 overexpression in Wilms tumor correlates with poor OS on univariate analysis. However, only histology and stage have independent prognostic value. Glypican-3 levels may help to stratify intermediate outcome histology (triphasic) and Stage III Wilms tumors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To study the expression profiles of 5 microRNAs in tissue and serum of patients with clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC) and evaluate their diagnostic and prognostic potential.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS We prospectively analyzed 30 patients of histologically proven ccRCC and collected 3 mL of serum preoperatively and small pieces of tumor and adjacent non-tumor renal tissue intraoperatively. Control serum samples were obtained from 15 patients of non-renal benign diseases. We analyzed 5 miRNAs-miR-34a, miR-141, miR-200c, miR-1233, and miR-21-2. Freshly collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and total RNA was extracted. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine relative miRNA expression.
   RESULTS In the renal tissue and serum samples, 3 out of 5 miRNAs were differentially expressed; that is, the expression levels of miR-34a and miR-141 were significantly decreased, whereas that of miR-1233 was significantly increased. Serum miR-34a, miR-141, and miR-1233 were able to diagnose ccRCC with a sensitivity of 80.76%, 75%, and 93.33%, and specificity of 80%, 73.33%, and 100%, respectively, as compared to histopathology. Using a panel of 2 serum miRNAs (miR-141 and miR-1233) ccRCC can be diagnosed with 100% sensitivity and 73.3% specificity.
   CONCLUSION miRNAs are differentially expressed in serum of patients with ccRCC and can be used to diagnose ccRCC with high sensitivity and specificity. Diagnostic sensitivity can be further improved by using a panel of miRNAs and has the potential to serve as novel diagnostic markers of ccRCC. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Development of a clinical diagnostic matrix for characterizing inherited epidermolysis bullosa
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Background Accurately diagnosing the subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is critical for management and genetic counselling. Modern laboratory techniques are largely inaccessible in developing countries, where the diagnosis remains clinical and often inaccurate.
   Objectives To develop a simple clinical diagnostic tool to aid in the diagnosis and subtyping of EB.
   Methods We developed a matrix indicating presence or absence of a set of distinctive clinical features (as rows) for the nine most prevalent EB subtypes (as columns). To test an individual patient, presence or absence of these features was compared with the findings expected in each of the nine subtypes to see which corresponded best. If two or more diagnoses scored equally, the diagnosis with the greatest number of specific features was selected. The matrix was tested using findings from 74 genetically characterized patients with EB aged > 6 months by an investigator blinded to molecular diagnosis. For concordance, matrix diagnoses were compared with molecular diagnoses.
   Results Overall, concordance between the matrix and molecular diagnoses for the four major types of EB was 91.9%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.88 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.95; P < 0.001]. The matrix achieved a 75.7% agreement in classifying EB into its nine subtypes, with a kappa coefficient of 0.73 (95% CI 0.69-0.77; P < 0.001).
   Conclusions The matrix appears to be simple, valid and useful in predicting the type and subtype of EB. An electronic version will facilitate further testing.

AB  - Background: In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), epigenomic and genomic studies have expanded the existing knowledge about the disease biology and led to the identification of potential biomarkers relevant for implementation of personalized medicine. In this study, an attempt has been made to examine and integrate the global DNA methylation changes with gene expression profile and their impact on clinical outcome in early stage CLL patients.
   Results: The integration of DNA methylation profile (n = 14) with the gene expression profile (n = 21) revealed 142 genes as hypermethylated-downregulated and; 62 genes as hypomethylated-upregulated in early stage CLL patients compared to CD19+B-cells from healthy individuals. The mRNA expression levels of 17 genes identified to be differentially methylated and/or differentially expressed was further examined in early stage CLL patients (n = 93) by quantitative real time PCR (RQ-PCR). Significant differences were observed in the mRNA expression of MEIS1, PMEPA1, SOX7, SPRY1, CDK6, TBX2, and SPRY2 genes in CLL cells as compared to B-cells from healthy individuals. The analysis in the IGHV mutation based categories (Unmutated = 39, Mutated = 54) revealed significantly higher mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes in the IGHV unmutated subgroup (p < 0.001). The relative risk of treatment initiation was significantly higher among patients with high expression of CRY1 (RR = 1.91, p = 0.005) or PAX9 (RR = 1.87, p = 0.001). High expression of CRY1 (HR: 3.53, p < 0.001) or PAX9 (HR: 3.14, p < 0.001) gene was significantly associated with shorter time to first treatment. The high expression of PAX9 gene (HR: 3.29, 95% CI 1.172-9.272, p = 0.016) was also predictive of shorter overall survival in CLL.
   Conclusions: The DNA methylation changes associated with mRNA expression of CRY1 and PAX9 genes allow risk stratification of early stage CLL patients. This comprehensive analysis supports the concept that the epigenetic changes along with the altered expression of genes have the potential to predict clinical outcome in early stage CLL patients.

AB  - Background: Group C Rotavirus (RVC) is an enteric pathogen responsible for acute gastroenteritis in children and adults globally. At present there are no surveillance studies on group C Rotaviruses in India and therefore their prevalence in India remains unknown. The present study aimed to evaluate group C rotavirus infection among <5 years old children hospitalized with acute gastroenteritis in New Delhi.
   Methods: A total of 350 fecal specimens were collected during September 2013 to November 2014 from <5 years old diarrheal patients admitted at KSCH hospital, Delhi. The samples found negative for group A rotavirus (N = 180) by Enzyme immunoassay were screened for group C rotavirus by RT-PCR with VP6, VP7 and VP4 gene specific primers. The PCR products were further sequenced (VP6, VP7, VP4) and analyzed to ascertain their origin and G and P genotypes.
   Results: Six out of 180 (group A rotavirus negative) samples were found positive for group C rotavirus by VP6 gene specific RT-PCR, of which 3 were also found positive for VP7 and VP4 genes. Phylogenetic analysis of VP7 and VP4 genes of these showed them to be G4 and P[2] genotypes. Overall, the nucleotide sequence data (VP6, VP7 and VP4) revealed a close relationship with the human group C rotavirus with no evidence of animal ancestry. Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence analysis of various genes also indicated differences in their origin. While the identity matrix of VP4 gene (n = 3) showed high amino acid sequence identity (97.60 to 98.20%) with Korean strain, the VP6 gene (n = 6) showed maximum identity with Nigerian strain (96.40 to 97.60%) and VP7 gene (n = 3) with Bangladeshi and USA strains. This is true for all analyzed samples.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrated the group C rotavirus as the cause of severe diarrhea in young children in Delhi and provides insights on the origin of group C rotavirus genes among the local strains indicating their source of transmission. Our study also highlights the need for a simple and reliable diagnostic test that can be utilized to determine the disease burden due to group C rotavirus in India.

AB  - Editing in microRNAs, particularly in seed can significantly alter the choice of their target genes. We show that out of 13 different human tissues, different regions of brain showed higher adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) editing in mature miRNAs. These events were enriched in seed sequence (73.33%), which was not observed for cytosine to uracil (17.86%) editing. More than half of the edited miRNAs showed increased stability, 72.7% of which had Delta Delta G values less than -6.0 Kcal/mole and for all of them the edited adenosines mis-paired with cytosines on the pre-miRNA structure. A seed-editing event in hsa-miR-411 (with A-C mismatch) lead to increased expression of the mature form compared to the unedited version in cell culture experiments. Further, small RNA sequencing of GBM patients identified significant miRNA hypoediting which correlated with downregulation of ADAR2 both in metadata and qRT-PCR based validation. Twenty-two significant (11 novel) A-to-I hypoediting events were identified in GBM samples. This study highlights the importance of specific sequence and structural requirements of pre-miRNA for editing along with a suggestive crucial role for ADAR2. Enrichment of A-to-I editing in seed sequence highlights this as an important layer for genomic regulation in health and disease, especially in human brain.

AB  - Total choline (tCho) was documented as a biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis by in vivo MRS. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind elevated tCho in breast cancer, an association of tCho with beta-catenin and cyclin D1 was evaluated. Hundred fractions from 20 malignant, 10 benign and 20 non-involved breast tissues were isolated. Cytosolic and nuclear expressions of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 were estimated using ELISA. Higher tCho was seen in malignant compared to benign tissues. Malignant tissues showed higher cytosolic and nuclear beta-catenin expressions than benign and non-involved tissues. Within malignant tissues, beta-catenin and cyclin D1 expressions were higher in the nucleus than cytosol. Cyclin D1 expression was higher in the cytosolic fractions of benign and non-involved than malignant tissues. Furthermore, in malignant tissues, tCho showed a positive correlation with the cytosolic and nuclear expression of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 and also a correlation between nuclear expressions of both these proteins was seen. Higher cytosolic beta-catenin expression was seen in progesterone receptor negative than positive patients. Results provide an evidence of correlation between non-invasive biomarker, tCho and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. The findings explain the molecular mechanism of tCho elevation which may facilitate exploration of additional therapeutic targets for breast cancer.

AB  - The malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is one of the oldest parasites documented to infect humans and has proven particularly hard to eradicate. One of the major hurdles in designing an effective subunit vaccine against the malaria parasite is the insufficient understanding of host-parasite interactions within the human host during infections. The success of the parasite lies in its ability to evade the human immune system and recruit host responses as physiological cues to regulate its life cycle, leading to rapid acclimatization of the parasite to its immediate host environment. Hence understanding the environmental niche of the parasite is crucial in developing strategies to combat this deadly infectious disease. It has been increasingly recognized that interactions between parasite proteins and host factors are essential to establishing infection and virulence at every stage of the parasite life cycle. This review reassesses all of these interactions and discusses their clinical importance in designing therapeutic approaches such as design of novel vaccines. The interactions have been followed from the initial stages of introduction of the parasite under the human dermis until asexual and sexual blood stages which are essential for transmission of malaria. We further classify the interactions as "direct" or "indirect" depending upon their demonstrated ability to mediate direct physical interactions of the parasite with host factors or their indirect manipulation of the host immune system since both forms of interactions are known to have a crucial role during infections. We also discuss the many ways in which this understanding has been taken to the field and the success of these strategies in controlling human malaria.

AB  - Background. Crucial gaps in our understanding of Plasmodium vivax reticulocyte invasion and protective immunity have hampered development of vivax vaccines. P. vivax exclusively invades reticulocytes that is mediated by the P. vivax reticulocyte-binding proteins (PvRBPs) specifically PvRBP2c and PvRBP1a. Vivax infections in Duffy-null individuals have suggested the evolution of alternate invasion pathways that may be mediated by the PvRBPs. Thus, PvRBPs appear as potential targets for efficacious P. vivax neutralization. However, there are limited data validating their vaccine efficacy. In the absence of vivax invasion assays, binding-inhibitory activity of antibodies has been reported to be associated with protection and a measure of vaccine potential.
   Methods. Flow cytometry-based analysis was performed of the PvRBP reticulocyte-binding properties and binding-inhibitory activity of specific anti-PvRBP2c/PvRBP1a human antibodies.
   Results. PvRBP2c and PvRBP1a displayed a distinct reticulocyte-binding specificity, and their specific reticulocyte-binding domains were mapped within their N-terminal regions. Importantly, naturally acquired antibodies against the reticulocyte-binding domains efficaciously blocked reticulocyte binding of native PvRBPs, suggesting that the human immune system produced functional binding-inhibitory antibodies through exposure to vivax malaria.
   Conclusions. Reticulocyte-binding domains of PvRBP2c/ PvRBP1a are targets of naturally acquired binding-inhibitory antibodies, substantiating their promise as candidate antigens against which vaccine-inducible immunity could potentially be boosted through natural infections.

AB  - Background The scale-up of tobacco control, especially after the adoption of the Framework Convention for Tobacco Control, is a major public health success story. Nonetheless, smoking remains a leading risk for early death and disability worldwide, and therefore continues to require sustained political commitment. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) offers a robust platform through which global, regional, and national progress toward achieving smoking-related targets can be assessed.
   Methods We synthesised 2818 data sources with spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression and produced estimates of daily smoking prevalence by sex, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. We analysed 38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burden, as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We then performed a cohort analysis of smoking prevalence by birth-year cohort to better understand temporal age patterns in smoking. We also did a decomposition analysis, in which we parsed out changes in all-cause smoking-attributable DALYs due to changes in population growth, population ageing, smoking prevalence, and risk-deleted DALY rates. Finally, we explored results by level of development using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI).
   Findings Worldwide, the age-standardised prevalence of daily smoking was 25.0% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 24.2-25.7) for men and 5.4% (5.1-5.7) for women, representing 28.4% (25.8-31.1) and 34.4% (29.4-38.6) reductions, respectively, since 1990. A greater percentage of countries and territories achieved significant annualised rates of decline in smoking prevalence from 1990 to 2005 than in between 2005 and 2015; however, only four countries had significant annualised increases in smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2015 (Congo [Brazzaville] and Azerbaijan for men and Kuwait and Timor-Leste for women). In 2015, 11.5% of global deaths (6.4 million [95% UI 5.7-7.0 million]) were attributable to smoking worldwide, of which 52.2% took place in four countries (China, India, the USA, and Russia). Smoking was ranked among the five leading risk factors by DALYs in 109 countries and territories in 2015, rising from 88 geographies in 1990. In terms of birth cohorts, male smoking prevalence followed similar age patterns across levels of SDI, whereas much more heterogeneity was found in age patterns for female smokers by level of development. While smoking prevalence and risk-deleted DALY rates mostly decreased by sex and SDI quintile, population growth, population ageing, or a combination of both, drove rises in overall smoking-attributable DALYs in low-SDI to middle-SDI geographies between 2005 and 2015.
   Interpretation The pace of progress in reducing smoking prevalence has been heterogeneous across geographies, development status, and sex, and as highlighted by more recent trends, maintaining past rates of decline should not be taken for granted, especially in women and in low-SDI to middle-SDI countries. Beyond the effect of the tobacco industry and societal mores, a crucial challenge facing tobacco control initiatives is that demographic forces are poised to heighten smoking's global toll, unless progress in preventing initiation and promoting cessation can be substantially accelerated. Greater success in tobacco control is possible but requires effective, comprehensive, and adequately implemented and enforced policies, which might in turn require global and national levels of political commitment beyond what has been achieved during the past 25 years.

AB  - gamma-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) catalyzes the transfer of the gamma-glutamyl moiety from donor compounds such as L-glutamine (Gin) and glutathione (GSH) to an acceptor. During the biosynthesis of various gamma-glutamyl-containing compounds using GGT enzyme, auto-transpeptidation reaction leads to the formation of unwanted byproducts. Therefore, in order to alter the auto-transpeptidase activity of the GGT enzyme, the binding affinity of Gin should be modified. Structural studies of the Bacillus licheniformis GGT (BlGT) complexed with the glutamic acid has shown that glutamic acid has strong ionic interactions through its alpha-carboxlic group with the guanidine moiety of Arg109. This interaction appears to be an important contributor for the binding affinity of Gln. In view of this, six mutants of Bacillus licheniformis ER15 GGT (BlGGT) viz. Arg109Lys, Arg109Ser, Arg109Met, Arg109Leu, Arg109Glu and Arg109Phe were prepared. As seen from the structure of BlGT, the mutation of Arg109 to Lys109 may reduce the affinity for Gln to some extent, whereas the other mutations are expected to lower the affinity much more. Biophysical characterization and functional studies revealed that Arg109Lys mutant has increased transpeptidation activity and catalytic efficiency than the other mutants. The Arg109Lys mutant showed high conversion rates for L-theanine synthesis as well. Moreover, the Arg109Met mutant showed increased hydrolytic activity as it completely altered the binding of Gin at the active site. Also, the salt stability of the enzyme was significantly improved on replacing Arg109 by Met109 which is required for hydrolytic applications of GGTs in food industries.

AB  - Small leucine-rich proteoglycans are components of extracellular matrix that regulates neoplastic transformation. Among small leucine rich proteoglycans, Decorin, Biglycan and Lumican are most commonly implicated markers, and their expression is well studied in various malignancies. In this novel study, we have collectively evaluated expression of these three molecules in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. Thirty patients of confirmed untreated bladder cancer, 30 healthy controls for blood and 30 controls for adjacent non-tumour tissue were enrolled. Blood was collected from all subjects and tumour/adjacent normal tissue was obtained from the patients. Circulatory levels were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, relative messenger RNA expression by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting. Circulatory levels of Biglycan (p = 0.0038) and Lumican (p < 0.0001) were significantly elevated, and that of Decorin (p < 0.0001) was significantly reduced in patients as compared with controls. Protein expression by immunohistochemistry and western-blotting showed elevated expression of Lumican and Biglycan and lower expression of Decorin in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction for messenger RNA expression from tissue specimens revealed significantly higher expression of Biglycan (p = 0.0008) and Lumican (p = 0.01) and lower expression of Decorin (p < 0.0001) in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. Out of all molecules receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the 0.207 ng/ml cut-off of serum Lumican provided optimum sensitivity (90.0%) and specificity (90.0%). Significant alteration of matrix small leucine-rich proteoglycans in urothelial carcinoma of bladder was observed. Higher expression of Lumican in Bladder cancer patients with the cut-off value of highest optimum sensitivity and specificity shows its importance as a potential non-invasive marker for early detection of UBC following further validation in large patient cohort.

AB  - In India, research prioritization in Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health and Nutrition (MNCHN) themes has traditionally involved only a handful of experts mostly from major cities. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-INCLEN collaboration undertook a nationwide exercise engaging faculty from 256 institutions to identify top research priorities in the MNCHN themes for 2016-2025. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method of priority setting was adapted. The context of the exercise was defined by a National Steering Group (NSG) and guided by four Thematic Research Subcommittees. Research ideas were pooled from 498 experts located in different parts of India, iteratively consolidated into research options, scored by 893 experts against five pre-defined criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, investment and innovation) and weighed by a larger reference group. Ranked lists of priorities were generated for each of the four themes at national and three subnational (regional) levels [ Empowered Action Group & North-Eastern States, Southern and Western States, & Northern States (including West Bengal)]. Research priorities differed between regions and from overall national priorities. Delivery domain of research which included implementation research constituted about 70 per cent of the top ten research options under all four themes. The results were endorsed in the NSG meeting. There was unanimity that the research priorities should be considered by different governmental and non-governmental agencies for investment with prioritization on implementation research and issues cutting across themes.

AB  - Cyclin dependent kinases (CDK) are key factors in promoting the initiation and development of tumors. These kinases are important for maintenance of mitochondrial biogenesis and imbalance in their expression in old age may lead to the oxidative stress. Lung cancer (LC), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are two very prominent cancers in older Indians. Both the cancers are showing increasing trend in older population. The present study assessed serum concentration of one of the kinases; CDK4 in older LC and HNSCC patients.
   The study included 100 subjects each of LC and HNSCC; and older subjects without cancer or any major health problems as controls. Serum CDK4 concentration was estimated using real-time label-free Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and was verified by western blot.
   Significant elevation in serum CDK4 was observed in cases with LC and HNSCC compared to controls. HNSCC patients with higher CDK4 expression had distinctly shorter survival than patients with comparatively lower CDK4 expression. No such difference was observed in LC patients. The germ line mutation study of this gene in Exon-2 was performed and none was observed among cases and controls.
   It can be concluded that older patients with HNSCC and lung cancer have raised serums CDK4 levels, which has the potential to emerge as a biomarker in clinical practice.
