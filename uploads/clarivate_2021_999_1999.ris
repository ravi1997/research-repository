AB  - Background and aims: Hemorrhagic stroke (HS) results in significant mortality and disability worldwide. Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) is responsible for blood pressure regulation and vascular homeostasis. Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis for ascertaining the association of ACE I/D polymorphism with HS since a number of studies depicted inconclusive evidence. Methods: Literature search was performed till July 10, 2020 in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Chinese National Knowledge Information and Google Scholar databases with keywords: ('Angiotensin Converting Enzyme' OR 'ACE') AND ('Single Nucleotide polymorphisms' OR 'SNP') AND ('Hemorrhagic stroke or 'HS'). Pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were determined for gene-disease association using either fixed (when I2 < 50%) or random effect (when I2 > 50%) models. Risk of bias in studies was assessed using funnel plots and sensitivity analyses. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA version 13.0 software. Results: A total of 53 studies having 5186 HS and 7347 healthy control subjects were included in our metaanalysis. Pooled analyses showed that ACE I/D gene polymorphism had significant association with risk of HS in overall study population [(dominant model: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.12-1.50 & recessive model: OR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.46-2.20)]. Population subgroup analyses further revealed significant relationship of ACE I/D polymorphism with ICH in Asians (recessive: OR 1.97, 95% CI = 1.57-2.47) but not in Caucasians (recessive: OR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.76-1.36). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that ACE I/D polymorphism may lead to risk of HS and can be a potential biomarker for HS susceptibility especially in Asian population.

AB  - MicroRNAs as cancer biomarkers in serum, plasma, and other body fluids are often used but analysis of miRNA in urine is limited. We investigated the expression of selected miRNAs in the paired urine, serum, cervical scrape, and tumor tissue specimens from the women with cervical precancer and cancer with a view to identify if urine miRNAs could be used as reliable non-invasive biomarkers for an early diagnosis and prognosis of cervical cancer. Expression of three oncomiRs (miR-21, miR-199a, and miR-155-5p) and three tumor suppressors (miR-34a, miR-145, and miR-218) as selected by database search in cervical pre-cancer, cancer, and normal controls including cervical cancer cell lines were analyzed using qRT-PCR. The expression of miRNAs was correlated with various clinicopathological parameters, including HPV infection and survival outcome. We observed a significant overexpression of the oncomiRs and the downregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs. A combination of miR-145-5p, miR-218-5p, and miR-34a-5p in urine yielded 100% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity in distinguishing precancer and cancer patients from healthy controls and it well correlates with those of serum and tumor tissues. The expression of miR-34a-5p and miR-218-5p were found to be independent prognostic factors for the overall survival of cervical cancer patients. We conclude that the evaluation of the above specific miRNA expression in non-invasive urine samples may serve as a reliable biomarker for early detection and prognosis of cervical cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intraosseous pneumatocyst refers to gas-filled cystic lesions inside bone. Whereas ilium and sacrum are the commonest locations for pneumatocysts, vertebral pneumatocysts are rare. Various theories have been proposed to explain the etiopathogenesis of vertebral pneumatocysts and the most widely accepted theory is the extension of air from intervertebral disc or joint spaces into the pneumatocyst cavity. The aim of this systematic review was to study all the cases of vertebral pneumatocyst reported in the literature to -nderstand this rare disease and its clinical importance. METHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases was performed to retrieve case reports and case series describing the cases of pneumatocyst. RESULTS: A total of 61 cases of incidentally reported vertebral pneumatocyst were included in the systematic review. The mean age of the patients was 57.82 +/- 10.2 years (range, 31-89 years). The mean size of the pneumatocysts was 8.67 +/- 4.18 mm (range, 2-20 mm). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pneumatocyst increased with increasing age, with most of the reported patients belonging to the 50-70 years age-group. Most of these patients have large pneumatocysts with degenerative changes in spine. Another less common subset of young patients with small pneumatocysts without associated degenerative changes has also been described. Pneumatocysts were most common in the cervical spine, with C5 being the most commonly affected vertebra. Most of the pneumatocysts remain stable in size on follow-up, although 3 cases of enlarging pneumatocyst have also been reported. An enlarging pneumatocyst should be closely followed up, although its benign nature has been reported in the literature.

AB  - Twitter is a free, open access social media platform that is widely used in medicine by physicians, scientists, and patients. It provides an opportunity for advocacy, education, and collaboration. However, it is likely not utilized to its full advantage by many disciplines in medicine, and pitfalls exist in its use. In particular, there has not been a review of Twitter use and its applications in the field of neurology. This review seeks to provide an understanding of the current use of Twitter in the field of neurology to assist neurologists in engaging with this potentially powerful application to support their work.

AB  - Iron is implicated in ocular diseases such as in age-related macular degeneration. Light is also considered as a pathological factor in this disease. Earlier, two studies reported the influence of constant light environment on the pattern of expressions of iron-handling proteins. Here, we aimed to see the influence of light in 12-h light-12-h dark (12L:12D) cycles on the expression of iron-handling proteins in chick retina. Chicks were exposed to 400 lx (control) and 5000 lx (experimental) light at 12L:12D cycles and sacrificed at variable timepoints. Retinal ferrous ion (Fe2+) level, ultrastructural changes, lipid peroxidation level, immunolocalization and expression patterns of iron-handling proteins were analysed after light exposure. Both total Fe2+ level (p = 0.0004) and lipid peroxidation (p = 0.002) significantly increased at 12-, 48- and 168-h timepoint (for Fe2+) and 48- and 168-h timepoint (for lipid peroxidation), and there were degenerative retinal changes after 168 h of light exposure. Intense light exposure led to an increase in the levels of transferrin and transferrin receptor-1 (at 168-h) and ferroportin-1, whereas the levels of ferritins, hephaestin, (at 24-, 48- and 168-h timepoint) and ceruloplasmin (at 168-h timepoint) were decreased. These changes in iron-handling proteins after light exposure are likely due to a disturbance in the iron storage pool evident from decreased ferritin levels, which would result in increased intracellular Fe2+ levels. To counteract this, Fe2+ is released into the extracellular space, an observation supported by increased expression of ferroportin-1. Ceruloplasmin was able to convert Fe2+ into Fe3+ until 48 h of light exposure, but its decreased expression with time (at 168-h timepoint) resulted in increased extracellular Fe2+ that might have caused oxidative stress and retinal cell damage.

AB  - We evaluated the clinical histories, motor and pulmonary functions, cardiac phenotypes and GAA genotypes of an Indian cohort of twenty patients with late onset Pompe disease (LOPD) in this multi-centre study. A mean age at onset of symptoms and diagnosis of 9.9 +/- 9.7 years and 15.8 +/- 12.1 years respectively was identified. All patients had lower extremity limb-girdle muscle weakness. Seven required ventilatory support and seven used mobility assists. Of the four who used both assists, two received ventilatory support prior to wheelchair use. Cardiac involvement was seen in eight patients with various combinations of left ventricular hypertrophy, tricuspid regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, dilated ventricles with biventricular dysfunction and aortic regurgitation. Amongst 20 biochemically diagnosed patients (low residual GAA enzyme activity) GAA genotypes of 19 patients identified homozygous variants in eight and compound heterozygous in 11: 27 missense, 3 nonsense, 2 initiator codon, 3 splice site and one deletion. Nine variants in 7 patients were novel. The leaky Caucasian, splice site LOPD variant, c.-32 -13T > G mutation was absent. This first study from India provides an insight into a more severe LOPD phenotype with earlier disease onset at 9.9 years compared to 33.3 years in Caucasian patients, and cardiac involvement more than previously reported. The need for improvement in awareness and diagnosis of LOPD in India is highlighted. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of tympanoplasty in treating chronic otitis media-related hearing loss, published literature was systematically reviewed to determine the clinical success rate of tympanoplasty at restoring hearing in chronic otitis media patients at a minimum follow-up period of 12-months.
   Data Sources: PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library.
   Methods: Two independent reviewers performed literature searches. Publications reporting long-term (>= 12-month) hearing outcomes and complications data on adult and pediatric patients with chronic otitis media were included and assessed for risk of bias and strength of evidence. To assess how tympanoplasty influences long-term hearing outcomes, data on pure tone audiometry (air-bone gap) and complications were extracted and synthesized.
   Results: Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Data from 3162 patients indicated that 14.0% of patients encountered postoperative complications. In adult patients, mean weighted air-bone gap data show closure from 26.5 dB hearing level (HL) (preoperatively) to 16.1 dB HL (postoperatively). In studies that presented combined adult and pediatric data, the mean preoperative air-bone gap of 26.7 dB HL was closed to 15.4 dB HL. In 1370 patients with synthesizable data, 70.7% of patients had a postoperative air-bone gap < 20 dB HL at long-term follow-up. Finally, subgroup analysis identified that mean improvement in ABG closure for patients with and without cholesteatoma was 10.0 dB HL and 12.4 dB HL, respectively.
   Conclusion: In patients with chronic otitis media, tympanoplasty successfully closed the air-bone gap to within 20 dB HL in 7/10 cases and had an overall complication rate of 14.0%.

AB  - The role of medial septum in the genesis of slow-wave sleep and the inhibition of rapid eye movement sleep has been established using neurotoxic lesion and chemical stimulation of the medial septum. Intracerebroventricular injection of endocannabinoids (anandamide) decreases wake and increases slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep in rats. Central cannabinoid (CB1) receptors are localized in the rat medial septum; however, the role of cannabinoid receptors at the medial septum on the regulation of sleep-wakefulness in rats lacks evidence. In this study, we have examined the changes in sleep architecture of 21 male Wistar rats, divided into three groups. Initially, 6 rats were used for dose standardization. Subsequently, one group (n = 6) was microinjected with CB1 receptor agonist, R-(+)-WIN 55,212-2 mesylate salt, the second group (n = 6) received microinjection of CB1 receptor antagonist LY 320,135, and the third group (n = 5) was microinjected with the vehicle, DMSO at the medial septum using stereotaxy. The sleep-wake cycle was recorded using electroencephalogram, electrooculogram, and electromyogram. Microinjection of CB1 receptor agonist at the medial septum decreased slow-wave sleep and increased total sleep time. The increase in total sleep time was due to an increased percentage of rapid eye movement sleep. After the third and fourth hour of CB1 receptor antagonist micminjection at the medial septum, slow-wave sleep decreased when compared to vehicle injection, while rapid eye movement sleep decreased compared to baseline. We conclude that the endocannabinoid system at the septal nucleus acts through CB1 receptors to increase rapid eye movement sleep in rats.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionary conserved 'stress-response' proteins that facilitate cell survival against various adverse conditions. HSP-mediated cytoprotection was hitherto reported to occur principally in two ways. Firstly, HSPs interact directly or indirectly with apoptosis signaling components and suppress apoptosis. Secondly, through chaperon activity, HSPs suppress proteotoxicity and maintain protein-homeostasis. Recent studies highlight the interaction of HSPs with cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs). SGs are conserved cytoplasmic mRNPs granules that aid in cell survival under stressful conditions. We primarily aim to describe the distinct cell survival strategy mediated by HSPs as the crucial regulators of SGs assembly and disassembly. Based on the growing evidence, HSPs and associated co-chaperones act as important determinants of SG assembly, composition and dissolution. Under cellular stress, as a 'stress-coping mechanism', the formation of SGs reprograms protein translation machinery and modulates signaling pathways indispensable for cell survival. Besides their role in suppressing apoptosis, HSPs also regulate protein-homeostasis by their chaperone activity as well as by their tight regulation of SG dynamics. The intricate molecular signaling in and around the nexus of HSPs-SGs and its importance in diseases has to be unearthed. These studies have significant implications in the management of chronic diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases where SGs possess pathological functions.

AB  - This randomized clinical trial investigates whether fortification of expressed breast milk by preterm formula powder is noninferior to fortification by human milk fortifier, in terms of short-term weight gain, in very low-birth-weight neonates
   Importance Fortification of expressed breast milk (EBM) using commercially available human milk fortifiers (HMF) increases short-term weight and length in preterm very low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. However, the high cost and increased risk of feed intolerance limit their widespread use. Preterm formula powder fortification (PTF) might be a better alternative in resource-limited settings. Objective To demonstrate that fortification of EBM by preterm formula powder is noninferior to fortification by HMF, in terms of short-term weight gain, in VLBW neonates. Design, Setting, and Participants Open-label, noninferiority, randomized trial conducted from December 2017 to June 2019 at a level 3 neonatal unit in India. The trial enrolled preterm (born at or before 34 weeks of gestation) VLBW neonates receiving at least 100 mL/kg/d of feeds and consuming 75% of milk or more as EBM. Interventions Neonates were randomly assigned to receive fortification by either PTF or HMF. Calcium, phosphorus, iron, vitamin D, and multivitamins were supplemented in PTF and only vitamin D in the HMF group to meet the recommended dietary allowances. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the weight gain until discharge from the hospital or 40 weeks' postmenstrual age, whichever was earlier; the prespecified noninferiority margin was 2 g/kg/d. Secondary outcomes included morbidities such as necrotizing enterocolitis, feed intolerance, and extrauterine growth restriction (<10th percentile on the Fenton chart at 40 weeks' postmenstrual age). Results Of the 123 neonates enrolled, 60 and 63 were randomized to the PTF and HMF groups, respectively. The mean gestation (30.5 vs 29.9 weeks) and birth weight (1161 vs 1119 g) were comparable between the groups. There was no difference in the mean (SD) weight gain between the PTF and HMF groups (15.7 [3.9] vs 16.3 [4.0] g/kg/d; mean difference, -0.5 g/kg/d; 95% CI, -1.9 to 0.7). The lower bound of 95% CI did not cross the noninferiority margin. The incidence of feed intolerance was lower in the PTF group (1.4 vs 6.8 per 1000 patient-days; incidence rate ratio 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.95), and fewer neonates required withholding of fortification for 24 hours or more (5% vs 22%; risk ratio, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.75). The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis stage II or more (0 vs 5%) and extrauterine growth restriction (73% vs 81%) was comparable between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance Fortification with preterm formula powder is not inferior to fortification with human milk fortifiers in preterm neonates. Given the possible reduction in feed intolerance and lower costs, preterm formula might be a better option for fortification, especially in resource-restricted settings.
   Question Is fortification of expressed breast milk by preterm formula powder noninferior, in terms of weight gain, to fortification by a commercially available human milk fortifier? Findings In this noninferiority trial enrolling 123 neonates at less than 34 weeks of gestation, the mean weight gain in the preterm formula group was 15.7 g/kg/d and in the human milk fortifier group was 16.3 g/kg/d. The difference was not significant and did not reach the prespecified noninferiority margin, and the incidence of feed intolerance was significantly lower in the preterm formula group. Meaning Preterm formula powder might be a better alternative for breast milk fortification in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - Objective: Lumbar synovial cysts (LSC) are one of the manifestations of spinal degenerative cascade. Spinal stenosis or presence of instability in these patients can lead to various symptoms and surgery is indicated following failure of non-operative management for symptomatic synovial cysts. Surgery when performed consists of either decompression with resection of cyst with our without fusion. The efficacy and complications of minimally invasive techniques using tubular retractors (microscopic or endoscopic) in comparison to traditional open techniques remain to be studied. Methods: A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve studies describing the use of minimal invasive techniques using tubular retractors (both microscopic and endoscopic) in patients with LSC. Meta-analysis with subgroup analysis and metaregression was done. Results: Twenty articles were selected for the systematic review and meta-analysis with total of 388 patients. Eighty-six percent of patients (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 80-90%) had favorable outcome as per Macnab's criteria (excellent and good outcome) with the pooled standard mean difference between preoperative and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) being -4.44 (95% CI -8.78 to -0.10, p-value=0.0474, I2 82%). The pooled percentage change in visual analogue scale (VAS) after surgery was 76.5% (95% CI 66.9-84%, I2 82%). The pooled proportion of incidental durotomies, cyst recurrence and patients requiring operation being 8% (95% CI 5-11%, I2 0%), 4% (95% CI 2-7%, I2 0%,) and 5% (95% CI 3-9%) respectively. Studies were homogeneous with an I2 value of 0%. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in the outcome rates or complication rates between the microscopic and endoscopic subgroups. Conclusion: Minimally invasive techniques for the resection of LSC is a safe and effective alternative to traditional surgical approaches with no difference between the microscopic and endoscopic approaches.

AB  - Background Habitat heterogeneity clearly distinguished in terms of availability of food and habitat resources and landscape features (natural or human-modified) play a crucial role in the avian species composition and population structure. To examine this, a study was carried out in Bhubaneswar, India, to understand the ecological niche distinction in birds based on habitat heterogeneity. Regular sampling was conducted in 30 sampling sites covering six different habitat types in a predominantly urban landscape of Bhubaneswar for understanding the ecological niche in birds. The birds were classified into 11 types of foraging guilds. Results The insectivorous guild had the highest bird species richness (181 species) and the omnivorous guild had the lowest (11 species). The piscivorous guild and wetland habitat had the strongest linkage, followed by the insectivorous guild and agricultural land. The frugivorous guild was significantly correlated with forest habitats (r = 0.386, p < 0.01) and park and garden habitats (r = 0.281, p < 0.01). This urban area hosted a higher number of bird species in certain habitat types, viz., agricultural lands (52%, 115 species) and forest patches (50%, 111 species). Conclusion The present study highlights the importance of agricultural lands, forest patches, parks and gardens, and wetlands inside the cityscape for supporting avifauna. It is therefore suggested that such habitats should be conserved inside an urban area to protect native avifauna. Thus, the city development plan must invariably include strategies for conserving the forest patches inside the urban area. Measures must be taken to restrain the degradation of agricultural lands and reduce their utilization for non-agricultural purposes, which will help in further reducing the bird population decline in the urban landscape.

AB  - Objective Investigators have extensively explored the short-term safety and efficacy data on Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) in mCRPC patients. However, scarce literature is reported on the long-term outcome of these patients. The current goal of this study is focused on the long-term outcome of mCRPC patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT.
   Methods Among 135 patients, 121 mCRPC patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT at 6 to 12-week intervals. Primary endpoint included overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints involved progression-free survival (PFS), predictive factors of OS and PFS, PSA response rate, molecular response, clinical response, and toxicity assessment.
   Results The median administered cumulative activity was 20 GBq (3.7-37 GBq). The median follow-up duration was 36 months (6-72 months). The estimated median PFS and OS were 12 months (mo) (95% CI: 10.3-13 mo) and 16 mo (95% CI: 13-17 mo), respectively. Any PSA decline and PSA decline >50% was achieved in 73% and 61% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed only failure to achieve >50% PSA decline as a significant factor associated with a poor PFS. Prognostic factors associated with reduced OS included, failure to experience >50% PSA decline, heavily pre-treated patient cohort who received >2 lines of prior treatment options, and patient sub-group treated with >= 2 lines of chemotherapy. Patients re-treated with additional treatment options after attaining Lu-177-PSMA refractory disease showed a remarkably prolonged OS. A significant clinical benefit was achieved post Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. The most common toxicities observed were fatigue (34.7%), followed by nausea (33%), and dry mouth (24.7%).
   Conclusion The current study supports the short-term safety and efficacy results of high response rates, prolonged PFS and OS, improved quality of life, and low treatment-related toxicities in patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.

AB  - Objective: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is known for its recurrent relapse despite various surgical and non-surgical treatments. Vascular Endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor expression on tissue is reported to be raised in RRP, and anti-VEGF targeted treatment is being explored to decrease recurrences. This study aims to identify the patients most suitable for systemic anti-VEGF therapy.
   Methods: The study design was a prospective cohort evaluation. The study group included all consecutive cases of RP treated surgically from November 2016-June 2019. Tissue receptor expression and serum levels of VEGF were assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA assay. Control samples for normal levels obtained by serum samples of healthy individuals and tissue samples obtained from healthy non-inflamed peripheral tissue of laryngectomy specimens. The tissue expression and serum levels of VEGF were compared with various diseaserelated factors of RP.
   Results: 32 cases of RRPs were included in the study with a median age of 20.85 years (range: 3-60 years). The glottis was involved in all patients and tracheobronchial involvement was seen among 6 patients (18.75%). The systemic and tissue expression of VEGF-A was significantly higher among cases than controls (p= <0.001). The serum level of VEGF-A was significantly higher among cases with higher Derkay's score (>20) (p = 0.02) and tissue expression of VEGF-A was significantly higher in tracheobronchial RRP (p = 0.04).
   Conclusion: Patients of RP with tracheobronchial involvement and high Derkay's score with strong tissue receptor expression & high serum level of VEGF can be identified as the patients wherein anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody treatment is more likely to be effective and merits further investigation to prove this.

AB  - Both ethnicity and age are important determinants of musculoskeletal health. We aimed to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia, assess the suitability of current diagnostic guidelines, and explore muscle-bone relationships in adults from India. A total of 1009 young (20-35 years) and 1755 older (> 40 years) men and women from existing studies were collated and pooled for the analysis. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measured areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at the hip and spine, and fat and lean mass; hand dynamometer measured hand grip strength (HGS). Indian-specific cut-points for appendicular lean mass (ALM), ALM index (ALMI) and HGS were calculated from young Indian (-2SD mean) populations. Sarcopenia was defined using cut-points from The Foundations for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), revised European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2), Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS), and Indian-specific cut-points. Low lean mass cut-points were then compared for their predictive ability in identifying low HGS. The relationship between muscle variables (ALM, ALMI, HGS) and aBMD was explored, and sex differences were tested. Indian-specific cut-points (men-HGS:22.93 kg, ALM:15.41 kg, ALMI:6.03 kg/m(2); women-HGS:10.76 kg, ALM:9.95 kg, ALMI:4.64 kg/m(2)) were lower than existing definitions. The Indian-specific definition had the lowest, while EWGSOP2 ALMI had the highest predictive ability in detecting low HGS (men:AUC = 0.686, women:AUC = 0.641). There were sex differences in associations between aBMD and all muscle variables, with greater positive associations in women than in men. The use of appropriate cut-points for diagnosing low lean mass and physical function is necessary in ethnic populations for accurate sarcopenia assessment. Muscle-bone relationships are more tightly coupled during ageing in Indian women than men.

AB  - This paper discusses the structural orientations and the physico-chemical properties of a single crystal of 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidinium hydrogen (2R,3R)-tartrate 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (2ADT). The experimental investigation of the properties of the compound improves the potential for the utilization of the crystalline compound in the fabrication of optical limiting and nonlinear optical devices. For the growth process, an organic nonlinear optical crystal of 2ADT is synthesized conventionally at varying molar concentrations to achieve an excellent yield. The structural orientations and refinements of the compound are identified and discussed with reference to a single crystal X-ray diffraction study and its supporting computations. The results of the experimental analysis via UV-vis-NIR spectrometry and a z-scan setup with a laser beam source are used in an in-depth discussion on the linear and nonlinear optical properties of the crystal together with its damage threshold induced by a Nd:YAG laser beam at 1064 nm. With optical transparency of 55% in the entire visible region, a lower cut-off wavelength at 228 nm, and a bandgap at 5.2 eV, the crystal was demonstrated to be suitable for use in optical device fabrication. The thermogravimetrically assessed thermal stability of 2ADT was examined up to 147 degrees C. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters responsible for activation reactions are also discussed because these give information about the material's thermal behavior. An optical limiting study revealed that the transmitted output power increases linearly with the input power at about 1.89 mW cm(-2).

AB  - Background: Pycnodysostosis is an autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia with easily recognizable clinical features and marked molecular heterogeneity. In this study, we explored the clinical and molecular spectrum of 25 Indian patients with pycnodysostosis from 20 families.
   Methods: Clinical information was collected on a predesigned clinical proforma. Sanger method was employed to sequence all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the CTSK gene. Novel variants were systematically assessed by prediction softwares and protein modelling. The pathogenicity of variant was established based on ACMGAMP criteria. An attempt was also made to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation and devise a diagnostic scoring system based on clinical and radiological findings.
   Results: Consanguinity and positive family history were present in 65% (13/20) and 45% (9/20) of the families respectively. Short stature and fractures were the predominant presenting complaints and was evident in 96% (24/25) and 32% (8/25) of affected individuals respectively. Gestalt facial phenotype and acro-osteolysis were present in 76% (19/25) and 82.6% (19/23) of the individuals respectively. Hepatosplenomegaly was present in 15% (3/20) of the individuals with one of them having severe anaemia. Causative sequence variations were identified in all of them. A total of 19 variants were identified from 20 families amongst which 10 were novel. Homozygous variants were identified in 90% (18/20) families. Amongst the novel variants, there was a considerable proportion (40%) of frameshift variants (4/10). No significant genotype-phenotype correlation was noted. Scoring based on clinical and radiological findings led to the proposal that a minimum of 2 scores in each category is required in addition to high bone density to diagnose pycnodysostosis with certainty.
   Conclusion: This study delineated the genotypic and phenotypic characterisation of Indian patients with pycnodysostosis with identification of 10 novel variants. We also attempted to develop a clinically useful diagnostic scoring system which requires further validation.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop, characterize and evaluate novel water soluble formulation for its topical and intrastromal application. Natamycin complexed with cyclodextrin was characterized by Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The complexed powder was used to formulate 1% w/v aqueous natamycin formulation (Natasol 1%) for topical use. The developed formulation was subjected to stability testing at various conditions. Single and multi-dose trans-corneal permeation of Natasol 1% was evaluated in New Zealand Albino rabbits in comparison with marketed 5% natamycin suspension. Sterile unpreserved Natasol (0.01% w/v natamycin) formulation was also developed for intrastromal injection. Both formulations were evaluated for the ocular toxicity. FTIR and DSC studies revealed successful complexation of natamycin that further protected the degradation at various stability conditions. Single dose trans-corneal permeation studies revealed that Natasol 1% attained Cmax at one hr and maintain its intraocular concentration 5 and 2.5 times higher at 4th and 6th hr compared to 5% natamycin suspension. Multidose kinetics revealed the steady state pharmacokinetics after hourly and two hourly dosing schedules. Topical Natasol 1% and sterile unpreserved Natasol 0.01% intrastromal injection, did not show any ocular toxicity in the animals. To conclude, the newly developed topical 1% w/v natamycin formulation was found to be non-inferior to 5% natamycin topical suspension. It is expected to increase patient compliance for the treatment of fungal keratitis.

AB  - Background: Magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) is a relatively novel technique to treat essential tremor (ET). The objective of this review was to analyze the efficacy and the safety profile of MRgFUS for ET.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was done. The post procedure changes in the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor (CRST) score, hand score, disability and quality of life scores were analyzed.
   Results: We found 29 studies evaluating 617 patients. DTI based targeting was utilized in six cohorts. A significant difference was observed in the pooled standard mean difference between the pre and postoperative total CRST score (p-value < 0.001 and 0.0002), hand score (p-value 0.03 and 0.02); and the disability at 12 months (p-value 0.01). Head pain and dizziness were the most in procedure complications. The immediate pooled proportion of ataxia was 50%, while it was 20% for sensory complications, which, respectively, declined to 31 and 13% on long term follow up. A significant reduction (p = 0.03) in immediate ataxia related complications was seen with DTI targeting.
   Conclusion: MRgFUS for ET seems to be an effective procedure for relieving unilateral tremor. Use of DTI based targeting revealed a significant reduction in post procedure ataxia related complications as compared to traditional targeting techniques. Analysis of other complications further revealed a decreasing trend on follow up.

AB  - Introduction: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is secondary to various benign and malignant etiologies. There is a variation in the underlying cause in different demographic settings. The initial clue to the presence of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes is through thoracic imaging modalities. Malignancy (Lung cancer, lymphoma, and extrathoracic cancer) and granulomatous conditions (sarcoidosis and tuberculosis) are the most common causes. For a confident diagnosis, the clinician must choose from several available options and integrate the clinical, radiological, and pathology findings. An accurate diagnosis is necessary for optimal management. Areas covered: We performed a search of the PUBMED database to identify relevant articles on the causes, imaging modalities, and interventional modalities to diagnose these conditions. We discuss a practical approach toward the evaluation of a patient with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Expert opinion: Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Treating physicians need to be aware of the clinico-radiological manifestations of the common diagnostic entities. Selecting an appropriate tissue diagnosis modality is crucial, with an intent to use the least invasive technique with good diagnostic yield. Endosonographic modalities (EBUS-TBNA, EUS-FNA, and EUS-B-FNA) have emerged as the cornerstone to most patients' diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis translates into favorable treatment outcomes.

AB  - The liver is a central organ in the human body, coordinating several key metabolic roles. The structure of the liver which consists of the distinctive arrangement of hepatocytes, hepatic sinusoids, the hepatic artery, portal vein and the central vein, is critical for its function. Due to its unique position in the human body, the liver interacts with components of circulation targeted for the rest of the body and in the process, it is exposed to a vast array of external agents such as dietary metabolites and compounds absorbed through the intestine, including alcohol and drugs, as well as pathogens. Some of these agents may result in injury to the cellular components of liver leading to the activation of the natural wound healing response of the body or fibrogenesis. Long-term injury to liver cells and consistent activation of the fibrogenic response can lead to liver fibrosis such as that seen in chronic alcoholics or clinically obese individuals. Unidentified fibrosis can evolve into more severe consequences over a period of time such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. It is well recognized now that in addition to external agents, genetic predisposition also plays a role in the development of liver fibrosis. An improved understanding of the cellular pathways of fibrosis can illuminate our understanding of this process, and uncover potential therapeutic targets. Here we summarized recent aspects in the understanding of relevant pathways, cellular and molecular drivers of hepatic fibrosis and discuss how this knowledge impact the therapy of respective disease.

AB  - Objectives: COVID-19 has affected thousands of health care workers worldwide. Suboptimal infection control practices have been identified as important risk factors. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to holistically assess the preventive practices of health care workers related to COVID-19 and identify the reasons for shortcomings therein.
   Methods: The development of the questionnaire involved item generation through literature review, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers and experts, followed by validation through expert opinion, pilot testing and survey. A cross-sectional survey on 147 healthcare workers was done using an online platform and/or interviews in August 2020 in New Delhi, India. Exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation was performed to establish construct validity. Internal consistency of the tool was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
   Results: The developed questionnaire consists of two sections: Section A contains 29 items rated on a five-point Likert scale to assess preventive practices and Section B contains 27 semi-structured items to assess reasons for suboptimal practices. The first section has good validity (CVR = 0.87, S-CVI/Av = 0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.85)
   Conclusions: This questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for holistic assessment of preventive practices and barriers to it among health care workers. It will be useful to identify vulnerable practices and sections in health care settings which would assist policymakers in designing appropriate interventions for infection prevention and control. This will also be useful in future pandemics of similar nature.

AB  - As the world fights with the Coronavirus, most of the hospitals are gearing up for the care of these patients. As most of the attention these days is being given on Coronavirus, the patients suffering from other clinical infections are being neglected. SARS-CoV-2 is being kept as the top differential in patients presenting with fever and respiratory distress. We hereby present a case of patient returning from Indonesia during the pandemic presenting with a history of hepatic, renal dysfunction with fever and cough. Due to the pandemic, the patient's fever and cough outweighed the hepatic and renal dysfunction, and the patient had to undergo dialysis before the final diagnosis of leptospirosis could be made.

AB  - Leptospirosis is considered as one of the most neglected zoonotic tropical diseases. Animals and humans acquire this infection through direct contact with contaminated urine or body fluids of infected animals. This prospective study was undertaken to know the proportion of leptospirosis in pediatric patients presented with acute febrile illness at the Post Graduate Department of Microbiology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Blood samples were collected over a period of one year from January to December 2018 from 70 pediatric patients aged up to 0-12 years presented with febrile illness for 3-14 days. Out of the 70 samples, 7 (10%) samples were found positive by IgM ELISA, 4 (5.7%) samples were positive by MAT and 3(4.3%) were found positive by PCR. Risk factors such as contact with infected animals and contaminated environment were highly associated with seropositivity of leptospirosis. Clinical symptoms such as fever, chills, myalgia, headache, abdominal pain and cough were significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the seropositivity of leptospirosis.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concerns over secondary infections because it has limited treatment options and empiric antimicrobial treatment poses serious risks of aggravating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Studies have shown that COVID-19 patients are predisposed to develop secondary infections. This study was conducted to ascertain the prevalence and profiles of co- & secondary infections in patients at the COVID-19 facility in North India.
   Methods: We studied the profile of pathogens isolated from 290 clinical samples. Bacterial and fungal pathogens were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the Vitek2 (R) system. Additionally, respiratory samples were tested for any viral/atypical bacterial co-infections and the presence of AMR genes by FilmArray test. The clinical and outcome data of these patients were also recorded for demographic and outcome measures analyses.
   Results: A total of 151 (13%) patients had secondary infections, and most got infected within the first 14 days of hospital admission. Patients aged >50 years developed severe symptoms (p = 0.0004) and/or had a fatal outcome (p = 0.0005). In-hospital mortality was 33%.K.pneumoniae (33.3%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by A. baumannii (27.1%). The overall resistance was up to 84%.Majority of the organisms were multidrug-resistant (MDR) harbouring MDR genes.
   Conclusion: A high rate of secondary infections with resistant pathogens in COVID-19 patients highlights the importance of antimicrobial stewardship programs focussing on supporting the optimal selection of empiric treatment and rapid-de-escalation, based on culture reports.

AB  - Purpose: The methods used for the processing of periprosthetic tissues and explanted implants to improve culture outcome especially in biofilm mediated prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are still debated upon. Studies have reported that Dithiothreitol (DTT) pretreatment of infected devices gives similar results as sonication. However, none of them evaluated the DTT treatment of periprosthetic tissues and explanted implants in the same cohort. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of DTT treatment of periprosthetic tissue and explanted implants, as compared to the normal saline treatment of periprosthetic tissues and sonication of explanted implants for the diagnosis of PJI.
   Methods: Seventy-three revision arthroplasty cases were prospectively included in this study. Three to five tissue specimens and the explanted implants were collected from each patient. Periprosthetic tissue samples were processed by both normal saline and DTT treatments. Explanted implants were subjected to both DTT treatment and sonication. Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) PJI criteria was used as the reference standard for the diagnosis of PJI.
   Results: Of the 73 cases enrolled, 34 had PJI and 39 were aseptic failures. The sensitivity of DTT treated periprosthetic tissue culture (PTC) and saline treated PTC was similar (66.6% vs 58.8%, P = 0.25). The specificity of both was 100%. Sonication and DTT treatment of explanted implants showed comparable sensitivity (85.3% vs 82.4%) and specificity (100% vs 97.4%), P > 0.99. Compared to DTT treated PTC, culture of DTT treated explanted implants significantly improved the diagnosis of PJI (P = 0.03).
   Conclusions: We could verify that DTT can be used to improve culture outcome in laboratories where biofilm detaching sonication techniques are not available for infected implants. In addition, we showed that it is possible to use DTT for treating tissue biopsies, but larger studies are required to confirm our findings.

AB  - Purpose: Hospital floors are underappreciated reservoir for microbes; therefore, floor cleaning should warrant reduction of microbial load for decreasing risk of infection transmission and has to be aesthetically acceptable. It was aimed to study the impact of mechanized laundering of floor mops in reducing microbial load compared to manual washing.
   Methods: An interventional study was conducted from January to July 2019 in various inpatient areas of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Culture of floor mops were taken after manual washing (pre-intervention) and mechanized laundering(intervention). During intervention, mops were equally divided into two piles, with one pile soaked in sodium hypochlorite for 15-20 min before mechanized laundering and other were put directly for mechanized laundering. Bacterial load in floor mops was observed in each group.
   Results: Significant difference (P Value 0.001) in bacterial load was observed in manually washed (502 cfu/plate) and mechanized laundering (278 cfu/plate) of floor mops. Presoaking of floor mops with sodium hypochlorite (262 cfu/plate) did not show any significant difference (P-value 0.59) in reduction of bacterial load compared to mops which were cleaned using mechanized laundering (294 cfu/plate). The bacterial load of floor mops which were manually washed showed increase in mean value of microbial load from 609 cfu/plate from day one to 4015 cfu/plate on day five.
   Conclusion: Mechanized laundering of floor mops standardizes the mop cleaning process and brings down the microbial load significantly compared to manual washing. Disinfection of floor mops before mechanized laundering using sodium hypochlorite did not have significant impact on reduction of microbial load.

AB  - Background A novel electromechanical robotic-exoskeleton was designed in-house for the rehabilitation of wrist joint and Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Objective The objective was to compare the rehabilitation effectiveness (clinical-scales and neurophysiological-measures) of robotic-therapy training sessions with dose-matched conventional therapy in patients with stroke. Methods A pilot prospective parallel randomized controlled study at clinical settings was designed for patients with stroke within 2 years of chronicity. Patients were randomly assigned to receive an intervention of 20 sessions of 45 min each, five days a week for four weeks, in Robotic-therapy Group (RG) (n = 12) and conventional upper-limb rehabilitation in Control-Group (CG) (n = 11). We intended to evaluate the effects of a novel exoskeleton based therapy on the functional rehabilitation outcomes of upper-limb and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke as compared to the conventional-rehabilitation. Clinical-scales- Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion, Barthel-Index, Brunnstrom-stage and Fugl-Meyer (FM) scale and neurophysiological measures of cortical-excitability (using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) -Motor Evoked Potential and Resting Motor threshold, were acquired pre- and post-therapy. Results No side effects were noticed in any of the patients. Both RG and CG showed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in all clinical motor-outcomes except Modified Ashworth Scale in CG. RG showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher improvement over CG in Modified Ashworth Scale, Active Range of Motion and Fugl-Meyer scale and FM Wrist-/Hand component. An increase in cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) in RG over CG, as indexed by a decrease in Resting Motor Threshold and increase in the amplitude of Motor Evoked Potential. No significant changes were shown by the contralesional-hemisphere. Interhemispheric RMT-asymmetry evidenced significant (p < 0.05) changes in RG over CG indicating increased cortical-excitability in ipsilesional-hemisphere along with interhemispheric changes. Conclusion Robotic-exoskeleton training showed improvement in motor outcomes and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke. Neurophysiological changes in RG could most likely be a consequence of plastic reorganization and use-dependent plasticity. Trial registry number: ISRCTN95291802

AB  - Despite preclinical success, monotherapies targeting EGFR or cyclin D1-CDK4/6 in Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have shown a limited clinical outcome. Here, we aimed to determine the combined effect of palbociclib (CDK4/6) and afatinib (panEGFR) inhibitors as an effective strategy to target HNSCC. Using TCGAHNSCC co-expression analysis, we found that patients with high EGFR and cyclin D1 expression showed enrichment of gene clusters associated with cell-growth, glycolysis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition processes. Phosphorylated S6 (p-S6), a downstream effector of EGFR and cyclin D1-CDK4/6 signalling, showed a progressive increase from normal oral tissues to leukoplakia and frank malignancy, and associated with poor outcome of the patients. This increased p-S6 expression was drastically reduced after combination treatment with afatinib and palbociclib in the cell lines and mouse models, suggesting its utiliy as a prognostic marker in HNSCC. Combination treatment also reduced the cell growth and induced cell senescence via increasing reactive oxygen species with concurrent ablation of glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates. Finally, our findings in sub-cutaneous and genetically engineered mouse model (K14-CreERtam;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Trp53R172H/+) studies showed a significant reduction in the tumor growth and delayed tumor progression after combination treatment. This study collectively demonstrates that dual targeting may be a critical therapeutic strategy in blocking tumor progression via inducing metabolic alteration and warrants clinical evaluation.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that non-motor symptoms (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) have differential progression patterns that have a different natural history from motor progression and may be geographically influenced. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1607 PD patients of whom 1327 were from Europe, 208 from the Americas, and 72 from Asia. The primary objective was to assess baseline non-motor burden, defined by Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) total scores. Other aims included identifying the factors predicting quality of life, differences in non-motor burden between drug-naive and non-drug-naive treated patients, and non-motor phenotypes across different geographical locations. Mean age was 65.9 +/- 10.8 years, mean disease duration 6.3 +/- 5.6 years, median Hoehn and Yahr stage was 2 (2-3), and 64.2% were male. In this cohort, mean NMSS scores were 46.7 +/- 37.2. Differences in non-motor burden and patterns differed significantly between drug-naive participants, those with a disease duration of less than five years, and those with a duration of five years or over (p <= 0.018). Significant differences were observed in geographical distribution (NMSS Europe: 46.4 +/- 36.3; Americas: 55.3 +/- 42.8; Asia: 26.6 +/- 25.1; p<0.001), with differences in sleep/fatigue, urinary, sexual, and miscellaneous domains (p<less than or equal to>0.020). The best predictor of quality of life was the mood/apathy domain (beta =0.308, p<0.001). This global study reveals that while non-motor symptoms are globally present with severe NMS burden impacting quality of life in PD, there appear to be differences depending on disease duration and geographical distribution.

AB  - 2-amino-5-nitropyridine 4-chlorobenzoic acid (1:1) (2A5NP4CBA), a potentially useful organic adduct compound, has been synthesized and grown as optically transparent single crystals by conventional slow evaporation solution technique (SEST) for the first time in the literature. The formation of new crystalline material was confirmed by the single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis and it belongs to the monoclinic crystal system. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum has been recorded by the KBr pellet technique to determine the various vibrational functional groups in the title material. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HRXRD) analyses have been carried out to reveal the phase purity and crystalline perfection of the grown crystals. The obtained full width at half maximum (FWHM) for (001) plane in the HRXRD spectrum indicates the excellent crystalline quality of the title 2A5NP4CBA single crystal. The recorded UV-Vis-NIR absorption and transmittance spectra reveal that the grown crystal possesses more than 70% of optical transmittance with the cut-off edge at 419 nm. The thermal analysis discloses that the grown crystal possesses good thermal stability of about 187 degrees C. To determine the appropriateness of the grown crystal for the high-power laser application, laser damage threshold (LDT) analysis has been carried out by Nd: YAG laser of wavelength of 1064 nm. The third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) coefficients, such as nonlinear absorption (beta), nonlinear refraction (n(2)), and nonlinear susceptibility (chi((3))), have been evaluated by utilizing a solid-state laser of wavelength 532 nm. The calculated value of chi((3)) is found to be excellent compared to other organic single crystals. The optical limiting threshold of the grown crystal is found to be 7.8 mW/cm(2) when using the solid-state laser of wavelength 532 nm.

AB  - Aim This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of unipolar mania (UM) in a group of patients of bipolar disorder (BD). Additionally, effort was made to evaluate the demographic, clinical and treatment related factors, which distinguish subjects of UM from BD. Methodology Seven hundred and seventy-three patients with BD, of at least 10 years duration, recruited from 14 General Hospital Units of tertiary care centers from India were evaluated for UM. Results The prevalence of UM, varied from 5.4% to 20.3%, depending on the definition used. With the most stringent definition of >= 4 episodes of mania and at least 5 years of follow-up, the prevalence of UM was 5.4%. Compared to patients of BD, who have episodes other than mania too, those with UM had lower proportion of patients with lifetime history of suicide attempts, spent less time in the episodes in their lifetime and had lower severity of residual depressive and manic symptoms. Further, compared to those with episodes other than mania too, those with UM had higher number of manic episodes per year of illness, had higher proportion of patients who had more than five episodes in the lifetime and had higher proportion of those with at least one episode with psychotic symptoms in the lifetime. Conclusion The present study suggests that a small proportion of patients with BD have UM course and this runs a different clinical course compared to that seen in patients with traditionally recognized as BD.

AB  - Backgound: Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) with carditis and chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) may be diffi-cult to differentiate and may lead to missed diagnosis of carditis. We aimed to determine differences between these groups and to develop a new scoring system for this purpose.
   Methods: Children (N = 514; mean age 11.6 +/- 2.8, range 5-18 years; 65% males) enrolled in a RHD registry at a tertiary care centre were studied. Clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic features of acute rheumatic carditis group (N = 126) were compared with chronic RHD group (N = 388). We performed multiple regression analysis and then developed a new scoring system using independent predictors. Accuracy of this scoring system was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.
   Results: Patients with ARF and carditis were younger, more commonly had history of fever, arthritis/arthralgias and had worse NYHA class. On echocardiography, severity of mitral regurgitation, presence of mitral leaflet nodules, mitral valve prolapse and pericardial effusion were more common in ARF group. On multiple regression analysis, following features were found to be independently predictive of ARF with carditis: age-negative association, NYHA class, severity of mitral regurgitation, mitral leaflet nodules, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antistreptolysin titer. Based on these 6 variables, a new scoring system (0-13) was developed. A score of 5 or more was found to be best threshold for diagnosis of carditis (ROC AUC 0.87, sensitivity 76%, specificity 79%).
   Conclusion: A new scoring system based on independent statistical associations appears promising for differentiating ARF with carditis from chronic RHD.

AB  - Introduction: In India, more than a million people die annually due to injuries. Identifying the patients at risk of early mortality (within 24 hour of hospital arrival) is essential for triage. A bilateral Government Australia-India Trauma System Collaboration generated a trauma registry in the context of India, which yielded a cohort of trauma patients for systematic observation and interventions. The aim of this study was to determine the independent association of on-arrival vital signs and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) with 24-hour mortality among adult trauma patients admitted at four university public hospitals in urban India.
   Methods: We performed an analysis of a prospective multicentre observational study of trauma patients across four urban public university hospitals in India, between April 2016 and February 2018. The primary outcome was 24-hour in-hospital mortality. We used logistic regression to determine mutually independent associations of the vital signs and GCS with 24-hour mortality. Results: A total of 7497 adult patients (18 years and above) were included. The 24-hour mortality was 1.9%. In univariable logistic regression, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) and the vital signs systolic blood pressure (SBP), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) had statistically significant associations with 24-hour mortality. These relationships held in multivariable analysis with hypotension (SBP < 90mm Hg), tachycardia (HR > 100bpm) and bradycardia (HR < 60bpm), hypoxia (SpO2 < 90%), Tachypnoea (RR > 20brpm) and severe (3-8) and moderate (9-12) GCS having strong associ-ation with 24-hour mortality. Notably, the patients with missing values for SBP, HR and RR also demon-strated higher odds of 24-hour mortality. The Injury Severity Scores (ISS) did not corelate with 24-hour mortality.
   Conclusion: The routinely measured GCS and vital signs including SBP, HR, SpO2 and RR are indepen-dently associated with 24-hour in-hospital mortality in the context of university hospitals of urban India. These easily measured parameters in the emergency setting may help improve decision-making and guide further management in the trauma victims. A poor short-term prognosis was also observed in patients in whom these physiological variables were not recorded.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Morphological assessment with conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences has limited specificity to distinguish between paragangliomas and schwannomas. Assessing the differences in microvascular properties through pharmacokinetic parameters of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI can provide additional information to aid in this differentiation.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective study on MR characterization of neck masses was performed between January 2017 and March 2019 in our department, out of which 40 patients with head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) (33 lesions) and schwannomas (15 lesions) were included in this analysis. MR perfusion using dynamic axial T1WI fat suppressed fast spoiled gradient recalled sequence with parallel imaging was performed in all the patients, in addition to single-shot turbo spin-echo axial diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and routine MRI. ROI-based method was used to obtain signal-time curves, permeability measurements, and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to differentiate paragangliomas from schwannomas. Statistical analysis was done to assess the significance and establish a cutoff to distinguish between the two entities. The available images of DOTANOC PET/CT (34 lesions) were analyzed retrospectively. Correlations between the perfusion, diffusion, and molecular PET/CT parameters were done.
   Results: Paragangliomas had a higher wash-in rate, wash-out rate, K-trans,K- K-ep, and V-p (p < 0.001); while schwannomas had a higher relative enhancement (p < 0.012), time to peak, time of onset, brevity of enhancement, and V-e (p < 0.001). Among the perfusion parameters, K-ep (area under curve (AUC) 0.994) and V-p (AUC 0.992) were found to have the highest diagnostic value. In diffusion-weighted imaging, paragangliomas had a lower mean ADC compared to schwannomas (p < 0.001). The SUVmax and SUVmean were significantly associated with K-trans, K-ep, and V-p in paragangliomas.
   Conclusion: CE-MRI in addition to DWI-MRI can accurately distinguish HNPGL from schwannoma and may replace the need for any additional imaging and preoperative biopsy in most cases.

AB  - Nosocomial infections are among the major public health concerns, especially during the ongoing Covid19 pandemic. There is a great demand for novel chemical agents that are capable of killing specific pathogens or augmenting the efficiency of existing disinfectants. Herein, we report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization (through FT-IR, HR-MS, SEM, TGA-DSC, CV, UV and SCXRD analyses) of six novel copper(s) complexes, [CuL(4X-An)] (5a-5d), [CuL(An)] (5e), and [CuL(benzhydrylamine)] (5f), and their evaluation as anti-microbial agents against WHO priority pathogens, confirming their possible use in hospital settings. The compounds were synthesized with a Schiff base (H2L) obtained by the condensation reaction of 3-acetyl-6-methyl-2H-pyran-2,4(3H)-dione (DHA) and benzohydrazide and further addition of different p-substituted aniline (An) molecules. Single crystal structure analyses revealed that the aniline derivatives are isostructural to the copper atom in a square planar coordination, while the benzhydrylamine complex forms a dimer (5f), with a square pyramidal coordination geometry for the metal. Time kill kinetics and reduced microbial recovery studies revealed excellent bactericidal action against Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Particularly, the novel compound 5f significantly reduced microbial recovery compared to ethanol-based sanitisers. in fact, addition of 5f to 70% ethanol remarkably synergized the killing with >6-log reduction in microbial burden. Overall, our novel compounds would increase the disinfection efficacy in hospitals and industries, thereby improving the efficiency and minimizing the risk of infections.

AB  - Background Expenditure for rehabilitation following knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis- and rehabilitation-related challenges following discharge to home after surgery is not available in the Indian context. Objectives To estimate cost of rehabilitation and document challenges in following rehabilitation advices, from a patient perspective. Methods We conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study of patients visiting the orthopedic department at a tertiary care public-funded hospital in New Delhi and included those who recently (less than 4 months) underwent primary knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis. A trained physiotherapist not involved in clinical care collected information on expenditures incurred after discharge from hospital, patient's ability to recall the advices given by the physician and challenges they experienced using a semi-structured questionnaire. We report median costs by category of direct and indirect cost and used linear regression to explore determinants of cost. Results We interviewed 82 consecutive patients (mean age 60.8 years and 68% females) with median time since surgery of 28 days. More than half (52%) sought some support for physiotherapy. The median cost of rehabilitation was INR 18,395 (Interquartile-range 11,325-27,775). Direct medical cost contributed to 74% of total cost (32% fee for services, 21% medications and lab investigations, 21% assistive devices). Twenty percent higher costs were incurred among those undergoing bilateral knee surgery after adjusting for age, sex, income, and type of physiotherapy support sought. Challenges were related to recall of advices, not understanding the recovery process and pain management. Conclusion About half patients undergoing knee arthroplasty seek support for rehabilitation after discharge to home contributing to a major portion of expenses incurred during rehabilitation. Cost-effective support mechanism for home-based rehabilitation is required for improving patient rehabilitation experiences.

KW  - ASSESSMENT SCALE
AB  - Background: Disability evaluation as per World Health Organization includes assessment of impairments, activity limitations, and participation restriction, which unfortunately is not assessed by the existing guidelines of disability in India. Aim: The aim of this study wasto comparea new study criterion with the existing guidelines for assessing cognitive disability for chronic neurological conditions. Methodology: A cross-sectional pilot study was conducted on 41 participants. They were assessed on an existing guideline (Gazette India 200,1 assessing physical domain and Intelligence Quotient[IQ]) and study criterion assessing three aspects of cognitive capacity: IQ, neurocognitive functioning, and QOL. Results: The existing guideline underestimated 84% of cases for disability. The average percentage of disability measured by the study criterion was 33.2% more as compared to existing guidelines with S.D of 26.6. Conclusion: Cognitive capacity assessment is an important element to be measured in chronic neurological disability certification. However, a large sample is required to make an affirmative claim for the same.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of anatomic and technical factors on the long-term outcome of CT-guided lumbar sympathectomy in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. Thirty patients (28 men, two women; mean age, 45.8 years) with chronic limb-threatening ischemia and diffuse tibial arterial disease not amenable to revascularization were included. CT-guided lumbar sympathectomy was performed at the L2-L3 level with a 22-gauge Chiba needle and absolute alcohol. Any periprocedural complication was noted. Numeric pain score (1-10 scale) and skin ulcers were assessed before the procedure and 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1 and 2 years after the procedure. According to spread of alcohol, patients were categorized into those with medial spread and those without medial spread (lateral spread group) with the lateral edge of the vertebral body as the reference point. Treatment results were categorized as improved, unchanged, or worsened on the basis of clinical response.
   RESULTS. There were 22 (73.3%) patients in the medial spread group and eight (26.7%) in the lateral spread group. The mean volumes of alcohol injected per side were not significantly different (p=.50). One major complication occurred in the group with medial spread. Mean numeric pain scores before the procedure and 3 weeks, 3 months, and 1 and 2 years afterward were 7.31, 2.95, 2.47, 2.10, and 2.04 in the medial spread group and 6.25, 4.13, 4.50, 4.35 and 4.32 in the lateral spread group (p<.001). At 2 years, 16 patients in the medial spread group and two patients in the lateral spread group showed clinical improvement (p<.001), and the limb salvage rates were 100% and 87.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed a trend in improvement with smoking cessation, but the difference was not statistically significant (p=.15). The direction of spread of the neurolytic agent, however, was a major determinant of outcome.
   CONCLUSION. CT-guided lumbar sympathectomy is a simple, safe, and effective procedure. Ensuring medial spread of the neurolytic agent significantly improves long-term results.

TI  - Reasons for under-reporting of paraquat poisoning in India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - INJURY
AB  - Background. Paraquat is an inexpensive herbicide used in agriculture because it is easily available and the cost of labour for manual clearance of weeds is prohibitive. Paraquat is toxic to human beings and is also used for committing suicide. We studied the reasons for under-reporting of paraquat poisoning including those related to the training of doctors.
   Methods. In this mixed-methods study, we describe a series of patients with paraquat poisoning. We recorded their demographic data, clinical features, treatment and outcome with an intention to explore the reason for an initial misdiagnosis. We also explored whether deficiencies in curricula contributed to the misdiagnosis.
   Results. The patients of paraquat poisoning (n=28) were mostly young illiterate men driven by impulsive behaviour rather than chronic depression. Paraquat was consumed by patients from non-agricultural background as well, implying easy access to the poison. Many patients could not name the agent and so initial treatment was directed at organophosphorus poisoning. The diagnostic signs included paraquat tongue, renal failure and jaundice. Most of the casualty medical officers and residents were unfamiliar with the symptoms and signs of paraquat poisoning as was evident by their answers to the questionnaire. Knowledge of medical students about paraquat poisoning was not assessed in the theory examinations and viva.
   Conclusion. Factors contributing to the limitation in establishing the diagnosis are illiteracy and ignorance of the patients, lack of specific signs and lack of training of medical officers in treating patients with paraquat poisoning.

AB  - Background. Yoga nidra is practised by sages for sleep. The practice is simple to use and has been clearly laid out, but its role in the treatment of chronic insomnia has not been well studied.
   Methods. In this randomized parallel-design study conducted during 2012-16, we enrolled 41 patients with chronic insomnia to receive conventional intervention of cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (n=20) or yoga nidra (n=21). Outcome measures were both subjective using a sleep diary and objective using polysomnography (PSG). Salivary cortisol levels were also measured. PSG was done before the intervention in all patients and repeated only in those who volunteered for the same.
   Results. Both interventions showed an improvement in subjective total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, reduction in total wake duration and enhancement in subjective sleep quality. Objectively, both the interventions improved TST and total wake duration and increased N1% of TST. Yoga nidra showed marked improvement in N2% and N3% in TST. Salivary cortisol reduced statistically significantly after yoga nidra (p=0.041).
   Conclusion. Improvement of N3 sleep, total wake duration and subjective sleep quality occurred following yoga nidra practice. Yoga nidra practice can be used for treatment of chronic insomnia after supervised practice sessions.

AB  - Background: Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) has become an integral part of epilepsy surgery, often used in the localization of the epileptogenic zone. It is an essential modality not only in the evaluation of nonlesional but also lesional drug refractory epilepsy, especially in the presence of anatomo-electro-clinical discordance. Objective: To describe our technique and the operative nuances involved in the performance of robotic SEEG placement. Methods: A 28-year lady with seizure onset at the age of 15 years presented with two types of seizures: one was associated with an aura of chest discomfort, palpitations along with oral and bilateral automatisms. There was associated speech and behavioral arrest along with ictal urinary incontinence. The other type has head turning to the right with secondary generalization lasting up to 1 min. Results: Multimodality investigations showed bilateral temporal origin of seizures. SEEG evaluation revealed left amygdala and anterior temporal neocortical (ATL) origin of seizures. The patient underwent left ATL and amygdalectomy. Histopathology revealed focal cortical dysplasia (FCD type Ib). The patient became seizure free (ILAE Class 1) at 1-year follow up. Conclusion: Robotic-guided SEEG is a safe and accurate method of evaluating complex MRI negative epilepsy.

AB  - Epilepsy affects around 50 million people across the globe and is the third most common chronic brain disorder. It is a non-communicable disease of the brain that affects people of all ages. It is accompanied by depression, anxiety, and substantially increased morbidity and mortality. A large number of third-generation anti-epileptic drugs are available, but they have multiple side-effects causing a decline in the quality of life. The inheritance and etiology of epilepsy are complex with multiple underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Different neurotransmitters play intricate functions to maintain the normal physiology of various neurons. If there is any dysregulation of neurotransmission due to aberrant transmitter levels or their receptor biology, it can result in seizures. In this review, we have discussed the roles played by various neurotransmitters and their receptors in the pathophysiology of epilepsy. Drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) has remained one of the forefront areas of epilepsy research for a long time. Understanding the mechanisms underlying DRE is of utmost importance because of its high incidence rate among epilepsy patients and increased risks of psychosocial problems and premature death. Here we have enumerated various hypotheses of DRE. Further, we have discussed different non-conventional therapeutic strategies, including combination therapy and non-drug treatment. The recent studies supporting the modern approaches for the treatment of epilepsy have been deliberated with particular reference to the mTOR pathway, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and inflammatory pathways.

AB  - Aim: The current study aimed to evaluate the psychological issues among the health-care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: An online survey using Survey Monkey (R) platform was carried out to evaluate depression (using Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (using Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7), and other psychological issues (using a self-designed questionnaire). Results: The study sample comprised 303 participants with a mean age of 41.2 (standard deviation: 11.1) years. A majority of them were male (69%) and married (79.9%). Nearly half (46.2%) of the participants had either anxiety disorder or depression or both and 12.9% of HCW had suicidal behavior. Higher level of anxiety and depression scores were associated with being female, having undergone quarantine, directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, and younger age (<30 years). Higher prevalence of depression and anxiety disorder was seen in younger (<30 years) age group, being a doctor (compared to paramedics). In addition, higher prevalence of depression was seen in those who were directly involved in the care of patients with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: About half of the HCWs are suffering from psychiatric morbidity, specifically anxiety, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need to assess all the HCWs for psychiatric morbidity and provide them with psychological support.

TI  - Gargle lavage & saliva: Feasible & cheaper alternatives to nasal & throat swabs for diagnosis of COVID-19
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background & objectives: In the present scenario, the most common sample for diagnosis of COVID-19 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is nasal and throat swab (NTS). Other sampling options such as gargle lavage have found limited application in clinical use mostly because of unavailability of an appropriate gargling liquid. This study was conducted to assess the stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in normal saline at 4 degrees C that can serve as a gargling liquid as well as a transport medium. The study also looked at the agreement between NTS and gargle lavage/saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Methods: In 29 consecutive real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) positive COVID-19 patients, paired NTS, gargle and saliva samples were taken. Samples were processed by rRT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To assess the SARS-CoV-2 RNA stability in normal saline, gargle lavage specimens were divided into two aliquots; one subset of the specimen was run within 4-6 h along with the routine samples (NTS and saliva) and the other subset was stored at 4 degrees C and processed after 24-30 h. Agreement between cycle threshold (Ct) values from both the runs was compared using Bland-Altman (BA) analysis. Results: The positivity rates of rRT-PCR in NTS, saliva and gargle lavage samples were 82.7 (24/29), 79.3 (23/29) and 86.2 per cent (25/29), respectively. BA plot showed a good agreement between the Ct values of fresh and stored gargle samples, stipulating that there were no significant differences in the approximate viral load levels between the fresh and stored gargle lavage samples (bias: E gene -0.64, N gene -0.51, ORF gene -0.19). Interpretation & conclusions: Our study results show stability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the gargle samples collected using normal saline up to 24-30 h. Gargle lavage and saliva specimen collection are cost-effective and acceptable methods of sampling for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by rRT-PCR. These simplified, inexpensive and acceptable methods of specimen collection would reduce the cost and workload on healthcare workers for sample collection.

AB  - Background: Lichen planus pigmentosus can have a negative impact on the quality of life; however, this has not been studied in detail.
   Objectives: To study the quality of life in patients with lichen planus pigmentosus and compare it with patients with vitiligo and melasma.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary-care center in north India from January 2018 to May 2019. Patients >= 18 years of age with lichen planus pigmentosus (n = 125), vitiligo (n = 113) and melasma (n = 121) completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire and answered a global question on the effect of disease on their lives. In addition, patients with vitiligo completed the Vitiligo Impact Scale (VIS)-22 questionnaire, while those with lichen planus pigmentosus and melasma filled a modified version of VIS-22.
   Results: The mean DLQI scores in patients with lichen planus pigmentosus, vitiligo and melasma were 10.9 +/- 5.95, 9.73 +/- 6.51 and 8.39 +/- 5.92, respectively, the difference being statistically significant only between lichen planus pigmentosus and melasma (P < 0.001). The corresponding mean modified VIS-22/VIS-22 scores were 26.82 +/- 11.89, 25.82 +/- 14.03 and 18.87 +/- 11.84, respectively. This difference was statistically significant between lichen planus pigmentosus and melasma, and between vitiligo and melasma (P < 0.001 for both). As compared to vitiligo, patients with lichen planus pigmentosus had a significantly greater impact on "symptoms and feelings" domain (P < 0.001) on DLQI, and on "social interactions" (P = 0.02) and "depression" (P = 0.04) domains on VIS-22. As compared to melasma, patients with lichen planus pigmentosus had significantly higher scores for "symptoms and feelings," "daily activities," "leisure" and "work and school" domains of DLQI, and all domains of VIS-22. Female gender was more associated with impairment in quality of life in patients with lichen planus pigmentosus, while lower education, marriage, younger age and increasing disease duration showed a directional trend.
   Limitations: Use of DLQI and modified version of VIS-22 scales in the absence of a pigmentary disease-specific quality-of-life instrument.
   Conclusion: Patients with lichen planus pigmentosus have a significantly impaired quality of life. The psychosocial burden of lichen planus pigmentosus is quantitatively similar to that of vitiligo, but significantly greater than melasma.

AB  - Background: Mercaptobenzothiazole compounds are associated with allergic contact dermatitis caused by rubber products. Several screening substances have been used for patch testing.
   Objective: To compare the frequency of positive test reactions to a mercapto mix containing a higher concentration of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole with reactions to the combination of 2-mercaptobenzothiazole 2.0% and mercapto mix 2.0%.
   Methods: There were 7103 dermatitis patients in 12 International Contact Dermatitis Research Group dermatology departments who were patch tested with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole 2.0% petrolatum (pet.), mercapto mix 2.0% pet., and mercapto mix 3.5% pet.
   Results: Contact allergy to the 3 test preparations varied among the 12 centers: 2-mercaptobenzothiazole 2.0% pet. (0-2.4%), mercapto mix 2.0% pet. (0-4.9%), and mercapto mix 3.5% pet. (0-1.4%). 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole 2.0% and mercapto mix 2.0% detected a few more positive patients compared with mercapto mix 3.5%, but the difference was statistically insignificant (mercapto mix 2.0% pet., P = 1.0; 2-mercapto-benzothiazole 2.0% pet., P = 0.66).
   Conclusions: Mercapto mix 3.5% pet. is not better than 2-mercaptobenzothiazole 2.0% and mercapto mix 2.0% by a difference that is significant. By using only 1 test preparation (mercapto mix 3.5%), an additional hapten could be tested. No cases of suspected/proven patch test sensitization were registered.

AB  - Objective Information on etiology of congenital nephrotic syndrome in non-Caucasian populations is limited. This study aimed to determine the genetic basis of congenital nephrotic syndrome in Indian patients. Methods In this observational, cross-sectional study, whole exome sequencing was performed on samples from all children diagnosed with congenital nephrotic syndrome, presenting at centers collaborating in a nationwide registry and biorepository. Analysis was targeted to focus on reported or novel, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 89 genes implicated in etiology of nephrotic syndrome. Sanger sequencing was used to confirm disease-causing variants in patients and allelic segregation of compound heterozygous variants in samples from parents. Inheritance of a shared haplotype was analyzed among ten individuals carrying the most common variant. Results During 2017-2019, 34 patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome were screened. Consanguinity and similar illness in siblings were reported in eleven patients each. Homozygous or compound heterozygous, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were found in NPHS1 in 24 cases, including two novel variants. One patient each had homozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic known or novel variant in NPHS2, PLCE1, OSGEP and LAMB2 genes. Patients with OSGEP and LAMB2 mutations had phenotype typical of Galloway Mowat and Pierson syndromes, respectively. Three variants in NPHS1 were common to 16 individuals. One reported variant in exon 19 (c.2600G>A; p.Gly867Asp) appears to share a common founder. Conclusion A genetic cause was determined for 82.4% patients with congenital nephrotic syndrome. Variants in NPHS1 are most common in Indian patients and founder mutations might be present.

AB  - PURPOSE: To summarize the indications and outcomes of posterior chamber phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) implantation in corneal ectasias including keratoconus, pellucid marginal degeneration (PMD), post-refractive surgery, and post-keratoplasty ectasias.
   METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted using the relevant keywords from various databases up to August 15, 2020. All pertinent studies were reviewed, and the relevant articles were studied in detail for efficacy, stability, predictability, and safety outcomes. In addition, visual quality, corneal biomechanical outcomes, complications, the role of posterior chamber PIOL in combination treatment, and comparison of posterior chamber PIOL with other PIOLs for ectasias were also evaluated.
   RESULTS: A total of 30 relevant studies (13 prospective, 13 retrospective, 4 case reports) on the subject were studied and summarized. All studies showed a favorable refractive outcome. Quality of vision remained unaffected and no significant complications were reported in any of the studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Posterior chamber PIOLs represent a viable option in the treatment of mild to moderate and stable corneal ectasia in patients with contact lens intolerance who have low irregular astigmatism, a clear central cornea, and good preoperative corrected distance visual acuity.

AB  - Introduction: Human Immunodeficiency Virus is a lentivirus that causes human immunodeficiency virus infection and over time, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cluster of Differentiation 4+ T cell count of people living with this infection play a vital role to determine infection progression and necessary treatment changes. This study was conducted to find out the prevalence of low Cluster of Differentiation 4+ T Cell Count in the People Living with human immunodefieciency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted between June to August 2018 in the Human Immunodeficiency virus and Hepatitis Reference Unit of National Public Health Laboratory, Ministry of Health and Population Teku. Ethical approval was taken (Reference Number 2912) and a total of 550 seropositive cases of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 undergoing antiretroviral therapy were studied. Convenient sampling technique was used. Data was analysed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
   Results: Seventeen (3.1%) of patients had Cluster of Differentiation 4+ T cell counts below 100 cells/mm(3) of blood. The mean Cluster of Differentiation 4+ T cell count was 509.3 cells/mm(3) of blood. Of the total samples, 280 (50.9%) were males, 268 (48.7%) were females, and the rest 2 (0.4%) were of other gender.
   Conclusions: Majority of people living with human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were found immune-competent.

AB  - Objectives: Both Zoledronic acid and denosumab have been utilized in neo-adjuvant setting for facilitating surgery and downsizing the lesion in Giant cell tumor (GCT). This study is aimed at comparing Zoledronic acid and Denosumab, when used in neo-adjuvant setting, in terms of radiological and clinical outcomes in GCT undergoing surgical intervention. Patients and Methods: Patients undergoing surgical intervention for GCT who received either denosumab or Zoledronic acid as neoadjuvant agents were retrospectively analyzed for reduction in tumor load radiologically, change in surgical plan after therapy, facilitation of surgery, therapy related complications, cost of treatment, rate of local recurrence and clinical outcomes. Results: Twenty patients received denosumab and 19 patients received Zoledronic acid as neoadjuvant agent. There was no significant difference in radiological outcomes, facilitation of surgery and clinical outcomes at end of follow-up. Zoledronic acid group had lower number of recurrences, however, not statistically significant. Therapy with Zoledronic acid was significantly cheaper (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Zoledronic acid is a cheaper alternative to denosumab in terms of solidification of lesion, reducing recurrence rates and improving clinical outcomes. Larger prospective studies required to further delineate this outcome with Zoledronic acid.

AB  - Background: The study of seizure patterns in electroencephalography (EEG) requires several years of intensive training. In addition, inadequate training and human error may lead to misinterpretation and incorrect diagnosis. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated seizure detection systems hold an exciting potential to create paradigms for proper diagnosis and interpretation. AI holds the promise to transform healthcare into a system where machines and humans can work together to provide an accurate, timely diagnosis, and treatment to the patients. Objective: This article presents a brief overview of research on the use of AI systems for pattern recognition in EEG for clinical diagnosis. Material and Methods: The article begins with the need for understanding nonstationary signals such as EEG and simplifying their complexity for accurate pattern recognition in medical diagnosis. It also explains the core concepts of AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) methods. Results and Conclusions: In this present context of epilepsy diagnosis, AI may work in two ways; first by creating visual representations (e.g., color-coded paradigms), which allow persons with limited training to make a diagnosis. The second is by directly explaining a complete automated analysis, which of course requires more complex paradigms than the previous one. We also clarify that AI is not about replacing doctors and strongly emphasize the need for domain knowledge in building robust AI models that can work in real-time scenarios rendering good detection accuracy in a minimum amount of time.

KW  - RISK
AB  - Background & objectives: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major public health problem in India. Its magnitude is particularly high among the elderly. Old age and comorbidity may lead to misdiagnosis and under treatment of this condition. COPD is not curable; however, various forms of treatment can help control symptoms and improve the quality of life. Most of the earlier studies lacked uniformity in definitions, designs, methodology and reporting techniques. Studies based on spirometry are only a few. Understanding the current prevalence and associated factors of COPD is important for planning control strategies. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the prevalence of COPD and associated factors among the elderly. Methods: In this community-based study among 449 elderly persons in a rural area, information regarding socio-demographic details, selected health conditions and exposure to risk factors was recorded. The assessment of airway obstruction was done by using a portable spirometer (MIR Spirolab). The diagnosis of COPD was based on the GOLD criteria. The association of COPD with sociodemographic and other variables was analysed by the multivariate logistic regression. Results: Acceptable spirometry findings were available for 392 (87.3%) participants. The prevalence of COPD was 42.9 per cent (95% confidence interval 37.9-47.7%). The prevalence was 54.5 per cent among men and 33.4 per cent among women. Smoking, higher age group and low body mass index were significantly associated with COPD. Interpretation & conclusions: The prevalence of COPD was found to be high among the rural elderly in this study. Interventions aimed at cessation of smoking and preparedness of health systems for diagnosis and management of COPD are hence required.

TI  - Clinical profile of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in first & second wave of the pandemic: Insights from an Indian registry based observational study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background & objectives: India witnessed a massive second surge of COVID-19 cases since March 2021 after a period of decline from September 2020. Data collected under the National Clinical Registry for COVID-19 (NCRC) were analysed to describe the differences in demographic and clinical features of COVID-19 patients recruited during these two successive waves. Methods: The NCRC, launched in September 2020, is an ongoing multicentre observational initiative, which provided the platform for the current investigation. Demographic, clinical, treatment and outcome data of hospitalized, confirmed COVID-19 patients were captured in an electronic data portal from 41 hospitals across India. Patients enrolled during September 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021 and February 1 to May 11, 2021 constituted participants of the two successive waves, respectively. Results: As on May 11, 2021, 18961 individuals were recruited in the registry, 12059 and 6903 reflecting in-patients from the first and second waves, respectively. Mean age of the patients was significantly lower in the second wave [48.7 (18.1) yr vs. 50.7 (18.0) yr, P<0.001] with higher proportion of patients in the younger age group intervals of <20, and 20-39 yr. Approximately 70 per cent of the admitted patients were >= 40 yr of age in both waves of the pandemic. The proportion of males were slightly lower in second wave as compared to the first [4400 (63.7%) vs. 7886 (65.4%), P=0.02]. Commonest presenting symptom was fever in both waves. In the second wave, a significantly higher proportion [2625 (48.6%) vs. 4420 (42.8%), P<0.003] complained of shortness of breath, developed ARDS [422(13%) vs. 880 (7.9%), P<0.001], required supplemental oxygen [1637 (50.3%) vs. 4771 (42.7%), P<0.001], and mechanical ventilation [260 (15.9%) vs. 530 (11.1%), P<0.001]. Mortality also significantly increased in the second wave [OR: 1.35 (95% CI: 1.19, 1.52)] in all age groups except in <20 yr. Interpretation & conclusions: The second wave of COVID-19 in India was slightly different in presentation than the first wave, with a younger demography, lesser comorbidities, and presentation with breathlessness in greater frequency.

AB  - Broca?s area, conventionally located in left (categorical) hemisphere of brain, is responsible for integrating linguistic and non-linguistic processing however, functionality of its right homolog remains partly understood and explored. This perception is based on the fact that in 96% of right-handed individuals, who constitute 91% of human population, the left hemisphere is dominant or categorical hemisphere. Here, we introduce novel scientific-based hypothesis that the right homolog of Broca?s region which we observed hyperactive during attention focused meditation, might further play an important role in patients with attention deficits and language and speech disorders. Meditation includes self-regulation practices that focus on attention and awareness to achieve better control on mental processes. The positron emission tomography of brain in twelve (12) apparently healthy male, right-handed long-term meditators showed that the right Broca?s area was significantly hyperactive (p = 0.002) during Meditation vs. Baseline while there was only a subtle increase in the activity of left Broca?s area. Our results suggest that hitherto partly explored and understood right homolog of the Broca?s area (referred to as right Broca?s area) may have some important role, especially during meditation which needs to be explored further.

AB  - Background: There are few studies on basal cell carcinoma (BCC) from India. Long-term follow-up is available in only one study and the aesthetic outcome of treatment has not been evaluated in Indian patients.
   Aims: In this retrospective study on BCC, we compared treatment failure, recurrence rates and aesthetic outcomes on long-term follow-up between surgical excision and repair, and nonsurgical and ablative treatments.
   Methods: Records of patients with BCC treated in the dermatologic surgery clinic over the past 10 years were analyzed. Patients with histopathologically confirmed BCC who could be contacted were evaluated for recurrence, treatment failure, overall satisfaction and aesthetic outcomes by global aesthetic improvement scale.
   Results: Out of 98 patients, 72 were contactable. Four patients received both nonsurgical and ablative treatments and surgical excision and repair sequentially and were excluded. The mean age of patients was 57.9 +/- 15.8 years (24-90 years) and the male: female ratio was 1.6:1. The most common site involved was the face (72.1%) followed by trunk and scalp, and the most common type of BCC was the pigmented superficial type (33.8%), followed by the pigmented noduloulcerative type (16.2%). There was no significant difference between the groups in the number of high-risk cases. The mean follow-up period was 37.1 +/- 31.4 (range, 4-120) months. Fifty one patients were treated with surgical excision and repair, and 17 with nonsurgical and ablative treatments (9-imiquimod, 5-cryotherapy, 4-radiotherapy). Treatment failure was seen in 5 (7.4%) patients, all in the nonsurgical and ablative treatments group (P = 0.0006). Recurrence was seen in 2 (2.9%) patients, both in the surgical excision and repair group (P > 0.05). Mean patient satisfaction was significantly higher with surgical excision and repair, though there was no significant difference in the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale between the groups.
   Limitations: The sample size was low. Only telephonic and pictorial assessments were done where the patient could not come for follow-up.
   Conclusions: Surgical excision and repair was associated with better outcomes than nonsurgical and ablative treatments. Treatment failures and adverse events were high with nonsurgical and ablative treatments. The recurrence rate was low.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the patterns and temporal trends of childhood cancer incidence (0-14 years) in Delhi from 1990 to 2014. Methods The new childhood cancer cases diagnosed between 1990 and 2014 were extracted from the Delhi population-based cancer registry (PBCR). Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to assess the temporal behaviour of new childhood cancer. The magnitude of temporal trend was assessed by estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs). Results The Delhi PBCR registered 12,637 cases (8484 boys and 4153 girls) during 1990-2014. The overall childhood cancer was twice in boys than girls (5.62% vs. 2.78%). The age-standardised incidence rates (ASIRs) of childhood cancer adjusted to the WHO World standard population distribution (year 2000) was 163 per one million in boys and 92 per one million in girls; median age at diagnosis being 6 and 7 years, respectively. Five-top childhood cancer sites was leukaemia, lymphoma, central nervous system (CNS), bone and retinoblastoma. A decreasing linear trend in proportion of new childhood cancer cases to total all age-group cancer was observed in both sexes during this period. The percentage increase in childhood cancer is similar in both sexes from 1990-94 to 2010-14 (97% vs. 93%). Increasing trend in ASIRs of childhood cancer was observed. Conclusion The new childhood cancer cases observed increasing trend during 1990 to 2014. Boys had nearly double the number of childhood cancer cases than girls while population ratio of boys and girls during the same period was 1.14:1.

AB  - Herein, the authors report a case of relapsing polychondritis (RP) presenting as isolated bilateral nodular episcleritis. A 23-year-old male presented to us with bilateral large ocular surface masses for which he had received antitubercular medications. A workup was performed to rule out infective, neoplastic, and immune etiologies, after which the patient was then treated empirically with systemic steroids. No response to steroids was noted, so the lesions were removed surgically. On follow up, he developed redness of both ears sparing the lobules. A biopsy from ear lesions supported the diagnosis of RP. At a follow up of 2 years, the patient is free of any ocular or systemic manifestation. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of RP presenting with bilateral giant nodular episcleritis and treated successfully with surgery. A multidisciplinary approach is essential for the management of such cases. A long-term close follow up is vital for early detection of associated malignancies like multiple myeloma.

AB  - Ocular graft-versus-host disease (oGVHD) occurs as a complication following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and is associated with significant ocular morbidity resulting in a marked reduction in the quality of life. With no current consensus on treatment protocols, management becomes challenging as recurrent oGVHD often refractory to conventional treatment. Most authors now diagnose and grade the disease based on criteria provided by the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference (NIH CC) or the International Chronic oGVHD (ICCGVHD) consensus group. This article will provide an insight into the diagnostic criteria of oGVHD, its classification, and clinical severity grading scales. The inflammatory process in oGVHD can involve the entire ocular surface including the eyelids, meibomian gland, corneal, conjunctiva, and lacrimal system. The varied clinical presentations and treatment strategies employed to manage them have been discussed in the present study. The recent advances in ocular surface imaging in oGVHD patients such as the use of meibography and in vivo confocal microscopy may help in early diagnosis and prognostication of the disease. Researching tear proteomics and identification of novel potential tear biomarkers in oGVHD patients is an exciting field as they may help in objectively diagnosing the disease and monitoring the response to treatment.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the anatomical and functional outcomes of pars plana vitrectomy without encircling band for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments with inferior breaks utilizing 3D heads up viewing system. Method: This prospective, single-center study included 22 consecutive eyes with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachments with only inferior breaks with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) CP2 or less, who underwent pars plana vitrectomy without encircling band, with silicon oil as tamponade. All surgeries were performed by a single surgeon. The single operation success rate was recorded after silicon oil removal. Results: The patient population consisted of 08 women (36%) and 14 men (64%) with a mean age of 56.6 +/- 14.7 years. The mean follow-up period was 8 months. A single break was present in 13 cases (59%), and 2-4 breaks were present in 9 cases (40.9%). The mean time for the surgical procedure was 35 min (range: 25-50). The macula was found to be detached in 19 cases (86.36%) and attached in 3 cases (13.6%). Single operation success rate (SOSR) of vitrectomy, after silicon oil removal without encircling band, for primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with inferior breaks was 95.4%. One case redetached due to PVR changes and underwent re-surgery. Final reattachment was achieved in all 22 cases (100%). Mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) significantly improved from 1.43 +/- 0.59 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) to postoperative BCVA was 0.48 +/- 0.34 logMAR (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Pars plana vitrectomy without encircling band, utilizing 3D heads up the system in RRDs with inferior breaks in eyes with PVR grade C2 or less, provides good outcome.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are aggressive diseases with a dismal patient prognosis. Despite significant advances in treatment modalities, the five-year survival rate in patients with HNSCC has improved marginally and therefore warrants a comprehensive understanding of the HNSCC biology. Alterations in the cellular and non-cellular components of the HNSCC tumor micro-environment (TME) play a critical role in regulating many hallmarks of cancer development including evasion of apoptosis, activation of invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, response to therapy, immune escape mechanisms, deregulation of energetics, and therefore the development of an overall aggressive HNSCC phenotype. Cytokines and chemokines are small secretory proteins produced by neoplastic or stromal cells, controlling complex and dynamic cell-cell interactions in the TME to regulate many cancer hallmarks. This review summarizes the current understanding of the complex cytokine/chemokine networks in the HNSCC TME, their role in activating diverse signaling pathways and promoting tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance development.

AB  - Background: The co-occurrence of alcohol and tobacco dependence is frequently witnessed in treatment settings. It is a challenge for clinicians to treat such patients due to their powerful biological association. Aim: The study is aimed to assess the relationship of Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism with substance intake among individuals who are dependent on both alcohol and tobacco. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study involving patients coming to the outpatient department was planned. Brief information on their sociodemographic and substance use profile was recorded. Genotyping of COMT Val158Met was carried out using established polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. The COMT genotyping was classified based on the presence or absence of Met allele using the dominant model. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test, and Binary logistic regression analysis were performed to analyze the data. Results: The study included 104 alcohol and nicotine co-dependent subjects. More than eighty percent of the participants were educated above secondary level, married, and employed. The allele frequencies of met and Val were found to be 0.23 and 0.77, respectively. Forty percent of the participants reported tobacco-related health problems. The odds of consuming alcohol and nicotine were four times high among Met allele carriers. While the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence and heaviness of smoking index scores were up to four and eight times higher among met allele (odds ratio 4.3 and 8.9, respectively). Conclusion: Patients carrying Met allele are reported to consume higher amounts of alcohol and tobacco and were likely to score high among measures of nicotine dependence. Thus met allele carriers needs additional attention for a successful treatment outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Microsurgical embolectomy though is the oldest known recanalization technique is being dismissed in favor of the latest mechanical endovascular techniques for the management of acute large vessel occlusion. Aim and Objective: We aim to highlight the role of microsurgical embolectomy in the current era of pharmacological and mechanical (endovascular) thrombolysis. Methods: An outline of the microsurgical embolectomy technique is described along with its current indications, advantages, and disadvantages. Results: It carries higher complete (TICI 3) revascularization rates with lower risk of distal embolic events especially in cases with high clot burdens; but is more labor-intensive and has longer reperfusion time in comparison to endovascular methods along with the requirement of highly skilled neurovascular surgeons to perform it quickly. Conclusion: Microsurgical embolectomy is an important indispensable recanalization technique in the armamentarium of vascular neurosurgeons.

AB  - We sought to examine the influence of clinically severe lower respiratory tract infection on pulmonary artery pressure in children having CHD with post-tricuspid left-to-right shunt, as it may have physiological and clinical implications. In a prospective single-centre observational study, 45 children with post-tricuspid left-to-right shunt and clinically severe lower respiratory tract infection were evaluated during the illness and 2 weeks after its resolution. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was estimated non-invasively using shunt gradient by echocardiography and systolic blood pressure measured non-invasively.
   Median pulmonary artery systolic pressure during lower respiratory tract infection was only mildly (although statistically significantly) elevated during lower respiratory tract infection [60 (42-74) versus 53 (40-73) mmHg, (p < 0.0001)]. However, clinically significant change in pulmonary artery systolic pressure defined as the increase of >10 mmHg was present in only 9 (20%) patients. In the absence of hypoxia or acidosis, only a small minority (9%, n = 4) showed significant pulmonary artery systolic pressure rise >10 mmHg. In the absence of hypoxia or acidosis, severe lower respiratory tract infection in patients with acyanotic CHD results in only mild elevation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure in most of the patients.

AB  - Corona virus disease (COVID)-19 is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (commonly referred to as SARS-CoV-2). In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Though the target organ for the virus is primarily the lungs, with the recent understanding of the pathobiology of this disease and the immune dysregulation associated with it, it is now clear that COVID-19 affects multiple organ systems. Several drugs and therapies have been tried or repurposed to combat the wrath posed by this disease. On October 22, 2020, the USA Food and Drug Administration approved remdesivir for use in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older). Several of the drugs being tried against COVID-19 have hepatotoxicity as their potential side effect. This review aims to provide the latest insights on various drugs being used in the treatment of COVID-19 and their effects on the liver.

AB  - Background: A significant proportion of patients with cervical spondylosis can present with atypical symptoms like vertigo, tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vison, palpitations and gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort. The role of ACDF in alleviating these atypical symptoms remains unexplored. Objective: The current study attempts to investigate the role of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in alleviating atypical symptoms associated with cervical spondylosis. Materials and Methods: The patients with cervical spondylosis who underwent ACDF between January 2011 and December 2015 were contacted by phone. Data regarding the severity and frequency of atypical symptoms was collected by a structured questionnaire. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the severity and frequency of these symptoms before the surgery and at last follow up. Results: A total of 467 patients underwent ACDF for cervical spondylosis between January 2011 and December 2015, of which 358 patients were interviewed telephonically. 99 of 358 (27.65%) patients who met the eligibility criteria were included in the final analysis. The severity and frequency of vertigo, headache, nausea, vomiting and GI discomfort significantly improved at last follow-up (P < 0.001) compared to pre-operative period. Significant improvement in hypertension was also seen (P = 0.001). Improvements in severity and frequency of tinnitus (P = 0.083), palpitation (P = 0.317) and blurring of vision (P = 1.00) were not significant. Conclusions: ACDF might improve the atypical symptoms like vertigo, headache, nausea, vomiting and GI discomfort in patients with cervical spondylosis. Some patients also show improvement in hypertension following surgery.

AB  - Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders, accounting for over 13 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries (WHO, 2019). Rehabilitation of cognitive impairments through compensatory training in such patients encompasses a wide range of techniques. However, interventional studies exploring their efficacy remain scarce despite being recommended in various reviews. Further, cultural contexts and other related factors have often been overlooked. We aimed to appraise the existing evidence on internal and external compensatory strategies in patients with epilepsy and identify the gaps and pitfalls in the existing literature for applicability to low resource and literacy settings from a neuropsychological perspective.

AB  - Purpose:Evaluation of circumpapillary vessel density (VD) and perfusion density (PD) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTa) in mild-moderate glaucoma patients having unilateral visual field defects, with their fellow eyes and controls.
   Methods:Both eyes of 24 patients having a definitive nasal step or arcuate scotoma in one hemisphere of one eye only, and 24 controls, underwent OCTa.
   Results:In eyes with a superior field defect, the superior/inferior quadrant ratios, (SQ/IQ) of 3 mm scan of VD and PD were significantly higher in eyes with a superior arcuate scotoma than fellow eyes (P = 0.03,0.02) as also controls, (P = 0.004,0.001). The mean percentage loss of inferior quadrant VD between control to fellow eyes, and superior nasal step eyes were similar, 20.19%/19.57% respectively, P = 0.85, while a loss in arcuate scotoma eyes was 38.81% (P = 0.001). The percentage decrease in inferior quadrant PD in fellow eyes was 14.70%, superior nasal step 23.39%, and an arcuate scotoma 34.74% (P = 0.02). Eyes with a superior nasal step had significantly lower VD and PD absolute values in the inferior quadrant OCTa in 3 mm and 6 mm circle scan only as compared to control eyes, VD, P = 0.03,0.04/PD, P = 0.008,0.02. Fellow eyes of superior field defects had significantly lower VD and PD absolute values in the inferior quadrant in 3 mm and 6 mm circle scan as compared to control eyes, VD, P = 0.006,0.04/PD, P = 0.01,0.03. Eyes with an isolated inferior field defect in only one eye, showed a significant decrease in both VD and PD in all quadrants as compared to fellow eyes and control eyes. A significant positive correlation was found between VD and RNFL thickness in peripapillary superior unaffected quadrants in eyes with superior field defects and inferior unaffected quadrants in inferior defects (P = 0.001 and 0.01).
   Conclusion:There was a statistically significant increasing SQ/IQ ratio and percentage loss of vascular parameters from control to fellow eyes, those with a superior nasal step, and those with a superior arcuate scotoma. Inferior VFDs appeared to be associated with a more generalized circulatory loss. The asymmetry between hemispheres and between eyes could be used as a biomarker for early glaucomatous neuropathy.

AB  - BackgroundTo understand how to improve the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors in uveal melanoma (UM), we need a better understanding of the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, their relation with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and their prognostic relevance in UM patients. Materials and methodsExpression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was assessed in 71 UM tissue samples by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and further validated by western blotting. The effect of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on PD-1/PD-L1 expression was determined on four UM cell lines. ResultsImmunoreactivity of PD-1 was found in 30/71 cases and of PD-L1 in 44/71 UM samples. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were found in 46% of UM tissues. PD-1 was expressed on TILs while tumor cells expressed PD-L1. UM with and without TILs showed expression of PD-1 in 69% and 18% cases, respectively (p=0.001). Similarly, PD-L1 was found in 75% of UM with TILs and in 50% of cases without TILs, respectively (p=0.03). DFS rate were lower in patients with TILs with expression of PD-1 and PD-L1, but the rate of DFS was higher with expression of PD-L1 in patients without TILs. After treatment of UM cell lines with IFN-gamma, PD-1 expression was induced in all UM cell lines whereas PD-L1 expression was found at a lower level in untreated cells, while expression also increased following treatment with IFN-gamma .ConclusionOur study suggests that increased infiltration with TILs promotes the aggressive behavior and suppresses the immune response of UM cells, thereby inhibiting immunotherapy.

AB  - Justification Steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) is one of the most common chronic kidney diseases in children. These guidelines update the existing Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology recommendations on its management. Objective To frame revised guidelines on diagnosis, evaluation, management and supportive care of patients with the illness. Process The guidelines combine evidence-based recommendations and expert opinion. Formulation of key questions was followed by review of literature and evaluation of evidence by experts in two face-to-face meetings. Recommendations The initial statements provide advice for evaluation at onset and follow up and indications for kidney biopsy. Subsequent statements provide recommendations for management of the first episode of illness and of disease relapses. Recommendations on the use of immunosuppressive strategies in patients with frequent relapses and steroid dependence are accompanied by suggestions for step-wise approach and plan of monitoring. Guidance is also provided regarding the management of common complications including edema, hypovolemia and serious infections. Advice on immunization and transition of care is given. The revised guideline is intended to improve the management and outcomes of patients with SSNS, and provide directions for future research.

TI  - Acute critical care course for interns to develop competence
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. All medical graduates must know how to stabilize and manage critically ill patients. A 2-day intensive course, called the acute critical care course (ACCC), was conducted to train interns in technical and non-technical skills for managing a patient whose condition is deteriorating. This analysis aims to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of ACCC for interns.
   Methods. We developed and conducted the ACCC to train interns. It included lectures and skill stations. Twenty-four interns participated in the course. Immediate, post-course, quantitative and qualitative feedback was taken online. Qualitative information was also collected verbally and later by email. These data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyse and report the patterns of responses and behaviour.
   Results. The average score for the utility of the course was 4.7 and for the skill stations it was 4.6 on a scale of 5. The qualitative analysis of the feedback emphasized the need for the course before the clinical posting and more skill- based modules rather than lectures. The interactive style of teaching and training in communication using role-play was appreciated. Few suggestions to improve the course were provided.
   Conclusions. Implementing the ACCC needed simulation, interactive discussions, role-play, modified Pendleton's feedback, and reflective exercise that form the basis of a range of educational principles. The blended learning set of objectives of ACCC were the pillars for this successful internship training programme.

   Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) expresses prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and PSMA PET/CT scan may be used for its imaging. Also, the precise diagnosis of residual/recurrent JNA after surgical treatment remains difficult with conventional contrast MRI and/or CT; functional imaging with PSMA PET/CT promises greater accuracy in the detection or exclusion of recurrent/residual JNA. Patients and Methods
   In this prospective study, 22 postoperative JNA patients who underwent a PSMA PET/CT scan both preoperatively and postoperatively from January 2018 to September 2020 were included. All patients underwent a low-dose head and neck spot PET/CT imaging. Abnormal postcontrast enhancement of a definite lesion was considered residual/recurrent tumor in contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI). In PSMA PET/CT, any abnormal uptake apart from physiological sites in the head and neck was considered as residual lesions. Radiological results were categorized as negative, suspicious for residual lesions, or definite residual/recurrent tumors. PSMA PET/CT findings were considered as the radiological standard, and patients were managed accordingly. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were separately calculated for CEMRI and PSMA PET/CT for diagnosing residual lesions. Results
   On postoperative CEMRI evaluation, 12 patients had residual tumors, 2 had normal suspicious scans, and 8 had normal postoperative scans. On PSMA PET/CT, only 7 patients had residual tumors and 15 had normal postoperative scans. In 1 patient with a residual tumor on both scans, a discrepancy was noted concerning tumor extent, and PSMA PET/CT accurately mapped the tumor. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CEMRI were 100%, 53.33%, 41.67%, and 100%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PSMA PET/CT were 100% for all parameters. Conclusions
   Because CEMRI is oversensitive and less specific compared with PSMA PET/CT, Postoperative Angiofibroma Radionuclide Imaging Study (PARIS) protocol should be used always. In residual tumors, PSMA PET/CT has an outright advantage over CEMRI in the diagnosis, tumor mapping, decision making, planning stereotactic radiation, and aiding in future follow-ups.

AB  - Objectives
   Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) expresses different somatostatin cell surface receptors and Ga-68 [DOTA, 1-Nal3]-octreotide (DOTANOC)-PET/computed tomography (CT) scan may be used for its imaging. Also, functional imaging with DOTANOC-PET/CT may promise of greater accuracy in the detection or exclusion of recurrent/residual JNA.
   Methods
   In this prospective study, five JNA patients who underwent a DOTANOC-PET-CT scan both preoperatively and postoperatively during June 2018-March 2020 were included. Postcontrast enhancement of a definite lesion was considered residual/recurrent tumor in contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI). In DOTANOC-PET/CT, any abnormal uptake apart from physiological sites was considered as residual lesions. Radiological results were categorized as negative, suspicious or definite residual/recurrent tumors. Any discrepancy was resolved by endoscopic biopsies.
   Results
   Preoperatively all five cases of JNA showed avid DOTANOC expression in the tumor. The mean (SD) value of DOTANOC standardised uptake value in the tumor was 4.3 (1.4) (range = 2.1-6.2). In postoperative CEMRI evaluation, three of five patients had residual tumors and two had normal scans. On DOTANOC-PET/CT, two of five patients had residual tumors and three had normal scans. In one patient with residual tumor, the discrepancy with regard to tumor extent was noted in two scans, and further biopsy confirmed the findings of DOTANOC-PET/CT as accurate.
   Conclusion
   Ga-68-DOTANOC-PET/CT uptake is universal in JNA and appears to be more specific in the identification of residual/recurrent JNA. In residual tumors, DOTANOC-PET/CT may have an advantage over CEMRI in the diagnosis, decision making and planning stereotactic radiation. However, these findings are to be validated in studies with larger patients.

AB  - Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the leading cancers with poor disease survival rate. Herein, we explored molecular basis, in silico identification and in vitro verification of genes associated with OSCC. Five gene expression series including, GSE30784, GSE13601, GSE9844, GSE23558 and GSE37991 were screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were enriched by cluster Profiler. Further, protein-protein interaction network was analysed and hub genes were verified. A total of 6476 (up-regulated: 2848; down-regulated: 3628) DEGs were identified among OSCC patients and healthy controls. Gene Ontology analysis indicated DEGs enrichment in cellular motility, invasion and adhesion processes. KEGG analysis revealed enrichment of PI3K-Akt signalling, focal adhesion and regulation of actin cytoskeleton pathways. Subsequently, nine DEGs including APP, EHMT1, ACACB, PCNA, PLAU, FST, HMGA2, LAMC2 and SPP1 were correlated with TCGA expression data along with significant association towards patient's survival, recognized as hub genes. This dysregulated mRNA signature of genes was validated in two OSCC cell lines with an anti-cancer agent, fisetin. Fisetin inhibited the expression of APP, EHMT1, PCNA, PLAU, FST, HMGA2, LAMC2, SPP1 and upregulated the expression of ACACB gene which were associated with growth inhibition of both the OSCC cell lines. The regulatory effect of fisetin supported crucial role of nine hub genes identified in OSCC. This study signified that hub genes and pathways might influence the aggressiveness of OSCC. Thus, the proposed hub genes could be potential diagnostic biomarker and drug targets for OSCC.

TI  - Cranioplast fabrication in a comatose patient: A clinical report
T2  - JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY
AB  - Cranioplasty may be necessary after decompressive craniectomies to aid in the restoration of the esthetic, morphological, functional, and psychosocial stability of those affected. This clinical report describes the management of a comatose road traffic accident victim with a history of autogenous cranial implant failure after decompressive craniectomy. The challenges posed by the nonambulatory state of the patient and his inability to follow commands were overcome by using reverse engineering and rapid prototyping to fabricate a 3D patient-specific polymethylmethacrylate cranial implant. A digital evaluation technique with grids as measuring tools was successfully implemented in the patient?s absence. The use of a custom clamp flask aided in the accommodation and subsequent investing, dewaxing, and polymerization of the carved cranial wax pattern. As a result, a custom cranioplast with optimum marginal fit, acceptable contour, adequate thickness, and reduced surgical duration of placement was obtained through a successful combination of conventional and digital techniques.

AB  - Introduction: Though the submandibular gland (SMG) is routinely sacrificed for several reasons during neck dissection in patients undergoing curative surgery for oral cavity cancers, it might be an innocent bystander and should be considered for preservation. This study aimed to identify the incidence, different patterns of invasion, and risk factors of SMG involvement in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
   Methods: This was a retrospective study of the patients who underwent upfront curative surgery for a biopsyproven oral cavity SCC. A consistent protocol-based treatment strategy was followed during the study period. Data about clinical profile including demographics, clinical and histology details, and treatment profile were extracted and analysed.
   Results: A total of 303 patients underwent unilateral and bilateral neck dissections contributing 79.2% (n = 240) and 20.8% (n = 63) of patients respectively. The common primary sites were buccal mucosa (n = 129, 42.5%), tongue (n = 100, 33.0%) and alveolar gingiva (n = 52, 17.2%). A total of four SMGs showed tumor involvement resulting in a prevalence of 1.09% per neck dissection (n = 366) and 1.32% per patient (n = 303). Of these four cases of SMG involvement, one patient with alveolar cancer had direct tumor invasion while the other three (alveolar cancer-two, tongue cancer-one) patients had neck node metastasis.
   Conclusion: The present study confirms a very low incidence of SMG involvement in patients with oral cavity cancer who undergo neck dissection. It is often observed in patients with high neck node burden (>= N2 disease and the presence of extracapsular spread) or direct invasion by the primary tumor.

AB  - The present study was carried out to compare the proteomic profiles of spermatogenic cells of crossbred and zebu cattle in an effort to understand the possible reasons for a higher incidence of sub-fertility in crossbred bulls. The spermatogenic cells collected from the testes of pre-pubertal (6 mo) and adult (24 mo) crossbred and zebu males through fine needle aspiration were proliferated in vitro, and proteomic profiling was done using a shotgun proteomics approach. The age-and species-specific variations in the expression level of proteins were identified in spermatogenic cells. The number of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified in pre-pubertal zebu and crossbred was 546, while 579 DEPs were identified between adult zebu and crossbred bulls. Out of these, 194 DEPS were common to these groups and 40 DEPs displayed a fold change >2. However, only 20 proteins exhibited similar expression variation trends (upregulated or downregulated) among pre-pubertal as well as adult zebu and crossbred bulls. Out of these 20 DEPs, 13 proteins were upregulated, and 7 proteins were downregulated in spermatogenic cells of zebu compared to crossbred bulls. Among the upregulated proteins were RPLP2, PAXIP1, calumenin, prosaposin, GTF2F1, TMP2, ubiquitin conjugation factor E4A, COL1A2, vimentin, protein FAM13A, peripherin, GFPT2, and GRP78. Seven proteins that were downregulated in zebu bulls compared to crossbred included APOA1, G patch domain-containing protein 1, NAD P transhydrogenase mitochondrial, glutamyl aminopeptidase, synaptojanin 1 fragment, Arf GAP with SH3 domain ANK repeat and PH domain-containing protein 1, and protein transport protein sec16B. It was inferred that the proteins associated with sperm function and fertilization processes, such as calumenin, prosaposin, vimentin, GRP78, and APOA1 could be studied further to understand the precise cause of subfertility in crossbred bulls.

AB  - Pregnancy in humans is a multi-step complex physiological process comprising three discrete events, decidualization, implantation and placentation. Its overall success depends on the incremental advantage that each of the preceding stages passes on to the next. The success of these synchronized sequels of events is an outcome of timely coordination between them. The pregnancy events are coordinated and governed primarily by the ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone, which are essentially ligand-activated transcription factors. It's well known that intercellular signaling of steroid hormones engages a plethora of adapter proteins that participate in executing the biological functions. This involves binding of the hormone receptor complex to the DNA response elements in a sequence specific manner. Working with Drosophila melanogaster, the heat shock proteins (HSPs) were originally described by Ferruccio Ritossa back in the early 1960s. Over the years, there has been considerable advancement of our understanding of these conserved families of proteins, particularly in pregnancy. Accumulating evidence suggests that endometrial and uterine cells have an abundance of HSP27, HSP60, HSP70 and HSP90, implying their possible involvement during the pregnancy process. HSPs have been found to be associated with decidualization, implantation and placentation, with their dysregulation associated with implantation failure, pregnancy loss and other feto-maternal complications. Furthermore, HSP is also associated with stress response, specifically in modulating the ER stress, a critical determinant for reproductive success. Recent advances suggest a therapeutic role of HSPs proteins in improving the pregnancy outcome. In this review, we summarized our latest understanding of the role of different members of the HSP families during pregnancy and associated complications based on experimental and clinical evidences, thereby redefining and exploring their novel function with new perspective, beyond their prototype role as molecular chaperones.

AB  - Purpose We have consistently observed a connective tissue lining over the intercondylar notch's roof (CTLINR) during arthroscopic surgeries of the knee joint. As there is a strong association of the intercondylar fossa with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), we believe that this tissue must be having some role in the functioning of the ACL. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate the anatomic characteristics of the CTLINR. Methods In this observational anatomical study, we have investigated the gross anatomical and histological features of the CTLINR in four knees of two fresh frozen non-embalmed cadavers. We have also studied its ultrastructural characteristics by obtaining an arthroscopic biopsy of the tissue from a patient undergoing ACL reconstruction. Results At gross examination, the CTLINR had a typical glistening white surface with transversely oriented fibres. It entirely covered the roof of the intercondylar notch and was soft to touch. Histological examination with haematoxylin-eosin stain revealed fibro-collagenous tissue with intervening blood vessels. Transmission electron microscopy manifested loosely arranged collagen fibres of variable diameter. Conclusion The histological and electron microscopic characteristics of the tissue differentiate it from the ACL and its femoral enthesis, suggesting that it was a distinct anatomical structure. As it entirely covered the roof of the intercondylar fossa and had a smooth surface and soft consistency, it may protect the reconstructed ACL from graft abrasion. Furthermore, as it had a characteristic arthroscopic appearance, future research can investigate its role in femoral tunnel positioning.

AB  - Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a smoking-related highly aggressive neuroendocrine cancer, is characterized by rapid cell proliferation, early metastatic dissemination, and early relapse due to chemoresistance to first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy. Genomically, SCLC tumors show nearly universal loss of TP53 and RB1 tumor suppressor genes, while gene expression signature classifies them into 4 distinct subgroups based on the expression patterns of lineage transcription factors - ASCL1/ASH1, NEUROD1, YAP-1, and POU2F3. Due to the lack of targetable molecular alterations and clinically useful diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarker, there is insignificant progress in the therapeutic management of SCLC patients. Numerous studies have shown a significant involvement of non-coding RNAs in the regulation of cell proliferation, invasion and migration, apoptosis, metastasis, and chemoresistance in various human cancers. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating the aforementioned biological process in SCLC. For this, we searched the scientific literature and selected studies that have evaluated the role of miRNAs in the disease pathogenesis or as a cancer biomarker in SCLC. Our review suggests that several miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of SCLC mainly by regulating cell proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance. Few studies have also demonstrated the clinical utility of miRNAs in monitoring response to chemotherapy as well as in predicting survival outcomes. However, more in-depth mechanistic studies utilizing in vivo models and multicentric studies with larger patient cohorts are needed before the applications of miRNAs as therapeutic targets or as biomarkers are translated from the laboratory into clinics.

AB  - Background The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to present an overview of the role of Ac-225-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-targeted alpha therapy (TAT) as a salvage treatment option in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
   Methods A systematic literature review was performed in databases such as Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the website; until December 2020. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. All original articles, including retrospective, prospective, hand-searched articles, and clinical trials, were searched, and appropriate data were included for the analysis. The study's primary endpoint assessed therapeutic efficacy by biochemical response assessment criteria (any prostate-specific antigen [PSA] decline and >50% PSA decline from the baseline) after Ac-225-PSMA-TAT. The secondary endpoints included assessing overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), molecular response, and therapy-related adverse events across all the studies. The values were expressed as pooled proportions and demonstrated graphically by forest plots using the random-effects model.
   Results After the data extraction and filtration process, a total of three publications, including 141 patients, were included for the final analysis. The pooled proportion of patients demonstrating any PSA decline and greater than 50% PSA decline were 83% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77%-89%) and 59% (95% CI: 42%-76%), respectively. The pooled proportions for OS was 81% (95% CI: 74%-89%). The pooled proportion of patients who have shown complete molecular response are 17% (95% CI: 5%-29%). The median PFS was 12 months (interquartile range: 8.2-14.4 months). Across the studies, the most common side effects from Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT were xerostomia/dry mouth, which pertained to Gr I-II in 63.1% (89 of 141), followed by fatigue in 44.5% (45 of 101) of patients. Grade I-II and III anemia was noted in 48.5% (49 of 101) and 6% (6 of 101), respectively. Grade III leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were negligible: 0.9% (1 of 101) and 0.9% (1 of 101), respectively. Similarly, grade III nephrotoxicity was also observed only in 5 of 101 (5%) patients.
   Conclusion Treatment with Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT demonstrated biochemical response, improved survival, caused low treatment-related toxicity proving a promising salvage treatment option in mCRPC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebral vasospasm is a common complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Many drugs have been tried to mitigate cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia. Cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, is a promising agent in preventing cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH. The objective of this article was to ascertain the effect of cilostazol on cerebral vasospasm after aSAH by performing meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
   METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed, and all the eligible randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.
   RESULTS: A total of 454 articles were identified using the search criteria. Six articles were selected for systematic review and the 4 randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled odds ratio for symptomatic vasospasm, new-onset infarct, and angiographic vasospasm was 0.35 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.21-0.59; P < 0.0001), 0.38 (95% CI, 0.21-0.66; P = 0.0007) and 0.49 (95% CI, 0.31-0.80; P = 0.004), respectively. The pooled risk ratio for unfavorable outcome was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.37-0.74; P = 0.0003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Cilostazol decreases the prevalence of symptomatic vasospasm, new-onset infarct, and angiographic vasospasm when administered after aSAH. Trial sequential analysis increased the precision of our results because the defined thresholds of effect were met by the available studies. However, further studies involving patients from other geographic areas are required to confirm the generalization of the results.

AB  - Esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF) is one of the common congenital anomalies occurring in newborns. Over the last eight decades, various technical modifications have been proposed in the surgical repair of EA-TEF. Preservation of azygos vein is one such modification that has gained considerable attention. However, a consensus statement regarding the superiority of its preservation over its division is lacking. We aim to compare the outcomes of surgery between the two groups of newborns, i.e., those undergoing repair with and without azygos vein preservation, in terms of its complications. The authors systematically searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus through December 2020. The incidence of anastomotic complications and chest infection was compared among the two groups of newborns, i.e., those undergoing surgical repair with (group A) and without azygos vein preservation (group B). Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model, and pooled risk ratio (RR) and heterogeneity (I-2) were calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. Six comparative studies, consisting of a total of 671 newborns, were included in the meta-analysis. As compared to group B, newborns belonging to group A showed a significantly lower incidence of pneumonitis in the postoperative period (RR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17-0.57, p = 0.0001). However, no significant difference in the incidence of anastomotic complications including anastomotic leak (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.48-1.12, p = 0.15) and stricture (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.36-1.09, p = 0.10) was observed between the two groups. The average Downs and Black scale scores ranged from 20 to 24. The risk of bias was low (n = 1) and moderate (n = 5) in the included studies. Kappa statistics showed a value of 0.902 (p < 0.001), highlighting an almost perfect agreement among the two observers. The present meta-analysis revealed the superiority of surgical repair of EA-TEF performed with preservation of azygos vein in terms of the incidence of postoperative chest infection. However, no significant difference in the occurrence of anastomotic leak and stricture was observed between the two groups. The level of evidence of the published comparative studies is limited. Therefore, well designed, randomized controlled trial utilizing a standardized operative approach on a larger sample-size needs to be conducted for optimal comparison between the two approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opinions vary regarding optimal treatment of unstable hangman's fractures. Recent technological advances have allowed short segment, motion preserving fixation, even in complex cases. The aim of the study was to demonstrate C1-C2 motion-preserving short-segment fusion in hangman's fracture and the evolution of technique from pedicle realignment to pedicle reformation in complex fractures with resorbed/destroyed C2 pedicles.
   METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Patients operated by a single surgeon at a tertiary level center from 2012 to 2018 were included. The type of fracture, operating time, and blood loss was recorded. Neurologic deficits were recorded using the American Spinal Injury Association scale with regular clinicoradiologic follow-up.
   RESULTS: Nine patients (8 male), with a mean age of 36 +/- 16.9 years were included. In the initial 7 patients, C2 pedicle screw, C3-C4 lateral mass screw, and rod fixation was done. The last 2 patients were complex neglected injuries, with 1 having severe angulation and displacement and the other having spondyloptosis with C2 body placed anterior to C4 body. In both these patients, direct C2 body screw were placed and pedicle reconstruction was done. Mean follow up was 41.4 +/- 29.8 months. All 5 patients with preoperative neurologic deficits had improvement in power. C1-C2 joint motion was preserved in all. All patients had bony fusion.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preservation of motion at the C1-C2 joint should be the goal in all surgically managed hangman's fracture patients. The technique of C2 pedicle reconstruction can be utilized for the same in old neglected hangman's fractures.

AB  - National estimates on tobacco and alcohol consumption are insufficient to guide policy at the sub-national level. This study assessed the sex-stratified prevalence of different types of smoking and smokeless tobacco and alcohol consumption among adults aged 15-49 using the National Family Health Survey (2015-16) at sub-national administrative units. Three-level logistic regression models were applied to quantify the variation at districtand community-level in smoking and consumption of smokeless tobacco and alcohol. A higher prevalence of smoking, smokeless tobacco and alcohol consumption was observed among men. The study found that the considerable unexplained variations in two different forms of tobacco and alcohol consumption among men attributed to between-population differences at district-level and community-level. The between-population differences were even larger at the district- and community-level in tobacco and alcohol consumption among women. Continious assessment of tobacco and alcohol consumption at lower administrative units and the development of evidence-based localised cessation interventions must be integrated with health policy to reduce disease burden and preventable deaths.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection is endemic in many different countries. CHIKV outbreaks are emerging in new areas and re-emerging in previously exposed geographical regions, thus making it a significant public health concern. CHIKV infections are often clinically inapparent, especially in children, which poses a challenge to testing and evaluating any vaccine. During CHIKV infection, CHIKV-specific antibodies are produced, and some of these antibodies can neutralize viruses released from infected cells before they can enter uninfected cells. In this study, we evaluated IgG binding and neutralizing antibody responses in paired serum samples from CHIKV-infected children and those with other febrile illness, using a recombinant truncated E2 protein and whole CHIKV particles as test antigens. Antibody detection using the truncated E2 protein showed a significant overlap between CHIKV-infected subjects and those with other febrile illnesses. This overlap was greater when binding antibody titers were determined using fixed CHIKV particles as the test antigen. Acute- and convalescent-phase sera collected from children after CHIKV infection showed significant differences in their neutralizing capacity. The neutralizing and binding antibody response showed a significant positive correlation. We detected IgG antibodies in most cases during the acute phase of infection. This was observed at two different geographical locations, one of which is not considered highly endemic. Conventional wisdom would suggest this to be a marker of re-infection (secondary infection). However, dissenting opinions have been voiced in other viral diseases (such as Ebola) where studies have detected IgG in acute illness. In the absence of any significant body of work documenting secondary CHIKV infections, we believe further work is needed to understand the early IgG response that we observed.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM)-associated impairments in wound healing include prolonged inflammation, the overexpression of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and low levels of growth factors at the wound site. To this end, a layer-by-layer scaffold (SL-B-L) made of cross-linked silk fibroin and hyaluronic acid is developed to deliver chlorhexidine, an antimicrobial agent and an MMP-9 inhibitor, along with the PDGF-BB protein. SL-B-L exhibited highly porous morphology. Diabetic rats treated with SL-B-L demonstrated an early wound closure, a fully reconstructed epithelial layer by 14 days, and reduced levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta 1, and MMP-9. Interestingly, SL-B-L treatment increased angiogenesis, the bioavailability of collagen, DNA content, and VEGF-A levels. Furthermore, enhanced keratinocyte-fibroblast interaction along with ordered collagen deposition was observed in SL-B-L-treated rats. Most interestingly, when compared with a clinically used scaffold SEESKIN+, SL-B-L outperformed in promoting wound healing in a diabetic rat model by regulating the inflammation while delivering growth factor and the MMP-9 inhibitor.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether sequential (one after the other with a delay of 120 s) or combined (freshly prepared mixture) administration of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block (SCBPB) provides faster onset and prolonged duration of block.
   Design: Randomised controlled double blinded study.
   Setting: Single centre study in an operating theatre of a tertiary care facility between November 2018 and May 2020.
   Patients: Ninety-seven patients of either sex, aged between 18 and 65 years, belonging to ASA I to III and undergoing surgery suitable to be performed under SCBPB were enrolled.
   Intervention: Ultrasound guided SCBPB was performed with 20 mL of freshly prepared mixture of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine (10 mL each) in group C (combined) and 10 mL 2% lidocaine followed 120 s later by 10 mL 0.5% bupivacaine in group S (sequential).
   Main outcome measures: Time to onset of complete sensory block was the primary outcome while time to onset of first sensory block and complete motor block, duration of sensory and motor block, duration of analgesia, use of intraoperative supplement, rescue analgesic consumption, and pain scores at rest and with movement were secondary outcomes.
   Main results: There was no significant difference between group C and group S in time to onset of complete sensory block [median (IQR) 16 (11, 20.5) and 15.5 (13, 21.75) minutes respectively] (p-value 0.58). The time to onset of first sensory block and motor block, duration of sensory and motor block, duration of analgesia, use of intraoperative supplement, postoperative pain scores and rescue analgesic requirement were also similar (pvalue >0.05).
   Conclusion: There was no advantage of sequential administration of 2% lidocaine and 0.5% bupivacaine over the administration of combination of both LAs in terms of onset and duration of block.

AB  - Objective
   This systematic review (SR) aims to evaluate the efficacy of modified coronally advanced flap (mCAF) on clinical and patient-reported outcomes in the treatment of multiple adjacent gingival recessions (MAGRs).
   Materials and methods
   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), case-series and prospective clinical studies on treatment of Miller class I/II or RT1 MAGRs with >= 6 months follow-up were identified from the electronic databases and hand-searched journals. Complete root coverage (CRC) was the primary outcome variable. To evaluate treatment effects, meta-analysis was conducted, wherever appropriate.
   Results
   A total of 1395 recessions in 408 patients were evaluated in SR and meta-analysis was performed for four RCTs. Overall CRC achieved with mCAF was 70% and mean root coverage (MRC) ranged from 51.58 to 97.27%. Meta-analysis showed that combination of mCAF with connective tissue graft (CTG) or collagen matrix (CM) demonstrated significantly higher CRC% and recession reduction than mCAF alone. Limited evidence is available to support the use of platelet rich fibrin or enamel matrix derivative or acellular dermal matrix graft along with mCAF to further enhance its efficacy.
   Conclusions
   mCAF is an effective procedure for treating MAGRs and in terms of achieving CRC and MRC. Additional use of CTG or CM further enhances treatment outcomes.

TI  - Safety and immunogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152: a double-blind, randomised, phase 1 trial
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
KW  - VIRUS
AB  - Background To mitigate the effects of COVID-19, a vaccine is urgently needed. BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule adsorbed to alum (Algel-IMDG) or alum (Algel).
   Methods We did a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial to assess the safety and immunogenicity of BBV152 at 11 hospitals across India. Healthy adults aged 18-55 years who were deemed healthy by the investigator were eligible. Individuals with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and/or serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either one of three vaccine formulations (3 mu g with Algel-IMDG, 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG, or 6 mu g with Algel) or an Algel only control vaccine group. Block randomisation was done with a web response platform. Participants and investigators were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccines were administered on day 0 (the day of randomisation) and day 14. Primary outcomes were solicited local and systemic reactogenicity events at 2 h and 7 days after vaccination and throughout the full study duration, including serious adverse events. Secondary outcome was seroconversion (at least four-fold increase from baseline) based on wild-type virus neutralisation. Cell-mediated responses were evaluated by intracellular staining and ELISpot. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04471519).
   Findings Between July 13 and 30, 2020, 827 participants were screened, of whom 375 were enrolled. Among the enrolled participants, 100 each were randomly assigned to the three vaccine groups, and 75 were randomly assigned to the control group (Algel only). After both doses, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were reported by 17 (17%; 95% CI 10.5-26.1) participants in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG group, 21 (21%; 13.8-30.5) in the 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG group, 14 (14%; 8.1-22.7) in the 6 mu g with Algel group, and ten (10%; 6.9-23.6) in the Algel-only group. The most common solicited adverse events were injection site pain (17 [5%] of 375 participants), headache (13 [3%]), fatigue (11 [3%]), fever (nine [2%]), and nausea or vomiting (seven [2%]). All solicited adverse events were mild (43 [69%] of 62) or moderate (19 [31%]) and were more frequent after the first dose. One serious adverse event of viral pneumonitis was reported in the 6 mu g with Algel group, unrelated to the vaccine. Seroconversion rates (%) were 87.9, 91.9, and 82.8 in the 3 mu g with Algel-IMDG, 6 mu g with Algel-IMDG, and 6 mu g with Algel groups, respectively. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were detected in a subset of 16 participants from both Algel-IMDG groups.
   Interpretation BBV152 led to tolerable safety outcomes and enhanced immune responses. Both Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for phase 2 immunogenicity trials. Further efficacy trials are warranted. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To study the feasibility of 16S rRNA metagenomics using next generation sequencing (NGS) along with broad range PCR assay for 762 bp region of 16S rRNA gene with Sanger's sequencing, in microbial diagnosis of culture negative endophthalmitis. Vitreous fluid from 16 culture negative and one culture positive endophthalmitis patients, admitted to a tertiary care hospital were processed for targeted metagenomics. NGS of 7 variable regions of 16S rRNA gene was done using Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine (PGM). Sequence data were analyzed using Ion Reporter software using QIIME and BLSATN tools and Greengenes and NCBI-Genbank databases. Bacterial genome sequences were detected in 15 culture negative and culture positive vitreous specimens. The sequence reads varied between 25,245-540,916 with read length between 142bp-228bp and coverage depth was 41.0X and 81.2X. Operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) of multiple bacterial genera and species were detected in 13 culture negative vitreous specimens and OTUs of a single bacterial species were detected in 2 culture negative and 1 culture positive specimens; one negative specimen had no bacterial DNA. Maximum numbers of OTUs detected by NGS for a bacterial species from any vitreous specimen was the one which was detected and identified by Sanger's sequencing in broad range PCR. All the bacteria were belonging to clinically relevant species. Broad range PCR with sequencing failed to identify bacteria from 5 of the 16 (31.25%) culture negative vitreous specimens. Metagenomics could detect and identify bacterial pathogens in 15 of the 16 culture negative vitreous specimen's up to species level. With rapidly decreasing cost, metagenomics has a potential to be used widely in endophthalmitis diagnosis, in which culture negativity is usually high.

AB  - Objectives: Vitamin D plays a role in multiple aspects of human physiology, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) genes are associated with obesity. No data are available, to our knowledge, on the possible relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and genetic variations of VDR and PTH genes. This study aimed to assess the significance of vitamin D and PTH, as well as VDR, and PTH gene polymorphisms with body composition and biochemical investigations in Asian Indians with and without OSA. Methods: In this study, 120 obese subjects with OSA, 110 obese subjects without OSA, and 70 nonobese subjects without OSA were recruited. Clinical, body composition, anthropometry, and biochemical investigations, as well as a full overnight polysomnography were measured. Genotyping related to VDR (BsmI, ApaI FokI, and TaqI) and PTH (BstBI and DraII) genes were investigated with a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: The mean values of the lower serum 25(OH) D (12.9 +/- 3.8; P = 0.0001) and higher serum PTH levels (61.9 +/- 12.5; P = 0.0001) were observed in obese subjects with OSA. There was an indirect correlation between serum 25(OH) D levels and OSA severity (P < 0.001). VDR (BsmI and FokI) and PTH (BstBI and DraII) genes were significantly associated with OSA (P < 0.05). Analyses of VDR haplotype combination variants (BBFFAATt [odds ratio: 3.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.986-4.567] and BbFFAaTt [odds ratio: 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.345-4.981) were more frequent in obese subjects with OSA (P = 0.001). The BBDD and bbDd haplotypes of the PTH gene seems to be a predisposing factor for OSA (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Lower serum 25(OH) D levels were significantly observed in patients with OSA and correlate with disease severity. Also, VDR and PTH mutations were found to be highly related with OSA in Asian Indians. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - nonspecific aortoarteritis
AB  - Purpose:
   Nonspecific aortoarteritis (NSAA) is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis involving aorta and its branches. We conducted a study prospectively to compare time resolved magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for the vascular assessment in the patients of NSAA.
   Materials and Methods:
   Seventeen patients of NSAA were recruited in the study over the period of 3 years. Contrast enhanced MRA using Time-resolved angiography With Interleaved Stochastic Trajectories (TWIST) sequence and diagnostic DSA were performed in these 17 patients.
   Results:
   The majority of the patients were young (median age was 25 years, range 8 to 46 years) and 11 patients were females. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated in 9 patients and C-reactive protein (CRP) was elevated in 6 patients. Most commonly involved vessels in our patients were right renal artery (14 patients), abdominal aorta (12 patients) and left renal artery (11 patients). Left and right subclavian arteres were involved in 10 and 6 patients respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of time-resolved MRA using TWIST sequence is 100% as compared to DSA in the assessment of major vessels such as aorta, arch vessels, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery. However, the sensitivity and specificity of time resolved MRA in the evaluation of renal arteries and vertebral arteries were 100%, 71.4% and 85.7%, 33.3% respectively. No significant association of MRI contrast enhancement with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p = 1.00) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.600).
   Conclusion:
   Time resolved MRA images obtained using TWIST sequence were as qualitative as DSA images and can noninvasively evaluate the vascular involvement in NSAA patients.

AB  - Cancer therapies have undergone a tremendous progress over the past decade. Precision medicine provides a more tailored approach, making the combination of existing therapies more precise. Different types of cancers are characterized by unique biomarkers that are targeted using various genomic approaches by clinicians and companies worldwide to achieve efficient treatment with minimal side effects. Precision medicine has two broad approaches namely stratified and personalized medicine. The driver mutations could vary within a subtype while the same driver mutations could be found across different subtypes. Precision medicine has recently gained a lot of importance for breast cancer therapy. Various kinds of mutations like hotspot mutations, gene alterations, gene amplification mutations are targeted to design a more specific therapy. Apart from these known gene mutations there are various unknown mutations. Thus, tumor heterogeneity can pose a challenge to precision medicine. For breast cancer, one of the most successful models developed in case of precision medicine is the anti-HER2 therapies as HER2 was considered to have the worst prognosis being highly malignant. But now due to the advent of HER2 receptor targeted therapies, it has a good prognosis. Moreover, precision medicine helps in identifying if the drug molecules being used for the treatment of one kind of cancer can be beneficial in the treatment of another kind of cancer as well, considering the signaling pathways and machinery is similar in most of the cancers. This reduces the time for new drug development and is economically more feasible. Precision medicine will prove to be very advantageous in case of brain metastasis.

AB  - Introduction: Sarcopenia is the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function. It is a major health issue in old age due to lack of understanding of the origin and molecular mechanism. Altered dietary pattern, sedentary lifestyle and physical inactivity have shown adverse effect of skeletal muscle function. Sedentary behaviour and low protein intake have been well associated with sarcopenia. Here, we aim to develop Sarcopenia mimicking murine model to observe the physiological and biochemical changes with physical activity intervention. We also intended to find the association of muscle stem cells and stress induced protein Sestrins in the developed sarcopenic model. Methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were categorized into 4 groups: young-control (Y-Cntrl), aged-matched control (ACntrl), Sarcopenic-model (SAR-model) and Sarcopenic intervention group (SAR-INT) with physical exercises. SAR-model group was kept in a retrofitted confined cage for sedentary lifestyle and was fed with protein restricted diet. Phenotypic assessment for body mass, grip strength and functional endurance was analysed to confirm the sarcopenic state. Mitochondrial enzymatic assessment, muscle stem cell (MuSCs) proliferation potential and protein quantification of Sestrins expression were performed by enzyme histochemistry, flow cytometry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), respectively. SAR-model group was given 10 weeks physical activity intervention to assess the physiological and biochemical changes.
   Results: Simultaneous implementation of physical inactivity by sedentary confinement and protein restricted diet led the animals to exhibit the features of sarcopenia. SAR-model group showed a decline of 8.6% (p < 0.0001) in the body weight assessment, 32% decline (p < 0.0001) in the grip strength, 28% increase in time elapsed (p < 0.0001) indicating decline in functional performance. Mitochondrial enzymes (ATPase, NADH-TR and SDH/ COX) assessment exhibited low expression in SAR-model group. Ki67 positive muscle stem cell declines around 50% in the model group. SPR quantification of Sestrin 2 showed a decline of 14% which significantly improved to 28% upon physical activity intervention (p = 0.0025) in SAR-INT group.
   Conclusion: It can be summarized that the mouse model generated in the present study mimics the feature of human Sarcopenia. Physical activity intervention may improve the sarcopenic status via modulation of Sestrin 2 which can serve as potential molecule for therapeutic implication.

AB  - Hirayama disease (HD) is a relatively uncommon cause of lower cervical myelopathy. A number of surgical approaches have been described in patients with HD in literature. We reviewed the literature and did a systematic review and meta-analysis of the studies which presented the clinical outcome following surgical intervention in HD. A systematic search of literature was performed with the keywords "Surgical treatment in Hirayama Disease", "Surgical approach in Hirayama Disease" and "Hirayama disease surgery". Data related to clinical outcome following surgery was pooled to calculate the pooled proportion of clinical improvement following anterior and posterior surgical approach. Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. Altogether, there were 10 types of surgical procedures performed for Hirayama disease. The most commonly described surgical technique was anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with cervical plating. The pooled proportion of patients experiencing clinical improvement following all cervical approaches was 80% (95% confidence interval 76 to 84%). Pooled proportion was maximum for anterior cervical plating (96% (95% confidence interval 62 to 100%)) and minimum for ACDF without plating (57% (95% confidence interval 20 to 88%)). Subgroup analysis based on different surgical approaches was not significant (p value = 0.61). The pooled proportion of patients experiencing clinical improvement following anterior and posterior cervical approach was 80% (95% confidence interval 76 to 84%) and 81% (95% confidence interval 66 to 91%). The indications of surgical treatment in patients with HD include poor patient compliance for neck collar or rapidly progressing severe disease. Good results with more than 80% chances of clinical improvement have been reported following various anterior and posterior surgical approaches. However, there was no significant difference in the pooled outcome of different surgical approaches. Most common technique used in literature is anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating.

AB  - Severe COVID-19 can manifest as multiorgan dysfunction with pulmonary involvement being the most common and prominent. As more reports emerge in the literature, it appears that an exaggerated immune response in the form of unfettered complement activation and a cytokine storm may be a key driver of the widespread organ injury seen in this disease. In addition, these patients are also known to be hypercoagulable with a high rate of thrombosis and a higher-than-expected failure rate of anticoagulation. While macrovascular thrombosis is common in these individuals, the frequent finding of extensive microvascular thromboses in several series and case reports, raises the possibility of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) as being a contributing factor in the thrombotic and multi-organ complications of the disease. If this is correct, rapidly identifying a TMA and treating the underlying pathophysiology may allow for better outcomes in these critically ill patients. To further explore this, we reviewed the published literature on COVID-19, looking for reports describing TMA-like presentations. We summarize our findings here along with a discussion about presentation, pathophysiology, and a suggested treatment algorithm.

AB  - The present study explored the association between daily ambient air pollution and daily emergency room (ER) visits due to acute respiratory symptoms in children of Delhi. The daily counts of ER visits (ERV) of children (<= 15 years) having acute respiratory symptoms were obtained from two hospitals of Delhi for 21 months. Simultaneously, data on daily concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O-3) and weather variables were provided by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. K-means clustering with time-series approach and multi-pollutant generalized additive models with Poisson link function was used to estimate the 0-6-day lagged change in daily ER visits with the change in multiple pollutants levels. Out of 1,32,029 children screened, 19,120 eligible children having acute respiratory symptoms for <= 2 weeks and residing in Delhi for the past 4 weeks were enrolled. There was a 29% and 21% increase in ERVs among children on high and moderate level pollution cluster days, respectively, compared to low pollution cluster days on the same day and previous 1-6 days of exposure to air pollutants. There was percentage increase (95% CI) 1.50% (0.76, 2.25) in ERVs for acute respiratory symptoms for 10 mu g/m(3) increase of NO2 on previous day 1, 46.78% (21.01, 78.05) for 10 mu g/m(3) of CO on previous day 3, and 13.15% (9.95, 16.45) for 10 mu g/m(3) of SO2 on same day of exposure. An increase in the daily ER visits of children for acute respiratory symptoms was observed after increase in daily ambient air pollution levels in Delhi.

AB  - In acute-ischemic-stroke patients, penumbra assessment plays a significant role in treatment outcome. MR perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) mismatch ratio can provide penumbra assessment. Recently reported studies have shown the potential of susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) in the qualitative assessment of penumbra. We hypothesize that quantitative penumbra assessment using SWI-DWI can provide an alternative to the PWI-DWI approach and this can also reduce the overall scan-time. The purpose of the current study was to develop a framework for accurate quantitative assessment of penumbra using SWI-DWI and its validation with PWI-DWI-based quantification. In the current study, the arterial-spin-labelling (ASL) technique has been used for PWI. This retrospective study included 25 acute-ischemic-stroke patients presenting within 24 hours of the last noted baseline condition of stroke onset. Eleven patients also had follow-up MRI within 48 hours. MRI acquisition comprised DWI, SWI, pseudo-continuous-ASL (pCASL), FLAIR and non-contrast-angiography sequences. A framework was developed for the enhancement of prominent hypo-intense vein signs followed by automatic segmentation of the SWI penumbra ROI. Apparent-diffusion-coefficient (ADC) maps and cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) maps were computed. The infarct core ROI from the ADC map and the ASL penumbra ROI from CBF maps were segmented semiautomatically. The infarct core volume, SWI penumbra volume (SPV) and pCASL penumbra volume were computed and used to calculate mismatch ratios MR. The Dice coefficient between the SWI penumbra ROI and ASL penumbra ROI was 0.96 +/- 0.07. MR CBFADC, which validates the hypothesis of accurate penumbra assessment using the SWI-DWI mismatch ratio. Moreover, a significant association between high SPV and the presence of vessel occlusion in the MR angiogram was observed. Follow-up data showed salvation of penumbra tissue (location and volumes predicted by proposed framework) by treatments. Additionally, functional-outcome analysis revealed 93.3% of patients with M 1 benefitted from revascularization therapy. Overall, the proposed automated quantitative assessment of penumbra using the SWI-DWI mismatch ratio performs equivalently to the ASL PWI-DWI mismatch ratio. This approach provides an alternative to the perfusion sequence required for penumbra assessment, which can reduce scan time by 17% for the protocol without a perfusion sequence.

AB  - In this work, a nonlinear strain rate dependent plugin developed for the OpenSim (R) platform was used to estimate the instantaneous strain rate (ISR) and the forces on the ACL's anteromedial (aACL) and posterolateral (pACL) bundles during walking and sudden change of direction of running termed as 'plant-and-cut' (PC). The authors obtained the kinematics data for walking via optical motion capture. PC movements, along with running kinematics, were obtained from the literature. A nonlinear plugin developed for ligaments was interfaced with OpenSim (R) platform to simulate walking and PC motions with a flexed knee and an extended knee. PC phase is sandwiched between an approach phase and take-off phase and was studied at various event velocities (1.8, 3, and 4.2 m s(-1)), and angles of PC (23 degrees, 34 degrees, and 45 degrees) as encountered in adult ball games. In both cases of PC-with-extended knee and PC-with-flexed-knee, the maximum forces on both the ACL bundles were observed after the take-off phase. A maximum force of similar to 35 N kg(-1) of body weight (BW) was observed on aACL after the take-off phase for an event velocity of 4.2 m s(-1). In the posterolateral bundle (pACL), the maximum forces (similar to 40 N kg(-1) of BW) were observed towards the end of the mid-swing phase (after the take-off phase) for the various combinations of the parameters studied. The forces observed in the simulation of PC-with-flexed-knee and PC-with-extended-knee has resulted in magnitude higher than sustainable by the adults. This study is novel in attempting to incorporate differing rates-of-strain that have been shown to alter soft tissue properties into the OpenSim (R) musculoskeletal model. The proposed model can be used by researchers to predict the forces during various kinematic activities for other soft tissues.

   Orchiopexy for cryptorchidism is one of the common day-care surgeries performed by pediatric surgeons across the globe. Although majority of the surgeons reposition the testis into a sub-dartos pouch, the practice of taking an additional transparenchymal anchoring suture is often debated. The potential risks include impaired spermatogenesis and subfertility. Also, a consensus statement regarding the superiority of suture fixation over no suture fixation, in terms of prevention of recurrence of cryptorchidism, is lacking. This systematic review and metaanalysis aims to compare the outcomes of orchiopexy between the two groups i.e. without (Group A) and with the transparenchymal suture fixation (Group B).
   Method
   The authors systematically searched the databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus through October, 2020 for comparative studies. Statistical analysis was performed using a fixedeffects model; and pooled risk ratio (RR) and heterogeneity (I-2) were calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Downs and Black scale.
   Result
   Five comparative studies, comprising a total of 734 and 1002 children within the groups A and B respectively, were recruited in this study. As compared to the children belonging to group A, a significantly higher incidence of recurrence of cryptorchidism (RR 1.75; 95% CI 1.10-2.80, p Z 0.02) was observed among the children of group B. However, the difference in the incidence of testicular atrophy could not reach statistical significance (RR 1.56; 95% CI 0.23-10.50, p Z 0.65). The average Downs and Black scale scores ranged from 15 to 21.5, with all the studies having moderate to high-risk of bias.
   Conclusion
   The present meta-analysis revealed superiority of orchiopexy performed without transparenchymal suture fixation in terms of recurrence of cryptorchidism. Although, the incidence of testicular atrophy was higher among the children belonging to the suture group, no statistically significant difference was observed among the two groups. However, the level of evidence of the published comparative studies is limited. Therefore, it is recommended to focus on adequate mobilization of the testis and its positioning in the sub-dartos with minimal tension rather than over-reliance on futile adjuncts like taking transparenchymal testicular suture.

AB  - Spatial distribution of cells and their interactions between neighboring cells in native microenvironments are of fundamental importance in determining cell fate decisions such as migration, growth, and differentiation. Controlling the spatial distribution of different cell types in defined geometries can replicate these native environments, which can be a useful model for several studies. While spatiotemporal control over multiple cell arrangements is required to achieve the complex tissue architecture, unfortunately, conventional cell patterning techniques usually allow only single patterning with a single cell type. In the present study, we introduce a simple lithographic method to pattern multiple cell types in a spatially controlled manner by utilizing the biophysical cues present at the corners of the patterned geometry. By fabricating micropatterns of different shapes, we demonstrate how the cell can be constrained to pattern along the corners of patterned geometries owing to the presence of topographical cues, leaving empty voids in the center that can be further utilized for patterning a second cell type. We also demonstrate that the cell alignment along the pattern is a dynamic process and the cells migrate from a more uniform cell-adhesive region toward the topographical cues. The cytoskeleton arrangement was geometry-dependent, which was confirmed through a series of in vitro evaluations, such as scanning electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. These findings have not only helped us in exploring the importance of these cues in guiding the cell fate but have also allowed us to develop a technique, which self-patterns the cells without any expensive exogenous cues and can be used as a model protocol to eventually organize cells into a specific pattern with micron-scale precision in vitro.

KW  - Tetralogy of Fallot
AB  - Objectives The present study sought to determine the prevalence and evaluate the patterns of various anomalies of coronary arteries in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) on multidetector CT angiography using a dual-source CT scanner.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed CT angiographies of 955 pediatric patients, diagnosed with TOF between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2019 and having an optimal evaluation of coronary arteries, with respect to the origin, course, and termination of the coronary arteries and associated cardiovascular anomalies.
   Results Anomalies of coronary arteries were observed in 8.27% (79/955) patients with TOF. Origin of accessory/proper left anterior descending (LAD) artery from right coronary artery (RCA) or right coronary sinus was the most common anomalous pattern, seen in 3.14% (30/955) patients, followed by the presence of hypertrophied conal artery seen in 2.62% (25/955) patients. The anomalous coronary artery was crossing the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) in all cases where the LAD artery was arising from RCA or right coronary sinus or where RCA was arising from the LAD artery. Coronary arterial anomalies were seen in a significantly higher proportion of patients with an atrial septal defect compared to those without (7/25 [28%] vs. 72/930 [7.74%]; p = .0003).
   Conclusion The prevalence of anomalies of coronary arteries increases significantly in the presence of TOF as compared to the general population. Majority of these anomalous coronary arteries course anterior to the RVOT which can potentially pose technical difficulties with a risk of adverse surgical outcomes and increased morbidity and mortality, rendering their diagnosis crucial before surgery.

AB  - A recent study in Scientific Reports identified glypican-3 (GPC3) as a novel extracellular interacting protein for FAT1 in hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. FAT1 is a large transmembrane atypical cadherin with limited knowledge existing about its binding partners. While in Drosophila, dachsous (ds), another transmembrane member of the cadherin superfamily, is known to function as FAT1 ligand, no ligand is known in mammals so far. The revelation of GPC3 as a potential binding partner of FAT1 extracellular domain unfolds an opportunity to study potential triggers of FAT1 signaling in cancers. Available inhibitors of GPC3 in various phases of clinical trials also present an attractive option to curb GPC3-FAT1 signaling in tumors that overexpress these proteins.

AB  - Objective To provide a descriptive audit of healthcare workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19, and their contacts, to understand the dynamics of transmission among HCWs.
   Methods Retrospective analysis of contact tracing data of infected HCWs was done from March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020 at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India. Contacts were categorized according to the nature of contact and followed for 14 days.
   Results Qualitative RT-PCR testing was performed on 106 HCWs (from a total of 257) owing to exposure or development of symptoms. Positive results were found in 16 HCWs (6.2%) who were exposed to 120 other HCWs, generating 197 exposure incidents. Of these, 30 (15.2%) exposure incidents were high risk with multiple exposures in 48 (40.0%) HCWs. Exposure to infected HCWs was noted in 3 (18.8%) of 16 positive cases. Of the 197 exposure incidents, 54 (27.4%) were deemed avoidable exposures. Infection prevention and control policies were periodically reviewed, and the department implemented mitigating steps to minimize the risk to healthcare providers.
   Conclusion Instituting appropriate infection prevention and control policies and use of adequate precautions by HCWs is vital to minimize high-risk exposure to COVID-19.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a mammalian heme peroxidase which catalyzes the conversion of thiocyanate (SCN?) and iodide (I-) by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into antimicrobial hypothiocyanite (OSCN?) and hypoiodite (IO-). The prosthetic heme group is covalently attached to LPO through two ester linkages involving conserved glutamate and aspartate residues. On the proximal side, His351 is coordinated to heme iron while His 109 is located in the substrate binding site on the distal heme side. We report here the first structure of the ternary complex of LPO with iodide (I-) and H2O2 at 1.77 angstrom resolution. LPO was crystallized with ammonium iodide and the crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution containing H2O2. Structure determination showed the presence of an iodide ion and a H2O2 molecule in the substrate binding site. The iodide ion occupied the position which is stabilized by the interactions with heme moiety, His109, Arg255 and Glu258 while H2O2 was held between the heme iron and His109. The presence of I- in the distal heme cavity seems to screen the positive charge of Arg255 thus suppressing the proton transfer from H2O2 to His109. This prevents compound I formation and allows trapping of a stable enzyme-substrate (LPO-I- -H2O2) ternary complex. This stable geometrical arrangement of H2O2 in the distal heme cavity of LPO is similar to that of H2O2 in the structure of the transient intermediate of the palm tree heme peroxidase. The biochemical studies showed that the catalytic activity of LPO decreased when the samples of LPO were preincubated with ammonium iodide.

AB  - Purpose of Review Megaprosthesis and Allograft Prosthesis Composite (APC) are the established treatment modalities for massive skeletal defects. There are a handful of studies comparing the use of megaprosthesis and APC in the management of substantial bone loss and it has always been a topic of debate regarding the superiority of one modality over the other. Therefore, we aim to compare the functional outcome and implant survivorship of each modality including complications, revision rates, amputation rate and mortality. Recent Findings The Allograft Prosthesis Composite (APC) constitutes a skeletal allograft implanted with a revision type prosthesis in it. The biological environment provided by the allograft allows attachment of the muscles and tendons imparting better stability and function. However, the literature is not kind enough with APC due to associated risk of infection, disease transmission and nonunion at the graft-host junction. The megaprosthesis (MP) on the other hand is a nonbiologic modality with better survivorship but subservient functional outcome. Infection has been a major issue in both the modalities. Advancement in metallurgy using silver coated megaprosthesis also failed to provide strong evidence in preventing infection. The functional outcome is better with APC in both the upper and lower limbs. However, the survivorship is better with megaprosthesis, especially in the upper limb when revision rates were compared between the two modalities. Deep infection and mechanical complications were significantly higher in the APC group. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of amputation rate, mortality, and local recurrence.

AB  - Background Bariatric surgery can alleviate cardiovascular risk via effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Our study aimed to assess the cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of HDL as a negative risk factor for CVD in individuals with obesity and identify the factors associated with improvement in CEC 3 months following bariatric surgery. Methods We recruited 40 control individuals (mean BMI of 22.2 kg/m(2)) and 56 obese individuals (mean BMI of 45.9 kg/m(2)). The biochemical parameters, inflammatory status and CEC of HDL was measured for the obese individuals before bariatric surgery and at 3 months after surgery. The CEC was measured using a cell-based cholesterol efflux system of BODIPY-cholesterol-labelled THP-1 macrophages. Results A significant reduction in BMI (- 17%, p < 0.001), resolution of insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-IR = - 23.4%, p = 0.002; Adipo IR = - 16%, p = 0.009) and inflammation [log resistin = - 6%, p = 0.07] were observed 3 months post-surgery. CEC significantly improved 3 months after surgery [Pre: 0.91 +/- 0.13; Post: 1.02 +/- 0.16; p = 0.001] despite a decrease in HDL-C levels. The change in CEC correlated with the change in apo A-I (r = 0.39, p = 0.02) and adiponectin levels (r = 0.35, p = 0.03). Conclusion The results suggest that improvements in CEC, through improvement in adipose tissue health in terms of adipokine secretion and insulin sensitivity could be an important pathway in modulating obesity-related CVD risk.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance poses a major threat to public health. More effective ways of the antibiotic prescription are needed to delay the spread of antibiotic resistance. Employment of sequencing technologies coupled with the use of trained neural network algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction will reduce the time needed for antibiotic susceptibility profile identification from days to hours.
   In this work, we have sequenced and phenotypically characterized 171 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from Norway and India. Based on the data, we have created neural networks to predict susceptibility for ampicillin, 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. All networks were trained on unassembled data, enabling prediction within minutes after the sequencing information becomes available. Moreover, they can be used both on Illumina and MinION generated data and do not require high genome coverage for phenotype prediction. We cross-checked our networks with previously published algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction and their corresponding datasets. Besides, we also created an ensemble of networks trained on different datasets, which improved the cross-dataset prediction compared to a single network.
   Additionally, we have used data from direct sequencing of spiked blood cultures and found that AMR-Diag networks, coupled with MinION sequencing, can predict bacterial species, resistome, and phenotype as fast as 1-8 h from the sequencing start. To our knowledge, this is the first study for genotype-to-phenotype prediction: (1) employing a neural network method; (2) using data from more than one sequencing platform; and (3) utilizing sequence data from spiked blood cultures.

AB  - Azilsartan is found to be more potent than other angiotensin receptor blockers in reducing blood pressure. However, its effect on the heart following myocardial infarction remains to be established. For the first time, we investigated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonistic and cardioprotective properties of azilsartan. Computational modeling studies of interactions between azilsartan and PPAR-gamma revealed azilsartan as an agonist of PPAR-gamma and showed the mechanism of azilsartan in cardioprotection. Our study compared the cardioprotective potential of telmisartan to that of azilsartan in a murine model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by comparing their antioxidant, ant apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-modulating ability, and PPAR-gamma agonistic activity. Male Wistar rats were grouped into four to receive vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide [0.05%] 2 ml/kg) telmisartan (10 mg/kg p.o.), azilsartan (10 mg/kg p.o.) or azilsartan with specific PPAR-gamma blocker, GW 9662 for 28 days. Ischemia was induced for 45 min on the 29th day followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Telmisartan and azilsartan pretreatment significantly nearly normalized cardiac parameters and preserved structural changes. Both drugs inhibited oxidative burst, inflammation, as well as cell death by modulating apoptotic protein expression along with reduction in 4 ',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells. An increment in pro-survival kinase ERK paralleled with a reduction in p38 and JNK was also revealed by MAPK pathway studies, after administration of these drugs. Interestingly, the aforementioned changes induced by both drugs were reversed by administration of the specific PPAR-gamma antagonist, GW9662. However, we found that azilsartan upregulated PPAR-gamma to a lesser extent as compared to telmisartan and the latter may be preferred in hypertensive patients at risk of myocardial infarction.

AB  - We describe a rare variant of obstructed supracardiac totally anomalous venous connection in a 7-day-old boy where the vertical vein was occluded and the entire pulmonary venous return was draining through a large tortuous pulmonary-systemic venous collateral. The case highlights the importance of computed tomography angiography in demonstrating such complex anatomies in congenital heart diseases.

AB  - Purpose of investigation: The oxytocin (OXT)-oxytocin receptor (OXTR) system provides a promising candidate gene for studies of genetic contributions to prematurity. The author studies the quantification and comparison of oxytocin receptor (OXTR) gene expression and serum OXT levels in the blood and amnion of women delivering preterm and evaluation of the correlation between OXTR gene expression in blood and amnion with serum OXT levels in them. Material and methods: Seventy pregnant women in spontaneous labor delivering vaginally preterm i.e., < 37 weeks and an equal number of matched controls delivering spontaneously at term (37-42 weeks) were recruited. Maternal serum OXT levels were quantified by ELISA collected in the active stage of labor i.e., 4 cm cervical dilatation. Gene expression studies in the maternal blood and amnion were done by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results: The mean serum OXT level in preterm labor (PTL) was 48.56 +/- 6.97 pg/mL; significantly higher than in controls (43.00 +/- 3.96 pg/mL), P < 0.001. OXTR gene expression in maternal blood (2.5 times) as well as in amnion (3.5 times) was significantly higher in PTL. A significant positive correlation was observed between serum OXT levels and OXTR gene expression in amnion (r = -0.190, P = 0.025). Conclusions: The serum OXT levels and OXTR gene expression in amnion surge significantly in the active phase of PTL. Thus, amnion probably links OXT-PTGs (prostaglandins) autocrine paracrine circuit to facilitate PTL. Future studies are needed to devise better OXTR receptor antagonists preferably acting on amnionic OXTRs to prevent inflammatory pathways leading to PTL.

AB  - Rapid detection of DNA/RNA pathogenic sequences or variants through point-of-care diagnostics is valuable for accelerated clinical prognosis, as witnessed during the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Traditional methods relying on qPCR or sequencing are tough to implement with limited resources, necessitating the development of accurate and robust alternative strategies. Here, we report FnCas9 Editor Linked Uniform Detection Assay (FELUDA) that utilizes a direct Cas9 based enzymatic readout for detecting nucleobase and nucleotide sequences without transcleavage of reporter molecules. We also demonstrate that FELUDA is 100% accurate in detecting single nucleotide variants (SNVs), including heterozygous carriers, and present a simple web-tool JATAYU to aid end-users. FELUDA is semi-quantitative, can adapt to multiple signal detection platforms, and deploy for versatile applications such as molecular diagnosis during infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19. Employing a lateral flow readout, FELUDA shows 100% sensitivity and 97% specificity across all ranges of viral loads in clinical samples within 1hr. In combination with RT-RPA and a smartphone application True Outcome Predicted via Strip Evaluation (TOPSE), we present a prototype for FELUDA for CoV-2 detection closer to home.

AB  - A 42-year-old woman who fell through a glass tabletop had her lower back pierced by a long shard of glass. She rapidly exsanguinated. At autopsy, a single penetrating wound was present in her left lower back, with complete transection of her left kidney and a 3.5 L haematoperitoneum. Death was due to exsanguination following accidental transection of the left kidney by a penetrating glass injury of the lower back. Glass-topped tables are a well-recognised source of injury in a domestic setting There are far more non-lethal than lethal injuries, many of which involve children. Quite long shards may remain undetected in wounds for considerable amounts of time. Non-tempered glass is a particular risk for breakage. Glass-topped tables should not be used as substitutes for chairs, particularly in overweight or obese individuals.

AB  - Lifestyle modification is the mainstay of treatment in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). Published Indian data on the diet and lifestyle of Indian NAFLD patients is scarce. This study explored variation in lifestyle-related behavior among obese patients with NAFLD. Ultrasonography (USG) diagnosed obese NAFLD patients (n = 140) were assessed for dietary intake [1-day 24 hours recall, food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ)] and physical activity (PA) [Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ)]. Diet quality score (0-30) and physical activity (PA) levels were used to study variation in lifestyle and assess the effect of lifestyle on the severity of NAFLD. Compared to the recommendation, calorie consumption was 25.2% higher in nearly half (53.6%) of the subjects and mean macronutrient intake was imbalanced (60.3% carbohydrates, 12.4% protein, 25.5% fats). Variation was seen in terms of diet quality-good (3%), moderate (54.3%), or poor (43.5%) and intensity of PA-high (15%), moderate (47.9%), or low (37.1%). No patient had a combination of high PA and good diet quality within all grades of NAFLD. Our study suggests wide variation in lifestyles of obese patients with NAFLD and need for a more flexible and individualized modification of their diet and PA.

AB  - Objective Cervical cancer screening by primary human papilloma virus detection and cytology is fraught with low specificity and variable sensitivity, respectively. Cytology-histology correlation remains modest. Biomarkers associated with early genetic events in cervical squamous carcinogenesis and detectable in cytology material are likely to be relevant. Human telomerase RNA component (hTERC) gene overexpression and aneuploidy are promising candidates in view of their reported early and consistent association with cervical squamous oncogenesis.
   Methods We analysed hTERC gene expression and chromosome 7 ploidy by fluorescent in-situ hybridisation (FISH) in 50 women with cytological precursor squamous intraepithelial lesions and available histology outcomes. Results were expressed as percentages of cells showing >= 3 signals, mean signals/nucleus, and maximum amplitude across various cytology and histology categories. Proportions of positive cases were calculated from threshold values derived from 6 controls. Distribution of above indices with respect to >= cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN2) was explored.
   Results For both genetic aberrations, there was significant positive correlation (for all indices) between the proportion of positive cases and worsening cytological and histological outcomes (P < .05), with significant intergroup differences (P < .05). High-grade lesions (>= CIN2) had significantly higher results compared to <CIN2 lesions (P <= .001). In five discordant cases with >= CIN2 under- or overdiagnosed on cytology, FISH supported the histological diagnosis.
   Conclusions HTERC gene amplification and chromosome 7 ploidy showed positive association with cervical squamous carcinogenesis and could be relevant in settings of discrepant cytology-histology correlation.

AB  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number alterations occur in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated regulation and biological significance of mtDNA copy number in pediatric AML patients (n = 123) by qRT-PCR, and in-vitro studies. MtDNA copy number was significantly higher (p < 0.001) and an independent predictor of aggressive disease (p = 0.006), lower event free survival (p = 0.033), and overall survival (p = 0.007). Expression of TFAM, POLG, POLRMT, MYC and ND3 were significantly upregulated. In cell lines, PGC1A inhibition decreased mtDNA copy number while MYC inhibition had no effect. PGC1A may contribute to enhanced mtDNA copy number, which predicts disease aggressiveness and inferior survival outcome.

T2  - CARDIOLOGY
KW  - Caudal fluoroscopy
KW  - Venous access
KW  - CIED
AB  - Background: Axillary venous access is preferred for CIED implantation. The procedure is usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance in anteroposterior (A-P) view. However, there is a lack of perception of depth in this view with a fear of creating complications. Caudal fluoroscopy (adding 30 degrees-35 degrees caudal angulation to A-P projection) has been proposed to circumvent this problem. Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the advantages of caudal fluoroscopy using fluoroscopic images, contrast venograms, and CT angiography images of axillary vein. Methods: The fluoroscopic images and contrast venograms obtained in the A-P view were compared with caudal fluoroscopy in patients undergoing CIED implantation at our centre. Also, the CT angiography images of axillary vein were reconstructed to understand the relative anatomy of the vein and the underlying lung parenchyma, simulating these 2 projections. Results: The CT angiography images, contrast venograms, and fluoroscopic images confirmed that caudal fluoroscopy allows better visualization of the vein in relation to the lung parenchyma and rib cage. Analysis of fluoroscopic images revealed that the bend of the first rib formed a conical prominence in caudal fluoroscopy. This served as an important bony landmark for successful venous access, which was usually obtained while the needle was being directed towards this prominence in caudal fluoroscopy. Conclusions: The proposed advantages of caudal fluoroscopy for CIED implantation have been elucidated by analysis of CT angiography images, contrast venograms, and fluoroscopic images.

AB  - Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs are associated with high (>95%) sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR12) in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. There is a paucity of data regarding the characteristics and re-treatment outcomes of DAA treatment failure patients. In a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected database, we assessed the outcomes of re-treatment among patients with previous DAA failure. Patients' characteristics, viral characteristics, including resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) in a subgroup of patients, SVR12, and clinical outcomes were studied. Of 40 patients with DAA failure, among whom 36 were retreated, mean age was 45.7 years, 63.9% (n = 23) were male, 63.9% (n = 23) had a genotype-3 infection and 63.9% (n = 23) were cirrhotic. The re-treatment regimens included a combination of pan-genotypic DAA, mainly sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with or without ribavirin. Three patients who declined retreatment and one who was still on treatment was excluded. For patients who completed re-treatment, SVR12 was 100% irrespective of genotypes. SVR12 among genotype 3 was 75% (15 of 20) when lost to follow-up was considered a treatment failure. Six patients died due to liver-related causes, including five (83.3%) with hepatocellular carcinoma. RAS analysis in 17 randomly selected patients did not reveal any dominant substitutions in NS5A or NS5B region affecting SVR12, though several novel mutations were observed. In conclusion, re-treatment of CHC patients with prior DAA failure using pan-genotypic DAA is associated with high SVR12 rates irrespective of genotype or the presence of RAS.

AB  - Background: Chest trauma causes substantial morbidity and mortality and its severity is assessed using clinical diagnosis or scoring systems like Injury severity score (ISS) and thoracic trauma severity score (TTSS). Association of inflammatory cytokines with severity of disease and final clinical outcome is not clearly defined in patients with chest trauma. In this study, we thought to evaluate the inflammatory response in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in chest trauma patients and correlate the level of extracellular cytokines with diseases severity and final outcome.
   Methods: A total of 65 patients with blunt chest trauma and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Assessment of inflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin (s) - IL-5, IL-13, IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17A, IL-17F,IL-4, IL-21 and IL-22 was performed in both serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid using 13-plex multiplex kit using fluorescence-encoded bead based immunoassays.
   Results: A significantly higher level of IL-13, IL-2, IL-6, IL-9, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22 cytokines were observed in patients with blunt chest trauma compared to healthy controls. Level of IL-2, IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-17A was significantly raised in the patients with blunt chest trauma who had a fatal outcome during the hospital stay. An elevated cytokine response of IL-13, IL-4, and IL-21 was noted in the group of patients with high (>5) thoracic trauma severity score.
   Conclusion: Routine monitoring of the inflammatory cytokine level in patients with chest trauma may be used routinely. Longer prospective studies should be encouraged to determine the role of cytokines in patients with chest trauma in predicting the patient final clinical outcome.

AB  - Background: In recognition to the rising incidences of child sexual abuse in India, various challenges of existing trauma measures and absence of indigenous efforts at development of comprehensive impact assessment scale, present study was conceptualized.
   Objective: To develop and establish psychometric properties of Multidimensional Scale for Children with Sexual Abuse.
   Participants and Settings: Outpatient department of government hospitals, non-governmental organizations and child care institutes were primary data setting from which a total of 457 participants were sampled.
   Methods: The scale development process consisted of identifying impact themes from 59 qualitative research participants and item pooling from available scales; item writing followed by content and face validity analysis from 18 experts; and pilot testing on 30 children. The scale was then applied to 200 children with CSA and 150 children without sexual abuse. The factor structure of the scale was obtained using exploratory factor analysis. Internal consistency, split-half reliability, and validity (convergent, divergent, discriminant) were evaluated. Cutoff scores were obtained using the receiver operating characteristics curve and percentile analysis.
   Results: The scale consisted of 62 items across 5 domains. It has high reliability (Cronbach's alpha 0.93; split-half reliability 0.89), high content, and discriminant validity. Convergent and divergent validity are satisfactory. Scale cut-off score of 31 has high sensitivity.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this scale is the first such psychometrically robust self-rated scale for young children with sexual abuse in the Asian country. Available in both Hindi and English language, the scale provides a quick measure of trauma across multidimensional functioning.

AB  - Objective: Efficacy and safety of Itolizumab, an immunomodulatory mAb, in treating moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cytokine release in COVID-19 patients was evaluated in a multi-centric, open-label, two-arm, controlled, randomized, phase-2 study.
   Methods: Patients were randomized (2:1) to Arm-A (best supportive care [BSC]+Itolizumab) and Arm-B (BSC). Primary outcome of interest was reduction in mortality 30-days after enrollment.
   Results: Thirty-six patients were screened, five treated as first-dose-sentinels and rest randomized, while four patients were screen-failures. Two patients in Arm-A discontinued prior to receiving one complete infusion and were replaced. At end of 1-month, there were three deaths in Arm-B, and none in Arm-A (p = 0.0296; 95% CI = -0.3 [-0.61, -0.08]). At end of study, more patients in Arm-A had improved SpO2 without increasing FiO2 (p = 0.0296), improved PaO2 (p = 0.0296), and reduction in IL-6 (43 vs 212 pg/ml; p = 0.0296) and tumor necrotic factor-alpha (9 vs 39 pg/ml; p = 0.0253) levels. Transient lymphopenia (Arm-A: 11 patients) and infusion reactions (7 patients) were commonly reported treatment-related safety events.
   Conclusion: Itolizumab is a promising, safe and effective immunomodulatory therapy for treatment of ARDS due to cytokine release in COVID-19 patients, with survival and recovery-benefit.

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced hospitals to prioritize admissions. Epilepsy surgeries have been postponed at most centers. As the pandemic continues with no definite end in sight in the near future, the question arises until when such patients should be denied appropriate treatment. A 12-year-old child with left-sided Rasmussen's encephalitis with drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) presented at the height of the pandemic, with worsening of seizure frequency from 4-5/day to 20/day, with new-onset epilepsia partialis continua. She demonstrated features of progressive cognitive decline. The pros and cons of operating during the pandemic were discussed with the parents by a multidisciplinary team. She underwent endoscopic left hemispherotomy. Postoperatively she became seizure free but developed hospital-acquired mild COVID infection for which she was treated accordingly. Chosen cases of severe DRE, as the one illustrated above, who are deemed to benefit from surgery by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, should be re-categorized into the most severe class of patients and scheduled for surgery as soon as possible. The risk benefit ratio of the seizures being mitigated by surgery on one hand and possibility of acquiring COVID infection during hospital stay has to be balanced and a decision made accordingly.

TI  - Evaluation of platelet-rich plasma on hair regrowth and lesional T-cell cytokine expression in alopecia areata: A randomized observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-head pilot study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Background: Platelet-rich plasma has shown some promise in the treatment of alopecia areata.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of platelet-rich plasma on hair regrowth and lesional T-cell cytokine expression in alopecia areata.
   Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, split-head study involving 27 patients with alopecia areata (Severity of Alopecia Tool score >= 25%). Alopecia patches on either side of the scalp were randomized to receive 3 intradermal injections of platelet-rich plasma or normal saline at monthly intervals and evaluated 3 months after the last session. Lesional T-cell cytokine messenger RNA expression was compared pre- and posttreatment in the platelet-rich plasma-treated sites.
   Results: The mean Severity of Alopecia Tool score did not change significantly compared with baseline with either platelet-rich plasma or placebo injections at any visit; however, the mean percentage reduction in the score in the platelet-rich plasma arm was more than in the placebo arm (9.05% +/- 36.48% vs 4.99% +/- 33.88%; P = .049) at final assessment. The mean interferon gamma (P = .001) and interleukin 17 cytokine (P = .009) messenger RNA expression decreased, whereas the mean interleukin 10 (P = .049) and FOXP3 (P = .011) messenger RNA expression increased significantly after platelet-rich plasma treatment.
   Limitations: Small sample size and a relatively short follow-up.
   Conclusion: Platelet-rich plasma was found to have limited efficacy in alopecia areata. However, it may play a role in restoring immune balance in the alopecic patches.

AB  - Lipid droplets (LDs) constitute compartments dedicated to the storage of metabolic energy in the form of neutral lipids. LDs originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with which they maintain close contact throughout their life cycle. These ER-LD junctions facilitate the exchange of both proteins and lipids between these two compartments. In recent years, proteins that are important for the proper formation of LDs and localize to ER-LD junctions have been identified. This junction is unique as it is generally believed to invoke a transition from the ER bilayer membrane to a lipid monolayer that delineates LDs. Proper formation of this junction requires the ordered assembly of proteins and lipids at specialized ER subdomains. Without such a well-ordered assembly of LD biogenesis factors, neutral lipids are synthesized throughout the ER membrane, resulting in the formation of aberrant LDs. Such ectopically formed LDs impact ER and lipid homeostasis, resulting in different types of lipid storage diseases. In response to starvation, the ER-LD junction recruits factors that tether the vacuole to these junctions to facilitate LD degradation. In addition, LDs maintain close contacts with peroxisomes and mitochondria for metabolic channeling of the released fatty acids toward beta-oxidation. In this review, we discuss the function of different components that ensure proper functioning of LD contact sites, their role in lipogenesis and lipolysis, and their relation to lipid storage diseases.

AB  - Aims The purpose of this study was to analyze the clinical outcomes after Eden-Hybinette procedure for revision surgery in recurrent anterior shoulder instability in patients with epilepsy. Materials and Methods We retrospectively evaluated eight such patients between 2015 and 2018. Four patients had failed Latarjet/Bristow procedure and two had failed arthroscopic Bankart procedure, while two had history of both the procedures. After medical control of epilepsy, Eden-Hybinette procedure was performed in all patients. WOSI score and Rowe shoulder score was recorded preoperatively and in subsequent post-operative follow-up. A paired t test was used to analyze and compare preoperative and postoperative outcomes and was considered significant if p value was < 0.05. Results The average follow-up was 30 months (range 24-48 months). There was no recurrence of shoulder instability. The mean WOSI score before surgery was 77.3 (range 70-83), which improved to 24.2 (range 19-30) at 24-month follow-up. The mean Rowe score before surgery was 11.3 (range 5-15), which improved to 81.8(range 65-90) at 24-month follow-up. The improvement in WOSI and Rowe score was found to be statistically significant [p value < 0.05] Conclusions We conclude that Eden-Hybinette is a useful revision procedure to manage recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation in patients with epilepsy. Optimum medical control of seizure is also an important factor in preventing recurrent shoulder instability

AB  - Background: It is thought that there is a high risk of zinc deficiency in India, but there are no representative national estimates.
   Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the national and state-level prevalence of low serum zinc concentrations (SZCs) in Indian children from the nationally representative Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey.
   Methods: Prevalence of low SZC, adjusted for C-reactive protein, was estimated among preschool (1-4 y; n = 7874) and school-age children (5-9 y; n = 10,430) and adolescents (10-19 y; n = 10,140), using SZC cutoffs defined by the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group.
   Results: Prevalence of low SZC was high among adolescents (31.1%; 95% CI: 29.8%, 32.4%), compared with school-age (15.8%; 95% CI: 15.3%, 16.3%) or preschool children (17.4%; 95% CI: 16.7%, 18.0%). However, stratification of prevalence by fasting status or using an alternative lower SZC cutoff independent of fasting status led to a reduction in prevalence by 3.7% or 7.8% in children <10 y, respectively. The prevalence of low SZC was higher among rural preschool children, those belonging to households with poor socioeconomic status, and those with severe stunting or underweight. Preschool children with diarrhea (22.6%; 95% CI: 20.8%, 24.4%), productive cough (22.7%; 95% CI: 18.5%, 27.5%), or malaria/dengue (38.5%; 95% CI: 29.4%, 48.2%) in the 2 wk preceding the survey had a higher prevalence of low SZC than those without morbidity (16.5%; 95% CI: 15.9%, 17.2%; 17.6%; 95% CI: 16.9%, 18.2%; and 17.5%; 95% CI: 16.8%, 18.1%, respectively).
   Conclusions: The national prevalence of low SZC among preschool (17%) or school-age children (16%) was <20%, which is considered the cutoff indicating a problem of public health significance; but there were variations by state and socioeconomic status. In adolescents, however, the prevalence of low SZC was 31%, which warrants further investigation. The association of low SZC with diarrhea in preschool children necessitates better coverage of Zn administration in the management of diarrhea.

AB  - Background People with chronic conditions are disproportionately prone to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic but there are limited data documenting this. We aimed to assess the health, psychosocial and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with chronic conditions in India. Methods Between July 29, to September 12, 2020, we telephonically surveyed adults (n = 2335) with chronic conditions across four sites in India. Data on participants' demographic, socio-economic status, comorbidities, access to health care, treatment satisfaction, self-care behaviors, employment, and income were collected using pre-tested questionnaires. We performed multivariable logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with difficulty in accessing medicines and worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Further, a diverse sample of 40 participants completed qualitative interviews that focused on eliciting patient's experiences during the COVID-19 lockdowns and data analyzed using thematic analysis. Results One thousand seven hundred thirty-four individuals completed the survey (response rate = 74%). The mean (SD) age of respondents was 57.8 years (11.3) and 50% were men. During the COVID-19 lockdowns in India, 83% of participants reported difficulty in accessing healthcare, 17% faced difficulties in accessing medicines, 59% reported loss of income, 38% lost jobs, and 28% reduced fruit and vegetable consumption. In the final-adjusted regression model, rural residence (OR, 95%CI: 4.01,2.90-5.53), having diabetes (2.42, 1.81-3.25) and hypertension (1.70,1.27-2.27), and loss of income (2.30,1.62-3.26) were significantly associated with difficulty in accessing medicines. Further, difficulties in accessing medicines (3.67,2.52-5.35), and job loss (1.90,1.25-2.89) were associated with worsening of diabetes or hypertension symptoms. Qualitative data suggest most participants experienced psychosocial distress due to loss of job or income and had difficulties in accessing in-patient services. Conclusion People with chronic conditions, particularly among poor, rural, and marginalized populations, have experienced difficulties in accessing healthcare and been severely affected both socially and financially by the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) is an important candidate gene implicated in glaucoma pathogenesis because it affects retinal ganglionic cell survival. The present study assessed the genetic association of -509C > T variant in the TGFB promoter region with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in a North Indian Punjabi population. Method A total of 867 subjects (307 POAG, 133 PACG cases and 427 controls) were recruited from the targeted population. Genotyping was done by PCR-RFLP method and the data was analyzed using PLINK software (v1.07). Logistic regression under different genetic models was applied and genotype phenotype correlation was assessed by one-way ANOVA. Result A statistically significant difference in the frequency of heterozygotes among PACG cases (53.16%) and controls (30.07%) (p = 0.0002) was observed. Genetic model analysis revealed that mutant "TT" genotype conferred 2-fold risk towards PACG development under recessive model (p = 0.0019) while dominant model and co-dominant model provided 0.62 and 0.37 fold protection against PACG (p = 0.025 and p = 0.0001, respectively). Data segregation based on sex revealed a strong protective effect of heterozygous 'CT' genotype against progression of PACG among females (p = 0.002, OR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.19-0.70), but conferred 2.14-fold risk among female POAG subjects (p = 0.013). Conclusion The study revealed a strong genetic association of -509C > T variant in TGFB with PACG in females. There is a need to replicate the results in a larger PACG cohort in other populations and further assess the contribution of sex specific factors in modifying genetic susceptibility to PACG.

AB  - Objective The prevalence of anemia has remained high among Indian adolescent girls over the past decade, despite the ongoing iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation program. This study was conducted to assess the impact of daily supplementation of a package of IFA with vitamin B-12 on hemoglobin levels among adolescent girls. Methods A community-based cluster-randomized trial was conducted in the rural block of Faridabad District, Haryana, India in the year 2017. A total of 760 adolescent girls in the age group of 12-19 years with mild and moderate anemia were selected from government schools. Daily-supervised administration of iron and folic acid was conducted for 90 days: experimental group-IFA (iron (60 mg), folic acid (500) mcg), and cyanocobalamin (1000 mcg), control group-IFA and placebo. Hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and vitamin B-12 levels were assessed at baseline and endline. Results Two-hundred adolescent girls completed 90 doses of daily supplementation. The mean hemoglobin (experimental group: 1.3 +/- 1.0 g/dL, control group: 1.6 +/- 1.2 g/dL, P = 0.004) and ferritin levels (experimental group: 18.6 +/- 31.5 ng/mL, control group: 18.8 +/- 35.0 ng/mL, P = 0.188) increased in both the control and experiment groups. Serum vitamin B-12 deficiency significantly reduced to 2.5% in the experimental group and ferritin deficiency alleviated in more than 96% of the girls post intervention. Conclusions Daily supplementation of IFA with/without vitamin B-12 for 90 days eliminated iron, vitamin B-12 deficiency and reduced the overall proportion of anemia by 53.5%. However, addition of vitamin B-12 to IFA supplementation had no impact on improving the hemoglobin levels among adolescent girls. The present study does not recommend provision of vitamin B-12 for prevention and treatment of anemia in this population group.

AB  - Objective To identify the risk factors for glaucoma progression, especially the association with myopia, among treated juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG) patients.
   Methods Glaucomatous progression was analysed in the eyes of JOAG patients with at least 5-years of follow up in this retrospective study. Baseline variables such as age, inheritance pattern, baseline intraocular pressure (IOP), baseline central corneal thickness, visual acuity, baseline refractive error, spherical equivalent (SE) and duration of follow-up were noted. Stereoparametric global trend analysis and Moorfields Regression Analysis on confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy were used to detect progression. Variables associated with glaucoma progression, with respect to progressors (PG) and non-progressors (NPG) were analysed. Since both eyes of a patient were taken for analysis, a generalised estimating equation method was used to correct the bias.
   Results Among 74 eyes (37 subjects), glaucoma progression was noted in 11 eyes (14.9%) of 8 patients, with a median time to progression of 7.4 years (range 5-15.5 years). For myopes (SE <= -1.00 D), glaucoma progression was 18 times more likely than mild and no myopes (>-1DS) (p = 0.03, 95% CI: 1.14, 217.44). The prevalence of myopia in the JOAG, PG and NPG cohorts was 70.3%, 87.5%, and 65.5%, respectively. Myopia progression was noted at follow up in 70% patients. One-unit increase in baseline vertical cup disc ratio, 1 mmHg increase in IOP fluctuations and 1 dB year(-1) depression of visual field were associated with 0.44, 0.06 and 0.07 D year(-1) increases in the rate of myopia progression, respectively.
   Conclusions JOAG progressors had a greater baseline myopic refraction and a faster myopia development over time. The development of myopia in JOAG eyes could be an indicator of glaucoma progression, and hence progressing myopic (<=-1 D) JOAG patients should be followed up more rigorously.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of modern-day oncology, including how stakeholders communicate through social media. We surveyed oncology stakeholders in order to assess their attitudes pertaining to social media and how it has been affected during the pandemic.
   Materials and methods: A 40-item survey was distributed to stakeholders from 8 July to 22 July 2020 and was promoted through the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network.
   Results: One thousand and seventy-six physicians and stakeholders took part in the survey. In total, 57.3% of respondents were medical oncologists, 50.6% aged <40 years, 50.8% of female gender and mostly practicing in Europe (51.5%). More than 90% of respondents considered social media a useful tool for distributing scientific information and for education. Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration.
   Conclusion: Social media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.

AB  - Abnormal indices of cell cycle regulation have been reported in multiple psychiatric disorders. Though reports specific to Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) are scant, numerous studies have highlighted partly common underlying biology in psychiatric disorders, cell cycle regulation being one such process. In this study, we therefore aimed to explore cell cycle in OCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate these effects in OCD. We also evaluated the effect of in vitro fluoxetine, commonly used serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) in OCD patients, on cell cycle regulation. The effects of both disease (OCD) and treatment (SRI) were assessed using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), derived from OCD patients and healthy controls, as a model system. LCLs were treated with 10 mu M of fluoxetine for 24 h, and the percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. We observed a lower proportion of cells in the G2/M phase in OCD cases than controls. The findings suggest that cell cycle dysregulation could be peripheral cellular phenotype for OCD. Among cases, all of whom had been systematically characterized for SRI treatment response, LCLs from non-responders to SRI treatment had a lower proportion of cells in G2/M phase than responders.

AB  - Patients with hematological malignancies are at risk of developing of various infectious and non-infectious pulmonary complications. Common non-infectious pulmonary complications include pulmonary edema, leukostasis, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) and differentiation syndrome. The overlapping imaging features pose diagnostic dilemma. We retrospectively analysed the CT findings in identifying differentiating imaging markers and developing an algorithm. 46 diagnosed patients of non-infectious pulmonary complications who underwent CT chest between February 2017 to March 2020 were included. The CT findings were recorded as parenchymal (GGO, consolidation, septal thickening, peribronchovascular interstitial thickening, and nodules), pleural effusion, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We categorized non-infectious pulmonary complications as: differentiation syndrome (Group1, n = 6), DAH (Group 2, n = 8), leukostasis (Group 3, n = 14),leukemic infiltrate (Group 4, n = 5), and pulmonary edema(Group 5, n = 13). Chi-square or Fisher exact test were used with p value <0.05 as statistically significant.Absence of diffuse GGO in Group 4, interlobular septal thickening in Group 2 and Group 3, nodules in Group 5, and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening in Group 2 were statistically significant. Presence of interlobular septal thickening in Group 5, nodules in Group 4, and peribronchovascular interstitial thickening in Group 5 were statistically significant. Based on the results, an algorithm was developed which may suggest a possible diagnosis in an appropriate clinical scenario.

AB  - A new class of hitherto unexplored 1, 3, 4-oxadiazoles, OXA2a and OXA2b has been synthesized in excellent yields and characterized by IR, NMR and mass spectroscopic studies. Further, the compounds have also been identified clearly with the aid of single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. In the crystal structure, there is a short intramolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot O contact forming S(5) ring motif in OXA2a and OXA2b. The crystal packing of OXA2a is stabilized by the C-H center dot center dot center dot pi intermolecular interactions and in the crystal packing of OXA2b, the adjacent molecules are linked via C-H center dot center dot center dot N intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The intercontacts in the crystal structure are investigated through computational method using Hirshfeld surfaces. In addition, the structure and reactivity of the oxadiazole compounds have been analysed through DFT calculations. Further, both the compounds displayed strong binding affinity with targeted COX-2 enzyme which has been recognized via molecular docking study. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives To study the association of Candida and antifungal therapy with pro-inflammatory cytokines (PIC) in oral leukoplakia (OL).
   Materials and methods A prospective observational study where immunocompetent adult subjects with OL (30 homogenous (HL), 30 non-homogenous (NHL)) and 30 age and sex-matched healthy controls (C) with no predisposing factors for oral Candida infection were recruited. Sterile cotton swabs and ophthalmic sponges were used to sample the lesion surface in OL and buccal mucosa in C, for direct microscopy and culture for Candida and to determine levels of PIC (IL-6, IL-8. IL-17, TNF-alpha) by ELISA, respectively. Sampling for PIC was repeated at same sites in OL, 2 weeks after antifungal therapy.
   Results Candida was associated with 55.3% of NHL, 23.3% of HL and 13.3% of C. The oral secretary levels of PIC were raised in NHL as compared to HL and C. The levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha (p<0.001) and IL-17 (p<0.01) were significantly raised in Candida positive NHL while IL-6 (p<0.05) and TNF-alpha (p<0.01) were significantly raised in Candida positive HL before antifungal treatment. After antifungal treatment, there was significant reduction in PIC in Candida positive NHL and HL.
   Conclusions Candida infection contributes to the inflammatory milieu in Candida associated OL which increases the risk of carcinogenesis. Antifungal therapy reduces the PIC in Candida associated OL.

AB  - Purpose Molecular mechanisms of uveal melanoma development in association with high pigmentation are unclear. Tyrosinase Related Protein (TYRP1) is not only one of the important melanogenesis marker that contributes to melanin synthesis, but can also prevents the melanocyte death. The induction of melanogenesis leads to induction of HIF-1 alpha which can affect the behavior of melanoma cells and its surrounding environment. The aim of our study was to determine the expression of TYRP1 and HIF-1 alpha at the protein and RNA level and determine its prognostic significance. Methods In the present study, the expression of TYRP1 and HIF-1 alpha was investigated on 61 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded choroidal melanoma samples by immunohistochemistry. Fresh 50 samples were validated by real-time PCR. Results were correlated with clinicopathological parameters and Kaplan-Meier was performed to determine the prognostic significance. Results High immunoexpression of TYRP1 and HIF-1 alpha was present in 61 and 54% of patients, respectively. Both TYRP1 and HIF-1 alpha correlated well with high pigmentation and BAP1 (BRCA1 Associated Protein-1) loss (p < 0.05) at IHC level as well as transcriptional level. There was reduced metastatic free survival in patients with necrosis and this was statistically significant (p = 0.010). Conclusion Our findings indicate that TYRP1 can be used as a potential biomarker in the development of targeted therapy in UM. Further studies on melanogenesis markers associated with TYRP1 could provide us a better understanding in this field.

AB  - Renal fusion anomalies are common congenital anomalies of the urogenital tract and have their genesis in the early embryonic period. They are classified into partial fusion anomalies (e.g., crossed fused ectopia, and horseshoe kidney) and complete fusion anomalies (e.g., fused pelvic kidney). Horseshoe kidney is the most common renal fusion anomaly and is characterized by the presence of two distinct functioning kidneys on either side of the vertebral column, with fusion occurring at the inferior poles in majority of the cases. Crossed fused ectopia is characterized by the presence of an ectopic kidney that crosses the midline and fuses with the orthotopic contralateral kidney, whereas fused pelvic (pancake) kidney is a complete fusion anomaly characterized by extensive medial fusion of both kidneys in the pelvis. Fusion anomalies are often associated with abnormalities of renal rotation, migration, and vascular supply, which predispose the kidneys to a number of complications and create difficulty during retroperitoneal surgeries and interventions. They are also associated with other congenital abnormalities of the urogenital tract, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and skeletal system. Hence, a thorough understanding of the etiopathogenesis and radiological features of fusion anomalies is important for directing patient management. This review summarizes the embryological basis, clinical presentation and imaging approach to renal fusion anomalies, followed by detailed anatomical and radiological description of the morphological types, and the complications associated with these anomalies.

AB  - Introduction: Adenomyosis associated abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB-A) often remains non-responsive to medical management. Uterine sparing treatment in young patients presenting with refractory AUB-A poses a challenge.
   Case report: A 28-years-old woman presenting with AUB-A with failed medical therapy did not improve with uterine artery embolization (UAE). She underwent a second session of UAE with smaller embolic particles to which she responded. The reported case is interesting as patient conceived spontaneously despite transiently diminished post-UAE ovarian reserves, indicating spontaneous recovery of ovarian function.
   Conclusion: UAE is a promising option for young patients, though UAE for adenomyosis may require smaller embolic particles to be effective which may diminish ovarian reserves due to non-target effects, however recovery is possible in young patients..

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided global challenges to health-care facilities in ensuring the delivery of care to patients. Tremendous international collaboration has enabled the swift formulation of evidence-based guidelines that aim to clarify day-to-day issues faced by physicians and other health-care providers on the frontlines.
   Areas covered: In order to provide answers to the common questions and dilemmas faced by physicians and policymakers, especially those handling pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, the authors made a list of pertinent clinical topics that were reviewed between 21st of August, 2020 to 30th of August, 2020 by the authors using online databases that included PubMed, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Library. Literature was reviewed and included based on relevance to the topics selected. The review was aimed to serve as a quick reference for addressing practical issues faced during patient care in the ongoing pandemic with a brief account of the management of COVID-19 patients as per international guidelines.
   Expert opinion: As more evidence continues to generate regarding the optimal methods of managing COVID-19 cases while caring for non-COVID patients concurrently, physicians will need to constantly reeducate themselves to keep pace with a rapidly evolving landscape of therapeutic options.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) typically responds better when treated with multiagent chemotherapy in the pediatric and young adolescent populations. Treatment of relapsed/refractory (RR) ALL remains a challenge. Even after stem-cell transplantation and intensive chemotherapy, the prognosis of RR-ALL remains grave. The advent of chimeric antigen receptors has demonstrated promising results in RR-ALL. Chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T) and engineered T cells are used to target cancer cells. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved CD19-specific CAR-T (tisagenlecleucel) therapy for RR-B-cell ALL in patients under 25 years old. In this systematic review, we discuss the efficacy and safety of CD19-specific CAR-T therapy in RR-B-cell ALL in the pediatric and young adult population. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and clinical trials databases. A total of 448 patients received a CD19-specific CAR-T product, and 446 patients had evaluable data. The age range was 0 to 30 years. The incidence rate of complete remission was 82%. The cumulative incidence of relapse after CD19-specific CAR-T therapy is 36%. Similarly, the incidence rate of grade 3 or higher adverse events of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, neurotoxicity, infections, and cytokine release syndrome were 38%, 23%, 18%, 29%, and 19%, respectively. Our subgroup analysis shows the incidence rate of minimal residual negative complete remission was 69% with the CD28z costimulatory domain, 81% with the 4-1BB domain, and 77% with fourth-generation CD19-specific CAR-T therapy.

AB  - mHealth, the use of wireless and portable communication technology to improve the health status of the population, has seen widespread adoption in low- and middle-income countries. It has been used to increase awareness and knowledge of healthcare, to collect health-related data, to deliver healthcare information such as results of investigations or appointment reminders, to aid decision-making by healthcare providers, and to improve communication between various stakeholders of the health system. Developing countries face an immense challenge of periodically updating the professional knowledge of their huge pool of community and facility level healthcare workers. Nearly universal possession of mobile phones, low-cost internet data, and high growth rate of smartphones has facilitated the use of mHealth in delivering evidence-based guidelines and decision-aids to frontline healthcare workers. This review describes the current evidence on the use of mHealth educational interventions targeting maternal and neonatal healthcare providers in low- and middle-income countries. Recent efforts of the National Neonatology Forum of India in integration of mHealth for development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines are also presented.

AB  - Open abdomen or laparostomy as a method of damage control in emergency surgery especially with perforated viscus has been used mainly to prevent abdominal compartment syndrome, burst abdomen and delayed ventral hernia. The authors aimed to study the associated morbidity of open abdomen with clinical and resuscitative parameters. A historical cohort of patients with open abdomen after emergency laparotomy at Trauma Centre AIIMS, New Delhi, from January 2013 to December 2017 was included in this analysis. Patients operated elsewhere came to this hospital for further care; patients with AIS (abbreviated injury score) > 3 in other body regions and patients who died within 48 h were excluded. These patients were studied for their requirement of more than usual post-operative care in the form of requirement of resuscitative measures and other vital clinical parameters. A comparative analysis of patients with and without intra-abdominal complications (enteric fistula and intra-abdominal sepsis) was performed. Of the 113 subjects studied from historical case records, 52 had intra-abdominal sepsis and 10 had entero-cutaneous fistulae. These patients in comparison with those who did not undergo laparotomy during the same period did not require extra efforts for resuscitation, ICU care, increased hospital stay, chest infection and other clinical and biochemical morbid parameters. Immediate post-operative period in this cohort of patients with open abdomen was not associated with extra effort to resuscitate or burden on clinical work. Early definitive closure of abdomen is recommended once patients are stabilised to avoid laparostomy-related complications.

AB  - Recent decade has seen a shift in the causes of childhood blinding diseases from anterior segment to retinal disease in both developed and developing countries. The common retinal disorders are retinopathy of prematurity and vitreoretinal infections in neonates, congenital anomalies in infants, and vascular retinopathies including type 1 diabetes, tumors, and inherited retinal diseases in children (up to 12 years). Retinal imaging helps in diagnosis, management, follow up and prognostication in all these disorders. These imaging modalities include fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, ultrasonography, retinal vascular and structural studies, and electrodiagnosis. Over the decades there has been tremendous advances both in design (compact, multifunctional, tele-consult capable) and technology (wide- and ultra-wide field and noninvasive retinal angiography). These new advances have application in most of the pediatric retinal diseases though at most times the designs of new devices have remained confined to use in adults. Poor patient cooperation and insufficient attention span in children demand careful crafting of the devices. The newer attempts of hand-held retinal diagnostic devices are welcome additions in this direction. While much has been done, there is still much to do in the coming years. One of the compelling and immediate needs is the pediatric version of optical coherence tomography angiography. These needs and demands would increase many folds in future. A sound policy could be the simultaneous development of adult and pediatric version of all ophthalmic diagnostic devices, coupled with capacity building of trained medical personnel.

AB  - Precis:
   Icare tonometer overestimated intraocular pressure (IOP) as compared with Perkins and this variation was higher in IOP>19 mm Hg and corneal opacity in patients with pediatric glaucoma.
   Purpose:
   To compare the IOP measured by Icare ic200 with Perkins tonometer in pediatric glaucoma with different corneal characteristics.
   Methods:
   Patients of pediatric glaucoma posted for routine examination under anesthesia, age below 12 years were enrolled. All patients underwent IOP measurement with Perkins and Icare ic200 tonometer by the same observer. Basic demographic data and other relevant clinical data were recorded. Central corneal thickness (CCT), horizontal corneal diameter, and corneal characteristics such as cornea clarity was recorded.
   Results:
   A total of 194 eyes of 105 patients were analyzed. The difference between Perkins and Icare IOP was -0.816 mm Hg with the Bland-Altman plot 95% limits of agreement (LoA) from -11.194 to 9.562 mm Hg and 5.1% (10) values lying outside LoA. At IOP <19 mm Hg, the difference was -0.65 mm Hg and IOP >= 19 mm Hg, the difference was higher, -1.12 mm Hg. In the clear cornea group (123 eyes), the difference in IOP by 2 tonometers was -0.776 mm Hg with the Bland-Altman plot 95% LoA between -10.679 and 9.128 mm Hg. In hazy corneas (36 eyes), the difference in IOP was 0.531 mm Hg. The Bland-Altman plot showed 95% LoA between -6.242 and 7.303 mm Hg. In the scarred cornea group (35 eyes), the difference in IOP between the 2 was -2.343 mm Hg and the Bland-Altman plot showed wide 95% LoA from -16.302 to 11.616 mm Hg.
   Conclusion:
   Icare tonometer overestimated IOP as compared with Perkins and this variation was higher in eyes with IOP >= 19 mm Hg, CCT >615 mu m, and scarred corneas. A moderate correlation between IOP and CCT for both tonometers was noted.

AB  - Purpose: The evaluation of Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) transcript by different investigative methods (qPCR, PCR and IHC) in corneal buttons from suspected viral keratitis patients and the comparison of results with histopathological findings and clinical diagnosis. Methods: Sixty corneal buttons, 30 suspected viral keratitis, and 30 controls (keratoconus and bullous keratopathy) obtained after primary penetrating keratoplasty, were included in the study. All the corneal buttons were subjected to reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (qPCR) for the detection of latency-associated transcript (LAT) gene, conventional PCR for polymerase (pol) gene, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HSV-1 antigen respectively. After obtaining baseline preoperative clinical data, all the patients were followed up for three years. The results obtained were correlated with clinicopathological features and follow-up data. Results: Of the 30 suspected viral keratitis patients there were 6 females and 24 males with mean age 46.5 +/- 24.62 years (3-80 yrs). There was a marked male preponderance (80%). HSV-1 LAT transcript was detected in 23% (7/30) corneal buttons by qPCR, HSV-1 DNA in 6.7% (2/30) and HSV-1 antigen in 30% (9/30) cases by conventional PCR and IHC respectively. A statistically significant association was found between qPCR and DNA PCR (P = 0.04). All the 30 control corneas were negative for HSV-1 LAT gene, DNA and antigen. Conclusion: Detection of HSV-1 LAT transcript by qPCR may be superior to HSV-1 DNA PCR ( conventional) and IHC, which has low sensitivity. However, the utility of HSV-1 LAT mRNA analysis as a diagnostic modality by qPCR needs to be validated on a larger patient cohort.

AB  - The aim of this article is to describe a novel technique of gluing as an interim measure to provide tectonic support in cases of medium-sized to large-sized (3-6 mm) corneal perforations. Five eyes of five patients in which conventional cyanoacrylate glue application was not feasible, and therapeutic keratoplasty could not be performed in view of the unavailability of corneal tissues were included. Surgery to maintain integrity of the globe was performed, and a therapeutic keratoplasty was performed on tissue availability (mean interval of 7.4 days). On follow-up, all patients had a well-formed anterior chamber, and none of them had progression. The contact lens sandwich technique of glue was a feasible, reproducible, and economical technique during times of tissue unavailability such as the present COVID pandemic, in patients with medium to large perforated corneal ulcers.

AB  - Background: Megaesophagus secondary to achalasia cardia is conventionally treated with esophagectomy. With the advent of minimal invasive surgery, laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy (LHCM) has been used in the management of megaesophagus. The authors hereby report our long-term results of 19 patients of megaesophagus managed with LHCM.
   Materials and Methods: Prospectively collected data of 19 patients with megaesophagus were reviewed for symptomatic outcome using defined symptom scores and achalasia disease-specific quality of life (A-DsQol) after LHCM with an antireflux procedure. Follow-up was done with clinical visits and telephonic calls.
   Results: The mean age of the patients was 39.8 years with 7 female and 12 male individuals. The mean duration of symptoms was 105 months. Dysphagia was the predominant symptom followed by regurgitation and heartburn. A-DsQOL was poor with a mean of 58.6 +/- 8.11. Nine patients had extra respiratory symptoms. All patients underwent LHCM with an antireflux procedure with no conversion, intraoperative perforation, or mortality. At a median follow-up of 66 months (interquartile range, 24.5 to 80), there was a significant improvement of dysphagia, regurgitation, heartburn, and Eckardt scores from 2.26 +/- 1.14, 2.05 +/- 0.62, 1.0 +/- 0.67, and 7.21 +/- 2.22 to 0.21 +/- 0.53, 0.15 +/- 0.37, 0.42 +/- 0.61, and 0.57 +/- 2.06, respectively (P < 0.001). One patient (5.2%) had a recurrence of dysphagia. Sixty-three percent of patients graded their satisfaction level as fully satisfied and 31% as better. A-DsQOL of life improved significantly (P < 0.001) after surgery. The respiratory symptoms improved in all.
   Conclusions: LHCM provides durable relief of symptoms in patients with megaesophagus and may be considered as the first-line treatment option in such patients.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of Octopus 900(OVF) kinetic module with Goldmann perimeter (GVF) and Humphrey 750i (HVF) perimeters in neuro-ophthalmic disorders. Methods: During this prospective observational cross-sectional study, 17 patients (26 eyes) with neuro-ophthalmic disorders underwent visual field examination on the three perimeters. Field defects on OVF were matched with HVF and GVF for the number of quadrants involved. An unmasked observer, and a masked observer (unaware of the clinical diagnosis) were made to separately diagnose the type of field defects on all three fields for the same patient. The pattern of field defect on OVF was compared with GVF and HVF field defects for both observers. Results: When OVF was compared with HVF and GVF, 88% eyes correctly matched for normal or abnormal visual fields, while quadrant-matching was 80% and 89% respectively. For the unmasked observer, the pattern of field defects on OVF was similar to HVF and GVF in 58% and 65% eyes respectively while for a masked observer, it was 54% and 62%. Central and paracentral scotomas showed unmatched fields when OVF was compared with HVF and GVF. When these patients were excluded, sensitivity of OVF increased to 95%. Conclusion: Clinical correlation aids in better characterisation of a field defect. All 3 perimeters are concurrent in the pattern of field defects for non-central defects. However, the default protocol on OVF may not be enough to demarcate the central and para-central scotomas. Development of a customised protocol for the assessment of central and centrocecal field defects increases the accuracy of OVF.

AB  - Secretory carcinoma (SC) of the salivary gland is considered to be a low-intermediate grade tumor with the potential of locally aggressive behavior. This tumor is similar both genetically (ETV6-NTRK3 fusion) and histologically to secretory carcinoma of the breast. We intent to share our experience of four cases of SC in terms of clinical behavior, pathological features, and treatment outcome. Medical records of four cases of SC were retrieved and analyzed for clinical presentation, surgical treatment, and outcome. Pathological data was reanalyzed along with immunohistochemistry. Out of the four identified SC cases, three were men. Two lesions originated from the parotid gland and two from minor salivary glands. Two of these cases exhibited features of locally aggressive pattern. SC of salivary gland origin has distinct histological and immunohistochemical features apart from the characteristic genetic translocation and fusion. Surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy is the treatment of choice. To establish the biological behavior of this tumor, larger case series with long-term follow-up is desirable.

AB  - A delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment in patients with tuberculosis (TB) can affect the period of communicability and cost of treatment. We aimed to describe the diagnostic pathways and delays in initiation of treatment among drug-sensitive newly diagnosed TB patients in Ballabgarh, India. In May 2019, we interviewed 110 TB patients who were put on treatment in the past 2 months. It was a cross-sectional study where data collection was conducted by a physician. We used a structured questionnaire to collect the information on care-seeking practices, delays, and patient's cost. Descriptive analysis was carried out for the pathways, delays, and patient cost. The mean number of health facility contacted before the diagnosis of TB was 2.8 (SD: 1.3); 76% of patients first sought care at a private health facility. The median total delay was 34.5 (IQR: 21-60) days; median patient delay seven (IQR: 2-21) days, median health system delay 16 (IQR: 8-45) days, median diagnostic delay 32.5 (IQR: 18-57) days, and median treatment delay two (IQR: 1-3) days. Health system delay was 2.2 times longer than patient delay; the health system delay was primarily due to delay in diagnosis. Patients contacting private health facility first had 1.7 times total delay, 2.4 times longer health system delay, and 3.4 times of direct cost compared with patients contacting a public health facility first. Accelerated efforts are needed to achieve India's target to eliminate TB by 2025.

AB  - Purpose: Our study aimed to evaluate the outcome of contralateral eye (CE) fixation duress squint surgery (FDSS) in third nerve palsy (3rd NP) with aberrant regeneration and compare the postoperative ptosis correction with preoperative ptosis improvement on adduction. Methods: Patients of 3rd NP with aberrant regeneration who underwent CE FDSS between December 2012-July 2015 in a tertiary-care eye hospital with a follow-up period of 1-year were retrospectively studied to analyze preoperative and postoperative details. Surgical success was defined as the correction of ptosis within 1 mm of preoperative ptosis improvement during maximal adduction of the affected eye, postoperative alignment <= 10 Delta, and resolution of subjective diplopia in primary position. Results: A total of 14 eyes in 14 patients (mean age 23.6 +/- 13.6 years) were included. Mean preoperative exotropia and ptosis in primary position in 14 patients was 53.4 +/- 20pd and 4.89 +/- 2.9 mm, respectively, and mean hypotropia in 6 patients was 23.67 +/- 5.89pd. The mean improvement of ptosis on adduction and supraduction in all patients was 4.07 +/- 2.64 mm and 2.89 +/- 2.22 mm, respectively (P = 0.213). All patients underwent large recession of CE lateral rectus (mean 12.4 +/- 2.7 mm), 9 patients underwent CE medial rectus resection/plication (mean 6.0 +/- 0.9 mm) and 6 patients underwent CE superior rectus recession (mean 6.6 +/- 0.67 mm). Postoperatively, mean ptosis and exotropia correction was 3.7 +/- 2.4 mm (P = 0.000) and 15 +/- 9.6pd (P = 0.000), respectively, and mean hypotropia was 2.17 +/- 4.02pd (P = 0.000). Surgical success was achieved in 6 patients. Postoperative ptosis correction showed strong positive correlation with preoperative improvement of ptosis on adduction (r = 0.87; P = 0.00). Conclusion: Preoperative lid excursion on adduction in 3rd NP can be regarded as a prognostic sign of the success of CE FDSS which can simultaneously correct both ptosis and squint.

AB  - Objective:
   This study was conducted to develop and validate a questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on lifestyle-related behaviour related to eating, activity and sleep pattern.
   Design:
   Indexed study used a mixed method design. Phase I employed qualitative methods for development of questionnaire including literature review, focus group discussion, expert evaluation and pre-testing. Phase II used quantitative methods for establishing construct validity of the questionnaire via parallel factor analysis.
   Participants:
   Phase 1 involved participation of experts from different fields (Departments of Medicine, Nutrition and Clinical Psychology) and general adult population. For phase II, data were collected from 124 adult respondents (female = 57 center dot 26 %); mean age (36 +/- 14 center dot 8 years) residing in an urban setting.
   Results:
   The questionnaire consisted of three sections: (A) socio-demographic and anthropometric parameters, (B) twenty-four items each for investigating the changes in eating, activity and sleep behaviour before v. during COVID-19, (C) six items assessing COVID-19 specific reasons for lifestyle change. The Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire is 0 center dot 83 suggesting its good internal consistency.
   Conclusions:
   This appears to be a valid tool to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle-related behaviours with potential utility for public health researchers to identify these changes at community level and develop strategies to reinforce corrective behaviours.

AB  - Force myography (FMG), is shown to be a promising alternative to electromyography in locomotion classification. However, the placement of force myography sensors over the thigh during locomotion is not yet clear. To this end, an inhouse developed FMG strap was placed over the thigh muscles of healthy/amputees, while walking on different terrains. The performance of the system was tested on six healthy and two amputees during the five different placements of FMG strap i.e., base, distal, lateral, medial, and proximal. The study reveals that there is an increase in average accuracy (STD) from [mean (STD)] 96.4% (4.0) to 99.5% (0.5) for healthy individuals and 95.5% (3.0) to 99.1% (0.3) for amputees while moving the FMG strap to the proximal of the thigh/stump. The study further determines the combination of three FMG channels on anterior side (Rectus Femoris, Vastus lateralis, and Iliotibial Tract muscles) that provides classification accuracy at par (p > 0.05) to utilizing all eight channels for locomotion classification. The variation of humidity throughout the trials did not significantly (p > 0.05) affect the classification accuracy. The study concludes that the optimal location to place the FMG strap is proximal to the thigh/ stump with a minimum of three FMG channels on the anterior part of the thigh for superior classification accuracy.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the post-lockdown challenges during Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic amongst the ophthalmologists in India. Methods: An online survey was sent to the practicing ophthalmologists across India. Data were collected from the responding ophthalmologists and analysed using Medcalc 16.4 software. Results: A total of 794 responses were obtained. Most respondents (51%) were in the age group 30-50 years and were in independent practice (40.05%). Almost three-fourth of ophthalmologists resumed their surgical services after a gap of more than a month post-lockdown. Almost a third of the respondents had significant reduction in their surgical workload during this period. Significant fear of contracting COVID-19 infection in the operation theatres was reported while moderate difficulty was found in procuring protective gear during immediate post-national lockdown period. Conclusion: The pandemic has changed the ophthalmic practice significantly, with patient and staff safety becoming areas of major concern. Both financial and psychological concerns affecting healthcare workers need addressing for continued patient care.

KW  - sleeve gastrectomy
AB  - Background: Complications after bariatric surgery are not uncommon occurrences that influence the choice of operations both by patients and by surgeons. Complications may be classified as intra-operative, early (<30 days post-operatively) or late (beyond 30 days). The prevalence of complications is influenced by the sample size, surgeon's experience and length and percentage of follow-up. There are no multicentric reports of post-bariatric complications from India. Objectives: To examine the various complications after different bariatric operations that currently performed in India. Materials and Methods: A scientific committee designed a questionnaire to examine the post-bariatric surgery complications during a fixed time period in India. Data requested included demographic data, co-morbidities, type of procedure, complications, investigations and management of complications. This questionnaire was sent to all centres where bariatric surgery is performed in India. Data collected were reviewed, were analysed and are presented. Results: Twenty-four centres responded with a report on 11,568 bariatric procedures. These included 4776 (41.3%) sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 3187 (27.5%) one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB), 2993 (25.9%) Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and 612 (5.3%) other procedures. Total reported complications were 363 (3.13%). Post-operative bleeding (0.75%) and nutritional deficiency (0.75%) were the two most common complications. Leaks (P = 0.009) and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (P = 0.019) were significantly higher in SG, marginal ulcers in OAGB (P = 0.000), intestinal obstruction in RYGB (P = 0.001) and nutritional complications in other procedures (P = 0.000). Overall, the percentage of complications was higher in 'other' procedures (6.05%, P = 0.000). There were 18 (0.16%) reported mortalities. Conclusions: The post-bariatric composite complication rate from the 24 participating centres in this study from India is at par with the published data. Aggressive post-bariatric follow-up is required to improve nutritional outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to study the perception of residency trainers about an optimum residency program. Methods: A survey, using a pre-validated questionnaire, was conducted by the Academic and Research Committee of the All India Ophthalmological Society, in 2019-20 with questions directed to teachers in medical colleges and national board of examination's ophthalmology residency programs on demography, teaching experience, imparting clinical and surgical skills, ideal academic schedule and dissertation in the post-graduate residency program. Results: The response rate in the survey was 47.6%. Valid responses were obtained from 309 residency trainers. Of these, 132 of 309 (42.7%) were females. The mean age was 45.3 +/- 9.5 years, range 26-68 years. The trainers believed that on a scale of 0-10, clinical skills teaching should be taught, mean +/- SD: slit lamp 9.8 +/- 0.7; indirect ophthalmoscopy 9.3 +/- 1.3; gonioscopy 9.2 +/- 1.5; perimetry 8.9 +/- 1.5; OCT 8.4 +/- 1.9; applanation tonometry 9.5 +/- 1.2 and orthoptic evaluation 8.1 (+/- 1.9). A resident should ideally perform independently surgeries (median, inter-quartile range IQR): SICS 50 (IQR 40-100); phaco 50 (20-60); pterygium excision 20 (10-40); DCR 10 (5-20); chalazion 20 (10-50), trabeculectomy 7 (5-15); strabismus 5 (2-10), LASIK and retinal detachment 0. Ideally there should be four lectures, four seminars, four case presentations, five journal clubs and four wet labs every month. Conclusion: Teachers expected their wards to become competent professionals. There was near unanimity about the content of clinical skills training, non-medical skills and academics, but there was a significant variation on extent of surgical training that should be imparted to the residents.

AB  - Objectives:
   The present study aimed to assess the role of early intervention of nerve blocks in the management of cancer pain. We also aimed to study its effect on the quality of life and the opioid requirement.
   Materials and Methods:
   Sixty patients with cancer having pain, 18 to 75 years were randomised and divided into an intervention group and analgesic titration with opioids group. Patients in the intervention group received nerve block and residual pain managed with opioids. Control group patients were managed with opioids alone.
   Results:
   The mean visual analog scale score showed statistically significant improvement in both the groups (8.56 +/- 1.07 to 2.5 +/- 0.63 in the intervention group, 9.3 +/- 0.74 to 3.3 +/- 0.75 in the control group at 1 month (P=0.000). This was associated with a decrease in the opioid requirement in the intervention group at 1 week (P=0.014) with only 4 patients receiving morphine at the end of 1 month.
   The change in the Karnofsky scale was statistically significant from baseline to 1 month in both groups.
   Discussion:
   Interventional pain management has a definitive role in palliative setup for pain management. Pain relief was obtained in both groups, but the quality of pain relief was better in the intervention group with an associated reduction in the opioid requirement.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering efficacy and safety of incisional goniotomy as an adjunct to phacoemulsification in primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) patients.
   Methods: Consecutive patients with PACG (high or borderline IOP) deemed fit for phacoemulsification were enrolled. After phacoemulsification, incisional goniotomy was performed with or without goniosynechialysis. Patient demographic profile, clinical data, and adverse events, if any, were analyzed during at least a 6-month follow-up period. Success was defined as IOP of 18 mm Hg or lesser with or without medications.
   Setting: Tertiary care Ophthalmic hospital.
   Design: Prospective interventional case series.
   Results: Of 46 eyes (38 patients) included, 69.6% eyes were classified as having advanced glaucoma. The mean treated IOP decreased by 7.3 +/- 1.0 (SE) mm Hg (95% CI, 5.2-9.3) from 21.4 +/- 6.6 to 14.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg at a mean duration of 11.7 +/- 5.5 months (6-22 months) postoperatively (P < .001, paired t test). There was 66.6% reduction in median number of hypotensive medications (P < .001, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Observed complications included hyphema (13 eyes [28%]), IOP spike (3 eyes [6.5%]), and cyclodialysis (1 eye [2.17%]). High treated IOP and number of medications were significantly associated with failure in univariate analysis (P < .05, Fisher exact test). The cumulative survival probability for qualified success at 22 months was 87.8% +/- 0.07 (95% CI, 0.65-0.96).
   Conclusions: Incisional goniotomy as an adjunct with phacoemulsification resulted in a significant and sustained reduction in IOP along with decrease in number of glaucoma medications in chronic PACG eyes, irrespective of the disease stage.

AB  - Uncertainty exists around the need to include an anthracycline if taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy is being used for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) negative and axillary lymph node negative (LNN) breast cancer. We identified all patients who were diagnosed with HER2-negative, LNN breast cancer treated with docetaxel-cyclophosphamide for four cycles (DC4) or an anthracycline-taxane (AT) regimen following surgical resection in Alberta from 2008 through 2012. We used propensity score methods to match each patient treated with AT to up to four patients treated with DC4 on potentially confounding clinicopathologic and treatment variables. We compared the 10-year invasive disease free survival (iDFS), breast cancer specific-survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) and assessed the effect of the type of adjuvant chemotherapy on these outcomes using Cox regression. Of the 726 eligible patients, 657 (90.5%) were treated with DC4 and 69 (9.5%) were treated with AT. Matching created a group of 202 women treated with DC4 and eliminated differences in clinicopathologic and treatment factors. There was no statistically significant difference for the treatment effects of matched DC4 patients compared to the AT patients on iDFS (75.7% vs. 76.8%, p = 0.75; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.8), BCSS (88.1% vs. 87%, p = 0.8; HR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.42 to 1.9), or OS (87.1% vs. 86.9%, p= 0.96; HR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.1). Four cycles of DC as compared with an AT regimen yielded similar 10-year iDFS, BCSS and OS amongst patients with HER2-negative, LNN breast cancer.

AB  - Background Catch-up in the first two years of life may help in reducing the growth deficit. Objective To study growth pattern of term infants from birth to 2 years, focusing on catch-up and catch-down growth (increase or decrease in z-score >0.67) in weight and length. Study design Prospective birth cohort. Participants 262 healthy term infants with birthweight 1800-4000 g. Intervention Serial assessment of anthropometric parameters at birth, 3.5 month, 1 year and 2 year of age. Outcomes Proportion, timing and determinants of catch-up and catch-down growth. Results Weight catch-up between birth to 3.5 mo, 1 y, and 2 y was seen in 18%, 41% and 38%; and weight catch-down in 27%, 25% and 23%, respectively. Between birth and 2 y, change in weight z-score was inversely related to birthweight (beta -3.754, P<0.001) and directly to caloric intake at 2 y (beta 0.003, P<0.001). Mean (SD) birthweights of infants with catch-up, steady growth and catch-down were 2.6 (0.4), 2.9 (0.4) and 3.1 (0.4) kg, respectively (P<0.001). Catch-up and catch-down in length between birth and 2 y were present in 30% and 33% of the infants, respectively. Length z-scores at 2 y but not at birth were positively correlated with mothers' (r=0.21, P=0.002) and fathers' height (r=0.22, P=0.001). Conclusion Nearly two-thirds of healthy term infants experienced either catch-up or catch-down in weight and length first 2 years of life. Infants' birthweight and length at birth, caloric intake, and parents' heights are important determinants of their growth patterns.

AB  - Background: Boerhavia diffusa is widely used in Asian and African countries in the treatment of inflammatory disorders in adjunct with other herbal formulations. The current research work was devised with an aim to examine the protective effect of hydroalcoholic root extract of Boerhavia diffusa in rheumatoid arthritis. Materials and Methods: Hydroalcoholic extract of plant at varying doses and reference drug (indomethacin 3mg/kg), were administered daily for 21 days. The parameters such as joint diameter, level of antioxidant (GSH) and pro-oxidant (MDA) markers and histolopathological evaluation were performed. Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of Boerhavia diffusa on pro-inflammatory (IL-1), anti-inflammatory (IL-10), pro-inflammatory TNF-alpha and its receptor, TNF-R1, angiogenesis (VEGF), Nrf-2 and NF-kappa B. Results: Findings of study discovered that there is dose dependent significant (p< 0.05) reduction in inflammation by varying doses of Boerhavia diffusa along with the reduction (p< 0.01) in levels of oxidant stress markers. Notable decline in inflammation and joint dysfunction was found in Boerhavia diffusa 200 mg/kg dose with significance of p< 0.001. Conclusion: We concluded that the tuberous roots of Boerhavia diffusa show dose dependently attenuate paw edema, inflammation and reversed the bone damage through inhibition of activated pro-inflammatory mediators, Nrf-2 and specifically NF-kappa B-mediated production of cytokines.

TI  - Efficacy of live attenuated and inactivated influenza vaccines among children in rural India: A 2-year, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial

KW  - VIRUSES
AB  - Background Influenza is a cause of febrile acute respiratory infection (FARI) in India; however, few influenza vaccine trials have been conducted in India. We assessed absolute and relative efficacy of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) among children aged 2 to 10 years in rural India through a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted over 2 years.
   Methods and findings In June 2015, children were randomly allocated to LAIV, IIV, intranasal placebo, or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in a 2:2:1:1 ratio. In June 2016, vaccination was repeated per original allocation. Overall, 3,041 children received LAIV (n = 1,015), IIV (n = 1,010), nasal placebo (n = 507), or IPV (n = 509). Mean age of children was 6.5 years with 20% aged 9 to 10 years. Through weekly home visits, nasal and throat swabs were collected from children with FARI and tested for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction. The primary outcome was laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated FARI; vaccine efficacy (VE) was calculated using modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis by Cox proportional hazards model (PH) for each year. In Year 1, VE was 40.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 25.2 to 51.9) for LAIV and 59.0% (95% CI 47.8 to 67.9) for IIV compared with controls; relative efficacy of LAIV compared with IIV was -46.2% (95% CI -88.9 to -13.1). In Year 2, VE was 51.9% (95% CI 42.0 to 60.1) for LAIV and 49.9% (95% CI 39.2 to 58.7) for IIV; relative efficacy of LAIV compared with IIV was 4.2% (95% CI -19.9 to 23.5). No serious adverse vaccine-attributable events were reported. Study limitations include differing dosage requirements for children between nasal and injectable vaccines (single dose of LAIV versus 2 doses of IIV) in Year 1 and the fact that immunogenicity studies were not conducted.
   Conclusions In this study, we found that LAIV and IIV vaccines were safe and moderately efficacious against influenza virus infection among Indian children.

   Author summary
   Why was this study done?
   In recent years, 2 community-based trials of the single-dose Russian-backbone live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have been published, with contrasting results. In Senegal, LAIV vaccine efficacy (VE) was demonstrated to be 0.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) -26.4 to 20.9), and in Bangladesh, LAIV VE was demonstrated to be 41.0% (95% CI 28.0 to 51.6) against all influenza virus strains. In addition, observational studies for VE of LAIV such as in the United States and Europe have also shown mixed results. While the World Health Organization (WHO) continues to recommend LAIV use in children, conflicting data on LAIV have led countries to review and reconsider national preferential recommendations for LAIV use in children. Given these gaps in evidence and the potential for indigenously produced LAIV to be used for prevention of influenza virus infection in Indian children, we evaluated the absolute efficacy of LAIV and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and relative efficacy of LAIV versus IIV among children aged 2 to 10 years in rural India.
   What did the researchers do and find?
   We conducted a 2-year, triple (participant-observer-analyst) blind, community-based vaccine trial. We randomly assigned 3,041 children aged 2 to 10 years to receive age appropriate doses of LAIV, IIV, or a control vaccine. In Year 1, VE was 40.0% (95% CI 25.2 to 51.9) for LAIV and 59.0% (95% CI 47.8 to 67.9) for IIV compared with controls; relative efficacy of LAIV compared with IIV was -46.2% (95% CI -88.9 to -13.1). In Year 2, VE was 51.9% (95% CI 42.0 to 60.1) for LAIV and 49.9% (95% CI 39.2 to 58.7) for IIV; relative efficacy of LAIV compared with IIV was 4.2% (95% CI -19.9 to 23.5). We found that LAIV and IIV were safe and moderately efficacious against laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection. In Year 1, LAIV, as a single dose in a vaccine-naive population, was significantly less efficacious than IIV, whereas in Year 2, VE for LAIV and IIV was similar. This was the first randomized controlled trial to our knowledge in a developing country setting that compared LAIV efficacy with IIV and provided VE by age group and influenza type/subtype across seasons spanning 2 consecutive years. Importantly, during both years, LAIV and IIV were protective against influenza A(H3N2) viruses. However, LAIV had limited efficacy against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 for both years.
   What do these findings mean?
   Influenza vaccination is an important tool for preparedness and response against seasonal epidemics and pandemics. However, decisions on specific vaccine introductions into national immunization platforms depend on multiple factors including effectiveness, presence of existing immunization platforms and cold chain infrastructure, cost, and local production of the vaccines. Availability of indigenous, safe, and moderately efficacious influenza vaccines, including LAIV, should initiate discussion on the optimal use of vaccines for the national strategy for influenza prevention and control in India.

AB  - The world is fighting the onslaught of COVID 19 for the last 10 months, ever since the first case was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Now, it has spread to over 200 countries. COVID 19-associated respiratory syndrome is causing a lot of mortality and morbidity. There are reports suggesting that the complications and ARDS associated with COVID 19 is an immune response reaction. The cytokine storm associated with severe cases of COVID 19 acts as a cause of death in many sick patients. It has been shown that COVID 19 is associated with a peculiar immune profile: Decrease in CD3, CD4, CD8, natural killer cell and B-cells; Rise in interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha; Decrease in IL-10; Decrease in interferon-gamma. Low-dose radiotherapy (LDRT) immunosuppressive features resulting from M2 macrophage phenotype activation, increase in IL-10, transforming growth factor beta, a decrease in IL-6, TNF alpha and an increase in CD3, CD4, and CD8 T cell counts may negate the harmful effects of cytokine release syndrome. Literature review shows that radiation was previously used to treat viral pneumonia with a good success rate. This practice was discontinued in view of the availability of effective antibiotics and antivirals. As there are no scientifically proven treatment for severe COVID 19-associated respiratory distress today, it is prudent that we understand the benefits of LDRT at this critical juncture and take rational decisions to treat the same. This article provides an radioimmunological rationale for the treatment of immune crisis mediated complications in severe cases of COVID 19.

AB  - The peripheral retina is affected in a variety of retinal disorders. Traditional fundus cameras capture only a part of the fundus even when montaging techniques are used. Ultra-wide field imaging enables us to delve into the retinal periphery in greater detail. It not only facilitates assessing color images of the fundus, but also fluorescein angiography, indocyanine green angiography, fundus autofluorescence, and red and green free images. In this review, a literature search using the keywords "ultra-widefield imaging", "widefield imaging", and "peripheral retinal imaging" in English and non-English languages was done and the relevant articles were included. Ultra-wide field imaging has made new observations in the normal population as well as in eyes with retinal disorders including vascular diseases, degenerative diseases, uveitis, age-related macular degeneration, retinal and choroidal tumors and hereditary retinal dystrophies. This review aims to describe the utility of ultra-wide field imaging in various retinal disorders.

AB  - Background: Clinical breast examination (CBE) is an integral component of triple assessment for women presenting with symptomatic breast disease. Four common search patterns of CBE are "dial of a clock" (DC), "vertical strips" (VS), "quadrant-wise" (QW), and "concentric circles" (CC). The most sensitive search pattern of CBE has not been established.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on women with symptomatic breast disease, to measure various diagnostic performance indices of four different search patterns of CBE by a professor, a surgical resident trainee, and a trained nurse. Women were examined one at a time randomly by three examiners. Each examiner examined with four different search patterns of CBE, one method at a time. Any nodularity or lump detected was noted and the findings were compared with breast sonography, which was considered as the gold standard. Statistical analysis was done using STATA 14, SPSS 20, and OpenEpi software for diagnostic test indices.
   Results: Sixty women (mean age = 39.6) with palpable findings of both breasts were included (n = 120). Most women presented with complaints of breast lump (70%) and mastalgia (27%). Sensitivity was highest for DC as elaborated [% (95% confidence interval)]: DC[73.2 (60-83)] > CC[66 (53-77)] > VS[62.5 (49-73)] > QW[58.9 (45-70)] for professor; DC[64.2 (51-75)] > VS[62.5 (49-73)] > CC[57.1 (44-69)] > QW[57.1 (44-69)] for resident; and DC[82.1 (7090)] > VS[78.5 (66-87)] > CC(75 (62-84)] > QW[73.2 (60-83)] for nurse. The minimum sonographic tumor size picked up by DC by all the examiners was 7 mm.
   Conclusions: The DC search pattern of CBE demonstrated the highest sensitivity for all the examiners. The trained nurse achieved the highest sensitivity among all the examiners.

TI  - Case Report: Isolated Central Nervous System Melioidosis from a Non-Endemic Area
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) melioidosis is a rare neurological infectious disease which carries a high mortality. We describe a previously healthy middle-aged female, who presented to us with left-sided hemiparesis and was on antitubercular therapy from a previous presumed diagnosis of CNS tuberculoma. Non-characteristic imaging picture, multiple negative body fluid cultures, and positive Cerebrospinal fluid galactomannan led to a further delay in diagnosis. Gram stain of the tissue obtained from brain biopsy revealed Gram-negative rods in "safety pin" appearance. By picking up the colonies that appeared on blood agar and MacConkey agar, the identification of the clinical isolates was performed using VITEK (R) matrix (BioM erieux, Marcy-L'Etoile, France)-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (VITEK MALDI TOF MS database version 3.2) which revealed Burkholderia pseudomallei. After the institution of appropriate treatment, she survived but with significant morbidity. A high index of suspicion should be kept for such previously healthy individuals belonging to non-endemic areas, where presentation is suspicious of an infective etiology, but not improving despite appropriate therapy. This may help in early recognition and institution of recommended treatment so that mortality can be avoided.

AB  - Background: Minimally invasive thymectomy (MIT) is emerging as an effective alternative to open thymectomy in the management of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). The primary objective of our study is to assess the surgical and neurological outcome of MIT in patients with MG.
   Materials and Methods: It is a retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data of 100 patients with MG, who underwent MIT from April 2012 to January 2018 at a tertiary care center in India. Surgical outcome was assessed for success of minimal invasive approach, conversion, perioperative morbidity, and postoperative hospital course. Neurological outcome was assessed, after at least 1 year of follow-up, according to Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America postintervention status. Factors predicting complete stable remission (CSR) were evaluated.
   Results: MIT was successfully performed in 98% patients with 2% conversion. There was no mortality. Overall. 10% of patients had perioperative morbidity with 5% having exacerbation of neurological symptoms. Two of these needed postoperative ventilation, whereas 3 recovered on conservative treatment. Median operative time and hospital stay were 140 minutes and 3 days, respectively. At a median follow-up of 47 months. CSR was seen in 20% with improvement in 73.3%. Overall, 63% patients were taken off steroids and patients requiring 3 drugs decreased by 70.7%. There was significant reduction in the dosage of pyridostigmine (P < 0.001), prednisolone (P < 0.001), and azathioprine (P = 0.002) after thymectomy. Milder disease (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America class 1 and 2) predicted CSR on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: MIT is a safe and effective procedure that leads to improvement in neurological status with significant reduction in number and dosage of medications after thymectomy. Mild disease predicts CSR.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the central visual field by microperimetry (MP), in early glaucoma. Methods: Consecutive perimetrically experienced patients with a single nasal step or arcuate scotoma and 14 control eyes underwent MP. Retinal sensitivity on MP was mapped for frequency and depth of loss in the central 10 degrees around fixation. Results: Twenty-one eyes had a single nasal step and 19 eyes with single arcuate scotoma on standard automated perimetry (SAP), with central 10 degrees being normal on 30-2 and 10-2 perimetry. The average mean sensitivity on MP, in glaucomatous and control eyes was 11.8 +/- 3.9 dB and 16.6 +/- 1.2 dB, respectively, P = 0.0004. The average mean defect on MP-1, in glaucomatous and control eyes was- 6.5 +/- 2.0 dB and- 3.0 +/- 1.2 Db, respectively, P = 0.05. The corresponding retinal hemisphere showed significant defects in MP. In eyes with single nasal steps, an absolute scotoma was seen in 14-28% of eyes 8-10 degrees off fixation, moderate to mild defects were seen in 10-52% eyes, and 10% eyes showed involvement up to 4 degrees from the fixation. Eyes with arcuate scotoma had an absolute scotoma on MP in 95% of eyes, 6-10 degrees from fixation, with extension up to 2 degrees from fixation in 21%. In glaucomatous eyes, the normal hemisphere on SAP showed a mild defect on MP in 43%. Control eyes did not show any defect in SAP or MP. Conclusion: A significant loss of central retinal sensitivity is recorded on MP in early glaucomatous neuropathy as compared to SAP. Paramacular absolute defects were seen at 6-10 degrees from fixation.

AB  - Background:
   Despite advances in perioperative neuroscience, there is low interest among anesthesiology trainees to pursue subspecialty training in neuroanesthesiology. We conducted a pilot survey to assess attitudes about neuroanesthesiology fellowship training.
   Materials and Methods:
   A confidential survey was distributed to an international cohort of anesthesiology attendings and trainees between January 15, 2017 and February 26, 2017.
   Results:
   A total of 463 responses were received. Overall, 309 (67%), 30 (6%), 116 (25%), and 8 (2%) of respondents identified themselves as attendings, fellows, residents, and "other," respectively. In total, 390 (84%) of respondents were from the United States. Individuals typically pursue anesthesiology fellowship training because of interest in the subspecialty, acquisition of a special skill set, and the role of fellowship training in career planning and advancement. Overall, 64% of attendings, 56% of fellows, and 55% of residents favored accreditation of neuroanesthesiology fellowships, although opinion was divided regarding the role of accreditation in increasing interest in the specialty. Respondents believe that increased opportunities for research and greater exposure to neurocritical care and neurological monitoring methods would increase interest in neuroanesthesiology fellowship training. Perceived barriers to neuroanesthesiology fellowship training were perceptions that residency provides adequate training in neuroanesthesiology, that a unique skill set is not acquired, and that there are limited job opportunities available to those with neuroanesthesiology fellowship training.
   Conclusions:
   In this pilot survey, we identified several factors that trainees consider when deciding to undertake subspecialty training and barriers that might limit interest in pursuing neuroanesthesiology subspecialty training. Our findings may be used to guide curricular development and identify factors that might increase interest among trainees in pursuing neuroanesthesiology fellowship training.

AB  - Purpose: High-dose rate remote afterloading brachytherapy machine and advanced treatment planning system help in getting optimum dose to tumor and low dose to normal structures. Inverse planning simulated annealing (IPSA) optimization technique has a unique feature of dwell time deviation constraint (DTDC). In this study, six IPSA-based plans having different DTDC values with routinely practiced geometric plus graphical optimization (GO + GrO) have been compared using various dosimetric parameters. Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, we have generated IPSA-optimized interstitial brachytherapy plans for ten cancer cervix patients. Routinely practiced GO + GrO-based plans were compared with six different IPSA plans having varying DTDC values from 0.0 to 1.0 using different dosimetric indices. Results: Conformity index and homogeneity index (HI) were higher in GO + GrO plans, compared to IPSA-optimized plans. However, HI of IPSA plans was increasing with increasing DTDC values. High-dose volumes were well controllable using DTDC parameter in IPSA-optimized plans. Dose to the rectum and bladder was smaller for IPSA-optimized plans than GO + GrO plans. Conclusions: One of the benefits of applying DTDC in IPSA-optimized plan is that it reduces high-dose volumes. Another advantage is the reduction in rectum and bladder dose.

AB  - In 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a significant morbidity and mortality world-wide. As of the date of this writing, a total of 116 M cases has been diagnosed worldwide leading to 2.5 M deaths. The number of mortalities is directly correlated with the rise of innate immune cells (especially macrophages) in the lungs that secrete inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-6) leading to the development of "Cytokine Storm Syndrome" (CSS), multi-organ-failure and death. Given that currently the treatment of this condition is rare and release of effective vaccine might be months away, here, we review the plants and their pharmacologically active-compounds as potential phytopharmaceuticals for the virus induced inflammatory response. Experimental validation of the effectiveness of these natural compounds to prevent or reduce the cytokine storm might be beneficial as an adjunct treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Purpose: We investigated whether Mycobacterium w (Mw), an immunomodulator, would improve clinical outcomes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
   Methods: We conducted an exploratory, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of hospitalised subjects with severe COVID-19 (pulmonary infiltrates and oxygen saturation.94% on room air) conducted at four tertiary care centres in India. Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive either 0.3 mL.day(-1) of Mw intradermally or a matching placebo for three consecutive days. The primary outcome of the study was the distribution of clinical status assessed on a seven-point ordinal scale ranging from discharged (category 1) to death (category 7) on study days 14, 21, and 28. The co-primary outcome was a change in SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment) score on days 7 and 14 compared to the baseline. The secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, time to clinical recovery, time to reverse transcription PCR negativity, adverse events, and others.
   Results: We included 42 subjects (22 Mw, 20 placebo). On days 14 (OR 30.4 (95% CI 3.3-276.4)) and 21 (OR 14.9 (95% CI 1.8-128.4)), subjects in the M-w arm had a better clinical status distribution than placebo. There was no difference in the SOFA score change on days 7 and 14 between the two groups. We did not find any difference in the mortality, or other secondary outcomes. We observed no adverse events related to the use of M-w.
   Conclusions: The use of Mw results in better clinical status distribution on days 14 and 21 compared to placebo in critically ill patients with COVID-19.

AB  - Muscle atrophy occurs in human musculature system due to inactivity of muscles in microgravity environment. Herein, a novel designed countermeasure gravitational load modulation bodygear is developed to enhance muscle activity. The bodygear is devised to compress the body through axial loading from shoulder to feet. The time and frequency domain parameters of electromyography (EMG) signals showed that the activity of gastrocnemius and soleus muscle was increased by 87% and 90% respectively in comparison to without bodygear during stepping. The enhanced muscle activity might be due to the increase in the recruitment of extra motor units, increase in contraction and more potential firing in muscles with bodygear. The results of analysis of variance confirmed that the root mean square, peak and mean frequency values were increased significantly (p < 0.05). Overall, the present bodygear is simple yet highly efficient to enhance muscle activity by providing enough loading during exercise. The bodygear demonstrates potential as a exercise countermeasure device by providing axial loading and can mimic the muscle activity of standing position in bed ridden patients. Further, it may serve as an rehabilitation device for speedy recovery of patients after further design refinement.

AB  - Objective. Respiratory papillomatosis involving the trachea is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present our experience in the management of 13 cases of tracheal papillomatosis and the difficulties encountered in the procedure. The surgical technique and results are discussed.
   Methods. A modified transoral trans-stomal approach was employed for the removal of papillomas by using microdebrider. All patients were operated on under general anaesthesia with intermittent removal of intubation tube and apnoea. All patients required repeated surgeries. Tracheostomy removal was considered after adequate surgery and recurrence-free interval. The follow-up period was 12-24 months.
   Results. The total number of surgeries per patient ranged from 3-35 (mean 10). Decannulation could be successfully achieved in 9 patients. There were no procedure-related complications.
   Conclusions. Transoral trans-stomal microdebrider assisted excision of tracheal papilloma showed excellent results without procedure-related complications. It can be used as a routine procedure for tracheal papillomas. The prognosis of tracheal involvement is fair and most patients can be decannulated.

AB  - Background: Type-III Pantothenate kinase from the multi drug resistant bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii (AbPanK) catalyzes the first step of the essential Coenzyme A biosynthesis pathway. AbPanK is an attractive drug target against the bacteria since it is an essential enzyme and its structure is significantly different from the human PanK.
   Methods: AbPanK was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized. A good quality single crystal was used for X-ray intensity data collection. Dynamic light scattering was done for calculating the hydrodynamic radii and its oligomeric nature in the solution. Binding studies of this protein with its two substrates, Pantothenate and ATP were done using spectrofluorometer.
   Results: Our results indicated that AbPanK shows a strong affinity with pantothenate with dissociation constant of 1.2 x 10-8 M and moderate affinity towards ATP of 3.7 x 10(-3) M. This fact was further substantiated by the calculations of Km of both substrates using kinase assay kit. Dynamic light scattering studies have shown that it exists as homogenous solution with hydrodynamic radii corresponding to the molecular weight of 29.55 kDa. A low-resolution X-ray intensity data set was collected, which shows that AbPank crystallizes in P2 space group with cell dimensions of a = 165 angstrom, b = 260 angstrom, and, c = 197 angstrom and alpha = 90.0, beta = 113.60, gamma = 90.0.
   Discussion: Recombinant Pantothenate kinase from Acinetobacter baumannii was purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The enzyme exhibits very low sequence identity (28%) to other corresponding enzymes.
   Conclusion: The recombinant enzyme was active and its binding affinities with its substrates pantothenate and ATP have been studied. This information would be very useful while designing the inhibitors of this enzyme in order to fight bacterial infections associated to this pathogen.

AB  - BackgroundProgress has been made in the reduction of under-five mortality in India; however, neonatal mortality is reducing at a slower rate. Efforts are required to bring down neonatal mortality in order to attain the Sustainable Development Goal-3. Prevention of sepsis among the high-risk, vulnerable low birth weight neonates by a newer intervention with probiotic supplementation is promising.MethodsA phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is being conducted at six sites in India. A total of 6144 healthy low birth weight (LBW) infants fulfilling the eligibility criteria would be enrolled within the first week of life, after obtaining written informed consent from the parents of the infant. Randomization in 1:1 ratio, stratified by site, sex, and birth weight, would be done through an interactive web response system (IWRS) using a standard web browser and email service. Vivomixx (R), a probiotic containing a mix of 8 strains of bacteria, in a suspension form standardized to deliver 10 billion CFU/ml, or an organoleptically similar placebo would be fed to enrolled infants in a 1-ml/day dose for 30days. The follow-up of enrolled infants for 60days would take place as per a pre-specified schedule for recording morbidities and outcome assessments at the six participating sites. Screening for morbidities would be conducted by trained field workers in the community, and sick infants would be referred to designated clinics/hospitals. A physician would examine the referred infants presenting with complaints and clinical signs, and blood samples would be collected from sick infants for diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by performing sepsis screen and blood culture. Appropriate treatment would be provided as per hospital protocol. The study would be implemented as per the MRC guideline for the management of Global Health Trials in accordance with ICH-GCP and Indian Regulatory guidelines. A contract research organization would be engaged for comprehensive monitoring and quality assurance. The final analysis would be conducted in a blinded manner as per the statistical analysis plan (SAP) to estimate the primary outcomes of sepsis, possible serious bacterial infection (PSBI), and secondary outcomes. The codes will be broken after DMC permission. The protocol has been reviewed by the Research Ethics Committee of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (REC-LSTM), from Research Ethics Committees of the six subject recruitment participating sites.DiscussionThis adequately powered and well-designed trial would conclusively answer the question whether probiotics can prevent neonatal sepsis in the high-risk group of low birth weight infants as indicated by a pilot study in 1340 LBW infants, evidence from systematic reviews of hospital-based studies, and a primary study on healthy newborns in Orissa. Results of the study would be generalizable to India and other low-middle-income countries.Trial registrationClinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) CTRI/2019/05/019197. Registered on 16 May 2019

AB  - Introduction: Trauma services within hospitals may vary considerably at different times across a 24 h period. The variable services may negatively affect the outcome of trauma victims. The current investigation aims to study the effect of arrival time of major trauma patients on mortality and morbidity.
   Method: Retrospective analysis of the Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration (AITSC) registry established in four public university teaching centres in India Based on hospital arrival time, patients were grouped into "Office-hours" and "After-hours". Outcome parameters were compared between the above groups. Results: 5536 (68.4%) patients presented "after-hours" (AO) and 2561 (31.6%) during "office-hours" (OH). The in hospital mortality for "after-hours" and "office-hours" presentations were 12.1% and 11.6% respectively. On unadjusted analysis, there was no statistical difference in the odds of survival for OH versus AH presentations. (OR,1.05, 95% CI 0.9?1.2). Adjusting for potential prognostic factors (injury severity, presence of shock on arrival, referral status, sex, or extremes of age), there was no statistically significant odds of survival for OH versus AH presentations (OR,1.02, 95%CI 0.9-1.2).ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation was longer in the AH group.
   Conclusion: The in-hospital mortality did not differ between trauma patients who arrived during "after-hours" compared to '"office-hours".

AB  - Objective To assess the oncological outcome and prognostic factors for primary Oral Squamous Cell Cancer (OSCC) staged as per AJCC 8th pTNM, and treated by the contemporary standard of primary surgery and pathology directed adjuvant radiation-chemoradiation.
   Methods A single institution cohort from a tertiary care academic institution in North India. Case inclusion 2013 to 2016; n = 218, median follow-up 35 months. All patients were restaged as per the AJCC 8th pTNM classification. Analysis for Overall Survival (OS), Disease-free Survival(DFS), and factors impacting outcome (Cox proportionate model Multivariate analysis).
   Results AJCC pTNM 7th to 8th edition conversion led to upstaging in 16.5%. Stage-II demonstrated greatest stage migration and apparent improvement in OS and DFS (P < .09).
   Discordance was noted between the presurgical (clinico-radiologic) and postsurgical (pathological) nodal status in 40.3% (88/218; 54 pathologically upstaged;34 downstaged). Pathological downstaging was particularly significant with advanced stage Gingivo-Buccal Cancers (25/73-34.7%).
   Stage-I-II early cancers had 3 years. OS-86.7% and DFS-78.8%; Stage-III-IV advanced cancers had 3 years. OS-56.7% and DFS-46.6%. Multivariate analysis identified poorer OS and DFS for age < 40 years (HR-1.8; 2.0), skin involvement (HR-2.1; 2.6) and pN+ status (HR-2.4; 3.5). Bone involvement did not compromise survival in this surgically treated set of patients.
   Conclusion Age < 45 is newly identified as significantly compromising DFS and OS in Oral Cancer. Established factors of skin involvement and pN+ are confirmed as impacting DFS-OS. An apparent improvement in survival in Stage II Cancers is noted as consequent to adoption of AJCC 8th edition staging.

AB  - Introduction: Infections with drug-resistant organisms (DRO) have been associated with poor patient outcomes. To tackle this global problem, it is necessary to understand the risk factors that predispose to infections with DRO.
   Methodology: This was a prospective observational study conducted over a three-year period at a tertiary-care hospital. Bacterial culture isolates from patients admitted in medicine wards with community or hospital-acquired infections were included. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine risk factors for drug-resistant infections.
   Results: Of the 295 patients with 323 isolates included, 40 (12.3%) had non-MDR (N-MDR) infections, 86 (26.6 %) had MDR infections and 197 (61%) had possible extensively drug-resistant (P-XDR) infections. History of previous admission in the preceding three months (Odds Ratio, OR = 4.53, 95% Confidence interval, CI = 1.8-11.42, p = -0.01), high SOFA score at admission (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.0-1.290, p = -0.039) and prolonged duration of ventilation (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.05-1.41, p = -0.012) were independently associated P-XDR infections when compared to patients with N-MDR.
   Conclusions: High rate of multidrug-resistant infections in the studied area is alarming. In this single-centre study, we elicited various risk factors for drug-resistant bacterial infections ranging from patient characteristics to iatrogenic risk factors during the hospital stay. Infections with P-XDR and MDR isolates independently increased hospital and ICU stay duration and were associated with increased mortality.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a noninvasive, depth-resolved imaging tool for the appraisement of retinal vascular changes. Since its introduction, the understanding of diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, central serous retinopathy, and other diseases has been enriched on many fronts. Its dyeless imaging property maps retinal as well as deeper choroidal vasculature in quick succession with good reproducibility. Hence, it can play an important role in the diagnosis and management of optic nerve-related diseases as well. A detailed literature review for its role in nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, optic disc drusen, papillitis, hereditary optic neuropathies, central nervous system diseases, and others highlights its role. The whole spectrum of neuro-ophthalmological diseases shows consistent peripapillary and macular capillary changes with structural and functional correlation. The superficial and deeper retinal and choroidal vasculatures are affected depending on the nature of the disease process. Hence, OCTA positions itself as a useful, noninvasive tool in the armamentarium of a neuro-ophthalmologist in future; however, there are several limitations of the OCTA with respect to its technical abilities in challenging neuroophthalmic cases. Therefore, future research should be directed to enhance the technical capabilities of OCTA and to determine the more precise role of it in the prognosis of neuro-ophthalmic diseases.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has in multiple ways affected healthcare delivery to non-COVIDpatients throughout the world. Adequate transfusion services are fundamental in ongoing therapy of patients with hematological ailments. We present the transfusion services in the hematology daycare under the department of Hematology and supported by the Blood Bank at our institution for the period 12th April 2020-30th June 2020, which saw the stringent lockdown and unlocking Phase I in India, declared in lieu of the pandemic. A 56 % reduction in total transfusion sessions was observed in 2020 (588 sessions given to 176 patients) compared to 1336 sessions in 516 patients over the same period in 2019. The reductions were seen across the different blood components (packed red blood cells [PRBC]: 585 vs. 1840, platelet rich plasma: 372 vs. 1313, single donor platelet 18 vs. 16), with a significant reduction in the mean PRBC transfused per PRBC transfusion session (1.11 vs 1.99, p<0.001) in 2020, compared to 2019. There were however no major differences in the transfusion practices across the different phases of the lockdown. Our study highlights the detrimental reduction in transfusion services due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related lockdown and showcases the remedial strategies taken to maximize transfusion support to patients during this period. Our observations might help to provide insights to adequately combat possible similar adverse situations in the future.

AB  - Purpose The aim was to study surgical outcomes in hangman's fractures in paediatric and adolescent patients and to demonstrate evolution in posterior surgery from C1-C2-C3 fusion to C1 sparing techniques. Methods Patients (aged <= 18 years) operated at a tertiary level centre between September 2011 to February 2018 with more than 1 year of follow-up were included. Neurological status, type of fracture, operating time, blood loss, follow-up, and complications were assessed. Results Nine patients were included, with mean age mean of 16.45 years, with a mean follow-up of 42.78 months. Six patients having neurological deficit showed improvement. Two patients, one having undergone C1-C3 lateral mass screw rod fixation (LMSF) and other had C2 pedicle screw with C3 LMSF, developed kyphosis for which fixation was further extended caudally. One patient with an old hangman's fracture with reabsorbed axis pedicle underwent C2 body screw along with C3-C4 pedicle screw rod fixation and C2 pedicle reconstruction. All patients showed evidence of postoperative fusion. Conclusion Hangman's fractures in young patients can be successfully managed via posterior fixation. In our centre, we have evolved in the direction of motion preservation at C1 C2 joint, along with 3 column stable fixation of the C2 pedicle. C2 pedicle reformation has allowed motion preserving surgery in complex fracture types. Extension of construct till C4 in selected cases is important to prevent postoperative kyphosis.

AB  - The present study examines a temporal relation of walking behavior during locomotion transition (walking to stair ascent) to electrooculography (EOG) signals recorded from eye movement. Further, electroencephalography (EEG) signals from the occipital region of the brain are processed to understand the relative occurrence in EOG and EEG signals during the transition. The dipole sources in the occipital region with reference to EOG detection were estimated from independent components and then clustered using the k means algorithm. The dynamics of the dipoles in the occipital cluster in different frequency bands revealed significant desynchronization in the beta and low gamma bands, followed by resynchronization. This transitional behavior coincided with transient features suggesting possible saccadic movement of the eyes in the EOG signal. With the data from six able-bodied participants, the desynchronization in EEG from the occipital region was detected by nearly 2.2 +/- 0.5s before the transition. Using preprocessing techniques on the EOG signal followed by detecting saccades from the derivative of the EOG signal, the eye movements were detected by nearly 2.5 +/- 0.5s before the transition. The EOG decoded intention of transition appeared as early as 3.0 +/- 1.63s before desynchronization in the EEG. A paired t-test analysis showed that the EOG-based intent decoding of transition reflects significantly earlier than occipital EEG (p < 0.00001). This study could lead to a multi-modal neural-machine interface that may produce results superior to previous attempts involving only EEG and EMG signals.

AB  - We examine the impact of exposure to biomass burning events (primarily crop burning) on the prevalence of hypertension in four North Indian states. We use data from the National Family Health Survey-IV for 2015-16 and employ a multivariate logistic and linear model to estimate the effect of exposure to biomass burning on the prevalence of hypertension and blood pressure, respectively. The adjusted odds ratio of hypertension among individuals living in areas with high intensity of biomass (HIB) burning (defined as exposure to > 100 fire-events during the past 30 days) is 1.15 [95% CI: 1.003-1.32]. The odds ratios further increase at a higher intensity of biomass burning and downwind fires are found to be responsible for the negative effect of fires on cardiovascular health. We also find that the systolic and diastolic blood pressure for older cohorts is significantly higher due to exposure to HIB. We estimate that elimination of HIB would prevent loss of 70-91 thousand DALYs every year and 1.73 to 2.24 Billion USD (in PPP terms) over 5 years by reducing the prevalence of hypertension. Therefore, curbing biomass burning will be associated with significant health and economic benefits in North India.

TI  - Is Coronoidectomy Superior to Coronoidotomy for Improving Maximum Incisal Opening in Patients With Oral Submucous Fibrosis?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: In the management protocol of the oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), multiple studies have advocated that an additional step of coronoidectomy or coronoidotomy helps achieve better and more consistent postoperative results. But, there are no studies that validate if one has an advantage over the other. This study aimed to compare the outcome of the coronoidectomy with coronoidotomy for OSMF cases.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial was designed in patients with OSMF requiring operative intervention. Patients were randomized into 2 groups based on a computer-generated randomization table: group I coronoidectomy and group II coronoidotomy. The primary predictor variables were the 2 different adjunct surgical steps - coronoidectomy and coronoidotomy. The primary outcome variable was the postoperative maximum incisal opening (MIO). Secondary outcome variables were duration of surgery and blood loss.
   Results: The study sample was composed of 32 patients (16 each group). Both the groups were comparable in terms of demographic profile. The MIO after surgery was comparable throughout the study between the groups. Repeated measures analysis of variance for comparison of mouth opening within the group showed that there was a significant improvement in postoperative MIO in both the groups (group I P value <.001 and group II P value 0.004). A statistically significant difference was found in the duration of the surgery (3.5 +/- 0.73 hours vs 2.06 +/- 0.87 hours) and blood loss (393.75 +/- 278.6 mL vs 90.62 +/- 58.36 mL) with the shorter time and less blood loss in coronoidotomy compared with coronoidectomy. All these cases were followed for 1 year.
   Conclusions: Coronoidotomy as an adjunctive treatment in OSMF provides comparable treatment outcome in terms of MIO compared with coronoidectomy with the added advantage of shorter operating time and less blood loss. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Blood and its cellular components are irradiated by ionizing radiation before transfusion to prevent the proliferation of viable T lymphocytes which cause transfusion associated-graft versus host disease. The immunodeficient patients undergoing chemotherapy for various malignancies are at risk of this disease. The international guidelines for blood transfusion recommend a minimum radiation exposure of 25 Gray (Gy) to the midplane of the blood bag, while a minimum dose of 15 Gy and a maximum dose of 50 Gy should be given to each portion of the blood bag. Therefore, precise dosimetry of the blood irradiator is essential to ensure the adequate irradiation of the blood components. The paper presents the fabrication of diacetylene-based colorimetric film dosimeters for the verification of irradiated doses. The diacetylene analogues are synthesized by tailoring them with different amide-based headgroups followed by their coating to develop colorimetric film dosimeters. Among all the synthesized diacetylene analogues, aminofluorene-substituted diacetylene exhibits the most significant color transition from white to blue color at a minimum gamma radiation dose of 5 Gy. The quantitative study of color change is performed by the digitization of the scanned images of film dosimeters. The digital image processing of the developed film dosimeters facilitates rapid dose measurement which enables their facile implementation and promising application in routine blood irradiator dosimetry.

AB  - Introduction: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemistry (IHC) is required to determine the eligibility for pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide and for several other indications depending on the country. Four assays have been approved/Communaute Europeene-In vitro Diagnostic (CV-IVD)-marked, but PD-L1 IHC seems diversely implemented across regions and laboratories with the application of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs).
   Method: To assess the practice of PD-L1 IHC and identify issues and disparities, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee conducted a global survey for pathologists from January to May 2019, comprising multiple questions on preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical conditions.
   Result: A total of 344 pathologists from 64 countries participated with 41% from Europe, 24% from North America, and 18% from Asia. Besides biopsies and resections, cellblocks were used by 75% of the participants and smears by 11%. The clone 22C3 was most often used (69%) followed by SP263 (51%). They were applied as an LDT by 40% and 30% of the users, respectively, and 76% of the participants developed at least one LDT. Half of the participants reported a turnaround time of less than or equal to 2 days, whereas 13% reported that of greater than or equal to 5 days. In addition, quality assurance (QA), formal training for scoring, and standardized reporting were not implemented by 18%, 16%, and 14% of the participants, respectively.
   Conclusions: Heterogeneity in PD-L1 testing is marked across regions and laboratories in terms of antibody clones, IHC assays, samples, turnaround times, and QA measures. The lack of QA, formal training, and standardized reporting stated by a considerable minority identifies a need for additional QA measures and training opportunities.

AB  - Objective: In the background of a large population of bilinguals globally, the study aimed to develop standards of neuropsychological testing in the context of bilingualism. Because bilingualism is known to affect cognitive processes, bilinguals and monolinguals were compared on their performance on cognitive tests, to investigate the possibility of the need for separate normative data for the two groups.
   Method: A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, standardized across five Indian languages: the Indian Council of Medical Research-Neuro Cognitive Tool Box (ICMR-NCTB) was administered to 530 participants (267 monolingual and 263 bilinguals matched for age and education). A systematic method of testing cognition in bilinguals was developed; to identify the appropriate language for testing, ensure language proficiency of examiner, and to interpret the bilingual responses. Additionally, the performance of bilinguals on the ICMR-NCTB was compared with monolinguals.
   Results: Cognitive testing in the bilingual context was performed in the most proficient language of the participants, by examiners well versed with the language. Results from the language-based tests suggested that the frequent occurrence of borrowed- and language-mixed words required consideration while scoring. The reported bilingual effect on cognitive processes did not reflect as differences in the performance between bilinguals and monolinguals.
   Conclusions: Observations from the study provide robust recommendations for neuropsychological testing in the context of bilingualism. Results indicate that separate normative data may not be required for bilinguals and monolinguals. The study will be relevant and provide a reference framework to address similar issues in the large population of bilinguals in other societies.

AB  - Background The lack of definitive treatment or preventative options for COVID-19 led many clinicians early on to consider convalescent plasma (CCP) as potentially therapeutic. Regulators, blood centres and hospitals worldwide worked quickly to get CCP to the bedside. Although response was admirable, several areas have been identified to help improve future pandemic management.
   Materials and methods A multidisciplinary, multinational subgroup from the ISBT Working Group on COVID-19 was tasked with drafting a manuscript that describes the lessons learned pertaining to procurement and administration of CCP, derived from a comprehensive questionnaire within the subgroup.
   Results While each country's responses and preparedness for the pandemic varied, there were shared challenges, spanning supply chain disruptions, staffing, impact of social distancing on the collection of regular blood and CCP products, and the availability of screening and confirmatory SARS-CoV-2 testing for donors and patients. The lack of a general framework to organize data gathering across clinical trials and the desire to provide a potentially life-saving therapeutic through compassionate use hampered the collection of much-needed safety and outcome data worldwide. Communication across all stakeholders was identified as being central to reducing confusion.
   Conclusion The need for flexibility and adaptability remains paramount when dealing with a pandemic. As the world approaches the first anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic with rising rates worldwide and over 115 million cases and 2 center dot 55 million deaths, respectively, it is important to reflect on how to better prepare for future pandemics as we continue to combat the current one.

AB  - Purpose Sunlight-induced p53 mutations are known to contribute towards increased risk of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). Stratifin (14-3-3 sigma)/HEM (human epithelial marker) is a p53-mediated inhibitor of cell cycle progression and has been shown to be a target of epigenetic deregulation in various carcinomas. In the present study, Stratifin expression, its promoter methylation status as well as expression of mutant p53 in early and advanced AJCC stages (8th edition) of OSSN, was evaluated.
   Methods Sixty-four OSSN [20 conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and 44 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)] patients were registered for this study, and they were followed up for 36-58 months (mean 48 +/- 3.6). Immunoexpression of Stratifin and mutant p53 protein, mRNA expression of Stratifin by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and methylation status of Stratifin by methylation-specific PCR, was undertaken.
   Results Hypermethylation of Stratifin promoter in 63% (40/64), loss of Stratifin expression in 75% (48/64) and downregulation of Stratifin mRNA in 61% (39/64) were observed. Stratifin hypermethylation was significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival in both early and advanced T stage SCC cases.
   Expression of mutant p53 expression was seen in 48% (31/64) OSSN cases. Of the 31 patients with mutant p53 expression, 87% (27/31) also demonstrated loss of Stratifin immunoexpression. A significant association was seen between mutant p53 expression and Stratifin loss (p = 0.01) in advanced T stage SCC cases.
   Conclusions Hypermethylation of Stratifin gene and its reduced mRNA expression both are potential biomarkers for identifying high-risk OSSN patients. Aberrant methylation of Stratifin and simultaneous mutant p53 expression implicates involvement of p53-Stratifin mediated signalling pathway in the pathogenesis of OSSN.

AB  - It has often been said that the brain is mostly benefitted from sleep. To understand the importance of sleep, extensive studies on other organs are too required. One such unexplored area is the understanding of muscle physiology during the sleep-wake cycle. Changes in muscle tone with different sleep phases are evident from the rapid eye movement sleep muscle atonia. There is variation in brain and body temperature during sleep stages, the brain temperature being higher during rapid eye movement sleep than slow-wave sleep. However, the change in muscle temperature with different sleep stages is not known. In this study, we have implanted pre-calibrated K-type thermocouples in the hypothalamus and the dorsal nuchal muscle, and a peritoneal transmitter to monitor the hypothalamic, muscle, and body temperature respectively in rats during 24 h sleep-wake cycle. The changes in muscle, body, and hypothalamic temperature during total sleep deprivation were also monitored. During normal sleep-wake stages, the temperature in the decreasing order was that of the hypothalamus, body, and muscle. Total sleep deprivation by gentle handling caused a significant increase in hypothalamic and body temperature, while there was least change in the muscle temperature. The circadian rhythm of the hypothalamic and body temperature in the sleep-deprived rats was disrupted, while the same was preserved in the muscle temperature. The results of our study show that muscle atonia during rapid eye movement sleep is a physiologically regulated thermally quiescent muscle state offering a conducive environment for muscle rest and repair.

As neurosurgery celebrates its first century, the increasing role of women neurosurgeons is a major theme. This article documents the early women pioneers in neurosurgery in Asia and Australasia. The contributions of these trailblazers to the origins, academics, and professional organizations of neurosurgery are highlighted. The first woman neurosurgeon of the region, Dr. T.S. Kanaka of India, completed her training in 1968, not long after the trailblazers in Europe and North America. She heralded the vibrant communities of neurosurgical women that have developed in the vast and diverse nations of the region, and the many formal and informal groups of women in neurosurgery that have introduced and promoted talented women in the profession. Contributions of women neurosurgeons to academic medicine and society as a whole are briefly highlighted, as are their challenges in this male-dominated specialty. The region is home to many deeply conservative societies; in fact, some nations in the region have not yet trained their first woman neurosurgeon. The fortitude of these individuals to achieve at the highest levels of neurosurgery indicates great potential for future growth of women in the profession, but also demonstrates the need for initiatives and advocacy to reach the full potential of gender equity.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress (OS) and mitochondrial alterations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Various environmental triggers like air pollutants, smoking, unhealthy social habits and sedentary lifestyle induce OS, which may compromise mitochondrial integrity. This trial was designed to explore the effect of 8-weeks yoga practice on mitochondrial health and disease severity in an active RA group compared with a usual-care control group.
   Methods: A total of 70 subjects were randomized into two groups: yoga group and non-yoga group. Mitochondrial health was assessed by calculation of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN), OS markers, mitochondrial activity, mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta Psi m), circadian rhythm markers and transcripts associated with mitochondrial integrity: AMPK, TIMP-1, KLOTHO, SIRT-1, and TFAM. Parameters of disease activity and disability quotient were also assessed by disease activity score - erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) and health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI), respectively.
   Results: In yoga group, there was a significant upregulation of mtDNA-CN, mitochondrial activity markers, Delta Psi m, and transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity after 8-weeks of yoga. There was optimization of OS markers, and circadian rhythm markers post 8-weeks practice of yoga. Yoga group participants showed significant improvements in DAS28-ESR (p < 0.05) and HAQ-DI (p < 0.05) over the non-yoga group.
   Conclusion: Adoption of yoga by RA patients holds the key to enhance mitochondrial health, improve circadian rhythm markers, OS marker regulation, upregulation of transcripts that maintain mitochondrial integrity, reduce disease activity and its associated consequences on health outcome and hence can be beneficial as an adjunct therapy.

TI  - Barriers and Facilitators to Substance Use Disorder Treatment in Low-and Middle-Income Countries: A Qualitative Review Synthesis
T2  - SUBSTANCE USE & MISUSE
AB  - Background and aims
   One of the ways to address the treatment gap for substance use disorders is to understand the barriers and facilitators to treatment. This study aimed to synthesize the literature on barriers and facilitators of treatment in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).
   Methods
   We search Medline electronic database to identify English language peer reviewed empirical studies, both qualitative and quantitative which reported barriers and/or facilitators of treatment of substance use disorders.
   Results
   Of 1389 titles, we selected 28 studies (14 were qualitative and 14 quantitative studies). The sample sizes of the qualitative studies ranged from 11 to 235. The majority of studies were from community or clinic settings. A wide range of barriers and facilitators were identified from the qualitative studies and were synthesized according to perceived susceptibility/seriousness, self-efficacy, perceived costs, perceived benefits, and cues to action. Most of the quantitative studies were community-based cross sectional-observational by design. Commonly identified barriers in these quantitative studies were perceived lack of problem or lack of need for treatment and low motivation whereas factors such as good family support and availability of effective treatment was found to facilitate substance use disorder treatment.
   Conclusion
   There are a wide range of barriers that hinder the substance use disorder treatment as well as certain factors that facilitate the treatment. Addressing them can help to minimize the treatment gap, which in turn can help in reducing the familial and social burden due to substance use disorders.

TI  - Successful Multimodality Management of Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumour of the Lower Dorsal Spine with Spinal Drop Metastasis: Illustrated Review
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
KW  - Paediatric spine
KW  - Atypical teratoid
KW  - rhabdoid tumour
KW  - Gross total resection
KW  - Craniospinal irradiation
AB  - Introduction: Spinal atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT) is exquisitely rare and constitutes 2% of all AT/RTs. Case Presentation: A 6-year-old boy presented with low backache for the last 5 months. MRI of the spine showed a 1.5 x 1.5 x 4.7 cm intradural extramedullary mass extending from D10 to D12, causing compression of the conus medullaris. With a preoperative diagnosis of ependymoma, a gross total resection (GTR) of tumour was performed. Post-operative histopathology showed AT/RT. The tumour cells were immunopositive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, smooth muscle actin, and p53 and immunonegative for MIC2, desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and INI1. Post-operative neuraxis MRI revealed post-operative changes (D10-D12) with a 9 mm enhancing lesion at L5-S1 junction suggesting drop metastasis. There was no lesion in brain. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology did not show any malignant cell. The metastatic work-up was normal. He received 3 cycles of chemotherapy with ICE regimen (ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide). Subsequently, he received craniospinal irradiation (CSI)-36 Gy/20 fractions/4 weeks followed by focal boost to primary tumour bed and spinal drop metastasis-14.4 Gy/8 fractions/1.5 weeks. Thereafter, he received 3 more cycles of ICE regimen. End-of-treatment MRI spine showed post-op changes (D10-D12) and 38.9% reduction of the L5-S1 lesion suggesting partial response. Six monthly spinal MRI showed serial reduction of the metastatic lesion leading to complete response (CR) 1 year after completion of treatment. On last follow-up (30 months from the initial diagnosis), he was neurologically intact and in CR. Conclusion: Multimodality management comprising GTR of tumour, CSI followed by focal boost, and multiagent chemotherapy (ICE) can lead to successful outcome in patients with this rare and aggressive spinal tumour.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of data on risk factors for infection among healthcare workers (HCWs) from India. Our objective was to evaluate the risk factors and frequency of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among HCWs.
   Methods: We conducted this retrospective case-control study of 3100 HCWs between May and July 2020. HCWs positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were the cases (n=506) and those negative for SARS-CoV-2 were the controls (n=253). Univariate analysis was followed by multivariate analysis of key demographic, clinical and infection control variables.
   Results: SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in 16.32% of HCWs. Nearly 45% of infected HCWs were asymptomatic. The proportions of sanitation workers (24% vs 8%; p<0.0001) and technicians (10% vs 4%; p=0.0002) were higher and that of doctors was lower among cases as compared with controls (23% vs 43%; p<0.0001). On univariate analysis, the type of HCW, smoking, lack of training, inadequate personal protective equipment (PPE) use and taking no or fewer doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were found to be significant. On multivariate analysis, the type of HCW (risk ratio [RR] 1.67 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.34 to 2.08], p<0.0001), inappropriate PPE use (RR 0.63 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.89], p=0.01) and taking fewer doses of HCQ (RR 0.92 [95% CI 0.86 to 0.99], p=0.03) were significant.
   Conclusions: The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 16% among HCWs. Being a sanitation worker, inappropriate PPE use and lack of HCQ prophylaxis predisposed HCWs to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - A 24-year-old male was brought to our emergency with complaints of abdominal pain for two days. There was a history of foreign body ingestion five days earlier, details of which he refused to reveal. After investigation with abdominal X ray and ultrasound, the foreign body was detected to be a mobile phone containing a battery. Clinical evaluation revealed no signs of lithium toxicity due to battery leak. The patient underwent endoscopy for removal of the mobile phone. The case shows the importance of thorough investigation and prompt attempt at endoscopic removal in the event of ingestion of foreign bodies containing batteries. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

   The present work involves encapsulation of herbal drug nanocurcumin into the virosomes and compared with a liposome in terms of their in vitro anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-migratory efficacy.
   Methods
   The anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-migratory efficacy of virosome and liposome were compared in HepG2 and CaCo2 cells by using MTT, Nitric oxide scavenging, and Wound healing assay, respectively.
   Results
   Size of the optimised NC-Virosome and NC-Liposome was 70.06 +/- 1.63 and 265.80 +/- 1.64 nm, respectively. The prepared NC-Virosome can be stored at -4 degrees C up to six months. The drug encapsulation efficiency of NC-Virosome and NC-Liposome was found to be 84.66 +/- 1.67 and 62.15 +/- 1.75% (w/w). The evaluated minimum inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) for NC-Virosome was 102.7 mu g/ml and 108.1 mu g/ml, while NC-Liposome showed 129.2 mu g/ml and 160.1 mu g/ml for HepG2 and CaCo2 cells, respectively. Morphological examination depicts detachment of the cells from substratum after exposure to NC-Virosome for 48 h.
   Conclusion
   The prepared NC-Virosome provides remarkable in vitro efficacy in both the cell lines with site-specific drug-targeting potential as compared to the liposome, results proved its potential as a drug delivery vehicle for future therapy with reduced toxicity.

AB  - Background Midazolam reduces post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) when compared to a placebo or when used as an adjuvant to other antiemetics. The present study was designed to compare midazolam with a combination of dexamethasone-ondansetron in preventing PONV.
   Methods One hundred and twenty patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries having 2 or more risk factors for PONV (simplified Apfel score) were randomised into 2 groups of 60 each. Patients in group D received 8-mg dexamethasone and 4-mg ondansetron for PONV prophylaxis while those in group M received 2-mg midazolam towards the end of surgery. The proportion of patients (frequency) who had PONV, post-operative nausea (PON) and post-operative vomiting (POV) was noted over 24 hours over the following intervals: 0-2 hours, 2-24 hours and 0-24 hours.
   Results The frequency of PONV at 24 hours in group D and group M was 30% and 33.3% respectively and was not significantly different (P = .70). There was no difference in the time to achieve post-anaesthesia discharge score of >= 9 between the two groups {5 minutes (5, 5) in group D; 5 minutes (1.25, 5) in group M, P = .48}. Ten patients in group D and 11 in group M required a rescue antiemetic over 24 hours (P = .81). The frequency of PON, POV and PONV as well as the median PONV score was similar at all time periods.
   Conclusion Midazolam does not result in significantly different frequency of PONV than a combination of dexamethasone-ondansetron.

KW  - Teleconsultation
AB  - Objective To study the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the utilization of pediatric cardiac care services and to determine the role of teleconsultation services in delivering healthcare in this subset of population.
   Methods It was a retrospective, observational study. All children who attended pediatric cardiology outpatient/teleconsultation services or were admitted to pediatric cardiology ward between April 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019 and April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020, were recruited in the study. Data for patients who underwent surgery or catheter intervention for congenital heart disease were also recorded and analyzed. Comparisons were drawn between the statistics during the two time-periods.
   Results Physical outpatient services were discontinued and were replaced by teleconsultations from April 2020. Inpatient admissions during COVID-19 pandemic (n = 66) decreased by two-thirds as compared to the admissions during similar period in 2019 (n = 189). Similarly, the percentage decrease during these 4 mo of pandemic were 84% for catheter interventions, 90% for total congenital heart disease (CHD) surgeries, and 40% for emergency CHD surgeries. The number of patients availing successful teleconsultation was 1079, which was only 15% of the total number of patients attending physical outpatient services (n = 7176) during the corresponding period in the year 2019. During the pandemic, systematic teleconsultation and local evaluation and investigations aided in better management of patients with CHD.
   Conclusions The utilization of cardiovascular services for CHD has reduced significantly during COVID-19 pandemic, for both out- and inpatient care. Teleconsultation services have streamlined the follow-up care to some extent and have helped in noncontact triaging of these patients for further care.

TI  - Experiments in modeling recent Indian fertility pattern
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - DISTRIBUTIONS
KW  - CURVES
AB  - Modelling is a well-established concept for understanding the typical shape and pattern of age-specific fertility. The distribution of India's age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) is unimodal and positively skewed and is distinct from the ASFR of the developed countries. The existing models (P-K model, Gompertz model, Skew-normal model and G-P model considered here) that were developed, based on the experiences of the developed countries, failed to fit the single-year age-specific fertility pattern for India as a whole and for the six selected states. Our study has proposed four flexible models, to capture the diverse age pattern of fertility, observed in the Indian states. The proposed models were compared in three ways; among themselves, with the original models and with the popular Hadwiger model. The parameters of these proposed models were estimated through the Non-Linear Least Squares Method. To find the model with best fit, we used the corrected version of Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc). Optimization of the four original models was successfully done. When the model was fitted to the empirical data of the 4th round of the National Family Health Survey conducted in 2015-2016, the results of this study showed that all the four proposed models outperform their corresponding original models and the Hadwiger model. When comparison among the proposed models was done, the Modified Gompertz Model provided the best fit for India, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Whereas, the Modified P-K model gave the best fit for West Bengal, Tripura and Karnataka. The Modified G-P model is the most suitable model for Punjab. Although our proposed models illustrated the fitting of ASFR for India as a whole and the selected six states only, it provides an important tool for the policymakers and the government authorities to project fertility rates and to understand the fertility transitions in India and various other states.

AB  - Gall bladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive and most common malignancy of biliary tract lacking effective treatment due to unavailability of suitable biomarkers and therapeutics. SMAD4 is an essential mediator of transforming growth factor-beta pathway involved in various cellular processes like growth, differentiation and apoptosis and also recognized as therapeutic target for GBC and other gastrointestinal tract cancers. In the present study, 3D structure of SMAD4 mutants was optimized through molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) along with wildtype. Furthermore, binding site of protein was predicted through hybrid approach and structural based virtual screening against two drug libraries was performed followed by docking. MDS of top docking score protein-ligand complexes were carried, and binding free energy was rescored. Two potential inhibitors, namely ZINC2098840 and ZINC8789167, were screened that displayed higher binding affinity towards mutant proteins compared with wildtype and both hydrophilic as well as hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role during protein-ligand binding. Current study identified novel and potent inhibitors of SMAD4 mutant that could be used as a drug candidate for the development of personalized medicine for gall bladder and other associated cancers.

AB  - Uveitis is the inflammation of uveal tract comprising of iris, ciliary body and choroid. Blood ocular barriers maintaining the homeostasis of eye breach during uveitis, leads to high risk for sight-threatening complications. The purpose of this study was to compare the anti-inflammatory activity enabled by two diverse pharmacological agents (prednisolone and dapsone) using their effect on aqueous humor proteome. Wistar rats of either sex (150200g) were used and randomly divided into various groups. Normal group was injected with 0.1ml normal saline (NS), endotoxin (LPS) (200 ?g/0.1ml NS) was injected into endotoxin induced inflammatory groups followed by 0.1% dapsone and 1% prednisolone treatment in endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) groups, respectively. Aqueocentesis was performed post 24 hour inflammation and samples were subjected for clinical parameter evaluation, cytokine analysis as well as global proteomic analysis using High-resolution mass spectrometer. Following which spectrum analysis, production spectra of peptides were matched against R. Norvegicus Protein Database (Uniport) using Proteome Discoverer (v2.2). Upon clinical evaluation, the anterior segment images post dapsone and prednisolone treatment have shown marked decrease in hyperaemia, miosis and iridial vessels vasodilation in rat eyes as compared to inflammation group. The result of cytokine analysis revealed 0.1% dapsone and prednisolone both significantly decreased the TNF-? levels. HRMS studies analysis expressed 140, 160, 158 and 141 proteins unique to normal, EIU, Dapsone and prednisolone group respectively. To conclude aqueous humor pharmacoproteomic revealed the anti-inflammatory activity of the dapsone comparable to the prednisolone treatment in endotoxin induced uveitis. The topical dapsone may be used as an alternative therapeutic option in treating uveitis without elevating intraocular pressure.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PEG IFN-?2b) along with the standard of care (SOC) in subjects with moderate COVID-19. Methods: In this phase 2, randomized, open-label study, adult subjects aged 18 years with RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 with moderate symptoms were randomized in a 1:1 to receive PEG IFN-?2b plus SOC, or SOC alone. The primary endpoint was improvement in clinical status on day 15, measured by the WHO 7-point ordinal scale. Results: Forty subjects were randomized to PEG IFN-?2b plus SOC (n = 20) and SOC (n = 20). Overall, 19 (95.0 0%) subjects in PEG IFN-?2b plus SOC had achieved clinical improvement on day 15 compared to 13 (68.42%) subjects in SOC (p < 0.05). Overall, 80% and 95% of subjects in the PEG IFN-?2b plus SOC group had a negative RT-PCR result on day 7 and day 14, respectively, compared to 63% and 68% in the SOC group. Adverse events (AEs) were reported for eleven subjects in the PEG IFN-?2b plus SOC group and eight subjects in the SOC group. All reported AEs were mild. Conclusion: The significant improvement in clinical status on day 15 is likely due to faster viral reduction compared to SOC with the PEG IFN-?2b treated moderate COVID-19 subjects showing a difference as early as day seven and becoming significant by day 14. ? 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: The treatment of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) has seen remarkable advances recently. However, relapse occurs in approximately 20% of cases which necessitates identifying additional high risk parameters for treatment intensification. The aim of this study is to assess the prognostic significance of CD45 antigen expression in pediatric ALL.
   Methods: We studied 363 pediatric patients with B cell precursor-ALL (BCP-ALL) (n = 313) and T-ALL (n = 50). The ratio of median fluorescence intensity of CD45 expressed in leukemic blasts and normal lymphocytes was calculated. The 75th percentile was taken as cut-off to categorise patients into CD45 high and CD45 low groups.
   Results: The 75th percentile was 0.141 in BCP-ALL and 0.548 in T-ALL. In BCP-ALL, there was a statistically significant association of age (>= 10 years) (p = 0.027) and National Cancer Institute high risk group (p = 0.001) with high CD45 expression but not in T-ALL. Worse event-free survival (EFS) was seen with high CD45 expression in BCP-ALL (42.17% versus 60.83%, p = 0.0053). In T-ALL, there was no association between CD45 expression and EFS (CD45 high 40.40% versus low 67.35%, p = 0.414). The overall survival (OS) was 70% versus 60% (p = 0.38) in BCP-ALL and the OS was 82% versus 68% (p = 0.16) in T-ALL for CD45 low versus CD45 high groups, respectively.
   Conclusion: We conclude that high CD45 surface expression is associated with worse EFS in pediatric BCP-ALL.

AB  - Introduction Recruitment of Covid-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors may present as a challenge due to inexperience and differences in donor profile as compared to whole blood donation. Present study highlights the deterrents to recruiting CCP donors at a hospital based blood centre.
   Materials and methods Potential CCP donors were contacted individually by telephone and a group approach through camp organisers from May to July 2020. Recruitment challenges were noted and deferrals of these recruited donors during screening and medical examination was obtained and analysed.
   Results Total 1165 potential CCP donors were contacted. Around 47% donors were lost due to challenges related to information storage and retrieval. Fear of health, family pressure, and fear of a new procedure were major reason (27.2%) for unwillingness to donate. The main reasons for deferral among potential donors were multiparity (38%) and being overage/underage (31.6%). Finally, 468 donors were recruited including 408 by individual approach and 60 by a group approach. From these absence of detectable COVID-19 antibodies were found in 15.4%. Few donors (9.0%) were deferred as they had not completed 28 days post recovery.
   Conclusion The process of CCP donor recruitment differs from that of whole blood donation and requires an individualised approach with involvement of clinicians in the initial phases of the pandemic. A group approach targeting specific organisations could be adopted for a successful CCP collection program. There is a need to relook into some aspects of donor selection such as consideration of multiparous female donors and overage/underage donors after reviewing scientific evidence.

AB  - In eukaryotic genome biology, the genomic organization inside the three-dimensional (3D) nucleus is highly complex, and whether this organization governs gene expression is poorly understood. Nuclear lamina (NL) is a filamentous meshwork of proteins present at the lining of inner nuclear membrane that serves as an anchoring platform for genome organization. Large chromatin domains termed as lamina-associated domains (LADs), play a major role in silencing genes at the nuclear periphery. The interaction of the NL and genome is dynamic and stochastic. Furthermore, many genes change their positions during developmental processes or under disease conditions such as cancer, to activate certain sorts of genes and/or silence others. Pericentromeric heterochromatin (PCH) is mostly in the silenced region within the genome, which localizes at the nuclear periphery. Studies show that several genes located at the PCH are aberrantly expressed in cancer. The interesting question is that despite being localized in the pericentromeric region, how these genes still manage to overcome pericentromeric repression. Although epigenetic mechanisms control the expression of the pericentromeric region, recent studies about genome organization and genome-nuclear lamina interaction have shed light on a new aspect of pericentromeric gene regulation through a complex and coordinated interplay between epigenomic remodeling and genomic organization in cancer.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate tumor-host interface in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by the Brandwein-Gensler histological risk score (BG risk score); to assess its association with clinicopathological features and impact on survival outcomes in a contemporary cohort staged as per AJCC 8th edition pTNM classification. Methods This retrospective cohort study at a tertiary care centre included 178 cases of OSCC treated by primary surgical resection from 2013 to 2016. Pathological lymph node status, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) were assessed. Results BG risk score assessment categorized 25 (14%) cases as low-risk, 93 (52%) as intermediate-risk, and 60 (34%) as high-risk. BG risk score category progression from low to intermediate to high risk was associated with an incremental risk of worsening pN status, DFS, and OS. BG risk score categories significantly demarcated 2-year DFS (96% in low-risk, 51.6% in intermediate-risk, 15% in high-risk; p < 0.001) and OS (96% in low-risk, 66.7% in intermediate-risk, 31.3% in high-risk; p < 0.001). On stratified analysis, BG risk score could further demarcate prognosis in early (I/II) and late (III/IV) stage subgroups (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis indicated the prognostic impact of BG risk score categories to be additional to, and of equal magnitude to, impact of pTNM stage. Conclusions BG risk score is a powerful prognostic tool in OSCC additional to pTNM staging. It can enable risk stratification and inform decisions regarding post-surgical adjuvant treatment. It is undertaken with routine histopathological evaluation, with no increased expense or turnaround time. A case is made for its inclusion in OSCC reporting guidelines.

AB  - Epilepsy is a common neurological condition in children. It is usually amenable to drug therapy. However, nearly one-third of patients may be refractory to antiseizure drugs. Poor compliance and nonepileptic events should be ruled out as possible causes of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). After failing adequate trials of two appropriate antiseizure drugs, patients with focal DRE or poorly classifiable epilepsy or epileptic encephalopathy with focal electro-clinical features should be worked up for surgical candidacy. A randomized controlled trial provided a class I evidence for epilepsy surgery in pediatric DRE. Pre-surgical screening workup typically includes a high-resolution epilepsy protocol brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a high-quality in-patient video electroencephalography evaluation. Advanced investigations such as positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) may be required in selected cases especially when brain MRI is normal, and further evidence for anatomo-electro-clinical concordance is necessary to refine candidacy for surgery and surgical strategy. Some children may also need functional MRI to map eloquent regions of interest such as motor, sensory, and language functions to avoid unacceptable neurological deficits after surgery. Selected children may need invasive long-term electroencephalographic monitoring using stereotactically implanted intracranial depth electrodes or subdural grids. Surgical options include resective surgeries (lesionectomy, lobectomy, multilobar resections) and disconnective surgeries (corpus callosotomy, etc.) with the potential to obtain seizure freedom. Other surgical procedures, typically considered to be palliative are neuromodulation [deep brain stimulation (DBS), vagal nerve stimulation (VNS), and responsive neural stimulation (RNS)]. DBS and RNS are currently not approved in children. Pediatric DRE should be evaluated early considering the risk of epileptic encephalopathy and negative impact on cognition.

AB  - Introduction: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) remains the cornerstone of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) management, and ticagrelor is one of the commonly used second antiplatelet agents. There is some evidence to suggest that morphine may reduce the antiplatelet effect of ticagrelor.
   Methods and results: In a single-center, randomized controlled trial, we compared the effect of morphine and fentanyl on platelet aggregation (PA) among patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor. Platelet aggregation was studied by automated light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) at baseline, and at 2 h after ticagrelor loading. The primary outcome was the difference in the maximal inhibition of platelet aggregation [IPA(%)] between the groups at 2 h. Pain relief, and drug-related adverse events were secondary outcomes. Of 136 patients randomized, 70 received fentanyl and 66 received morphine. At baseline, the median (IQR) platelet aggregation [6135% (54.6 to 70) Vs. 58.8% (52.7 to 72.9)] were comparable between the groups. There was no statistically significant difference between the fentanyl and the morphine groups in IPA at 2-h [85.88%(64.65-98.16) and 81.93%(44.2-98.03), p = 0.09]. However, morphine use was independently associated with a PA of >30% at 2 h (p < 0.009). There was no difference in adverse events.
   Conclusion: In patients with ACS, there was no significant difference between the use of fentanyl or morphine on the effect of ticagrelor on PA. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) also known as Whipple procedure is done for malignant lesions involving the distal CBD, duodenum, ampulla and pancreatic head. In the absence of peritoneal and distant metastases, resectability of the lesion is mainly determined by the relationship of the lesion with the vascular structures in the vicinity. Vascular variations of the celiac artery branches are common and PD, a complex surgical procedure, becomes more challenging if the vascular variations are present. In borderline resectable lesions advances in neoadjuvant therapies and refined surgical techniques are pushing the boundaries of resection. Extended PD is done in borderline resectable lesions when resection and reconstruction of portal vein involved by the primary mass and dissection of extended lymph nodal stations are intended. In this era where more borderline cases are undergoing surgery, it is essential for the radiologist to understand the procedure and the implications of variations in vascular anatomy. Though there are many radiology literatures available on the diagnostic and resectability criteria related to normal vessel anatomy there are very few on the importance of the variant arterial anatomy. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the readers with these variant vessels which can help the surgeons in their intraoperative identification and consequently improve surgical outcomes.

AB  - Background Yoga as alternative form of therapy has shown positive impact on pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, behavioral changes, and inflammation in non-trauma patients. However, the efficacy of Yoga has not been studied in chest trauma patients. Methods This randomized controlled trial was conducted at level-1 Trauma Centre. Isolated chest injury patients were randomized into either standard physiotherapy or Yogatherapy groups. Patients in physiotherapy group received conventional chest physiotherapy and Yogatherapy group received a set of Yogic exercises in addition to conventional chest physiotherapy. Primary outcome measure was changes in pulmonary function tests (PFT) at 4 weeks of discharge. Secondary outcomes were changes in quality of life (QoL), respiratory muscle strength and endurance, chest wall mobility, and levels of cytokines at 4 weeks. Data were analyzed using STATA v14.0. Results A total of 89 eligible patients were randomized to physiotherapy (n = 46) and Yoga therapy (n = 43) groups. Demographic characteristics were comparable in both the groups. There were statistically significant improvements in PFT in the Yogatherapy group compared with physiotherapy with an increase in Forced vital capacity (p = 0.02) and Forced expiratory volume (p = 0.01) at 4 weeks. In addition, there were significant improvement in physical component of QoL, respiratory muscle endurance (p = 0.003) and axillary cirtometry (p = 0.009) in the Yogatherapy group. However, no statistically significant difference in the trends of cytokine markers seen between the groups. Conclusion Yoga was found to be effective in improving pulmonary functions and QoL in patients with chest trauma.

AB  - Background and purpose: The Meta-Analysis of Chemotherapy in squamous cell Head and Neck Cancer (MACH-NC) demonstrated that concomitant chemotherapy (CT) improved overall survival (OS) in patients without distant metastasis. We report the updated results.
   Materials and methods: Published or unpublished randomized trials including patients with nonmetastatic carcinoma randomized between 1965 and 2016 and comparing curative loco-regional treatment (LRT) to LRT + CT or adding another timing of CT to LRT + CT (main question), or comparing induction CT + radiotherapy to radiotherapy + concomitant (or alternating) CT (secondary question) were eligible. Individual patient data were collected and combined using a fixed-effect model. OS was the main endpoint.
   Results: For the main question, 101 trials (18951 patients, median follow-up of 6.5 years) were analyzed. For both questions, there were 16 new (2767 patients) and 11 updated trials. Around 90% of the patients had stage III or IV disease. Interaction between treatment effect on OS and the timing of CT was significant (p < 0.0001), the benefit being limited to concomitant CT (HR: 0.83, 95%CI [0.79; 0.86]; 5(10)-year absolute benefit of 6.5% (3.6%)). Efficacy decreased as patients age increased (p_trend = 0.03). OS was not increased by the addition of induction (HR = 0.96 [0.90; 1.01]) or adjuvant CT (1.02 [0.92; 1.13]). Efficacy of induction CT decreased with poorer performance status (p_trend = 0.03). For the secondary question, eight trials (1214 patients) confirmed the superiority of concomitant CT on OS (HR = 0.84 [0.74; 0.95], p = 0.005).
   Conclusion: The update of MACH-NC confirms the benefit and superiority of the addition of concomitant CT for non-metastatic head and neck cancer. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent times, several control engineers have been working towards development of efficient rehabilitation exoskeletons for mobility impairments. This work aims at implementation of an optimal fuzzy logic-based control strategy for a lower limb exoskeleton application wherein the control parameters for the proposed control approach are obtained by a recently developed optimization technique named as dragon fly algorithm (DFA). For analysis of appropriately tuned closed-loop control, a comparative study between two optimization techniques namely DFA and genetic algorithm (GA) applied to a 2-degree of freedom (dof) nonlinear and coupled lower-limb exoskeleton, is presented. To see the practical aspects, a three-dimensional simscape model of the 4-dof lower limb exoskeleton is developed to observe the closed-loop performance of fuzzy logic proportional-integral-derivative (FLC-PID) controller for bipedal human walking. Experimental data for different speeds during treadmill walking is captured with electronic wireless goniometer, and is used to validate the bipedal walking control for the designed lower-limb exoskeleton. The results are further compared with traditional PID controllers in order to see the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches. Furthermore, the robustness testing of the proposed control schemes is also investigated for different speeds of human walking. This study presents a closed-loop control design for the development of a low-cost lower limb exoskeleton to restore normal gait for persons with mobility disorders, stroke or elderly persons.

AB  - Background: Before the approval of first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors, platinum doublets were the standard of care in patients with treatment-naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable driver mutations. Pemetrexed-platinum combinations are preferred in non-squamous NSCLC. However, there has been no direct comparison to paclitaxel-carboplatin. Methods: This open-label randomized trial was designed to compare pemetrexed-carboplatin with (weekly) paclitaxel-carboplatin in treatment-naive advanced/metastatic non-squamous NSCLC without driver mutations. Patients received either pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) and carboplatin AUC 5 every 3 weeks, or paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) on day 1, day 8, and day 15 with carboplatin AUC 5 every 4 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients in both arms were allowed to receive pemetrexed maintenance. Results: A total of 180 patients were enrolled. The study was terminated early; however, at the time of analysis 75.8% of the required events had occurred. Finally, 164 patients were evaluable, 83 in the pemetrexed arm and 81 in the paclitaxel arm. After a median follow-up of 17 months, progression-free survival (PFS) rates at 6 months were not different in the two treatment arms (47.45 vs. 48.64%, p = 0.88). The median PFS values were 5.67 months (95% CI 3.73-7.3) and 5.03 months (95% CI 2.63-7.43) in each arm, respectively (HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.81-1.59, p = 0.44). The median overall survival was also not different: 14.83 months (95% CI 9.5-18.73) and 11.3 (95% CI 8.3-19.7; HR 1.19, 95% CI 0.8-1.78, p = 0.37). All grade toxicities were similar except for alopecia and peripheral neuropathy, which were higher in the paclitaxel arm. Conclusion: Pemetrexed-carboplatin is not superior to (weekly) paclitaxel-carboplatin as the first-line regimen in advanced non-squamous NSCLC in terms of PFS.

TI  - Generalizability of deep learning models for dental image analysis
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - We assessed the generalizability of deep learning models and how to improve it. Our exemplary use-case was the detection of apical lesions on panoramic radiographs. We employed two datasets of panoramic radiographs from two centers, one in Germany (Charite, Berlin, n=650) and one in India (KGMU, Lucknow, n=650): First, U-Net type models were trained on images from Charite (n=500) and assessed on test sets from Charite and KGMU (each n=150). Second, the relevance of image characteristics was explored using pixel-value transformations, aligning the image characteristics in the datasets. Third, cross-center training effects on generalizability were evaluated by stepwise replacing Charite with KGMU images. Last, we assessed the impact of the dental status (presence of root-canal fillings or restorations). Models trained only on Charite images showed a (mean +/- SD) F1-score of 54.1 +/- 0.8% on Charite and 32.7 +/- 0.8% on KGMU data (p<0.001/t-test). Alignment of image data characteristics between the centers did not improve generalizability. However, by gradually increasing the fraction of KGMU images in the training set (from 0 to 100%) the F1-score on KGMU images improved (46.1 +/- 0.9%) at a moderate decrease on Charite images (50.9 +/- 0.9%, p<0.01). Model performance was good on KGMU images showing root-canal fillings and/or restorations, but much lower on KGMU images without root-canal fillings and/or restorations. Our deep learning models were not generalizable across centers. Cross-center training improved generalizability. Noteworthy, the dental status, but not image characteristics were relevant. Understanding the reasons behind limits in generalizability helps to mitigate generalizability problems.

AB  - Background and objectives Cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19 is due to a pathological inflammatory response of raised cytokines. Removal of these cytokines by therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) prior to end-organ damage may improve clinical outcomes. This manuscript is intended to serve as a preliminary guidance document for application of TPE in patients with severe COVID-19.
   Material and methods The available literature pertaining to the role of TPE for treatment of COVID-19 patients was reviewed to guide optimal management. It included indication, contraindication, optimal timing of initiation and termination of TPE, vascular access and anticoagulants, numbers and mode of procedures, outcome measures and adverse events.
   Results Out of a total of 78 articles, only 65 were directly related to the topic. From these 65, only 32 were acceptable as primary source, while 33 were used as supporting references. TPE in critically ill COVID-19 patients may be classified under ASFA category III grade 2B. The early initiation of TPE for 1-1 center dot 5 patient's plasma volume with fresh frozen plasma, or 4-5% albumin or COVID-19 convalescent plasma as replacement fluids before multiorgan failure, has better chances of recovery. The number of procedures can vary from three to nine depending on patient response.
   Conclusion TPE in COVID-19 patients may help by removing toxic cytokines, viral particles and/or by correcting coagulopathy or restoring endothelial membrane. Severity score (SOFA & APACHE II) and cytokine levels (IL-6, C-reactive protein) can be used to execute TPE therapy and to monitor response in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - This study analyzed the surgical outcomes after initial implementation of a cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) program in government settings in India. Methods: Ovarian cancer patients undergoing cytoreductive surgery and HIPEC from May 2015 to April 2019 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Treatment characteristics and surgical outcomes were analyzed. Results: The study identified 101 patients. The mean peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was 7 +/- 6, with higher PCI scores in primary and recurrent cases. Major morbidities were recorded in 24.7% of patients. High PCI score, completeness of cytoreduction and major morbidities were independent predictors of overall survival in multivariate analysis. Conclusion: The application of HIPEC in limited-resource settings is feasible with acceptable major morbidities. This program should receive similar priority in government systems.

AB  - Introduction: Cognitive impairment has now been recognised to be present in patients with several of spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). Cognitive impairment in patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 has not been evaluated. Objective: To evaluate the cognitive impairment in patients diagnosed with spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12).
   Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study and enrolled 30 (20 male and 10 female) genetically confirmed SCA12 patients and 30 healthy, age, gender and education matched individuals as controls. Cognitive domains were tested using a battery of validated neurocognitive tests.
   Result: Mean age of patients was 51.6 +/- 8.0 years and mean disease duration was 5.3 +/- 3.0 years. Mean International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) score was 29.8 +/- 12.5. SCA 12 patients scored significantly lower than controls in executive function and new learning ability. Other tested cognitive domains were also affected but did not reach statistical significance. Age, age at onset, severity of ataxia, disease duration and CAG repeat length did not correlate with cognitive impairment.
   Conclusion: Cognitive impairment is a part of the spectrum of SCA12 and is characterized by dysfunction in executive function and new learning ability even early in the course of disease.

AB  - Carbenoxolone (CBX) is a semi-synthetic plant derivative with pleiotropic pharmacological properties like antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. Though approved for treatment of gastric ulcers, its use is limited due to adverse effects such as cytotoxicity. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is a natural, non-toxic protein with high water-solubility and low immunogenicity, and is widely used as a nanocarrier for targeted drug delivery. In the present study, controlled release BSA-CBX nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized by desolvation method to reduce drug cytotoxicity. These NPs showed desirable physicochemical properties such as particle size (-240 nm), polydispersity index (0.08), zeta potential (-7.12 mV), drug encapsulation efficiency (72 %), and were stable for at least 3 months at room temperature. The drug was released from the BSA-CBX NPs in a biphasic manner in vitro following non-fickian diffusion. Computational analysis determined that the binding between BSA and CBX occurred through van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds with 93 % steric stability. Further, the cytotoxic assays demonstrated -1.8-4.9-fold reduction in cytotoxicity using three human cell lines (A549, MCF-7, and U-87). Subsequently, this novel CBX formulation with BSA as an efficient carrier can potentially be used for diverse biomedical applications.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global threat and diagnosis of active TB ((ATB) both extra-pulmonary (EPTB), pulmonary (PTB)) and latent TB (LTBI) infection remains challenging, particularly in high-burden countries which still rely heavily on conventional methods. Although molecular diagnostic methods are available, e.g., Cepheid GeneXpert, they are not universally available in all high TB burden countries. There is intense focus on immune biomarkers for use in TB diagnosis, which could provide alternative low-cost, rapid diagnostic solutions. In our previous gene expression studies, we identified peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) mRNA biomarkers in a non-human primate TB aerosol-challenge model. Here, we describe a study to further validate select mRNA biomarkers from this prior study in new cohorts of patients and controls, as a prerequisite for further development. Whole blood mRNA was purified from ATB patients recruited in the UK and India, LTBI and two groups of controls from the UK (i) a low TB incidence region (CNTRLA) and (ii) individuals variably-domiciled in the UK and Asia ((CNTRLB), the latter TB high incidence regions). Seventy-two mRNA biomarker gene targets were analyzed by qPCR using the Roche Lightcycler 480 qPCR platform and data analyzed using GeneSpring (TM) 14.9 bioinformatics software. Differential expression of fifty-three biomarkers was confirmed between MTB infected, LTBI groups and controls, seventeen of which were significant using analysis of variance (ANOVA): CALCOCO2, CD52, GBP1, GBP2, GBP5, HLA-B, IFIT3, IFITM3, IRF1, LOC400759 (GBP1P1), NCF1C, PF4V1, SAMD9L, S100A11, TAF10, TAPBP, and TRIM25. These were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Single biomarkers and biomarker combinations were further assessed using simple arithmetic algorithms. Minimal combination biomarker panels were delineated for primary diagnosis of ATB (both PTB and EPTB), LTBI and identifying LTBI individuals at high risk of progression which showed good performance characteristics. These were assessed for suitability for progression against the standards for new TB diagnostic tests delineated in the published World Health Organization (WHO) technology product profiles (TPPs).

AB  - Convalescent plasma is currently being used in the treatment of COVID-19. Recommendations regarding use convalescent plasma in COVID-19 requires systematic summaries of available evidence. We searched the databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Epistomonikos, Medrxiv and Biorxiv. Title/abstract screening, full text screening and data abstraction were carried out in duplicate by two reviewers. Pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. GRADE tool was used to rate the certainty of evidence. Twenty two studies were found eligible for inclusion: nine randomized controlled trials and thirteen cohort studies. Low certainty evidence from eight RCTs showed inconclusive effects of convalescent plasma on mortality at 28 days (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.18). Low certainty evidence from thirteen cohort studies showed a reduction in mortality at 28 days (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82). The pooled OR for clinical improvement was 1.07 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.34) representing low certainty evidence. Evidence from three RCTs showed inconclusive effect of CP on the need for mechanical ventilation (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.98). Four cohort studies reporting unadjusted estimates suggested a reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation with convalescent plasma (OR 0.80 95% CI 0.71 to 0.91, low certainty). Pooled estimates from 2 RCTs showed inconclusive effects of convalescent plasma on the proportion of patients with nondetectable levels of virus in nasopharyngeal specimens on day 3 (OR 3.62, 95% CI 0.43, 30.49, very low-quality evidence). The present review reports uncertain estimates on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19. There is low certainty evidence of a possible reduction in mortality and mechanical ventilation, a faster viral clearance and the absence of any serious adverse events. However, its efficacy for these outcomes requires evidence from good quality and adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has raised concern about the possibility and effects of mother?infant transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breastfeeding and close contact. The insufficient available evidence has resulted in differing recommendations by health professional associations and national health authorities. We present an approach for deciding public health policy on infant feeding and mother?infant contact in the context of COVID-19, or for future emerging viruses, that balances the risks that are associated with viral infection against child survival, lifelong health, and development, and also maternal health. Using the Lives Saved Tool, we used available data to show how different public health approaches might affect infant mortality. Based on existing evidence, including population and survival estimates, the number of infant deaths in low-income and middle-income countries due to COVID-19 (2020?21) might range between 1800 and 2800. By contrast, if mothers with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection are recommended to separate from their newborn babies and avoid or stop breastfeeding, additional deaths among infants would range between 188 000 and 273 000.

AB  - Study Design. Prospective comparative study. Objective. The aim of this study was to compare the spatiotemporal, kinematic, kinetic and electromyographic (EMG) gait variables in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) and congenital scoliosis and to compare these gait variables of scoliosis patients with healthy controls. Summary of Background Data. Earlier studies have solely focussed on the possibility of altered gait patterns in AIS patients; not much light has been shed on the differences in gait patterns in congenital and adolescent scoliosis patients. Methods. Forty scoliosis patients (20 each with AIS and congenital scoliosis) and 20 healthy volunteers were prospectively recruited. After thorough clinical and radiological examination, all patients underwent gait analysis in accordance with standard protocols. The outcome measures included spatiotemporal, kinetic, kinematic and EMG activity. Composite indices for gait analysis-Gait Profile Score (GPS) and Gait Deviation Index (GDI)-were also calculated. Relevant statistical tests were applied to compare the different groups. Results. No significant difference was found between the AIS and congenital scoliosis groups with respect to baseline demographic and radiological parameters. The two subgroups of scoliosis patients (AIS and congenital) did not differ significantly with respect to any of the measured gait analysis parameters. However, when compared to the healthy age-matched control group, the scoliosis patients differed significantly with respect to gait speed, stride length, step length, GDI, GPS and peak EMG activation for erector spinae, biceps femoris, semimembranosus, rectus femoris, gastrocnemious, and tibialis anterior. Conclusion. Our findings confirm the previous findings of literature regarding the alteration in gait patterns in scoliosis patients when compared to normal individuals. However, the lack of difference in gait analysis variables between AIS and congenital scoliosis patients suggests that this alteration in gait is secondary to the existence of the deformity and does not correlate with the onset or etiology of deformity.

AB  - Objective Myocardial iron overload (MIO) in thalassemia major (TM) may cause subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction which manifests with abnormal strain parameters before a decrease in ejection fraction (EF). Early detection of MIO using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-T2* is vital. Our aim was to assess if CMR feature-tracking (FT) strain correlates with T2*, and whether it can identify early contractile dysfunction in patients with MIO but normal EF. Methods One hundred and four consecutive TM patients with LVEF > 55% on echocardiography were prospectively enrolled. Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria underwent CMR, with T2* being the gold standard for detecting MIO. Group 1 included patients without significant MIO (T2* > 20 ms) and group 2 with significant MIO (T2* < 20 ms). Results Eighty-six patients (mean age, 17.32 years, 59 males) underwent CMR. There were 68 (79.1%) patients in group 1 and 18 (20.9%) in group 2. Fourteen patients (16.3%) had mild-moderate MIO, and four (4.6%) had severe MIO. Patients in group 2 had significantly lower global radial strain (GRS). Global longitudinal strain (GLS) and global circumferential strain (GCS) did not correlate with T2*. T1 mapping values were significantly lower in patients with T2* < 10 ms than those with T2* of 10-20 ms; however, FT-strain values were not significantly different between these two groups. Conclusion CMR-derived GRS, but not GLS and GCS, correlated with CMR T2*. GRS is significantly decreased in TM patients with MIO and normal EF when compared with those without. FT-strain may be a useful adjunct to CMR T2* and maybe an early marker of myocardial dysfunction in TM.

AB  - Information regarding the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in pediatric oncology is limited. We conducted a systematic review of the available published literature on children with cancer affected by COVID-19. The last date of the study search was October 20, 2020, and 33 studies comprising 226 children were included for the final analysis. Data were extracted in a predefined data collection form, and the variables were extracted and analyzed. Patients with hematological malignancies were more in number. Males and children on intensive treatment were more frequently affected. Fever was the commonest symptom. The disease was asymptomatic/mild in 48% and severe in 9.6%. Consolidation, peribronchial cuffing, and consolidation with ground glass opacities were the common imaging findings. Hydroxychloroquine was the most frequently used drug for COVID-19. About 10% of children required intensive care, and about 32% had oxygen requirements. The percentage of children who died due to COVID-19 was 4.9%. The severity, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 in pediatric oncology were more compared to the general pediatric population. This information can help in risk stratification for the management of COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), a common multidrug-resistant pathogen, causes a wide spectrum of nosocomial infections with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The emergence of pan drug-resistant international high-risk clones such as ST258, ST14, ST15, ST147, and ST101 is a global concern. This study was performed to investigate the carbapenemases, the plasmid profile, and the clonal relationship among Indian K. pneumoniae.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 290 K. pneumoniae isolates from seven centers in India were characterized to determine sequence types (STs) and carbapenemases. A subset of isolates was subjected to whole genome sequencing and hybrid genome assembly to obtain the complete genome. Plasmids carrying carbapenemases were characterized to determine the dissemination of carbapenem-resistant (CR) K. pneumoniae.
   Results: From this study, 75 different STs were observed with ST231 being predominant. About 79% of the analyzed isolates were CR with 59% (n = 136) producing OXA48-like carbapenemases. While ST231 was the predominant clone among the OXA48-like producers; NDM producers and NDM+OXA48-like producers were mostly associated with ST14. Interestingly, 61% (n = 138) of the total CR K. pneumoniae were colistin resistant, belonging to 22 different STs. Plasmid profiling shows that bla(OXA48-like) was exclusively carried by ColKP3, whereas bla(NDM) was associated with IncFII-like plasmids.
   Conclusion: The highly mosaic genome of K. pneumoniae coupled with the diverse ecological niches in India makes it a hotspot for antimicrobial resistance, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Extensive molecular surveillance of the clonal spread of K. pneumoniae could help in understanding AMR dynamics and thus rework therapeutic management.

KW  - Nomenclature

KW  - Nephron
KW  - Scientific language
AB  - A recently published nomenclature by a "Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes" (KDIGO) Consensus Conference suggested that the word "kidney" should be used in medical writings instead of "renal" or "nephro" when referring to kidney disease and kidney health. Whereas the decade-old move to use "kidney" more frequently should be supported when communicating with the public-at-large, such as the World Kidney Day, or in English speaking countries in communications with patients, care-partners, and non-medical persons, our point of view is that "renal" or "nephro" should not be removed from scientific and technical writings. Instead, the terms can coexist and be used in their relevant contexts. Cardiologists use "heart" and "cardio" as appropriate such as "heart failure" and "cardiac care units" and have not replaced "cardiovascular" with "heartvessel", for instance. Likewise, in nephrology, we consider that "chronic kidney disease" and "continuous renal replacement therapy" should coexist. We suggest that in scientific writings and technical communications, the words "renal" and "nephro" and their derivatives are more appropriate and should be freely used without any pressure by medical journals to compel patients, care-partners, healthcare providers, researchers and other stakeholders to change their selected words and terminologies. We call to embrace the terms "kidney", "renal" and "nephro" as they are used in different contexts and ask that scientific and medical journals not impose terminology restrictions for kidney disease and kidney health. The choice should be at the discretion of the authors, in the different contexts including in scientific journals.

AB  - Objective: To compare efficacy of myoinositol as an adjuvant to dietary modification for treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus in Asian Indian women compared to controls.
   Study design: Setting: This pilot randomized open label trial was conducted in a single antenatal clinic in India.
   Subjects: One hundred women with singleton pregnancy and gestational diabetes diagnosed between 14-28 weeks' gestation were included. Overt diabetes, twin pregnancy, pre-existing renal disease, heart disease and other chronic medical disorders were exclusions. Intervention: Participants were randomized in two groups (1:1 ratio) by opaque envelope method. Individualized nutrition counseling with dietary modification and routine antenatal care was provided to all. Fifty women received myoinositol 1000 mg twice daily; 50 controls did not receive myoinositol. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels were assessed after two weeks. Women not achieving glycemic targets (fasting glucose <95 and postprandial glucose <120 mg/dL) were given pharmacologic therapy. Contributory factors in women requiring additional pharmacologic therapy, maternal and fetal outcomes were noted. Statistical analysis: Between group comparisons reported relative risk and mean difference. To assess predictive factors for need for pharmacologic therapy, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used.
   Results: Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. Except one woman in the myoinositol group, all women provided glycaemia data throughout their pregnancy. Glycemic control was achieved in 44/ 49 (89.8 %) women in myoinositol group which was significantly higher than 34/50 (68 %) in the controls ((relative risk 0.31, 95 % confidence interval 0.13 to 0.80, p = 0.008). Mean duration of myoinositol treatment was 17.6 weeks (standard deviation 5.3). Additional treatment with metformin/insulin was needed in all women failing to achieve glycaemic control. The mean (range) dose of insulin was 25.3 units in myoinositol group compared to 14.27 units in controls (p = 0.058). Secondary outcomes were similar in two groups except baby weight which was higher in controls (p = 0.018).
   Conclusions: Oral supplementation with myoinositol in dose of 1 gm twice-daily, when started soon after the diagnosis of GDM, is effective in achieving glycemic control and decreasing the need for additional pharmacological therapy in Asian Indian women.

AB  - Objective To develop and validate a model to predict seizure freedom in children undergoing cerebral hemispheric surgery for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy.
   Methods We analyzed 1267 hemispheric surgeries performed in pediatric participants across 32 centers and 12 countries to identify predictors of seizure freedom at 3 months after surgery. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed based on 70% of the dataset (training set) and validated on 30% of the dataset (validation set). Missing data were handled using multiple imputation techniques.
   Results Overall, 817 of 1237 (66%) hemispheric surgeries led to seizure freedom (median follow-up = 24 months), and 1050 of 1237 (85%) were seizure-free at 12 months after surgery. A simple regression model containing age at seizure onset, presence of generalized seizure semiology, presence of contralateral 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron emission tomography hypometabolism, etiologic substrate, and previous nonhemispheric resective surgery is predictive of seizure freedom (area under the curve = .72). A Hemispheric Surgery Outcome Prediction Scale (HOPS) score was devised that can be used to predict seizure freedom.
   Significance Children most likely to benefit from hemispheric surgery can be selected and counseled through the implementation of a scale derived from a multiple regression model. Importantly, children who are unlikely to experience seizure control can be spared from the complications and deficits associated with this surgery. The HOPS score is likely to help physicians in clinical decision-making.

TI  - Predicting Obesity Using Facial Pictures during COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
KW  - BODY-WEIGHT
AB  - Background. Sedentary lifestyle and work from home schedules due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have caused a significant rise in obesity across adults. With limited visits to the doctors during this period to avoid possible infections, there is currently no way to measure or track obesity. Methods. We reviewed the literature on relationships between obesity and facial features, in white, black, hispanic-latino, and Korean populations and validated them against a cohort of Indian participants (n = 106). The body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were obtained using anthropometric measurements, and body fat mass (BFM), percentage body fat (PBF), and visceral fat area (VFA) were measured using body composition analysis. Facial pictures were also collected and processed to characterize facial geometry. Regression analysis was conducted to determine correlations between body fat parameters and facial model parameters. Results. Lower facial geometry was highly correlated with BMI (R-2 = 0.77) followed by PBF (R-2 = 0.72), VFA (R-2 = 0.65), WHR (R-2 = 0.60), BFM (R-2 = 0.59), and weight (R-2 = 0.54). Conclusions. The ability to predict obesity using facial images through mobile application or telemedicine can help with early diagnosis and timely medical intervention for people with obesity during the pandemic.

AB  - Background Pediatric interventional radiology has grown as an advanced subspecialty with increased demand, number and complexity of cases, and number of pediatric institutions offering a pediatric interventional radiology service. Despite the overall increase in the number of pediatric interventionalists over the past two decades, there is a heterogeneity in their academic backgrounds and a lack of uniform training pathways. Objective To analyze the demographics, academic backgrounds and scholarly activities of pediatric interventionalists across the United States (U.S.) and Canada. Materials and methods A list of all members of the Society for Pediatric Interventional Radiology was obtained and pediatric interventionalists at academic and private practice institutions in the U.S. and Canada were included. Publicly available online sources were used to gather demographic and educational information about each pediatric interventionalist, which included the online curriculum vitae, the and websites, and Elsevier's Scopus database. Demographic and educational data including age, gender, educational background, additional degrees, academic rank, previous leadership positions, and metrics of scholarly activities were recorded. Fellowships in diagnostic pediatric radiology, adult interventional radiology and/or pediatric interventional radiology were recorded. Mann-Whitney U tests and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare differences between groups. Results One hundred and twenty-five pediatric interventionalists were included, of whom 24 (19.2%) were female. The mean age was 48.6 years (standard deviation [SD]: 10.6, median: 45 years, range: 36-82 years). There was no statistical difference between median age for male versus female pediatric interventionalists (44.5 years vs. 45 years, P=0.89). A majority of pediatric interventionalists were American medical school graduates (96, 76.8%), while 29 (23.2%) were international medical graduates. Eighty-three percent (104) of the pediatric interventionalists completed diagnostic radiology residency training in the U.S., most commonly at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio (6.4%) and Washington University in St. Louis, MO (5.6%). Among fellowship training, pediatric interventionalists completed a pediatric radiology fellowship (61.6%), adult interventional radiology fellowship (40%) and/or a dedicated pediatric interventional radiology fellowship (57.6%). The mean +/- SD (median) publications, citations and Hirsch index (h-index) for pediatric interventionalists were 32 +/- 45 (12), 68 +/- 1,317 (120) and 9 +/- 10 (5), respectively. There was a statistically higher number of publications, citations and h-index with increasing academic rank at the assistant, associate and professor levels (P<0.001 for all groups). International medical graduate pediatric interventionalists had a higher, but not statistically significant, median publication count (26 vs. 11, P=0.0.25), citation count (236 vs. 93, P=0.36) and h-index (9.0 vs. 5, P=0.24) compared to pediatric interventional radiologists from American medical schools. Conclusion Pediatric interventionalists in North America are predominantly male, with about a quarter having graduated from international medical schools. Pediatric radiology fellowship, followed by pediatric interventional radiology fellowship, was the most frequently pursued training pathway.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS) is a common spinal disease. LDS has been differentiated into dynamic (unstable) and static (stable) spondylolisthesis. Standing flexion/extension lumbar spine radiographs are the best investigation to detect presence of dynamic spondylolisthesis. Magnetic resonance imaging is the investigation of choice to show lumbar canal stenosis and disc prolapse but it can miss dynamic LDS. Studies have shown good association between presence of facet fluid (FF) and dynamic spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. All studies describing the relationship between FF and degenerative spondylolisthesis as measured on dynamic radiographs or kinematic magnetic resonance imaging were included.
   RESULTS: Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria. A total of 1065 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Of the patients with unstable spondylolisthesis, 71% had FF, whereas only 22% of the patients with stable spondylolisthesis had FF. The combined pooled odds ratio for unstable spondylolisthesis in the presence of FF was 7.55 (3.61-15.08; P < 0.00001). The pooled standard mean difference in the FF size in the patients with unstable and stable spondylolisthesis was 0.97 mm (0.38-1.57; P = 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: FF has positive correlation with the presence of dynamic LDS and the probability of dynamic LDS increases as the size of FF increases. The probability of having a dynamic spondylolisthesis in patients with FF >1 mm is 8 times that of patients with no FF. Standing flexion extension radiographs should be performed in patients with FF >1 mm.

AB  - Understanding the causes of the diverse outcome of COVID-19 pandemic in different geographical locations is important for the worldwide vaccine implementation and pandemic control responses. We analyzed 42 unexposed healthy donors and 28 mild COVID-19 subjects up to 5 months from the recovery for SARS-CoV-2 specific immunological memory. Using HLA class II predicted peptide megapools, we identified SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive CD4(+) T cells in around 66% of the unexposed individuals. Moreover, we found detectable immune memory in mild COVID-19 patients several months after recovery in the crucial arms of protective adaptive immunity; CD4(+) T cells and B cells, with a minimal contribution from CD8(+) T cells. Interestingly, the persistent immune memory in COVID-19 patients is predominantly targeted towards the Spike glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2. This study provides the evidence of both high magnitude pre-existing and persistent immune memory in Indian population. By providing the knowledge on cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, our work has implication for the development and implementation of vaccines against COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the role of outdoor light exposure by estimating ocular sun exposure measured by Conjunctival Ultraviolet Autofluorescence (CUVAF) imaging and serum melatonin levels in myopes and non-myopes.
   Materials & Methods: Age and sex matched emmetropes and myopes (60 each) aged 10-25 years participated. Those with a history of ocular surgery or any ocular or systemic co-morbidity were excluded. Socio-demographic parameters, sun exposure questionnaires, indoor and outdoor activity profile, morning serum melatonin levels, sleep pattern, degree of myopia, ocular biometry and area of CUVAF on ultraviolet photography were noted and analyzed.
   Results: Mean age of myopes (18 +/- 4.5 years) and emmetropes (18.5 +/- 4 years) was similar (P = .523). Serum melatonin levels were significantly higher (P = .001) among myopes (89.45 pg/ml) as compared to emmetropes (52.83 pg/ml). Lifetime sun exposure was significantly lower in myopes than emmetropes (P = .0003). Area of CUVAF was inversely related to degree of myopia (P < .0001). Day time sleepiness was greater in myopes (51.7%) than emmetropes (15%) (P < .0001). There was a positive correlation between serum melatonin levels and axial length among myopes (correlation coefficient = 0.27; P = .03). Age and gender had no association with serum melatonin levels.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates an inverse relationship between serum melatonin levels and degree of CUVAF in myopes. A novel link between serum melatonin, axial length and outdoor sun exposure is highlighted in the current study.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of heavy metals on Labeo rohita inhabiting the Yamuna River, India. Levels of heavy metals measured in the water were as follows: Fe>Mn>Zn>Cu>Ni>Cr>Cd. Gill and liver tissue of exposed L. rohita showed a high metal pollution index, compared to reference fish collected from the Agra Canal. In the exposed fish, higher levels of creatinine and enzyme activity (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) were observed, while the A:G index declined. Additionally, higher TLC, lymphocytes, respiratory burst, and nitric oxide synthase activity indicated a heightened immune response. Levels of superoxide dismutase and lipid peroxidation were elevated, while catalase, glutathione S transferase, and glutathione was reduced. DNA of the exposed fish appeared deteriorated, with a greater mean tail length in comparison to the reference. Our results imply that Yamuna River water generates oxidative stress and DNA damage in L. rohita. As this river is a critical source of water and food to the native community, this could pose a threat to public health similar to that in the indicator organism.

AB  - Background: Minimally invasive parathyroid surgery is the standard of care in patients with Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) which requires accurate preoperative localization. Of all the available imaging modalities, 4DCT is considered the best modality for localization, however it entails the risk of ionizing radiation. To circumvent this 4DMRI was evaluated for parathyroid lesion localization.
   Purpose: To evaluate and compare the accuracy of 4DCT and 4DMRI in the localization of parathyroid Lesions. Materials and methods: In this ethically approved observational diagnostic study, 135 patients (age range: 10?75 years, male: female ratio - 1:2.1) with clinically and biochemically suspected PHPT were recruited. Of these, 56 patients underwent both 4DCT and 4DMRI. Six patients with positive imaging who didn?t undergo surgery were excluded. A total of 50 patients with 61 proven parathyroid lesions were included for analysis. 48 patients had surgical and histopathological findings for the confirmation of imaging findings.
   Results: Both 4DCT and 4DMRI correctly detected 59/61 lesions in 48 patients. There was one false positive and two true negatives. In addition, 2 (3.22 %) lesions which were not detected by 4DCT and 4DMRI were found on surgery. The sensitivity of both 4DCT and 4DMRI was 96.7 %; specificity was 66.6 % and accuracy was 95.2 %.
   Conclusion: 4DMRI and 4DCT had similar accuracy for the detection of parathyroid lesions. However, 4DMRI has the advantage of lack of exposure to ionizing radiation, which can be beneficial in younger patients.

AB  - Purpose: To note the comprehensive role of swept source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-ASOCT) in anterior segment diseases. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out on various medical databases using the keywords, swept source anterior segment optical coherence tomography; SS-ASOCT; Cornea and SS-ASOCT; SS-ASOCT and glaucoma; SS-ASOCT and cataract; SS-ASOCT and biometer; SS-ASOCT and tear film and ocular surface.Original works and novel reports describing the potential role of SS-ASOCT in various anterior segment conditions were included. Results: After a thorough assessment of literature, it was clear that the SS-ASOCT did provide newer insights into many anterior eye conditions. The rapid scan acquisition, deeper tissue penetration, and higher magnification did enhance many of our understandings, which were previously not possible. In addition, lenticular assessment under complex clinical scenarios with automated values on objective scale has made it a worthy tool with immense future possibilities. Conclusions: SS-ASOCT unveiled various anterior segment findings which were of clinical importance.

AB  - Tuberculosis, an airborne infectious disease, results in a high morbidity and mortality rate. The continuous emergence of TB resistance strains including MDR (multidrug-resistant tuberculosis), XDR (extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis), and especially TDR (totally drug-resistant tuberculosis) is a major public health threat and has intensified the need to develop new antitubercular agents. A natural product, curcumin, possesses diverse biological activities but suffers due to a lack of water solubility and bioavailability. To overcome these limitations, a series of 17 water-soluble monocarbonyl curcuminoids was synthesized and evaluated for antimycobacterial activity. All compounds exhibited good to moderate anti-TB activity with MIC99 in the range of 3.12-25.0 mu M, out of which 7c and 7p were found the most potent compounds with MIC99 in the range of 3.12-6.25 mu M. Furthermore, these compounds were observed to be nonhaemolytic, nontoxic, and stable under both physiological as well as reducing conditions. In-vitro metabolic stability data of the representative compound 7p with the human liver microsome revealed that these compounds possess a moderate metabolism with a half-life of 1.2 h and an intrinsic clearance of 1.12 ml/h/mg.

TI  - Inclusion of Orogastric Tube in the Staple Line During Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: an Avoidable Complication
T2  - OBESITY SURGERY

KW  - Complication
KW  - RYGB
KW  - Ryle's tube
AB  - Purpose: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) involves creation of a small gastric pouch by sequential firing of stapler. During stapler firing, the orogastric tube (OGT) needs to be withdrawn to avoid inclusion in the staple line. We report a rare complication of inadvertent stapling of the OGT during creation of the gastric pouch.
   Materials and methods: A 37-year old man with body mass index (BMI) of 52.5 kg/m(2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus, obstructive sleep apnoea, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, underwent LRYGB, with a biliopancreatic limb of 70 cm and an alimentary limb of 130 cm. Before firing the stapler for gastric pouch, the anaesthesia team was requested to withdraw the OGT, and they confirmed that it was done. The stapler was fired without any difficulty. Gastrojejunostomy was also done using linear stapler without any hindrance. The enterotomies were closed with absorbable sutures. Methylene blue leak test was found to be negative. Just before extubation, the anaesthesia team asked us if the OGT could be removed! To our horror, the OGT could not be pulled out on gentle tugging, confirming inclusion of the OGT in the staple line. The patient was induced again and re-explored immediately, with endoscopic guidance. Both the pouch and remnant stomach were opened, the cut ends of OGT freed from both staple lines, and the tube removed. The openings in the pouch and remnant stomach were closed with stapler. Methylene blue leak test and air insufflation test were done and found to be negative.
   Results: Postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 5. Review of the recorded video was done but the OGT was not visualised through the initial gastrotomy as the OGT had possibly been stapled during the last vertical firing higher up near the fundus.
   Discussion: Stapler firing over the OGT can occur insidiously without the surgeon's awareness. In this case, it was only suspected when the anaesthesia team asked us matter-of-factly whether the OGT could be removed. We had presumed that it had been removed before the first firing. Some surgeons prefer to keep the OGT for a day after surgery. Had that been our practice, this complication would have mandated a re-surgery in the early postoperative period.
   Such complications occur when the surgeon fails to request the anaesthesia team to remove the OGT or if there is poor communication between the surgical and anaesthesia teams. Sometimes, it can be due to change in the anaesthesia team during the procedure. In our case, though the anaesthesia team was the same, there was a new anaesthesia registrar who was involved in a bariatric surgical case for the first time.
   Use of transparent drapes, if available, may be advantageous, enabling the surgical team to see the OGT.
   The openings in the pouch and remnant stomach were closed with a stapler, as it was thought to be a more secure and faster method than oversewing. However, if the pouch is too small to allow stapler closure, simple suture closure should be done.
   Conclusion: Inclusion of orogastric tube in the staple line should be a 'never event'. This case report highlights the importance of good communication between the surgical and anaesthesia teams, not only during the staple fire, but throughout the procedure.

AB  - Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease of the whole joint organ, characterized by the loss of cartilage, and structural changes in bone including the formation of osteophytes, causing disability and loss of function. It is also associated with systemic mediators and low-grade inflammation. Currently, there is negligible/no availability of specific biomarkers that can be used to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of OA. The most unmet clinical need is, however, related to the monitoring of disease progression over a short period that can be used in clinical trials. In this review, the value of biomarkers identified over the past decade has been highlighted. These biomarkers are associated with the synthesis and breakdown of cartilage, including collagenous and noncollagenous biomarkers, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory biomarkers, expressed in the biological fluid such as serum, synovial fluid, and urine. Broad validation of novel and clinically applicable biomarkers and their involvement in the pathways are particularly needed for early-stage diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and severity and examining new drugs to mitigate the effects of this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.

AB  - Cytosine methylation is a well-explored epigenetic modification mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) which are considered "methylation writers"; cytosine methylation is a reversible process. The process of removal of methyl groups from DNA remained unelucidated until the discovery of ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins which are now considered "methylation editors." TET proteins are a family of Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent 5-methyl cytosine dioxygenases-they convert 5-methyl cytosine to 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine, and to further oxidized derivatives. In humans, there are three TET paralogs with tissue-specific expression, namely TET1, TET2, and TET3. Among the TETs, TET2 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells where it plays a pleiotropic role. The paralogs also differ in their structure and DNA binding. TET2 lacks the CXXC domain which mediates DNA binding in the other paralogs; thus, TET2 requires interactions with other proteins containing DNA-binding domains for effectively binding to DNA to bring about the catalysis. In addition to its role as methylation editor of DNA, TET2 also serves as methylation editor of RNA. Thus, TET2 is involved in epigenetics as well as epitranscriptomics. TET2 mutations have been found in various malignant hematological disorders like acute myeloid leukemia, and non-malignant hematological disorders like myelodysplastic syndromes. Increasing evidence shows that TET2 plays an important role in the non-hematopoietic system as well. Hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma are some non-hematological malignancies in which a role of TET2 has been implicated. Loss of TET2 is also associated with atherosclerotic vascular lesions and endometriosis. The current review elaborates on the role of structure, catalysis, physiological functions, pathological alterations, and methods to study TET2, with specific emphasis on epigenomics and epitranscriptomics.

AB  - From 1985 to 2016, the prevalence of underweight decreased, and that of obesity and severe obesity increased, in most regions, with significant variation in the magnitude of these changes across regions. We investigated how much change in mean body mass index (BMI) explains changes in the prevalence of underweight, obesity, and severe obesity in different regions using data from 2896 population-based studies with 187 million participants. Changes in the prevalence of underweight and total obesity, and to a lesser extent severe obesity, are largely driven by shifts in the distribution of BMI, with smaller contributions from changes in the shape of the distribution. In East and Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the underweight tail of the BMI distribution was left behind as the distribution shifted. There is a need for policies that address all forms of malnutrition by making healthy foods accessible and affordable, while restricting unhealthy foods through fiscal and regulatory restrictions.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus, a causal agent of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. ACE2R methylation across three CpG sites (cg04013915, cg08559914, cg03536816) determines the host cell's entry. It regulates ACE2 expression by controlling the SIRT1 and KDM5B activity. Further, it regulates Type I and III IFN response by modulating H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone mark. SARS-CoV-2 protein with bromodomain and protein E mimics bromodomain histones and evades from host immune response. The 2 '-O MTases mimics the host's cap1 structure and plays a vital role in immune evasion through Hsp90-mediated epigenetic process to hijack the infected cells. Although the current review highlighted the critical epigenetic events associated with SARS-CoV-2 immune evasion, the detailed mechanism is yet to be elucidated.

T2  - PHYSICAL & OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY IN PEDIATRICS
KW  - Outcome
KW  - physical therapy
KW  - rehabilitation
KW  - surgery
KW  - type III craniopagus
AB  - Aims
   Describe the pre-operative and post-operative stages of physical therapy examination, rehabilitation interventions and outcomes in craniopagus conjoined twins (CCT).
   Methods
   27-months old total vertical types III CCT were admitted for surgical treatment. A structured rehabilitation program (functional mobility, balance training, sensory stimulation, communication, orthotic management, and caregiver education) was delivered post-operatively at different stages of surgery. The total duration of post-separation rehabilitation was 15 months for Twin A and 23 months for Twin B.
   Results
   Pre-operative WeeFIM was 67/126 for both the twins. Post-separation, Twin A improved to a state of complete independence in walking, step climbing, and hand function with a discharge WeeFIM score of 84/126. However, Twin B was completely dependent in bed mobility and transfer activities during discharge (WeeFIM-18/126). Minimal change in functional status was noted in Twin B (discharge FSS score-19/30). Both the twins were transferred to a regional hospital for long-term care. At 67 months of age, Twin B lost his life due to chest infection.
   Conclusions
   Vestibular based therapies, balance, and postural control may be prioritized in the rehabilitation process of CCT. Greater communication and coordination among physical, occupational therapists and other rehabilitation professionals are recommended for successful outcome in these unique cases.

AB  - Polymorphisms occurring in LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) region can profoundly impact pathogenicity, transmission and biology of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1). We investigated intra-clade polymorphisms, associated with HIV-1 clade-C infections that occur in India and Africa. Plasma samples were obtained from 24 HIV-infected ART-experienced individuals. Next Generation Sequencing was performed on Illumina Hi Seq X system. Sequence analysis was done using MEGA v7. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) were investigated to unveil signature sequences. Signature nucleotides in Indian sequences were observed at 19 positions, of which 7 nucleotide signatures occurred in transcription binding sites (TFBS), namely NF-AT-II, NFAT-III, USF, TCF- 1alpha, Sp1-I and TAR. Intra-clade C variations in HIV-1 LTR that inscribe signature nucleotides in Indian sequences lead to formation monophyletic cluster of Indian sequences. Moreover, occurrence of intra-clade signature nucleotides was observed at the key positions in the transcription factor binding sites in Indian and African clade-C sequences.

AB  - Complex perineal injuries pose a major diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to trauma surgeons. A retrospective review of the hospital records of 29 patients with complex perineal injury following blunt trauma was done. Demographic profile, management and outcomes were collected. Quality of life analysis was conducted for patients with complex perineal injuries who were discharged. The most predominant mode of injury was a road crash: being a pedestrian run over by a heavy motor vehicle. Pelvic fracture was seen in 20, anorectal involvement in 22 and urogenital injuries in 14. Urgent surgical debridement was done in all patients, faecal diversion in 27 and urinary diversion in 14. There were nine deaths, three from haemorrhage, and the remainder from sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction. Complex perineal injury remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients. There is a need to ensure adequate rehabilitation services for such patients.

AB  - Objective To describe an innovative interactive e-learning method to disseminate knowledge to larger group of participants over a wide geographical area.
   Methods The course material included standard training tool "Best Practices in Preterm Care," hosted on Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging platform. The participants were enrolled in the group created on Telegram by the facilitators and included in-service nurses from India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and UAE. They were mentored by 62 facilitators over 10 wk. Content of each module was loaded every week on two specific days. Mentors specified for that week facilitated learning through discussions. There was a live session every week to address any additional queries and to summarize the key messages of the week. Each week ended with weekly assessments through quiz.
   Results In this course, 4623 nursing professionals from India and Southeast Asian Region involved in providing neonatal care, participated. There were 9939 posts with an average of 126 posts per day. Majority of the participants felt that the topics were relevant (similar to 95%) and they were comfortable in asking questions and could clarify their doubts (similar to 90%). Majority rated their overall experience as very good to excellent (similar to 98%).
   Conclusions Interactive e-learning using the current approach if channelized optimally seems to be acceptable and feasible method to reach wide geographical area. This, however, needs local champions ready to mentor their own health professionals with context-specific guidance.

AB  - Purpose: To describe a novel technique of tectonic patch grafts for elliptical-shaped peripheral sterile keratolysis with iris prolapse.
   Methods: We performed a full thickness corneo-scleral patch graft in five eyes of five patients with elliptical-shaped peripheral sterile keratolysis with perforation and iris tissue prolapse. In this technique, four disposable trephines with predetermined diameter were employed to fashion both the host and the donor without any free-hand dissection. An intact anatomical integrity of the globe without the need for any repeat tectonic measures was considered as a successful outcome.
   Results: The mean age was 34.2 +/- 10.2 years (18-45). The mean total surgical time and donor preparation time was 94.4 +/- 7.12 min and 7.6 +/- 1.14 min, respectively. The intraoperative course was uneventful in all cases and all eyes had a well-maintained corneal integrity till 6 months follow up.
   Conclusion: We describe a simple, reproducible, and time-saving technique of performing elliptical shaped corneoscleral patch grafts for peripheral corneal perforations with iris prolapse.

AB  - Phage display antibody (PDA) libraries, allows the rapid isolation and characterization of high specificity monoclonal antibodies for therapeutic and diagnostic applications. However, selection of positive binding clones from synthetic and semi-synthetic libraries has an inherent bias towards clones containing randomly generated amber stop codons, complicating the identification of high affinity binding antibodies. We screened Tomlinson I and J library against receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV2, eight clones which showed positive binding in phage ELISA, contained one or more amber stop codons in their single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) gene sequences. The presence of amber stop codons within the antibody sequence causes the premature termination of soluble form of scFv expression in nonsuppressor Escherichia coli strain. In the present study, we have used a novel strategy that allows soluble expression of scFvs having amber stop codon in their gene sequences (without phage PIII protein fusion), in the suppressor strain. This strategy of introduction of Ochre (TAA) codon at the junction of scFv and PIII gene, speeds up the initial screening process which is critical for selecting the right scFvs for further studies. Present strategy leads to the identification of a scFv, B8 that binds specifically with nanomolar affinity toward SARS CoV 2 RBD, which otherwise lost in terms of traditional methodology.

AB  - Purpose Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma (ACC) is an aggressive malignant lacrimal gland tumour associated with poor prognosis. Aberrant Notch signalling has been investigated in various tumours. However, very few studies on Notch signalling in lacrimal gland ACC are reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the status of Notch1 receptor and activated Notch1 (NICD1) in lacrimal gland ACC and to correlate it with high-risk clinicopathological features.
   Methods A total of 23 cases of histopathologically proven lacrimal gland ACC, who underwent surgical treatment, were included in this study. Expression of Notch1 receptor and NICD1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissues. The results obtained were correlated with clinicopathological high-risk features and survival of the patients. Kaplan-Meier survival and multivariate analysis was performed to determine the prognostic significance.
   Results Overexpression of Notch1 receptor and NICD1 was observed in 65% and 39% of lacrimal gland ACC cases, respectively. On Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with Notch1 receptor overexpression had reduced disease free survival. On univariate analysis, male gender, bone erosion, perineural invasion, solid histologic pattern, intracranial extension and advanced tumour stage were also indicators of poor prognosis. On multivariate analysis bone erosion was the most significant poor prognostic indicator.
   Conclusion Our study demonstrates that overexpression of Notch1 receptor plays a critical role in the biology and aggressive behaviour of lacrimal gland ACC. Bone erosion, solid histologic pattern, advanced T stage, perineural invasion and intracranial extension are other high-risk clinicopathological predictors of lacrimal gland ACC.

AB  - Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a unique and distinctive subtype of gastric GIST. The literature on this subtype from developing countries is exceedingly sparse. Patients with SDH-deficient GIST often experience a lack or delay in genomic profiling, despite stereotypical clinicopathologic features, potentially resulting in sub-optimal management. SDH-deficient GISTs are highly syndromic, typically have more indolent behavior, a prognosis not predicted by size and mitotic rate, a tendency to lymph node metastases, and are insensitive to standard tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We report two women with SDH-deficient GIST. In the first case, SDH deficiency was identified late due to lack of awareness and poor access to diagnostic facilities. The patient progressed through TKI therapy, but responded to temozolomide, which is under investigation in clinical trials. In the second case, SDH deficiency was identified at diagnosis, and the patient responded well to (177)Lutetium peptide radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT) after progressing through two lines of TKIs. We aim to highlight the need for more awareness and access to genomic diagnostic facilities for GIST patients, temozolomide as a novel therapy for SDH-deficient GIST, and the potential value of DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET) and PRRT as a novel imaging modality and therapy for TKI insensitive GIST patients.

AB  - Background and aims As the understanding of food addiction increases, there is a need to explore the occurrence of this condition in different population groups. This exploratory study aimed to assess the occurrence of food addiction in a sample of respondents from India using a Hindi version of the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). Methods The Hindi language version of the scale was developed using the back-translation methodology. Subsequently, an online questionnaire-based study was conducted using convenience sampling which presented the Hindi version of YFAS. Results From 376 respondents (median age 19 years, 42.8% males), the rate of occurrence of food addiction was 13.3%. Persistent desire or repeated unsuccessful attempts to quit was the most common symptom domain endorsed. The weight (median 67 kg versus 60 kg) and BMI (median 25.89 kg/ m(2)versus 23.04 kg/ m(2)) were higher in the food addiction group as compared to the non-food addiction group. Conclusions Despite the limitations of potential selection bias, this exploratory study suggests that food addiction may be present in a proportion of young aged Indians. The association of food addiction with higher weight and BMI suggests propensity to develop metabolic syndrome, and the need to evaluate interventions that could modify phenomenological expression of food addiction.

AB  - Stroke has emerged as the second most common cause of mortality worldwide and is a major public health problem. It is a multi-factorial disease and genetics plays an important role in its pathophysiology, however, mechanisms of genome involvement in the disease remain unclear. Both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms could play a role in the development of stroke disease. Although epigenetic characteristics may also be heritable, they can be modified during the lifetime under different environmental exposure in response to lifestyle. Recent studies provide clear evidence that epigenetic factors play an important role in the pathological mechanisms leading to an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Epigenetic changes are reversible therefore; studying epigenetic factors may serve as a marker for disease progression, biomarker for disease diagnosis, and development of novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Identifying the factors which predispose the risk of stroke provides information for the mechanism of stroke and the design of new drug targets where epigenetic modifications play a significant role. Epigenetic modifications play an essential role in a large variety of multifactorial diseases. This review will focus on the evidence that epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.

AB  - Feasibility of portable neuroimaging of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) effects on the cerebral cortex has not been investigated vis-a-vis cerebellar lobular electric field strength. We studied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in conjunction with electroencephalography (EEG) to measure changes in the brain activation at the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) following ctDCS as well as virtual reality-based balance training (VBaT) before and after ctDCS treatment in 12 hemiparetic chronic stroke survivors. We performed general linear modeling (GLM) that putatively associated the lobular electric field strength with the changes in the fNIRS-EEG measures at the ipsilesional and contra-lesional PFC and SMC. Here, fNIRS-EEG measures were found in the latent space from canonical correlation analysis (CCA) between the changes in total hemoglobin (tHb) concentrations (0.01-0.07Hz and 0.07-0.13Hz bands) and log10-transformed EEG bandpower within 1-45 Hz where significant (Wilks' lambda>0.95) canonical correlations were found only for the 0.07-0.13-Hz band. Also, the first principal component (97.5% variance accounted for) of the mean lobular electric field strength was a good predictor of the latent variables of oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb) concentrations and log10-transformed EEG bandpower. GLM also provided insights into non-responders to ctDCS who also performed poorly in the VBaT due to ideomotor apraxia. Future studies should investigate fNIRS-EEG joint-imaging in a larger cohort to identify non-responders based on GLM fitting to the fNIRS-EEG data.

AB  - Introduction Spinal metastases are the most commonly encountered spinal tumors. With increasing life expectancy and better systemic treatment options, the incidence of patients seeking treatment for spinal metastasis is rising. Radical resections and conventional low-dose radiotherapy have given way to modern 'separation' surgeries and stereotactic body radiotherapy which entails lesser morbidity and improved local control. This article provides an overview of the decision making and currently available treatment options for metastatic spinal tumors. Methods A MEDLINE literature search was made for studies in English language reporting on human subjects, describing results of various treatment options that are a part of multidisciplinary management of metastatic spinal tumors. The highest-quality evidence available in the literature was reviewed. Discussion Treatment of patients with metastatic spinal tumors is largely palliative, with radiotherapy and selective surgery being the mainstays of management. Multidisciplinary management that incorporates factors like patient performance status, expected survival and systemic burden of disease and employs well-validated decision-making frameworks for guiding treatment holds the key to an effective palliative treatment strategy. Effective pain management, achieving local control, adequate neurological decompression in the setting of epidural cord compression and surgical stabilization for mechanical stabilization are the main goals of treatment Conclusion The management of metastatic spinal tumors has been rapidly evolving; currently, limited decompression and stabilization followed by postoperative SBRT for local tumor control are associated with less morbidity and may be referred to as the current standard of care in these patients.

AB  - Immersion rod is a very low-cost electrical device. It is based on simple working principle and widely used in developing nations to heat water for various domestic needs. However, the literature about electrocution caused by it is nearly absent. This is despite its usage being potentially hazardous, with almost sure fatal outcome in cases of mishandling. Data was gathered from 2011 to 2020, via inquest and autopsy reports, regarding electrocution deaths related to it. 6 cases were identified. All consisted of females in domestic settings, as the unique epidemiology in stark contrast to the existing literature on electrocution fatalities worldwide. Injury patterns in a few cases resembled those typical of high voltage electrocution, in these low voltage fatalities. Characteristics of joule burns showed sub-patterns, deviant from electrocution related to other appliances and was again unreported previously. Spark burns and scalds were patterns, quite diagnostic of immersion rod fatalities. A typical pattern for a multitude of injuries in each case is brevity of this study. Injury patterns are presented as a classical guide for further growth of the literature on these types of fatalities.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, and they are causing enormous socio-economic burden to the developed and developing countries. Allyl Methyl Sulfide (AMS) is a novel cardioprotective metabolite identified in the serum of rats after raw garlic administration. The present study explored the cardioprotective effect of AMS on thoracic aortic constriction (TAC)-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure model in rats.
   Methods: Thoracic aortic constriction (TAC) by titanium ligating clips resulted in the development of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure model. Four weeks prior to TAC and for 8 weeks after TAC, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were administered with AMS (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) or Enalapril (10 mg/kg/ day).
   Results: We have observed AMS (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) intervention significantly improved structural and functional parameters of the heart. mRNA expression of fetal genes i.e., atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), alpha skeletal actin (?-SA) and beta myosin heavy chain (?-MHC) were reduced in AMS treated TAC hearts along with decrease in perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. AMS attenuated lipid peroxidation and improved protein expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes i.e., catalase and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) along with electron transport chain (ETC) complex activity. AMS increased mitochondrial fusion proteins i.e., mitofusin 1 (MFN1), mitofusin 2 (MFN2) and optic atrophy protein (OPA1), and reduced fission protein i.e., dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1). Preliminary study suggests that AMS intervention upregulated genes involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics in normal rats. Further, in-vitro studies suggest that AMS reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in isoproterenol-treated cardiomyoblast.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that AMS protected cardiac remodelling, LV dysfunction and fibrosis in pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure model by improving endogenous antioxidants and mitochondrial function.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a common infectious pathology especially in low-income countries, which may complicate pregnancy. Although pulmonary TB is more common in pregnancy than extra pulmonary TB (EPTB), EPTB is becoming more common especially in those living with human deficiency virus (HIV) co infection or have other comorbidities. The diagnosis of TB may be delayed in pregnancy due to the masking of its symptoms by those of pregnancy. If diagnosed and treated on time both pulmonary TB and EPTB are associated with excellent maternal and perinatal outcome. If, however, there is delay in diagnosis and treatment then there could be adverse maternal and fetal consequences like preterm labour, fetal growth restriction and even stillbirths. Similarly severe forms of TB like disseminated disease (miliary TB) or multi drug resistant TB (MDR TB) are associated with poor outcome. Diagnosis and management is same as in non-pregnant patients. Both drug sensitive pulmonary TB and EPTB are treated with four drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) orally daily for 2 months followed by three drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin and ethambutol) orally daily for 4 months. Drug resistant TB is treated with second line drugs with caution, as some of these drugs are teratogenic. Optimum antenatal care and nutrition therapy along with anti-tuberculosis drugs provide for optimum maternal and perinatal outcome. This review discusses maternal and perinatal outcomes, diagnosis and management of pulmonary TB and extrapulmonary TB as well as perinatal tuberculosis. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: In our study, we focussed on three SNPs in the non-coding regions near FGFR2 gene, as studies on non coding variants in the genome are the novel trends to identify the susceptible loci for nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P). FGFR2 gene is selected as a candidate gene based on knock out animal models and the role played in syndromic forms of clefting. FGFR2 gene also plays an important role in FGF signaling pathway during craniofacial development.
   Methods: In the present study 148 case-parent triads were assessed for three SNPs rs10749408, rs11199874 and rs10788165 near FGFR2 gene by using TaqMan allelic discrimination method. Transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) was used to find the allelic association. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers was analysed using Haploview program 4.2. Haplotype transmission effects were estimated using FAMHAP package. The possible parent-of-origin effects were assessed by likelihood based approach.
   Results: TDT analysis of three SNPs failed to show significant transmission disortion from heterozygous parents to the affected child and are not associated with NSCL/P. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed strong LD between rs11199874 and rs10788165 SNPs. In the haplotype TDT analysis, GG haplotype of rs11199874rs10788165 showed significant undertransmission to affected child. No significant parent-of-origin effects were observed. Conclusion: The present study on noncoding variants near FGFR2 gene is not associated with NSCL/P. As the numbers of triads included in the study are less, further studies are needed including large sample size to find association with NSCL/P.

AB  - Glucocorticoid (GC), such as prednisolone, is an essential component of multidrug chemotherapy regimen for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Resistance to GC in leukemia cells is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. Despite the extensive use of GC for many years, molecular mechanisms underlying its resistance in ALL have not been fully uncovered. Recent studies have shown a potential role of EMP1, CASP1, and NLRP3 genes in prednisolone response. In this study on 148 pediatric B-ALL patients, we studied these three genes to assess their association with prednisolone response measured by day 8 blast count after 7 days of induction therapy with prednisolone. Intriguingly, ALL samples exhibited higher expression of EMP1 along with a low expression of CASP1 and NLRP3 compared to disease free normal bone marrow collected from patients with solid tumors. Among the three analyzed genes, only EMP1 was found to be overexpressed in prednisolone poor responders (p=0.015). Further, a comparison of gene expression between cytogenetic subtypes revealed higher expression of EMP1 in BCR-ABL subtype. Expression of EMP1 in multiple gene expression datasets was used for gene set enrichment analysis, which revealed TNF-alpha, IL-2-STAT5 signaling, inflammatory responses and hypoxia as the major positively associated pathways and E2F targets as negatively associated pathways. Interestingly, the clinical remission rate was higher in CASP1 high patients (p=0.048). In univariate survival analysis, higher EMP1 expression was associated with poor prognostic measures while higher expression of NLRP3 and CASP1 was associated with better prognostic measures in our data. Further, multivariate analysis revealed an independent association of high CASP1 and NLRP3 with a better prognosis. This study strengthens the available evidence that mRNA expression of EMP1, CASP1, and NLRP3 may serve as potential biomarkers for risk stratification of pediatric B-ALL patients.

AB  - Amid bone grinding, a part of the hard tissue (i.e. bone) is usually removed to gain clearer operative excess to the tumours present beneath the bone. The tool wear and tool loading influence the thermal as well as mechanical conditions of surgery. The rise in temperature during osteotomy may cause severe consequence like thermogenesis and damage to optic nerves, cervical, and sciatic nerves. Therefore, the present study has been carried out to investigate the burr wear with different shaped grinding burrs. The burr wear is characterized in terms of burr loading, dislodging and fracture in abrasives. The burr loading is further quantified on the amount of bone adhered over the surface of the burr. The results of surface characterization revealed that minimum wear occurred in case of convex shape burr whereas cylindrical burr caused the highest wear in terms of abrasive fragmentation, dislodging, and wear flats. The minimum percentage of weight reduction observed with the convex burr i.e., 1.68% including 0.4196 g weight of dislodged abrasive (W-ab) and corresponding burr loading is observed as 0.1464 g. The maximum burr loading was seen in the case of the spherical burr (Wb) i.e. 0.5907 g. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Literature shows fentanyl reduces the median effective concentration (EC50) of propofol when used for various noxious stimuli. However, fentanyl combined with propofol has a depressive effect on haemodynamics. We hypothesise that low dose dexmedetomidine will reduce the propofol requirement for induction with better haemodynamic profile compared with fentanyl.
   Material and methods: 120 ASA I/II adult patients, of age group 20 to 60 years, scheduled for elective day-care surgeries under general anaesthesia were randomised to three equally distributed groups as group D, group F and group S (control) of 40 patients each. They received infusions of dexmedetomidine 0.5 mcg/kg, fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg and normal saline (control) respectively over 5 min prior to induction with propofol TCI (Marsh model). EC50 of propofol (primary objective) for I-gel insertion in each group was determined from the estimated effect site concentration (Ce), using Dixon's up-and-down method. Secondary objectives were propofol dose requirement and percentage change in haemodynamics during induction.
   Results: Our study demonstrates that low-dose dexmedetomidine premedication achieves more reduction in the EC50 (2.4 mu g/ml, IQR 2.4 - 2.6 mu g/ml, 95% CI 2.40 - 2.55 mu g/ml) and dose of propofol (1.14 +/- 0.28 mg/kg, 95% CI 1.05 - 1.23 mg/kg), for I-gel insertion, than that can be achieved by the use of fentanyl with propofol (EC50 of 3.0 mu g/ml IQR 3.0 - 3.05 mu g/ml, 95% CI 2.94 - 3.11 mu g/ml; propofol dose 1.89 +/- 0.55 mg/kg, 95% CI 1.72 - 2.07 mg/kg) without any significant change in the haemodynamics.
   Conclusion: Low-dose dexmedetomidine when compared with fentanyl significantly reduce the EC50 and dose of propofol required for I-gel insertion with propofol TCI, without much change in the haemodynamic profile.

AB  - India has made significant improvement in childhood cancer services in last few decades. However, the outcome still remains modest as compared to global standards due to significant barriers in recognition, diagnosis and cure.
   Data regarding comprehensive childhood cancer burden in country is lacking due to low and urban pre-dominant coverage of population-based cancer registry programs. The available data shows lower incidence of childhood cancer incidence especially in leukaemia and CNS tumours which may suggest poor awareness of caregivers and delayed diagnosis with many "missed cases". Incidence data are also skewed towards male pre-ponderance which suggests gender bias in seeking healthcare.
   The childhood cancer services in India are predominantly restricted to few tertiary care centres in major cities. The outcome in major groups of cancer is complicated by delayed and more advanced stage of presentation and poor supportive care during intensive treatment. Treatment refusal and abandonment remains major hurdles.
   Last few decades saw development of dedicated paediatric oncology services and training programs in the country. The development of InPOG (Indian Paediatric Oncology group) for conducting collaborative trials will lead to adoption of uniform treatment protocols suited for the country. Financial support through the govern-ment promoted health insurance and holistic support through philanthropic organizations have improved treatment adherence and outcome.
   Moving forward, the focus should be on strengthening the cancer registries for capturing nationwide data, improving awareness of childhood cancer among caregivers and healthcare workers for early recognition and improving accessibility of childhood cancer care services beyond major cities.

AB  - Lung cancer is generally diagnosed at advanced stages when surgical resection is not possible. Late diagnosis, along with development of chemoresistance, results in high mortality. Preventive approaches, including smoking cessation, chemoprevention and early detection are needed to improve survival. Smoking cessation combined with low-dose computed tomography screening has modestly improved survival. Chemoprevention has also shown some promise. Despite these successes, most lung cancer cases remain undetected until advanced stages. Additional early detection strategies may further improve survival and treatment outcome. Molecular alterations taking place during lung carcinogenesis have the potential to be used in early detection via noninvasive methods and may also serve as biomarkers for success of chemopreventive approaches. This review focuses on the utilization of molecular biomarkers to increase the efficacy of various preventive approaches.

KW  - Diabetic neuropathy
AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the most widely spread metabolic disorder also called as "life style" disease. Due to the alarming number of patients, there is great need to therapies targeting functions which can help in maintaining the homeostasis of glucose levels and improving insulin sensitivity. Detailed analysis was done through various research and review papers which was searched using MEDLINE, BIOSIS, and EMBASE using various keywords. This search retrieved the most appropriate content on these molecules targeting UPP pathway. From this extensive review involving UPP pathway, it was concluded that the role of ubiquitin's is not only limited to neurodegenerative disorders but also plays a critical role in progression of diabetes including obesity, insulin resistance, and various neurogenerative disorders but it also targets proteasomal degradation including mediation of cellular signaling pathways. Thus, drugs targeting UPP not only may show effect against diabetes but also are therapeutically beneficial in the treatment of diabetes-associated complications which may be obtained. Thus, based on the available information and data on UPP functions, it can be concluded that regulation of UPP pathway via downstream regulators mainly E1, E2, and E3 may bring promising results. Drugs targeting these transcriptional factors may emerge as a novel therapy in the treatment of diabetes and diabetes-associated complications.

Main outcome measure-ments were demographic profile, clinical features, visual acuity, corneal topography, aberrometry, and biomechan-ical and confocal microscopy findings. center dot RESULTS: A total of 116 eyes of 62 consecutive pa-tients were recruited with a mean +/- age of 14.7 +/- 2.77 years (range: 8-18 years); 46 of 62 (88%) were males; 57 of 62 cases (92%) had bilateral disease; 53 of 116 eyes (46%) had progressive KC; and 9 of 116 eyes (8%) had acute hydrops. Systemic associations were found in 6 of 62 patients (9.7%) and ocular associations in 77 of 116 eyes (66.3%); 68 of 116 eyes (58.6%) had associated vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC). Among eyes with VKC, 29 of 68 eyes (46%) were in stage IV KC, versus 25% of eyes with no VKC (P = .004). The mean +/- SD refractive spherical equivalent was-4.72 +/- 3.32 diopters (D), and refractive astigmatism was 3.69 +/- 3.09 D. The mean values of maximum keratometry, thinnest pachymetry, and corneal higher-order aberra-tions were 60.89 +/- 10.9 D, 396.05 +/- 95.03 mm, and 1.18 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively. Values of corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor correlated with the stage of KC (r =-0.26; P = .007). center dot CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric KC was commonly associated with VKC in this cohort. Eyes with VKC had more severe KC than those without VKC. Nearly half of the patients presented with progressive disease. Corneal biomechan-ical changes correlated well with stage of KC in this pedi-atric age group. (Am J Ophthalmol 2021;225:69-75. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

AB  - Background: Around 1 in 7 people in India are impacted by mental illness. The treatment gap for people with mental disorders is as high as 75-95%. Health care systems, especially in rural regions in India, face substantial challenges to address these gaps in care, and innovative strategies are needed.
   Methods: We hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign and a mobile-technology-based electronic decision support system will result in reduced stigma and improved mental health for adults at high risk of common mental disorders. It will be implemented as a parallel-group cluster randomised, controlled trial in 44 primary health centre clusters servicing 133 villages in rural Andhra Pradesh and Haryana. Adults aged >= 18 years will be screened for depression, anxiety and suicide based on Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorders (GAD-7) scores. Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with elevated PHQ-9, GAD-7 or suicide risk and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of people not at elevated risk based on these scores. Outcome analyses will be conducted blinded to intervention allocation.
   Expected outcomes: The primary study outcome is the difference in mean behaviour scores at 12 months in the combined 'high-risk' and 'non-high-risk' cohort and the mean difference in PHQ-9 scores at 12 months in the 'high-risk' cohort. Secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety remission rates in the high-risk cohort at 6 and 12 months, the proportion of high-risk individuals who have visited a doctor at least once in the previous 12 months, and change from baseline in mean stigma, mental health knowledge and attitude scores in the combined non-high-risk and high-risk cohort. Trial outcomes will be accompanied by detailed economic and process evaluations.
   Significance: The findings are likely to inform policy on a low-cost scalable solution to destigmatise common mental disorders and reduce the treatment gap for under-served populations in low-and middle-income country settings.

TI  - A living WHO guideline on drugs to prevent covid-19
T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - CLINICAL QUESTION
   What is the role of drugs in preventing covid-19?
   WHY DOES THIS MATTER?
   There is widespread interest in whether drug interventions can be used for the prevention of covid-19, but there is uncertainty about which drugs, if any, are effective. The first version of this living guideline focuses on the evidence for hydroxychloroquine. Subsequent updates will cover other drugs being investigated for their role in the prevention of covid-19.
   RECOMMENDATION
   The guideline development panel made a strong recommendation against the use of hydroxychloroquine for individuals who do not have covid-19 (high certainty).
   HOW THIS GUIDELINE WAS CREATED
   This living guideline is from the World Health Organization (WHO) and provides up to date covid-19 guidance to inform policy and practice worldwide. Magic Evidence Ecosystem Foundation (MAGIC) provided methodological support. A living systematic review with network analysis informed the recommendations. An international guideline development panel of content experts, clinicians, patients, an ethicist and methodologists produced recommendations following standards for trustworthy guideline development using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   UNDERSTANDING THE NEW RECOMMENDATION
   The linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (6 trials and 6059 participants) found that hydroxychloroquine had a small or no effect on mortality and admission to hospital (high certainty evidence). There was a small or no effect on laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (moderate certainty evidence) but probably increased adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty evidence). The panel judged that almost all people would not consider this drug worthwhile. In addition, the panel decided that contextual factors such as resources, feasibility, acceptability, and equity for countries and healthcare systems were unlikely to alter the recommendation. The panel considers that this drug is no longer a research priority and that resources should rather be oriented to evaluate other more promising drugs to prevent covid-19.
   UPDATES
   This is a living guideline. New recommendations will be published in this article and signposted by update notices to this guideline.
   READERS NOTE
   This is the first version of the living guideline for drugs to prevent covid-19. It complements the WHO living guideline on drugs to treat covid-19. When citing this article, please consider adding the update number and date of access for clarity.
   Drugs could be used as prophylaxis to prevent covid-19 developing in those who are free from disease. Such drugs complement vaccines that, through developing immune responses to SARS-Cov-2, reduce the risk of developing covid-19 and its consequences. Drugs to prevent covid-19 could target whole populations, those at higher risk of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 (due to their work, social circumstances, or a particular exposure), or those at higher risk of death and poor outcomes if infected. There are 2610 trials investigating various drug interventions for covid-19 (see section on emerging evidence).1 This rapidly evolving evidence landscape requires trustworthy interpretation and expeditious clinical practice guidelines to inform clinicians, patients, governments, ministries and health administrators.
   This living guideline uses emerging evidence from RCTs on drugs to prevent covid-19 and complements the livingWHOguideline on drugs to treat covid-19.(2) The living network meta-analysis associated with this guideline will incorporate new trial data and allow for analysis of comparative effectiveness.3 Details of the network meta-analysis and other related publications are listed in box 1. We will also use additional relevant evidence on long term safety, prognosis, and patient values and preferences related to covid-19 treatments to inform the living guidance.

TI  - National noncommunicable disease monitoring survey (NNMS) in India: Estimating risk factor prevalence in adult population
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - ICMR-INDIAB
KW  - HYPERTENSION
AB  - Background
   The primary objective of National NCD monitoring survey (NNMS) was to generate national-level estimates of key NCD indicators identified in the national NCD monitoring framework. This paper describes survey study protocol and prevalence of risk factors among adults (18-69 years).
   Materials and methods
   NNMS was a national level cross-sectional survey conducted during 2017-18. The estimated sample size was 12,000 households from 600 primary sampling units. One adult (18-69 years) per household was selected using the World Health Organization-KISH grid. The study tools were adapted from WHO-STEPwise approach to NCD risk factor surveillance, IDSP-NCD risk factor survey and WHO-Global adult tobacco survey. Total of 8/10 indicators of adult NCD risk factors according to national NCD disease monitoring framework was studied. This survey for the first time estimated dietary intake of salt intake of population at a national level from spot urine samples.
   Results
   Total of 11139 households and 10659 adults completed the survey. Prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use was 32.8% (95% CI: 30.8-35.0) and 15.9% (95% CI: 14.2-17.7) respectively. More than one-third adults were physically inactive [41.3% (95% CI: 39.4-43.3)], majority [98.4% (95% CI: 97.8-98.8)] consumed less than 5 servings of fruits and / or vegetables per day and mean salt intake was 8 g/day (95% CI: 7.8-8.2). Proportion with raised blood pressure and raised blood glucose were 28.5% (95% CI: 27.0-30.1) and 9.3% (95% CI: 8.3-10.5) respectively. 12.8% (95% CI: 11.2-14.5) of adults (40-69 years) had ten-year CVD risk of >= 30% or with existing CVD.
   Conclusion
   NNMS was the first comprehensive national survey providing relevant data to assess India's progress towards targets in National NCD monitoring framework and NCD Action Plan. Established methodology and findings from survey would contribute to plan future state-based surveys and also frame policies for prevention and control of NCDs.

AB  - Introduction The classical effects of exogenous opioids, such as morphine, are predominantly mediated through mu-opioid receptors. The chronic use of morphine induces anxiety-like behavior causing functional changes in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The mixed mu/kappa-agonist, nalbuphine, used either as an analgesic or as an adjuvant with morphine, produces different and opposite effects. However, whether nalbuphine can be used to antagonize morphine-induced anxiety and dopaminergic alterations is not fully known. Objective This study aimed to compare acute and chronic effects of nalbuphine on morphine-induced anxiety and dopaminergic alterations in rats. Methods Male adult Wistar albino rats were made opioid-dependent by administering increasing doses of morphine (5-25 mg/kg; i.p.; b.i.d.). Withdrawal was induced by naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.), 4 h after the last morphine injection. Anxiety-like behavior was measured using Activity Monitor (Coulbourn Instruments, Inc. USA). Thereafter, the animals were sacrificed and the brain dissected out and the level of cAMP and the transcriptional and translational expression of TH was measured. Nalbuphine was co-administered with morphine, acutely and chronically, at various doses (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.). Results Morphine-dependent rats showed a significant higher anxiety and cAMP levels and a significant decrease in the expression of TH. Co-administration of chronic doses of nalbuphine attenuates the higher anxiety, cAMP levels, and upregulates the TH expressions; however, the acute nalbuphine treatment does not attenuate the morphine-induced side effects. Conclusion Therefore, nalbuphine might have an important role in attenuating the anxiety and the effects of the dopaminergic pathway and may have potential in the treatment of opioid addiction.

AB  - Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected millions of people worldwide with far-reaching socio-economic implications in society. The adoption of preventive practices by the public remains the mainstay in reducing the spread of COVID-19 but there is a dearth of validated tools to assess such infection prevention practices related to pandemics. This study was conducted to develop and validate a questionnaire for the assessment of preventive practices against COVID-19 in the general population. It was done following a standardized protocol involving questionnaire development through literature review, focused group discussions, indepth interviews, expert opinion, and pre-testing. This was followed by the validation of the questionnaire through a cross-sectional survey on 108 individuals from diverse backgrounds in New Delhi, India in July 2020. Exploratory factor analysis was used to evaluate construct validity. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The developed questionnaire for assessing preventive practices consists of two sections: the first section of 18 items to evaluate preventive practices and the second section of 19 items for assessing various reasons for deficiencies in the preventive practices. The first section has good content validity (CVR = 0.81 and S-CVI/Av = 0.97) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient 0.82). Thus, this questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for the comprehensive assessment of preventive practices and barriers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be useful in assessing the preparedness of the public and will be helpful to policymakers in designing appropriate interventions for protection against COVID-19.

TI  - Scleral tunnel with conjunctival autograft for rescue management of extruded haptic: Surgical technique and review of literature

KW  - Conjunctival autograft

AB  - Extrusion of haptic is a rare complication after intra-scleral haptic fixation of intraocular lens (SF-IOL). Various techniques described for its management such as autologous scleral patch, cauterization of exposed haptic, reattempting the glued IOL and IOL explant have their own limitations. Presently, we describe a simple rescue technique for management of such situations. In this method, after performing localized conjunctival peritomy, 2 mm long partial-thickness scleral tunnel is fashioned with an angled 20-guage microvitreoretinal blade 1.5 mm away from the limbus in line with pre-existing defective scleral flap underneath which the exposed haptic is tucked securely. Following this, conjunctival autograft (CAG) with fibrin glue application is undertaken to combat conjunctival fibrosis. In three patients, where this technique was performed, had well-tucked haptic and maintained visual acuity with no complications at 3-months follow-up. This technique is a useful method of tucking extruded haptic after SFIOL in eyes subjected to multiple previous surgeries.

TI  - <i>Corynebacterium striatum</i>: An emerging nosocomial skin and soft-tissue pathogen
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - The genus Corynebacterium is composed of Gram-positive, aerobic, non-motile, non-spore-forming bacilli that are widely distributed throughout the environment. They are usually found as commensals on the skin and are often considered as mere contaminants when isolated from clinical samples. We describe a patient with skin and soft-tissue infections due to Corynebacterium striatum following exploratory laparotomy identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The clinical importance and pathogenic potential of Corynebacterium species, especially C. striatum, cannot be underestimated. This report is a reminder to physicians of the possible pathogenicity of non-diphtherial Corynebacteria.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing is high in children with Down syndrome. Although the association between sleep-disordered breathing and developmental delay and behavioral abnormalities are proven among typically developing children, there are few such studies of children with Down syndrome. This study assesses the relationship between the severity of sleep apnea and development and behavioral abnormalities in individuals with Down syndrome.
   Methods: In a cross-sectional prospective study, 53 children with Down syndrome were assessed for sleep-disordered breathing by overnight polysomnography. Behavior was assessed using Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and developmental quotient (DQ) using Developmental Profile 3. The association between various domains of behavior and development with the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) was assessed using Spearman rank correlation. Multiple linear regression assessed the independent effects of various factors on development and behavior.
   Results: Of 53 subjects (three to 11.8 years), 51 (96%) were found to have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In both three to five year and six to 12 year age groups, there was a statistically significant positive correlation between the CBCL scores and the AHI (rho = 0.77 and 0.83, respectively). There was a statistically significant negative correlation between the DQ and the AHI (rho = -0.62). In multiple linear regression, AHI was the only independent variable that was associated with CBCL and DQ.
   Conclusions: This study provides robust evidence that OSA can negatively influence the development and behavior in children with Down syndrome as in typically developing children. Moreover, with increasing severity of OSA, children with Down syndrome have more behavioral abnormalities, especially attention deficit and hyperactivity, and also have poorer development scores.

T2  - CLINICA CHIMICA ACTA
KW  - Lumican
KW  - Cancer

KW  - Migration
KW  - Clinical outcome
AB  - The extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of a myriad of structural and signaling molecules which potentially regulate cell function and homeostasis. Lumican, a class II SLRP (small leucine rich proteoglycan) is a ubiquitous ECM component which not only organizes the collagen based structural matrix, but also modulates cell proliferation signals as observed in cancer. In the perspective of cancer biology, lumican expression in the tumor microenvimnment is associated with signaling, which can result in either pro-tumorigenic or anti-tumorigenic effects. Its pro-tumorigenic effects are mainly observed in gastric, bladder and liver cancers, which is associated with deterioration of clinical prognosis. Lumican mediated pro-tumorigenic effects involve activation of focal adhesion kinases (FAK), mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) and metallopmteinase-9 (MMP-9). On the contrary, in breast cancer, pancreatic cancer and melanoma, lumican demonstrates anti-tumorigenic effects, which are associated with favorable clinical outcomes. Anti-tumorigenic potential of lumican is clubbed with epithelial-mesenchymal transition reprogramming as well as downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), FAK and MMP-14 mediated pathways thereby preventing tumorigenesis. This review highlights that the expressional significance of lumican in cancer biogenesis is tumor specific and demands rigorous cancerspecific evaluation to understand its role as a potential anti-cancer target or a therapeutic molecule.

AB  - Persistent pupillary membrane (PPM) is a common congenital anomaly of the eye, representing the remnants of tunica vasculosa lentis. It is often detected as an incidental finding upon examination. The presentation may vary from being an insignificant strand of iris to a hyperplastic dense membrane, with or without adhesions to the surrounding structures, which notably obscures the visual axis. When present as an isolated pathology, these patients are often asymptomatic. However, some patients with isolated PPM do present with poor visual acuity or subnormal quality of vision. The severity of their disability does not always correlate to the extent of the anomaly present in the eye. The rationale as to why only some patients with significant PPM experience this visual handicap while others don?t is one of the baffling conundrums in ophthalmology at present. Hence, we attempt to elaborate on the possible mechanisms that explain the unpredictable and variable clinical manifestation of persistent pupillary membranes.

AB  - Background: Migraine is a common form of primary neurologic headache. Many patients are chronic migraineurs and suffer from a significant disability and adverse effects of drugs. There are various surgical options available to treat migraines, including peripheral neurectomies.
   Objective: To study the surgical and functional outcomes of migraine surgeries using peripheral neurectomies and compare them with conservatively treated patients.
   Materials and Methods: Migraine patients who had a unilateral onset pain were given local bupivacaine block at the suspected trigger site, and those who were relieved were given the option for surgery. In the operative group, the peripheral nerve of the trigger site was lysed under local anesthesia. The conservative group was continued with the standard treatment. Evaluations with a baseline and 6 months visual analog score (VAS), migraine headache index (MHI), migraine disability assessment test (MIDAS), and pain self-efficacy questionnaire (PSEQ) scores were done.
   Results: A total of 26 patients got benefitted with the local bupivacaine block, out of which 13 underwent surgery. At baseline, the VAS, MHI, MIDAS, and PSEQ scores were similar in both the groups. The operative group had significant (P < 0.001) improvement in all these parameters 6 months after the surgery. All patients of the operative group got free from prophylactic migraine treatment; however, 11 out of 13 patients still needed occasional use of analgesics. There was one complication of transient temporal numbness.
   Conclusion: Migraine surgery using peripheral neurectomies was more effective than chronic drug treatment in appropriately selected patients.

KW  - PATTERN
AB  - Background. There is lack of comprehensive data on substance use and associated factors among school students in Delhi, India.
   Methods. We used a cluster sampling method based on sections of classes in schools to conduct this study in two government-run schools in Delhi. All enrolled students from 8th, 9th and 11th grades participated (n=405). The WHO Student Drug Use questionnaire was administered in a single session for a class section for assessing substance use.
   Results. The participation rate was 90.6%. The rates of past 12 months' use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and inhalants were 22%, 12.1%, 12.1% and 8.6%, respectively, while rates for 'sedatives and tranquillizers' were 4.9%, opium 2.7% and other opioids 1.2%. Lifetime use of heroin was reported by two students and use in the past 12 months by one student. Multiple substance use was high. Higher age was associated with the use of alcohol and cannabis. According to logistic regression model results, use by a family member significantly increased the probability of using tobacco (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 11.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4-37.8) and alcohol (AOR 3.75; 95% CI 5.1-1059.3). Similarly, use by peers significantly increased the probability of tobacco (AOR 7.7; 95% CI 2.0-29.8) and cannabis use (AOR 5.7; 95% CI 1.5-21.5). Having poor harm perception significantly increased the chances of inhalant use by students (AOR 5.5; 95% CI 1.5-20.1).
   Conclusion. The study results bring to attention the prevalent and important problem of substance use among schoolchildren. We recommend that (i) intervention strategies for school settings are important and need to factor in the use of illicit substances (cannabis); (ii) psychosocial intervention by trained school counsellors in school settings is the mainstay for intervention for cannabis and inhalants; and (iii) heroin users should be referred to healthcare facilities for detoxification.

AB  - The study was undertaken to differentiate antemortem electrical (AME) and postmortem electrical (PME) burn marks with the help of histopathology. The electrical burn mark was produced on 25 dead bodies. Alongside 25 cases of electrocution deaths were included for comparison. Slides were prepared and stained with hematoxylin-eosin stains. Intraepidermal and subepidermal separation; coagulative necrosis of the epidermis; nuclear elongation and hyperchromasia of epidermal cells; homogenization of the dermis; nuclear elongation and hyperchromasia of hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and blood vessel endothelium were studied for histopathological changes and graded. The findings of the study suggest that the histopathological changes in electrical burn marks are due to the physical effect of heat produced by the electric current. The classical histopathological features of electrical burn mark cannot differentiate between AME and PME burn marks. However, careful evaluation of grading of the dermal changes can be helpful in differentiating AME and PME burn marks. Highest grade of dermal thickness homogenization and highest grade of nuclear elongation of dermal appendages were significantly more in the antemortem electrical burn marks than PME burn marks.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE
   The significance of the study is that, although conventional culture remains the criterion standard for identifying the causative fungal pathogens, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may serve as a powerful and high-throughput tool for the early and definitive diagnosis of high-risk patients with mycotic keratitis owing to high sensitivity and specificity. PURPOSE
   This study was focused on comparing the results of PCR with traditional microbial studies for the detection and identification of fungal pathogens in patients with clinically suspected fungal keratitis. METHODS
   Corneal scrapings were collected from 59 patients with clinically suspected fungal keratitis for routine culture, staining, and seminested PCR assay for fungal pathogen identification. The results of PCR were compared with a conventional microbial workup (smear and culture). The samples that were unidentified by culture but were amplified by PCR were further identified by nucleotide sequencing. RESULTS
   Of the 59 patients with suspected fungal keratitis, 38 (64.40%) were found to be positive by PCR assay, 24 (40.67%) by culture, 18 (20.3%) by potassium hydroxide wet mount, and 8 (13.5%) by Gram stains for fungal pathogens. All the 24 isolates found positive with culture were also positive with PCR, so they had not been sequenced for molecular identification. The remaining 14 isolates that were positive with PCR but negative with culture were further identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides, Simplicillium species, Fusarium solani, Alternaria tenuissima, Chaetomium globosum, Penicillium citrinum, and Rhizopus microsporus by sequencing up to the species level. CONCLUSIONS
   The PCR was able to detect the presence of fungal pathogens in a high proportion of culture-negative cases. This study suggests that PCR may serve as a rapid, important complement to traditional culture with high-throughput means of fungal pathogen identification in patients with clinically suspected fungal keratitis.

AB  - Introduction: Vertebral artery (VA) may run an anomalous course in congenital craniovertebral junction anomalies. Anomalous VA, though rare, is challenging to handle. An anomalous VA can get injured during exposure of craniovertebral junction, even in the experienced hands. Objective: The objective of this article was to describe the technique of repairing the VA in case of its damage during exposure in the craniovertebral junction (atlantoaxial dislocation [AAD] with basilar invagination [BI]). Procedure: The authors describe a case of VA artery injury in a case of severe BI & AAD, which was anomalous and coursing over the joints. Following the repair of injured VA, we proceeded with the surgery (distraction, compression, extension, and reduction [DCER]). Conclusion: To avoid injury, it is important to always perform a CT 3-D angiogram, perform meticulous dissection under the microscope while exposing the joints, use variable impedance bipolar to control venous bleeding and always expose the side with non-dominant VA first.

AB  - Phlogacanthus thyrsiflorus Nees is a medicinal herb commonly used in traditional folk medicine, and it is known to possess anticancer activity. Here, we explored the anticancer properties of methanolic extract of P. thyrsiflorus leaves in HeLa and MCF-7 cell lines. We observed nuclear fragmentation as indication of apoptosis in the MPT treated cancer cells using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as well as fluorescent dye. DNA from the treated cells showed characteristic laddering of DNA fragments in agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell populations undergoing secondary necrosis following apoptosis could also be detected in FACS by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Activated caspase-3 in the treated HeLa cells was detected by polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody utilizing immunocytochemistry. Using transmission electron microscopy, sub-cellular changes like rough endoplasmic reticulum, swollen mitochondria, distorted mitochondrial membrane, loss of cristae and matrix were observed in the treated HeLa cells. Extensive plasma membrane blebbing was also observed by scanning electron microscopy. Our findings support that Phlogacanthus thyrsiflorus leaves are natural source of potent anticancer agent.

AB  - The Nuclear Medicine Global Initiative was formed in 2012 by 13 international organizations to promote human health by advancing the field of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging by supporting the practice and application of nuclear medicine. The first project focused on standardization of administered activities in pediatric nuclear medicine and resulted in 2 articles. For its second project the Nuclear Medicine Global Initiative chose to explore issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals around the world. Methods: Information was obtained by survey responses from 35 countries on available radioisotopes, radiopharmaceuticals, and kits for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Issues impacting on access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals in individual countries were also identified. Results: Detailed information on radiopharmaceuticals used in each country, and sources of supply, was evaluated. Responses highlighted problems in access, particularly due to the reliance on a sole provider, regulatory issues, and reimbursement, as well as issues of facilities and workforce, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusion: Strategies to address access and availability of radiopharmaceuticals are outlined, to enable timely and equitable patient access to nuclear medicine procedures worldwide. In the face of disruptions to global supply chains by the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, renewed focus on ensuring a reliable supply of radiopharmaceuticals is a major priority for nuclear medicine practice globally.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of mindfulness meditation (MM) on intraocular pressure (IOP) and trabecular meshwork (TM) gene expression in patients with medically uncontrolled primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).
   DESIGN: Parallel arm, single-masked, randomized controlled trial.
   METHODS: Sixty POAG patients with IOP >= 21 mm Hg taking maximal topical medication and scheduled for trabeculectomy were included in this study at a tertiary eye care center in India. Thirty patients (Group 1) underwent 3 weeks of 45-minute daily MM sessions in addition to medical therapy while Group 2 continued medical therapy only. Primary outcome was change in IOP (AIOP) after 3 weeks of MM. Secondary outcomes were probability of success, percentage of reduction in IOP, effect on diurnal variations of IOP, changes in quality of life (QoL), and changes in gene expression patterns in TM.
   RESULTS: At 3 weeks, a significant decrease in IOP was seen in Group 1 (20.16 +/- 3.3 to 15.05 +/- 2.4mm Hg; P = .001), compared to Group 2 (21.2 +/- 5.6 to 20.0 +/- 5.8mm Hg; P = .38). AIOP was significantly higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (5.0 +/- 1.80 vs. 0.20 +/- 3.03mm Hg; P = .001). Analysis of gene expression revealed significant upregulation of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS1 and NOS3) and neuroprotective genes with downregulation of proinflammatory genes in Group 1 in comparison to Group 2 (P = .001).
   CONCLUSIONS: MM was associated with significant decrease in IOP and changes in TM gene expression, indicating its direct impact on ocular tissues. (Am J Ophthalmol 2021;223:308-321. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

AB  - Background: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is the most common procedure used in the management of hydrocephalus regardless of the etiology. The standard free-hand technique is used for the placement of VPS in patients with enlarged ventricles. In patients with very small ventricles, CSF access through ventriculostomy becomes challenging and free-hand technique may be associated with high failure rates. In these situations, stereotactic-guided VPS becomes very useful. Objective: To validate and describe the technique of robotic-guided VPS in cases with very small ventricles. Methods: Three patients underwent VPS with robotic guidance between 2016 and 2019. One patient with a diagnosis of occipital meningocele, who later developed recalcitrant CSF leak from the operative site, and two other patients were diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Plain CT brain with 1-mm slice thickness acquired prior to the surgery was uploaded into the ROSA machine (Zimmer Biomet Warsaw, Indiana). The trajectory for the VPS is created on the robotic software presurgery. The patient is placed in the supine position with head turned to the side contralateral to VPS insertion and fixed with Mayfield clamp. Registration of the patient is done with the robot. The placement of the VPS is commenced with the robotic arm in the predetermined trajectory. Results: Ventricle was hit in a single attempt in all the cases. CSF leak stopped in the case with meningocele; headache, and visual acuity improved in both the cases of IIH. Conclusion: Robotic-guidance provides a safe and accurate method of VPS placement even in the presence of slit-like ventricles.

AB  - Within a year of its emergence, coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into a pandemic. What has emerged during the past 1 year is that, apart from its potentially fatal respiratory presentation from which the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) derives its name, it presents with a myriad of gastrointestinal (GI) and liver manifestations. Expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor throughout the GI tract and liver, which is the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2, may be responsible for the GI and liver manifestations. Besides acting directly via the ACE-2 receptor, the virus triggers a potent immune response, which might have a role in pathogenesis. The virus leads to derangement in liver function tests in close to 50% of the patients. The impact of these derangements in patients with a normal underlying liver seems to be innocuous. Severe clinical presentations include acute decompensation and acute-on-chronic liver failure in a patient with chronic liver disease, leading to high mortality. Evolving data suggests that, contrary to intuition, liver transplant recipients and patients with autoimmune liver disease on immuno suppression do not have increased mortality. The exact mechanism underlying why immuno suppressed patients fare well as compared to other patients remains to be deciphered. With newer variants of COVID-19, which can spread faster than the original strain, the data on hepatic manifestations needs to be updated to keep a step ahead of the virus.

AB  - Background: The complex relationship between migraine and epilepsy has frequently been described to represent a clinical and electrographic "borderland." These two conditions share clinical expressions such as paroxysmal and chronic nature, as well as semiology, particularly visual phenomenon.
   Objective: We aimed to review the current literature on the overlapping phenomena of migraine and epilepsy.
   Materials and Methods: We searched the PubMed for relevant literature and conducted a narrative review on migraine and epilepsy.
   Results: Migraine and epilepsy share a complex and pathophysiologically intriguing relationship. The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) makes diagnostic provisions for migraine aura-triggered seizures (Subchapter 1.4.4) and headache attributed to epileptic seizure (Subchapter 7.6), the latter being further categorized as 7.6.1 Ictal epileptic headache, and 7.6.2 post-ictal headache. Neurological conditions such as certain channelopathies and epilepsy syndromes exhibit both conditions within their phenotypic spectrum, suggesting shared genetic and molecular underpinnings. Diagnostic confusion may arise, particularly between occipital epilepsy and the visual aura of migraine. Antiseizure medications may be effective for the treatment of migraines that occur in concert with epilepsy.
   Conclusions: Migraine and epilepsy share several clinical features and have intertwined genetic and molecular underpinnings, which may contribute to common pathogenesis. Electroencephalography may be useful as a diagnostic tool in selected cases.

AB  - Background: Traumatic vertebral burst fractures can be surgically approached via different approaches (anterior/posterior, or combined). Transpedicular approach (TA) is a posterior approach that has the advantage of achieving circumferential arthrodesis via single posterior only approach. The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience with TA in management of traumatic lumbar burst fractures (TLBFs). Materials and Methods: All consecutive patients with TLBFs managed with TA over 5 years duration were included in this retrospective study. Correction of kyphotic deformity and change in neurological status were analyzed to assess outcome. Cobb's angle and ASIA grade were used for this purpose. Results: There were 21 males and 14 females. Eight patients had complete (ASIA-A) while 22 had incomplete injury. All patients had a TLICS score >=4. The mean preoperative Cobb's angle was 13.97 degrees that improved to -3.57 degrees postoperatively (mean kyphosis correction-17.54 degrees). None of the patients developed iatrogenic nerve root injury. There was no perioperative mortality. The mean cobb's angle was 1.23 degrees at 39.1 months follow-up. Eight patients developed cage subsidence but none required revision surgery. Postoperatively, 27 (77.1%) patients showed neurological improvement and none deteriorated. The median ASIA score improved from 3 to 5. A fusion rate of 91.4% was observed at last follow-up. Conclusions: The advantages of TA including sense of familiarity with posterior approach amongst spine surgeons, lesser approach-related morbidity, and results comparable to anterior/combined approaches, make TA an attractive option for managing TLBFs. Although technically difficult, it can be successfully used for circumferential arthrodesis in lumbar region without sacrificing nerve roots.

AB  - The present work provides a new reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified silicon nanowires (SiNW) nanocomposite-based platform for the fabrication of a sensor. The fabricated sensor was used for the detection of biomarkers of infectious diseases in an easy, inexpensive, and non-invasive way. SiNW have been synthesized using metal-assisted chemical etching technique (MACE) and were casted using GO at room temperature. Subsequently, SiNW/GO was reduced to SiNW/rGO nanocomposite under an inert atmosphere using argon gas and characterized using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. This film was fabricated in the form of an electrode and utilized for the sensitive and selective detection of two volatile organic compounds (VOCs) namely cyclohexane and formaldehyde, found in the exhaled breath of patients with certain infections. The SiNW/rGO nanocomposite sensor showed a contrary response of 1.07 and 0.99 for 1 ppm concentration of cyclohexane and formaldehyde, respectively at room temperature. It showed a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 ppm and exhibits a fast response time of 30 s at ambient conditions. The recovery time of the sensor was 1-2 min and 3 min for cyclohexane and formaldehyde, respectively. Thus, the reported sensing approach using SiNW/rGO nanocomposite could exhibit a new nanocomposite for the fabrication of sensors having high sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, and stability for target analytes.

AB  - PURPOSE Patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) usually require a prolonged hospital stay that varies greatly across patients. Limited information exists on the factors associated with hospital length of stay (LOS) after allo-HSCT and the impact on transplant-related costs. The objective of this study was to determine predictors for longer LOS for allo-HSCT and to assess their impact on the cost of transplant stay.
   METHODS Using the National Inpatient Sample database, adult patients hospitalized for allo-HSCT were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, primary and secondary procedure codes.
   RESULTS Between 2002 and 2015, 68,296 hospitalizations for allo-HSCT were identified. Peripheral blood was the most common stem-cell source (80%) followed by bone marrow (15%) and cord blood (5%). Median LOS was 25.8 days (interquartile range [IQR], 21-34.0 days), and the overall inpatient mortality rate was 8%. Stem-cell source was a significant predictor for longer LOS, being significantly longer for cord blood (median, 36.9 days; IQR, 26.7-49.9 days) compared with bone marrow (median, 27.2 days; IQR, 21.5-35.2 days) and peripheral blood (median 25.4 days; IQR, 20.8-32.7 days). Other predictors for longer LOS were patient characteristics such as age and race, transplant/post-transplant characteristics, and complications such as total body irradiation use, acute graft-versus-host disease, and infections. Longer LOS was also found to be associated with higher hospital costs.
   CONCLUSION In patients who undergo allo-HSCT, LOS can be predicted using patient- and transplant-related characteristics as well as post-transplant complications. LOS is also a driver for increased cost, and further efforts are needed to mitigate transplant complications and resource utilization. (c) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - The present article aims to analyze epidemiologic aspects of the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) over different countries across the globe. While analyzing the overall spread of the disease, clusters of countries could be identified where the population-adjusted number of cases and mortality rates (MRs) were significantly different from the others. To draw a comparison over the countries at the same stage of infection, the nature and spread of the infection was evaluated at the 90th day of the pandemic for each country. It was observed that the countries with prevalent malarial transmission tended to have lesser population-adjusted COVID-19 caseloads. It was further observed that high population coverage of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination was negatively associated with population-adjusted caseloads and MRs due to COVID-19. The present cross-sectional study is an attempt to bring in several social, economic, and structural confounders into understanding of the nature and spread of this novel pandemic globally.

AB  - Background: Migraine is a common neurological disorder with significant morbidity and disability. There is growing evidence that migraine is associated with cardiovascular diseases and stroke.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to provide an update on the association of migraine with some common vascular diseases in persons suffering from the disease and discuss the clinical implications.
   Methods and Materials: We searched PUBMED database using the MeSH terms "Stroke", "Coronary Artery Disease", "Myocardial Ischemia", "Atrial Fibrillation", "White Matter" and "Dementia, Vascular", in combination with "Migraine Disorders", "Migraine with Aura" and "Migraine without Aura" and reviewed the relevant studies. We studied articles mostly in English for the past 10 years, without excluding older articles that were relevant to this review. We also searched the reference lists of articles obtained and included some insightful reviews on `Migraine and Vascular Risk'.
   Results: The association between migraine and vascular diseases is strong and consistent for ischemic stroke and migraine with aura especially in young women, with oral contraceptive use and smoking. Although literature reports a higher prevalence of obesity, dyslipidemia, and family history of cardiovascular diseases in migraineurs, the `migraine-vascular' connection persists in models where the traditional vascular risk factors are adjusted, implicating a migraine-specific pathophysiology at work. There is some evidence linking an adverse vascular risk factor profile to incident myocardial infarction in people with migraine. The association with hemorrhagic stroke is more variable.
   Conclusion: Although the absolute effect of migraine on `vascular risks' is small, good practice parameters dwell on treating and reducing existing cardiovascular risk factors through lifestyle modification, encouraging smoking cessation, and advocating the wise use of agents like ergot alkaloids and oral contraceptives, after a risk-benefit analysis.

AB  - The continuous rise in relapse rate and mortality for multiple myeloma (MM) demands an effective treatment option. The microRNAs are emerging nowadays for their promising therapeutic potential. Earlier, we reported involvement of Versican (VCAN) in myeloma pathogenesis which could be inhibited by miR-144 and miR-199 in stroma. However, there is dearth of literature showcasing the direct effect of these miRs in association with VCAN in MM. Expression of miR-144 and miR-199 was determined in myeloma cell lines (RPMI8226 & U266). These miRs were inhibited by small oligos to elucidate changes in expression of VCAN along with variation in parameters such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in vitro. Moreover, effect on certain downstream signaling cascades was also evaluated. Lastly, interaction of miRs with VCAN was assessed by reporter luciferase assay. microRNAs expression were found significantly elevated in myeloma cells in comparison to stromal levels reported previously. The antagomirs-mediated inhibition of miR-144 and miR-199 significantly induced VCAN expression in myeloma cells along with alteration in myeloma-associated parameters in favor of myeloma pathogenesis with downstream activation of FAK/STAT3 signaling. Interestingly, miR-144 found to have direct binding with VCAN 3 ' UTR while miR-199 possess different mechanism. The inhibition of miR-144 and miR-199 contributed in myeloma progression via upregulation of VCAN in vitro affirming the translational significance of VCAN and associated microRNAs in MM. These miRs, hence might be employed for targeting VCAN and might emerge as an effective therapy for the better outcome of MM in clinical settings in future.

AB  - Objectives:
   To assess the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux in mechanically ventilated children using 24-hour esophageal pH-metry and its role as a risk factor for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
   Design:
   Prospective cohort study.
   Setting:
   PICU of a tertiary care hospital from North India.
   Patients:
   Mechanically ventilated children 1-15 years old in PICU from July 2015 to June 2017, excluding those receiving acid suppressants, known cases of gastroesophageal reflux disease, having upper gastrointestinal bleed.
   Intervention:
   Demographic details, baseline investigations, diagnosis, treatment details, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score were recorded at enrollment. Gastroesophageal reflux was evaluated using 24-hour esophageal pH-metry. Children were followed up for 7 days or 48 hours after extubation for development of ventilator-associated pneumonia using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Pathologic acidic gastroesophageal reflux was defined as fall in esophageal pH less than 4 for more than 4% of total time, whereas pathologic alkaline gastroesophageal reflux as rise in esophageal pH greater than 7 for more than 17% of total time.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   Sixty-one children (median [interquartile range], age 73 mo [30-132 mo]; 44 boys [72%]) were enrolled. Median Pediatric Risk of Mortality III score was 10.0 (3-16). Median duration of ventilation was 6 days (3-9 d). Pathologic gastroesophageal reflux (acidic or alkaline) was present in 47 children (77%). Twelve children (19.7%) met criteria for pathologic acidic gastroesophageal reflux, whereas 44 children (72.1%) had pathologic alkaline gastroesophageal reflux; nine children (14.7%) had both pathologic acidic and alkaline gastroesophageal reflux. Of the enrolled children, 17 (27.9 %) developed ventilator-associated pneumonia. No patient had both pathologic acidic gastroesophageal reflux and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Of 17 children who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia, 12 (70.5%) had pathologic alkaline gastroesophageal reflux as compared to 32 children (72.7%) among the 44 children who did not develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (p = 0.87).
   Conclusions:
   The current study shows high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux on 24-hour esophageal pH-metry in mechanically ventilated children with medical diagnoses. The significance of this finding and its impact on ventilator-associated pneumonia and other ventilator-associated events need to be examined in larger studies.

AB  - Background: Patients with reactive arthritis frequently present to dermatologists. However, there is paucity of information regarding its clinical aspects and management in dermatological literature.
   Objective: To review the clinical features and management of patients with chronic reactive arthritis admitted to the dermatology department of a teaching hospital.
   Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with reactive arthritis admitted to the Department of Dermatology and Venereology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India from January 2016 to February 2018.
   Results: There were 12 males (disease duration 9-180 months). Biologics were used in 9 (75%) patients on 16 different occasions, the most frequent being infliximab (n = 10 times), followed by adalimumab (n = 3), etanercept, secukinumab and itolizumab (n = 1 each), in combination with other systemic agents. Response rate with treatment regimens including biologics (69% responders, 31% partial responders) was statistically significantly better than those without biologics (27% responders, 46% partial responders, 27% nonresponders; P = 0.036), using a composite measure assessing improvement in skin and joint symptoms. Biologics were discontinued on 50% of the occasions, after a median of 3.5 months (range 1.5-7.5 months) because of satisfactory response (n = 4), therapeutic fatigue (n = 3) or adverse event (n = 1). After biologic discontinuation, the response was sustained for a median of 5 months (range 3-6 months) before disease exacerbation. The number of treatment switches increased with the follow-up duration (median three switches per patient, range 1-8). The median follow-up duration was 10.5 months (range 4-76 months).
   Conclusion: Biologics produce rapid improvement in skin and joint symptoms in chronic reactive arthritis, but the response is not long-lasting. Patients with chronic reactive arthritis have a waxing and waning course despite regular treatment.
   Limitations: The limitations are retrospective design, small sample size and lack of a validated outcome measure.

AB  - Background: The decline in the diaphragm thickness is common among patients with sepsis. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the decline in diaphragm thickness as assessed by ultrasonography and various outcomes in septic patients.
   Methods: This prospective study included patients with sepsis whose diaphragm thickness was measured during inspiration (DTinsp) and expiration (DTexp) using ultrasonography on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 14 of admission in the ICU and thereafter weekly measurements until discharge or death.
   Results: The study included 70 (45 male) patients with sepsis [mean (SD) age = 55.91(14.08) years]. The mean (SD) DTinsp and DTexp (mm) on day-1 were 2.84 (0.32) and 2.33(0.27), respectively. During the hospital stay, there was a decline in DTinsp and DTexp. The decline in DTinsp and DTexp on days 3, 5, and 7 was significantly higher among patients with difficult weaning, non-survivors, and worse 90-day outcomes. Early decline (from day-1 to day-3) in diaphragm thickness predicted difficult weaning, in-hospital mortality, and worse 90-day outcome.
   Conclusions: Among patients with sepsis, the decline in diaphragm thickness detected by ultrasonography is associated with worse in-hospital and short-term post-discharge outcomes. The role of early decline in diaphragm thickness on ultrasonography as a marker of worse outcomes needs further evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to establish worldwide and regional diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) and achievable administered activities (AAAs) for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).
   BACKGROUND Reference levels serve as radiation dose benchmarks to compare individual laboratories against aggregated data, helping to identify sites in greatest need of dose reduction interventions. DRLs for SPECT MPI have previously been derived from national or regional registries. To date there have been no muttiregional reports of DRLs for SPECT MPI from a single standardized dataset.
   METHODS Data were submitted voluntarily to the INCAPS (International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Cardiology Protocols Study), a cross-sectional, multinational registry of MPI protocols. A total of 7,103 studies were included. DRLs and AAAs were calculated by protocol for each world region and for aggregated worldwide data.
   RESULTS The aggregated worldwide DRLs for rest-stress or stress-rest studies employing technetium Tc 99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals were 11.2 mCi (first dose) and 32.0 mCi (second dose) for 1-day protocols, and 23.0 mCi (first dose) and 24.0 mCi (second dose) for multiday protocols. Corresponding AAAs were 10.1 mCi (first dose) and 28.0 mCi (second dose) for 1-day protocols, and 17.8 mCi (first dose) and 18.7 mCi (second dose) for multiday protocols. For stress-only technetium Tc 99m studies, the worldwide DRL and AAA were 18.0 mCi and 12.5 mCi, respectively. Stress-first imaging was used in 26% to 92% of regional studies except in North America where it was used in just 7% of cases. Significant differences in DRLs and AAAs were observed between regions.
   CONCLUSIONS This study reports reference levels for SPECT MPI for each major world region from one of the largest international registries of clinical MPI studies. Regional DRLs may be useful in establishing or revising guidelines or simply comparing individual laboratory protocols to regional trends. Organizations should continue to focus on establishing standardized reporting methods to improve the validity and comparability of regional DRLs.

KW  - MUSCLE TRANSPLANTATION
AB  - Facial nerve palsy is an exceedingly debilitating condition, incapacitating functional and aesthetic facets of the face. Orthodromic transfer of temporalis muscle is an easy and predictable technique which offers early animation of oral commissure and lower face. A retrospective chart review of 6 patients of facial palsy treated with orthodromic temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation is presented. The technique consisted of intra-oral coronoidectomy followed by attachment of fascia lata grafts from the coronoid to the commissure, the upper and lower lips via small cutaneous incisions. Contraction of the temporalis, pulls the fascia lata extensions thereby reanimating the lower face. 4 male and 2 female patients with an age range of 25 to 49 years were treated. Simultaneous fat grafting (2 patients), depressor labi inferioris muscle resection (2 patients) and wedge excision of nasolabial fold (2 patients) was done as ancillary procedures. Post-operative smile evaluation was carried out using the Terzis and Noah facial grading system. Patients were asked to smile with and without biting, and photographs and video were taken. The results were graded from 1 to 5 based on a 5-point scale (ie, poor, fair, moderate, good, and excellent) by an independent observer. The results were excellent in 1 patient (Terzis grading 5/5) and good in the remaining 5 patients (Terzis grading 4/5). Excursion of the oral commissure ranged from 6 to 10 mm. Our experience indicates that temporalis tendon transfer for facial reanimation has a short learning curve and provides early predictable outcome without significant complications. This single-stage, day-care procedure can be easily incorporated by maxillofacial surgeons to expand their surgical spectrum.

AB  - It is not uncommon to have prolapse of the atrial septal occluder device despite accurate measurement of atrial septal defect and an appropriately chosen device. This is particularly a problem in cases with large atrial septal defect with absent aortic rim. Various techniques have been described for successful implantation of atrial septal occluder in such a scenario. The essence of all these techniques is to prevent prolapse of the left atrial disc through the defect while the right atrial disc is being deployed. In this brief report, we illustrate the use of cobra head deformity of the device to successfully deploy the device across the atrial septum.

AB  - Background: Solitary cysticercus granuloma (SCG) appearing as a single ring-enhancing lesion (SREL) is the most frequently encountered imaging finding in patients of neurocysticercosis (NCC) in India and during follow-up, most of SCGs resolve with or without calcifications. Recurrent SCG have been rarely reported. Objectives: The aim of our study is to report the incidence of recurrent SCG in a cohort of patients with SCG and postulate the hypothesis. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 278 patients with SCG meeting the criteria of NCC. Their medical records and imaging studies were analyzed. Results: Out of 278 patients, 119 patients with SCG meeting the criteria of NCC with follow-up imaging were included. 15 (12.61%) had recurrent NCC and 104 (87.4%) patients did not have any recurrence during a median follow-up of 14.23 months (range; 0.24 - 113.3) and 25.26 months (range; 3.09- 98.11) respectively. Out of 15 recurrent NCC cases, ten patients had documented imaging resolution or partial regression of previous lesion followed by occurrence of new SCG in the same location, three patients had change in morphology of lesion from solitary discrete REL to solitary conglomerate REL secondary to development of new cysticercus granuloma adjacent to old lesion patients had recurrent lesions adjacent to previous lesion and two patients had new SCG in different locations following regression of old SCGs. Conclusion: Recurrent SCGs are not uncommon in NCC and recurrence is more likely to occur at the site of initial infection and therefore may be mistaken for persistent infection or other granulomatous lesions.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic value and accuracy of ictal SPECT and inter-ictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) in localizing the site for surgery in persons with drug resistant epilepsy.
   Method: This was a prospective observational study. Patients expected to undergo epilepsy surgery were enrolled consecutively and the localization results from different imaging modalities were discussed in an epilepsy surgery meet. Odds ratio of good outcome (Engel I) were calculated in patients who underwent surgery in concordance with MEG and SPECT findings. Post-surgical seizure freedom lasting at least 36 months or more was considered the gold standard for determining the diagnostic output of SPECT and MEG.
   Results: MEG and SPECT were performed in 101 and 57 patients respectively. In 45 patients SPECT could not be done due to delay in injection or technical factors. The accuracy of MEG and SPECT in localizing the epileptogenic zone was found to be 74.26 % and 78.57 % respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio for Engel I surgical outcome was reported as 2.43 and 5.0 for MEG and SPECT respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio for MEG in whom SPECT was non-informative was found to be 6.57 [95 % CI 1.1, 39.24], although it was not significantly associated with good surgical outcome. MEG was useful in indicating sites for SEEG implantation.
   Conclusion: SPECT was found to be non-informative for most patients, but reported better diagnostic output than MEG. MEG may be a useful alternative for patients in whom SPECT cannot be done or was non-localizing.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: About 2.5 billion peoples are at risk of dengue virus and the majority of people, use traditional plant-based medicines to combat dengue. The whole plant of Andrographis paniculata used traditionally over past decades for health promotion. Andrographolide isolated from Andrographis paniculata is used as natural remedy for the treatment of various diseases in different parts of the world. Andrographolide has been reported to have antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, chikungunya virus, dengue virus 2 and 4.
   Aim of the study: The aim of the present study to isolate the andrographolide from the A. paniculata by super-critical fluid extraction technique and to characterize the isolated compound along with it anti-dengue activity against DENV-2 in vitro and in silico methods.
   Materials and methods: Supercritical extraction condition for A. paniculata was standardised to isolate andrographolide compound at definite temperature and pressure on the basis of previous study. The andrographolide was identified by using Ultraviolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-VIS), Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and High Performance Thin Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ((HNMR)-H-1). The maximum non-toxic dose of isolated andrographolide was detected by MTT assay using a micro plate reader at 595 nm. One hundred (100) copies/ml of the DENV-2 virus was used for antiviral assay in C6/36 cells lines and inhibition of virus due to andrographolide was determined by real-time PCR assay. The purity of isolated andrographolide was determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The dengue NS5 receptor protein was docked with andrographolide and evaluated on the basis of the total energy and binding affinity score by Auto Dock (V4.2.6) software.
   Results: Andrographolide, a diterpene lactone was isolated from the A. paniculata supercritical extract at 40 degrees C temperature and 15 Mpa pressure. UV spectrophotometer analysis revealed that the curve of andrographolide plant extract was overlapped with reference compound at 228 nm and the similar bands were detected from FT-IR spectroscopy analysis at 3315, 2917, 2849, 1673, 1462 and 1454 cm(-1) in isolated and standard andrographolide. HPTLC analysis shows the retention factor (R-f) of A. paniculata extract at 0.74 +/- 0.06 as similar to standard andrographolide Rf values. The purity of isolated andrographolide was 99.76%. The maximum nontoxic dose of isolated andrographolide was found as 15.62 mu g/ml on the C6/36 cell line calculated by using MTT assay. The andrographolide showed the 97.23% anti-dengue activity against the dengue-2 virus in C6/36 cell lines. Results of molecular docking showed that the interaction between andrographolide and NS5 of dengue protein with the maximum binding energy as -7.35 kcal/mol.
   Conclusions: It is concluded that isolated andrographolide from the A. paniculata possess anti-dengue activity against dengue-2 virus as revealed from in vitro and in silico method. Due to lack of the vaccine and anti-viral agents, andrographolide extracted from A. paniculata play a major role to inhibit the dengue replication. Hence, it could be a source for drug design and help to reduce the dengue infection.

AB  - Given the genomic uniqueness, a local data set is most desired for Indians, who are underrepresented in existing public databases. We hypothesize patients with rare monogenic disorders and their family members can provide a reliable source of common variants in the population. Exome sequencing (ES) data from families with rare Mendelian disorders was aggregated from five centers in India. The dataset was refined by excluding related individuals and removing the disease-causing variants (refined cohort). The efficiency of these data sets was assessed in a new set of 50 exomes against gnomAD and GenomeAsia. Our original cohort comprised 1455 individuals from 1203 families. The refined cohort had 836 unrelated individuals that retained 1,251,064 variants with 181,125 population-specific and 489,618 common variants. The allele frequencies from our cohort helped to define 97,609 rare variants in gnomAD and 44,520 rare variants in GenomeAsia as common variants in our population. Our variant dataset provided an additional 1.7% and 0.1% efficiency for prioritizing heterozygous and homozygous variants respectively for rare monogenic disorders. We observed additional 19 genes/human knockouts. We list carrier frequency for 142 recessive disorders. This is a large and useful resource of exonic variants for Indians. Despite limitations, datasets from patients are efficient tools for variant prioritization in a resource-limited setting.

AB  - Long-chain omega-3 fatty acid status during pregnancy may influence newborn anthropometry and duration of gestation. Evidence from high-quality trials from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial among 957 pregnant women (singleton gestation, 14-20 weeks' gestation at enrollment) in India to test the effectiveness of 400 mg/day algal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to placebo provided from enrollment through delivery. Among 3379 women who were screened, 1171 were found eligible; 957 were enrolled and were randomized. The intervention was two microencapsulated algal DHA (200 x 2 = 400 mg/day) or two microencapsulated soy and corn oil placebo tablets to be consumed daily from enrollment (<= 20 weeks) through delivery. The primary outcome was newborn anthropometry (birth weight, length, head circumference). Secondary outcomes were gestational age and 1 and 5 min Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration (APGAR) score. The groups (DHA; n = 478 and placebo; n = 479) were well balanced at baseline. There were 902 live births. Compliance with the intervention was similar across groups (DHA: 88.5%; placebo: 87.1%). There were no significant differences between DHA and placebo groups for birth weight (2750.6 +/- 421.5 vs. 2768.2 +/- 436.6 g, p = 0.54), length (47.3 +/- 2.0 vs. 47.5 +/- 2.0 cm, p = 0.13), or head circumference (33.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 33.8 +/- 1.4 cm, p = 0.15). The mean gestational age at delivery was similar between groups (DHA: 38.8 +/- 1.7 placebo: 38.8 +/- 1.7 wk, p = 0.54) as were APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min. Supplementing mothers through pregnancy with 400 mg/day DHA did not impact the offspring's birthweight, length, or head circumference.

AB  - Headache disorders, characterized by recurrent headache, are among the most common disorders of the nervous system. The aim of this study was to document epidemiological and economic burden due to headache globally and in India and suggest a public health approach to address headache disorders for India. We reviewed the available literature on burden due to headache, its management using a primary health care approach and health system barriers, with special emphasis on India. Globally, it has been estimated that prevalence of current headache disorder (symptomatic within last year) among adults is about 50%, around 30% report migraine and headache on 15 or more days every month affects 1.7-4% people. The Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 estimated that migraine caused 45.1 million (95% UI 29.0-62.8) and tension-type headache 7.2 million (95% UI 4.6-10.5) years of life lived with disability. Limited data available in India support such high burden. These studies also indicate high diagnostic and treatment gaps for headache disorders in India. Major challenges in addressing headache disorders effectively in India are low perceived severity, absence of burden data, lack of standard treatment protocols for headache disorders and primary care models for neurological disorders in developing country context. There needs to be a better appreciation of the burden and a public health approach among all stakeholders, if burden of headache disorders is to be addressed effectively in India.

TI  - Communication skills training through 'role play' in an acute critical care course
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - SBAR
AB  - Background. Effective patient-doctor communication is a key component of patient-centred care, which is one of the six pillars of quality healthcare delivery. Structured and effective communication skills training for healthcare providers is the need of hour in medical education. We assessed the efficacy of role play and simulation in developing communication skills.
   Methods. As a key component of an acute critical care course (ACCC), communication skills are taught using role play models and simulation. Live feedback is critical in learning during this course as per the principles of adult learning (andragogy). Quantitative and qualitative data were collected to assess the efficacy of ACCC.
   Results. The 19th ACCC was introduced to interns at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi in December 2018. The teaching methodology and objective-oriented structured training in ACCC were much appreciated for training in human factors with emphasis on communication. A positive response was obtained from the candidates 3 weeks after they completed the course to assess whether interns are able to make use of this training in their day-to-day clinical practice amounting to a reliable evidence level of Kirkpatrick's 'return of investment'.
   Conclusion. The use of 'role play' to teach communication skills is effective and superior to lecture-based teaching. Further structured and interactive programmes in communication skills training will improve patient care, relatives' satisfaction and the image of medical profession.

AB  - Background and Objective: Stem cell therapy has emerged as a potential therapy for the treatment of stroke. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled studies using various types of stem cell therapies in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Method: Literature search was carried out using PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane library, and clinicaltrial.gov to identify studies on stem cell therapy in IS from its inception till January 2020. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. STATA version 13 was used for carrying out meta- analysis. We included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) if any of the stem cell therapy was used to treat patients with IS in any phase after the index stroke. Results: We included a total of eight randomized controlled studies involving 459 subjects (217 intervention and 242 controls) in the meta-analysis. We did not observe statistically significant reduction in mean NIHSS score in the intervention group (SMD - 0.34, 95% CI - 0.76 to 0.08) in patients with acute or sub-acute stroke. However, a statistically significant reduction (SMD - 1.57, 95% CI -2.22 to -0.92) was observed in patients with chronic ischemic stroke. Statistically non-significant reduction in mean mRS in the intervention group (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.28) in patients with acute or sub-acute ischemic stroke was observed, however a statistically significant reduction (SMD - 1.07, 95% CI - 1.94 to -0.19) was noted in patients with chronic stroke. We did not observe statistically significant reduction in mean Barthel index score (SMD 0.24, 95%CI -1.69 to 2.17) in chronic stroke. Statistically non-significant lower mortality rate was observed in intervention group compared to controls (Risk Ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.66) among acute or sub-acute, as well as in the chronic stroke group (Risk Ratio 0.47, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.09). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis provides no clinically important evidence for efficacy of stem cells in reducing neurological deficit compared to control group. Well-designed large randomized controlled trials are required to provide more information on the efficacy of stem cell therapy in patients with IS.

AB  - In this paper, we present a new method for estimating knee joint angle using force myography. The technique utilized force myogram signals from thigh muscles while subjects walked on a treadmill at different speeds, i.e., slow, medium, fast, and run. An eight-channel in-house force myography (FMG) data acquisition system was developed to collect the data wirelessly from seven healthy subjects and a transfemoral amputee. An artificial neural network was employed to estimate the knee joint angle from force myogram signals. The root-mean-square error across the healthy subjects was 6.9 +/- 1.5 degrees at slow (1.5 km/hr), 6.5 +/- 1.3 degrees at medium (4 km/hr), 7.4 +/- 2.2 degrees at fast (6 km/hr) speeds, and 8.1 +/- 2.2 degrees while running (8 km/hr). The root-mean-square error, across the trials, for the transfemoral amputee was 4.0 +/- 1.2 degrees at slow (1 km/hr), 3.2 +/- 0.6 degrees at medium (2 km/hr) and 3.8 +/- 0.9 degrees at fast (3 km/hr) speeds. The proposed approach is useful in real-time gait analysis. The system is easily wearable, convenient in out-door use, portable, and commercially viable.

AB  - Introduction: There are limited data on the effect of chronic pancreatitis (CP) on pregnancy outcomes and vice versa. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical trajectory of CP during pregnancy and its effect on pregnancy outcomes. Methods: All female patients of child-bearing age (>= 15 years) diagnosed with CP were studied from January 2004 to July 2019. The change in frequency of painful episodes was assessed before, during, and after pregnancy. Maternal and fetal outcomes were compared between pregnant women (early onset) and women presenting with CP after completion of all pregnancies (late onset). Results: Of 187 women with CP, pregnancy outcomes and clinical course were assessed in 99 patients. The frequency of painful exacerbations was significantly lower during pregnancy compared with prepregnancy and postpregnancy periods (P < 0.001). The median pain score decreased significantly to 0 (0-2) during pregnancy from 3 (0-6) before conception and increased to 4 (0-8) after pregnancy (P = 0.002). Women with early onset CP (n = 57) had their first child later and had fewer pregnancies compared with those with late onset CP (n = 42). There was no difference in maternal outcomes such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and preterm delivery, and fetal outcomes such as abortion, low birth weight, and still birth between the groups. There was no reported congenital anomaly. DISCUSSION: Younger patients with CP had later and fewer pregnancies, but there was no increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. The clinical course of CP was usually benign during pregnancy with decreased frequency and severity of pain.

   Purpose: To stage liver fibrosis by using 5-minute delayed DECT and compare findings with those of transient elastography (TE), shear-wave elastography (SWE), and histologic examination.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective study included patients with chronic liver disease who were scheduled to undergo multiphase abdominal CT and liver biopsy from January 2017 to September 2018. Fifty individuals being screened as renal donors comprised the control group. Study participants underwent TE, SWE, multiphasic DECT (including 5-minute delayed dual-energy scanning), and liver biopsy. Multiphasic DECT and SWE were performed in the control group. The NIC of the right lobe of the liver (RNIC) was compared with liver stiffness (LS) as measured with TE and SWE and with the METAVIR fibrosis stage (ranging from F0 to F4). Diagnostic performance was assessed by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs).
   Results A total of 107 participants (mean age, 35 years +/- 12 [standard deviation]; 57 men) and 50 control subjects (mean age, 47 years +/- 11; 29 women) were evaluated. The RNIC showed strong correlation with METAVIR stage (Spearman rho = 0.81, P < .001). The AUC for RNIC with each METAVIR stage ranged between 0.86 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.97) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92, 0.99). The cut-off value of RNIC was 0.24 (sensitivity: 85% [86 of 101 participants; 95% CI: 77%, 91%]; specificity: 83% [84 of 101 participants; 95% CI: 42%, 98%]) for stage F1 fibrosis and 0.29 (sensitivity: 84% [67 of 80 participants; 95% CI: 74%, 90%]; specificity: 81% [65 of 80 participants; 95% CI: 63%, 92%]) for stage F2 fibrosis. RNIC correlated well with LS as measured with TE and SWE (Spearman rho = 0.60 and 0.64, respectively; P < .001).
   Conclusion: Normalized iodine concentration of liver at 5-minute delayed dual-energy CT showed strong correlation with the histologic stages of liver fibrosis and good diagnostic performance in estimating liver fibrosis. (C) RSNA, 2020

AB  - Multicentric gliomas are uncommon pathological entities, although well described in the literature. The aim of this study was to highlight the management issues in a rare case of multicentric glioma occurring in a bilateral temporo-insular region. A 35-year-old farmer with no comorbid illness presented with a history of progressively increasing holocranial headaches, intermittent episodes of vomiting, and memory disturbances from the last 3 months. Radiological findings were suggestive of multicentric glioma involving bilateral temporo-insular regions. Patient underwent tumor decompression first on the left side followed by the right side. Postoperative course was uneventful. Management of multicentric gliomas is challenging.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy (25G PPV) with encircling scleral band (ESB) in patients with acute retinal necrosis (ARN)-related rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). Methods: Single-center retrospective interventional case series of patients who underwent 25G PPV with ESB for ARN-related RRD. Complete anatomic success was defined as the complete attachment of retina after primary PPV. Functional success was measured by the final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) >= 20/400. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were also noted. Results: 14 eyes of 13 patients were included in the study. Six patients (46.1%) were immunocompromised. The mean follow-up was 23.64 +/- 9.95 (range 6-42) months. Silicone oil was used as tamponade in 13 eyes and C 3F 8 gas in one eye. After the primary PPV, complete anatomical success was seen in all eyes (100%), however, one eye developed phthisis bulbi after silicone oil removal (SOR). Statistically significant improvement of BCVA was seen, from LogMAR 2.03 +/- 0.29 preoperatively to LogMAR 1.57 +/- 0.63 postoperatively (p-value 0.014). Six eyes (42.9%) had functional success. Nine eyes (64.3%) had improvement in vision while 4 eyes (28.6%) maintained preoperative vision. 10 eyes (71.4%) underwent cataract surgery, nine eyes (64.3%) underwent SOR while 2 eyes (14.3%) had epiretinal membrane (ERM) under oil during follow-up. Conclusion: 25G PPV combines the advantages of minimally invasive vitrectomy surgery while offering improved anatomic outcomes in patients with ARN-related RRD. The functional outcome varies depending on the status of the optic disc and macula.

AB  - Description: The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed a clinical practice guideline in 2020 for the management of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Methods: The KDIGO Work Group (WG) was tasked with developing the guideline for diabetes management in CKD. It defined the scope of the guideline, gathered evidence, determined systematic review topics, and graded evidence that had been summarized by an evidence review team. The English-language literature searches, which were initially done through October 2018, were updated in February 2020. The WG used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach to appraise evidence and rate the strength of the recommendations. Expert judgment was used to develop consensus practice points supplementary to the evidence-based graded recommendations. The guideline document underwent open public review. Comments from various stakeholders, subject matter experts, and industry and national organizations were considered before the document was finalized.
   Recommendations: The guideline includes 12 recommendations and 48 practice points for clinicians caring for patients with diabetes and CKD. This synopsis focuses on the key recommendations pertinent to the following issues: comprehensive care needs, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and educational and integrated care approaches.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common progressive neuro-degenerative disorder. Research in PD is gradually increasing in India due to increased clinical cases, which could double by 2030 worldwide. Although its prevalence is low in India as compared to other countries, the total burden is much higher due to the large population size. PD is progressively debilitating, with pronounced motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) that severely affect the quality of life (QoL) of patients and their caregivers. The progressive nature of the disease lays great emphasis on doctors to focus on the patients' QoL. As a consequence, Health-related QoL (HRQoL) has gradually become one of the main indicators for assessing health-related outcome. There is a growing need to pay attention to the NMSs and a pressing need to look at the QoL of Indian patients with PD through a culture and value specific lens. Research into the holistic QoL assessment with emphasis on psychological domains may allow for the early evaluation and intervention of depressive and cognitive symptoms in PD. This could result into increased productivity, reduced morbidity, and healthcare cost, which would in turn result into better QoL of Indian PD patients.

AB  - Cross-sectional imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis and management of various structural and functional changes that occur in the postoperative period after palliative or corrective surgical procedures performed for congenital heart diseases (CHD). Although echocardiography is the mainstay for the evaluation of CHD, it is limited by poor acoustic window post-surgery in addition to being operator dependent. Computed tomography (CT) allows for the comprehensive evaluation of the post-surgical anatomy and complications after repair for cyanotic CHD. Radiologists and cardiac imagers should be familiar with these expected changes after surgeries performed for various cyanotic CHDs, to obtain diagnostic quality cardiac CT images and to promptly recognise the abnormal post-operative appearances in this patient population. In this review, we describe the various CT features of complications that can be encountered after repair of cyanotic CHDs.

AB  - Objective: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with its new quantitative mapping techniques has proved to be an essential diagnostic tool for detecting myocardial injury associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. This systematic review sought to assess the important imaging features on CMR in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic literature review within the PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and WHO databases for articles describing the CMR findings in COVID-19 patients. Results: A total of 34 studies comprising 199 patients were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Of the CMRs 21% were normal. Myocarditis (40.2%) was the most prevalent diagnosis. T1 (109/150; 73%) and T2 (91/144; 63%) mapping abnormalities, edema on T2/STIR (46/90; 51%), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) (85/199; 43%) were the most common imaging findings. Perfusion deficits (18/21; 85%) and extracellular volume mapping abnormalities (21/40; 52%), pericardial effusion (43/175; 24%), and pericardial LGE (22/100; 22%) were also seen. LGE was most commonly seen in the subepicardial location (81%) and in the basal-mid part of the left ventricle in inferior segments. In most of the patients, ventricular functions were normal. Kawasaki-like involvement with myocardial edema without necrosis/LGE (4/6; 67%) was seen in children. Conclusion: CMR is useful in assessing the prevalence, mechanism, and extent of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients. Myocarditis is the most common imaging diagnosis, with the common imaging findings being mapping abnormalities and myocardial edema on T2, followed by LGE. As cardiovascular involvement is associated with poor prognosis, its detection warrants prompt attention and appropriate treatment.

AB  - In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of Sirt1, Sirt3 and combined activation in high fructose diet-induced insulin resistance rat heart and assessed the cardiac function focusing on mitochondrial health and function. We administered the Sirt1 activator; SRT1720 (5 mg/kg, i.p.), Sirt3 activator; Oroxylin-A (10 mg/kg i.p.) and the combination; SRT1720 + Oroxylin-A (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p.) daily from 12th week to 20th weeks of study. We observed significant perturbations of most of the cardiac structural and functional parameters in high fructose diet-fed animals. Administration of SRT1720 and Oroxylin-A improved perturbed cardiac structural and functional parameters by decreasing insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and improving mitochondrial function by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis, OXPHOS expression and activity in high fructose diet-induced insulin-resistant rats. However, we could not observe the synergistic effect of SRT1720 and Oroxylin-A combination. Similar to in-vivo study, perturbed mitochondrial function and oxidative stress observed in insulin-resistant H9c2 cells were improved after activation of Sirt1 and Sirt3. We observed that Sirt1 activation enhances Sirt3 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis, and the opposite effects were observed after Sirt1 inhibition in cardiomyoblast cells. Taken together our results conclude that activation of Sirt1 alone could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications.

TI  - Study 3: Assessment of events during surgery on posterior polar cataracts using intraoperative optical coherence tomography
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Intraoperative optical coherence tomography
KW  - in vivo changes in posterior polar cataracts
KW  - posterior polar cataract
AB  - Purpose: To describe the changes along nucleo-epinuclear and the opacity-capsular junction during hydrodelineation and the entire period of phacoemulsification using intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT). Methods: A total of 12 eyes of 12 patients with clinically confirmed posterior polar cataract, who underwent cataract surgery by a single surgeon under the direct guidance of iOCT. The changes along nucleo-epinuclear junction and opacity-capsular junction during/following hydrodelineation and the changes along the opacity-capsular junction following nucleus removal, capsular changes before the opacity removal, and its dynamic changes throughout the surgical procedure were studied. Results: The mean age of patients was 48.25 +/- 7.89 years. Eight of them were males and the right eye was operated in seven patients. With regular hydrodelineation, optimal separation of the nucleus-epinuclear layer was evident in 11 patients. Once a golden ring is achieved through the hydro procedure, then repeated attempts can be performed within it to decrease the chances of capsular damage. Fracture of the posterior opacity with tension over the underlying capsule (n = 1), inadvertent hydro dissection while performing hydrodelineation (n = 1), continuous posterior capsular billowing (n = 2), and posterior capsular ruptures (n = 2) were encountered in this observation with even well-judged surgical maneuvering. Conclusion: iOCT provides a better understanding of real-time changes along different layers of the human lens during posterior polar cataract surgery. The observations obtained here are likely to help in minimizing inadvertent complications in the future.

AB  - Background: Teleconsultation services in India, especially in neurosurgery, are relatively new. Despite its large-scale adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, comprehensive analyses of patients' perspectives and hurdles are lacking. Materials and Methods: We conducted an anonymized telephonic survey of consecutive neurosurgical patients who availed telemedicine services at our institute, using a validated, structured questionnaire. To prevent bias, interviewers were not involved in the study design/analyses. Patients' perception of usefulness and performance of teleconsultation was graded on a 5-point Likert scale. Results: Of the 330 patients who availed teleconsultation services, 231 (70%) completed the survey. Even though 91% of the respondents had access to a smartphone, only 10% received a video-based teleconsult. As per respondents, the challenges included poor network (7%), suboptimal communication/discussion (5.6%), lack of physical examination (6%), and misinterpretation of prescription by pharmacists/patients (6%). The majority of the respondents (58%) either agreed/strongly agreed that teleconsultation helped them tide over the medical exigency during the lockdown; however, the clinical diagnosis did not influence this response (P = 0.21). The vast majority of the respondents felt that teleconsultation is beneficial (97%), as it minimizes their exposure to COVID-19. One-third of the patients preferred this service over physical visits and 60% agreed to its continuation till resumption of routine care. Access to video-teleconsultation was the chief suggestion in 39 of 74 suggestions received. Conclusions: Telemedicine in neurosurgery offers favorable patient satisfaction during this pandemic and may be a satisfactory alternative to physical outpatient services in the future. Video-based teleconsults should be the preferred modality of communication for neurosurgery patients.

AB  - Alexithymia has been described as difficulty in expressing as well as experiencing feelings. It has been studied in relation with medical as well as psychological conditions and has been seen to impact treatment outcomes. The current review focuses on the relationship of alexithymia with depression and the role of culture in this relationship. The keywords for literature included terms such as depression, alexithymia, depression and alexithymia, Toronto Alexithymia Scale, assessing alexithymia and depression, and alexithymia as a trait. The main findings of the review were that alexithymia and depression are highly correlated, and severity of depression and gender are independently associated with alexithymia and may interfere with treatment outcomes.

AB  - Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with high mortality, morbidity, and recurrence. Studies have reported the accuracy of several blood biomarkers in predicting clinical outcomes; however, their independent contribution in prediction remains to be established. Aim: To investigate the incremental accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with ICH in a north Indian population using blood-based biomarkers. Methods: In this study, a total of 250 ICH cases were recruited within 72 hours of onset. Baseline clinical and CT scan measurement were recorded. Homocysteine (HCY), C-reactive protein (CRP), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), E-selectin (SELE), and P-selectin (SELP) levels were measured through ELISA. Telephonic follow-up was done by using mRS scale at three months. Results: The mean age of cohort was 54.9 (SD +/- 12.8) years with 64.8% patients being male. A total of 109 (43.6%) deaths were observed over three months follow-up. Area under the receiver operating characteristics curve-(AUROC) for 90day mortality were 0.55 (HCY), 0.62 (CRP), 0.57 (MMP9), 0.60 (SELE) and 0.53 (SELP) and for poor outcome at 90-day (mRS: 3-6) were 0.60 (HCY), 0.62 (CRP), 0.54 (MMP9), 0.67 (SELE) and 0.54 (SELP). In multivariable model including age, ICH volume, IVH and GCS at admission, serum SELE (p = 0.004) significant for poor outcome with improved AUROC (0.86) and HCY (p = 0.04), CRP (p = 0.003) & MMP9 (p = 0.02) for mortality with least Akaike's Information Criterion-(AIC) (1060.5). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the serum SELE is a significant predictor of poor outcome and HCY, CRP & MMP9 for Mortality in patients with ICH in the north Indian population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Formulary of India (NFI), a ready reckoner for medicines among healthcare-professionals aims for promoting rational drug use. This needs periodic update based on evidence-based medicines and suggestions from end-users. This study assessed the level of awareness among health-care professionals and sought suggestions for enhancement of utility/content of NFI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This pan-India cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November-2020 and March-2021. A Google-doc-based validated questionnaire (20 questions) was circulated through E-mail/social media groups and to 311 medical institutes/hospitals/clinics across India through the adverse drug reaction monitoring centers under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India.
   RESULTS: A total of 461 participants (39-interns, 167-resident doctors, and the rest practicing physicians/doctors) affiliated to 224 institutes/hospitals/clinics had responded. About 46% respondents consulted NFI for drug-related information and 82.3% stated that NFI provides balanced unbiased information. About 95% respondents were aware of NFI's content and 76% mentioned usefulness of NFI in their clinical practice; however, 34.4% had misconceptions about NFI, 28.7% had a false belief that NFI is a legal document to safeguard health-care providers and 22.2% had never used it. Suggestions to enhance NFI's utility included digital accessibility, incorporation of information like drugs for basic medical emergencies (71.3%), disposal of expired-pharmaceutical products (38.7%), pharmaceutical price control policy (36.3%), and drug-procurement practices in hospitals (35.6%).
   CONCLUSION: As per the survey findings, NFI is an effective tool for instant access to precise and unbiased drug-related information, and fostering rational use of drugs. Boosting its practical usefulness needs incorporation of suggested information, digital accessibility, and periodic update.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic neurological diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in the world. With increasing life expectancy in the developing world, the incidence and prevalence of these diseases are predicted to rise even further. This has also contributed to an increase in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for noncommunicable diseases. Treatment for such diseases also poses a challenge with multiple genetic and epigenetic factors leading to a varied outcome. Personalization of treatment is one way that treatment outcome/prognosis of disease can be improved, and pharmacogenomics plays a significant role in this context. Methodology: This article reviewed the evidence pertaining to the association of genetic and epigenetic markers with major neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD), which are a major source of burden among neurological disorders. Types of studies included are peer-reviewed original research articles from the PubMed database (1999-2018). Results: This study compiled data regarding specific genetic and epigenetic markers with a significant correlation between the clinical diagnosis of the disease and prognosis of therapy from 65 studies. In a single platform, this review highlights the clues to some vital questions, such as why interferon beta (IFN-beta) therapy fails to improve symptoms in all MS patients? why cholinesterase inhibitors fail to improve cognitive impairment in a subset of people suffering from AD? or why some individuals on levodopa (L-DOPA) for PD suffer from side-effects ranging from dyskinesia to hallucination while others do not? Conclusion: This article summarizes the genetic and epigenetic factors that may either require monitoring or help in deciding future pharmacotherapy in a patient suffering from MS, AD, and PD. As the health care system develops and reaches newer heights, we expect more and more of these biomarkers to be used as pharmacotherapeutic outcome indicators.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had health implications of unprecedented magnitude. The infection can range from asymptomatic, mild to life threatening respiratory distress. It can affect almost every organ of the body. Ophthalmologists world over are reporting various manifestations of the infection in the eye. This review was undertaken to help ophthalmologists recognize the possible manifestations and the stage of the viral disease when they commonly appear. Literature search was performed for the publications on ophthalmic manifestations of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) between January 1, 2020 and January 31, 2021. 46 case reports, 8 case series, 11 cross sectional/cohort observational studies, 5 prospective interventional studies, 3 animal models/autopsy studies and 6 reviews/meta-analysis were included. Conjunctivitis is the most common manifestation and can develop at any stage of the disease. Direct effect due to virus, immune mediated tissue damage, activation of the coagulation cascade and prothrombotic state induced by the viral infection, the associated comorbidities and drugs used in the management are responsible for the findings in the eye. The viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) has been isolated from ocular tissues but the role of eye as a route for infection is yet to be substantiated. Ophthalmic manifestations may be the presenting feature of COVID-19 infection or they may develop several weeks after recovery. Ophthalmologists should be aware of the possible associations of ocular diseases with SARS-CoV-2 in order to ask relevant history, look for specific signs, advise appropriate tests and thereby mitigate the spread of infection as well as diagnose and initiate early treatment for life and vision threatening complications.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak poses a global crisis in health care delivery system, including habilitation and rehabilitation services. In this study, we shared our experiences on telerehabilitation services established primarily for students with visual disabilities (SwVD) amidst COVID-19 pandemic and its outputs. Methods: Following the lockdown declared on March 23, 2020, the rehabilitative team of a tertiary eye center in north India received information that many visually challenged students (VCS) were stranded in schools for the blind in Delhi, and feeling with anxiety and panic in absence of teachers. Shortly, the room for vision rehabilitation clinic was set-up for telefacilities. The intended services were explained while disseminating the mobile numbers. A semi-structured questionnaire consisting of closed and open-ended was developed to record COVID-19 knowledge and concerns. Inductive content analysis was used to report the qualitative information. Results: As of June 30, 2020, a total of 492 clients contacted the team, with maximum from Delhi (41.5%), and predominantly males (78.8%). Around 80.3% of callers were VCS with age range of 11 to 30 years. The two most frequently encountered health needs were itching in eyes (36.1%) and headache (29%). Television news was the most used medium among callers to get COVID-19 information. Cough is a less frequently known mode of transmission (28%), similarly handwashing as a less known for prevention (17.2%). Eight concerns were recorded based on qualitative data analysis. Conclusion: Telerehabilitation provides valuable insights and has the potential to address various concerns, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear among VCS during the pandemic.

KW  - Neovascular glaucoma

KW  - retinal ischemia
AB  - Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a sight-threatening secondary glaucoma characterized by appearance of new vessels over the iris and proliferation of fibrovascular tissue in the anterior chamber angle. Retinal ischemia is the common driving factor and common causes are central retinal vein occlusion, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and ocular ischemic syndrome. The current rise in the prevalence of NVG is partly related to increase in people with diabetes. A high index of suspicion and a thorough anterior segment evaluation to identify the early new vessels on the iris surface or angle are essential for early diagnosis of NVG. With newer imaging modalities such as the optical coherence tomography angiography and newer treatment options such as the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, it is possible to detect retinal ischemia early, tailor appropriate treatment, monitor disease progression, and treatment response. The management strategies are aimed at reducing the posterior segment ischemia, reduce the neovascular drive, and control the elevated intraocular pressure. This review summarizes the causes, pathogenesis, and differential diagnoses of NVG, and the management guidelines. We also propose a treatment algorithm of neovascular glaucoma.

AB  - Purpose of review The study was undertaken to assess the current importance of clinical examination of the optic nerve head (ONH) in glaucoma management. Recent findings ONH changes in glaucoma are easily assessed with good specificity on examination, whereas imaging has not been able to identify pallor of the neuroretinal rim (NRR), disc hemorrhages, or vascular signs of acquired cupping. Glaucomatous neuropathy in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) has extensive databases on imaging machines, however, other glaucomas such as primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG), congenital, and secondary glaucomas have been reported to have a significantly different ONH morphology. Clinical evaluation with knowledge of the underlying cause of glaucoma allows easy diagnosis of any abnormality, whereas the absence of an imaging database in such eyes makes diagnosis difficult on optical coherence tomography (OCT) and so forth. In eyes with congenital anomalies and dysplastic discs, clinical examination and history provide better identification of glaucomatous damage. Staging of glaucoma on ONH examination when perimetry is unreliable provides a means of determining the amount of damage and appropriate reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP). Clinical examination of the ONH is very relevant for screening, diagnosis, staging, and management of all glaucomas, and is irreplaceable in detecting nonglaucomatous causes of ONH cupping and visual field defects similar to those in glaucoma.

AB  - Introduction: Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an astrocytopathy with a predilection for the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brainstem. In this ambispective study, we evaluate clinical characteristics, responses to therapy, and disability outcomes in patients with NMOSD. Methods: Patients diagnosed as NMOSD and following up for at least 1 year at a tertiary care center in India were recruited. Patient data were collected ambispectively from January 2012 until December 2018. Results: A total of 106 patients (29M/77F) with NMOSD were evaluated. The mean age of onset was 29 (+/- 11.6) years. About 77 patients (72.64%) were positive for the AQP4 antibody. Age of onset was higher for those presenting with an opticospinal syndrome (34.2 years) as compared to either isolated longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) (30 years) or optic neuritis (ON) (25.3 years). The most common syndrome at onset was LETM in 57 patients (53.77%) followed by ON in 31 patients (29.24%). Azathioprine was the most common immunotherapy (83.96%) prescribed followed by rituximab (7.54%) and mycophenolate mofetil (1.88%). There was a significant decrease in the number of relapses post-azathioprine (P < 0.001). Out of 67 patients with ON, 21 (31.34%) had complete recovery while 17 (25.37%) patients had a severe deficit at a 3-month follow-up. Out of 92 patients with a motor deficit, 49 (53.26%) patients had a partial motor deficit at a 6-month follow-up. The severe visual deficit at baseline and female gender predicted poor visual and motor recovery, respectively. Conclusion: This is the largest descriptive study on patients with NMOSD from India. Relapse rates were similar irrespective of the clinical presentation, age, gender, and disease course. Treatment with immunosuppressive treatment significantly affected the disease course.

AB  - tasks that require binocular vision and stereopsis, such as ophthalmic surgery in a simulated environment. Methods: Thirty-nine ophthalmic residents with best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20 or better OU, with normal binocular vision and stereopsis, were recruited for the study. Anisometropia was induced using spherical and cylindrical trial lenses from +1D to +5D in a trial frame. The residents performed an anterior chamber navigation exercise on the EYESi simulator and the surgical score at baseline and for each level of induced anisometropia was noted. Near stereopsis was assessed by the Randot test and TNO test at baseline and for each level of induced anisometropia. Results: Stereoacuity on the Randot test and TNO test were 30 (95% CI, 25.9-34.1) and 44.4 (95% CI, 28.5-60.3) arcseconds, respectively which reduced to 65.5 (95% CI, 48.7-82.3) and 75.9 (95% CI, 15.5-136.3) arcseconds at anisometropia of +1D Sph (P < 0.001) and 380 (95% CI, 309.9-450.1) and 1922.1 (95% CI, 1582.5-2261.7) arcseconds for +5D Sph, respectively for the two tests, (P < 0.001). The corresponding surgical score reduced from 93.8 (95% CI, 91.1-96.7) to 87.5 (95% CI, 79.295.8, P < 0.001) for 1 DSph and 55.97 (95% CI, 38.3-73.7, P < 0.001) for 5DSph. There was a strong negative correlation between stereopsis scores and surgical task scores (Spearman's rho-0.86, P value <0.001) Similar changes were seen for anisometropia induced with cylindrical powers. Conclusion: Induced anisometropia is associated with a significant diminution in surgical task scores in a simulated environment and this is correlated with the deterioration in stereoacuity. Assessment of stereopsis may be included as a regular part of the screening procedure for ophthalmic trainee residents.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe central cholinergic neuronal loss, gradually contributing to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, resulting in the brain's cell death at the later stages of AD. Although the etiology of AD is not well understood, however, several factors such as oxidative stress, deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides to form A beta plaques, intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and low level of acetylcholine are thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of AD. There is practically no drug for AD treatment that can address the basic factors responsible for the neurodegeneration and slow down the disease progression. The currently available therapies for AD in the market focus on providing only symptomatic relief without addressing the aforesaid basic factors responsible for the neurodegeneration. Ferulic acid (FA) is a phenol derivative from natural sources and serves as a potential pharmacophore that exerts multiple pharmacological properties such as antioxidant, neuroprotection, A beta aggregation modulation, and anti-inflammatory. Several FA based hybrid analogs are under investigation as a multi-target directed ligand (MTDLs) to develop novel hybrid compounds for the treatment of AD. In the present review article, we are focused on the critical pathogenic factors responsible for the onset of AD followed by the developments of FA pharmacophore-based hybrids compounds as a novel multifunctional therapeutic agent to address the limitations associated with available treatment for AD. The rationale behind the development of these compounds and their pharmacological activities in particular to their ChE inhibition (ChEI), neuroprotection, antioxidant property, A beta aggregation modulation, and metal chelation ability, are discussed in detail. We have also discussed the discovery of caffeic and cinnamic acids based MTDLs for AD. This review paper provides an in-depth insight into the research progress and current status of these novel therapeutics in AD and prospects for developing a druggable molecule with desired pharmacological affinity and reduced toxicity for the management of AD.

AB  - Lower level of testosterone in men is related to major risks of cardiovascular diseases. This risk may increase due to the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). The mPTP is also regulated by ischemic preconditioning (IPC) and a membrane protein known as caveolin. The cardioprotective effect of IPC is the most effective methodologies used in testosterone deficiency. Daidzein (DDZ) a caveolin inhibitor shows cardioprotective action. The experiment has been designed to evaluate the pretreated DDZ effect in IPC-mediated cardioprotective action in orchidectomy (OCZ)-challenged rat heart. The experiment was designed on male Wistar rats with/without OCZ. The level of testosterone is decreased by OCZ which reduces general body growth. Isolated heart from normal and OCZ rat was tied up on Langendorff's perfused apparatus and followed by ischemic reperfusion (IR) and IPC cycle. To investigate the cardioprotective effect of DDZ in heart with testosterone deficiency, a total of nine groups, each consisting of six rats (n = 6) were as follows: Sham, IR, IPC, IPC + OCZ, IPC + DDZ, IPC + OCZ + DDZ, IPC + sodium nitrite, IPC + OCZ + sodium nitrite, IPC + OCZ + DDZ + sodium nitrite. Hemodynamic parameters, cellular injury (infarct size, LDH, CKMB and cardiac troponin-T), oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, integrity and immunoblot analysis were assessed for each group. The experimental data showed that DDZ potentiated IPC-mediated increase in the heart rate, left ventricular diastolic pressure, coronary flow; + dp/dt(max), and - dp/dt(max). The pretreated DDZ decreases the action of LDH and CKMB, myocyte size, cardiac collagen content, infarct size and ventricular fibrillation and attenuation in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in OCZ-challenged rat heart in all sets of experiments. Sodium nitrite, a producer of nitric oxide (NO), enhanced potentiating effects of DDZ on IPC-mediated cardioprotection in OCZ-challenged rats. These observations show that the downregulation of caveolin through impaired opening of mPTP during reperfusion and caveolin might be a potential adjuvant to IPC against cardiac injury in OCZ-challenged rats.

AB  - At birth, the eye is moderately hypermetropic but achieves emmetropia by the age of 5?6 years in a large majority (Chakraborty et al., 2020; Gwiazda et al., 1993). The process of emmetropization is attributed to changes in several components of the eye structure, predominantly cornea, crystalline lens and axial length. Emmetropization is possible only when there is a fine balance between the optical power of the eye and its focal length. The former is determined by the combined dioptric power of the cornea and crystalline lens and the latter by the axial length of the eyeball. Increase in axial length has been shown to be the most important factor for reaching emmetropia. The main determinant of this increase is reported to be expansion of the vitreous chamber (Mutti et al., 2005; Larsen, 1971). Growth of the vitreous body during postnatal development is well established. However, what initiates vitreous chamber expansion and what brings about its precise arrest at the point of emmetropization are aspects that have not been explored and remain an enigma. It is hypothesized herein that vitreous chamber expansion and resultant early increase in axial length that precisely stops at the point of emmetropia, occurs secondary to postnatal structural and conformational changes within the vitreous collagen and internal limiting membrane (ILM) collagen and molecular interactions between these two structures.

AB  - Background: Cervicogenic headache is a distinct type of headache described in 1980s by Sjaastad, a Norwegian neurologist. It is a not so uncommon headache, which is usually under-diagnosed resulting in suboptimal quality-of-life.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to review the current recommendations on diagnosis and management of cervicogenic headache.
   Methods and Material: A PubMed search was done for the recent articles on 'cervicogenic headache' published in English literature with the aim of recognizing the current perspectives on cervicogenic headache.
   Results: The diagnosis of cervicogenic headache is based on clinical criteria mentioned by the International Headache Society (IHS) and Cervicogenic Headache International Study Group (CHISG). Cervical nerve block may confirm the nociceptive source in majority of cases and is included in CHISG criteria. Non-invasive diagnostic methods like echogenicity of muscles, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) are proposed by some authors for avoiding complications associated with blocks. Mainstay of management is physical therapy. Surgical interventions for cervical degenerative disease may relief an associated headache but such interventions are not performed solely for cervicogenic headache.
   Conclusion: Headaches with a cervical spine nociceptive source are increasingly being recognized. Current diagnostic criteria and management options are reviewed here.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) markers have not been widely studied in relation to hematoma volume and growth in hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The objectives to assess the relationship of white matter hyperintense lesions (WMHL), microbleeds (MBs), and cortical siderosis (CSS) with hematoma volume, hematoma expansion (HE), and 3 months outcome in patients with hypertensive ICH. Methods: All consecutive acute hypertensive supratentorial ICH presenting to the emergency were prospectively recruited. Baseline and 24 hours computed tomography (CT) to assess hematoma volume and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for CSVD markers were performed in all subjects. WMHL (graded using Fazekas's scale), MBs, and CSS were assessed and compared with baseline variables and outcomes. All the images were assessed by an experienced stroke neurologist/neuroradiologist. Results: One hundred and fifty-seven patients were screened and 60 were included. Mean age was 54.08 +/- 11.57 years and 47 (78%) were males. Of 60, 19 (28.1%) had HE, 31 (51.6%) had major bleed (>30 ml), and 28 (47.46%) had poor 3 month outcome (mRS 4-6). On univariate analysis, high grade WMHL was associated with greater HE [odds ratio (OR): 2.65, confidence interval (CI) 1.48-4.72, P = 0.001), greater proportion with volume >30 ml (OR: 7.16, CI: 1.09-47.13, P = 0.001) and poor outcome (OR: 2.1, CI: 0.05-3.27, P = 0.001). MBs were associated with poor outcome (P = 0.029) but not with HE/volume. CSS was related to HE (P = 0.031), a large volume bleed (P = 0.023), and poor outcome (P = 0.021). On multivariate model, only WMHL independently predicted HE (P = 0.034), greater proportion with bleed volume >30 ml (P = 0.041), and poor outcome (P = 0.042). Conclusions: WMHL in MRI serves as a predictor of hematoma expansion, a large volume bleed, and poor outcome in hypertensive ICH and may be incorporated into existing prediction models.

AB  - Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a disabling and refractory symptom of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Interleaved stimulation (ILS) is a novel paradigm which may benefit axial symptoms of PD. Objectives: To assess the effect of ILS on FOG in patients unresponsive to conventional subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. Methods: 19 PD patients receiving subthalamic stimulation and experiencing FOG at both conventional (130-150Hz) and low frequency (60Hz) stimulation were given ILS.The primary outcome measure was the UPDRS part III gait score (item 29) at 3 months after ILS. A subset of patients was tested with the stand-walk-sit (SWS) test, 30 min after ILS. Results: The mean UPDRS part III gait score (baseline: 1.8 +/- 0.6) improved at 30 min (1.1 +/- 0.8, P = 0.017) and remained improved at 3 months (1.2 +/- 0.8, P = 0.048). FOG episodes reduced during SWS test (P = 0.041). Conclusions: ILS of STN through two adjacent contacts provided significant short-term beneficial effects on FOG.

AB  - The aim of this review was to determine the role of surgery in treating hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) causing isolated central precocious puberty (CPP). Literature review was done according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Patients with isolated CPP due to HH, managed with surgical resection, were included. We found 33 studies, reporting 103 patients (76 pedunculated, 27 sessile). Patients were considered "cured" if the symptoms of PP had regressed and the hormone profile had normalized after surgery. Indications for surgery included hamartoma deemed surgically resectable (n-12), for the purpose of tissue diagnosis (n-3), partial response/failure of preoperative therapy (n-9), and unable to afford/to avoid long-term medical therapy (n-7). The extent of resection was total (TR) (n-39), near total/subtotal (NTR/STR) (n-20), partial (PR) (n-35), or unspecified (n-9). On follow-up (range: 3 months-16 years), 73.6% (56/76) of patients with pedunculated HH were cured, while 17.1% (13/76) had partial relief. Only 3/27 (11.1%) of patients with sessile HH were cured. All patients with a pedunculated hamartoma who underwent TR (n=36) improved, with 88.88% cured of the symptoms. Surgery had no effect in 17/23 (73.9%) patients with sessile HH who underwent PR. Psychological symptoms improved in 10/11 patients. There was no mortality. Permanent complications, in the form of 3rd nerve palsy, occurred in 3.7% (2/54) of the patients. To conclude, in the current era of availability of GnRH analogs, surgical resection in a subset of patients may be acceptable especially for small pedunculated hamartomas.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, dermatologists reported an array of different cutaneous manifestations of the disease. It is challenging to discriminate COVID-19-related cutaneous manifestations from other closely resembling skin lesions. The aim of this study was to generate and evaluate a novel CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) ensemble architecture for detection of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from clinical images. An ensemble model of three different CNN-based algorithms was trained with clinical images of skin lesions from confirmed COVID-19 positive patients, healthy controls as well as 18 other common skin conditions, which included close mimics of COVID-19 skin lesions such as urticaria, varicella, pityriasis rosea, herpes zoster, bullous pemphigoid and psoriasis. The multi-class model demonstrated an overall top-1 accuracy of 86.7% for all 20 diseases. The sensitivity and specificity of COVID-19-rash detection were found to be 84.2 +/- 5.1% and 99.5 +/- 0.2%, respectively. The positive predictive value, NPV and area under curve values for COVID-19-rash were 88.0 +/- 5.6%, 99.4 +/- 0.2% and 0.97 +/- 0.25, respectively. The binary classifier had a mean sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76.81 +/- 6.25%, 99.77 +/- 0.14% and 98.91 +/- 0.17%, respectively for COVID-19 rash. The model was robust in detection of all skin lesions on both white and skin of color, although only a few images of COVID-19-associated skin lesions from skin of color were available. To our best knowledge, this is the first machine learning-based study for automated detection of COVID-19 based on skin images and may provide a useful decision support tool for physicians to optimize contact-free COVID-19 triage, differential diagnosis of skin lesions and patient care.

TI  - A deficiency of Dec2 triggers periodontal inflammation and pyroptosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERIODONTAL RESEARCH
KW  - Dec2
KW  - P. gingivalis
KW  - periodontal inflammation
KW  - Pyroptosis
AB  - Background and Objectives: Periodontal pathogens initiate various diseases and induce inflammatory host responses. The activation of inflammasomes triggers caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1 beta-mediated pyroptosis via gasdermin D (GSDMD). Differentiated embryo chondrocyte 2 (Dec2) is a transcription repressor that controls the expression of genes involved in innate immune and inflammatory responses. However, the effects of Dec2 on inflammasome-induced pyroptosis in periodontal tissues remain elusive. This study aimed to characterize the activation of Dec2 inflammasomes that contribute to P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pyroptosis and its functional and regulatory importance in periodontal inflammation.
   Materials and Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs) were stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS in vitro. An experimental periodontitis mouse model (wild-type (WT) and Dec2KO) was established to profile periodontal pyroptosis.
   Results: The results demonstrate that P. gingivalis LPS activates caspase-1, caspase-11, and NF-kappa B in HGFs and in HPDLFs. siRNA knockdown of Dec2 stimulated the induction and further upregulated LPS-induced pyroptosis in HGFs and HPDLFs, resulting in the release of IL-1 beta. Further, a deficiency of Dec2 alleviated periodontal pyroptosis via the transcriptional induction of GSDMD. In addition, P. gingivalis-induced IL-1 beta expression and Dec2-deficient mice subsequently increased the inflammatory effect of P. gingivalis in HGFs and in HPDLFs, confirming the importance of Dec2 in the activation of inflammasomes and the regulation of pyroptosis.
   Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that Dec2 alleviates periodontal pyroptosis by regulating the expression of NF-kappa B, caspase-1 and GSDMD, suggesting that Dec2 is a crucial component of inflammasome activation and subsequent pyroptosis.

AB  - Automated classification of significant prostate cancer (PCa) using MRI plays a potential role in assisting in clinical decision-making. Multiparametric MRI using a machine-aided approach is a better step to improve the overall accuracy of diagnosis of PCa. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a framework for differentiating Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) grades (grade 2 to grade 5) of PCa using texture features and machine learning (ML) methods with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The study cohort included an MRI dataset of 59 patients with clinically proven PCa. Regions of interest (ROIs) for a total of 435 lesions were delineated from the segmented peripheral zones of DWI and ADC. Six texture methods comprising 98 texture features in total (49 each of DWI and ADC) were extracted from lesion ROIs. Random forest (RF) and correlation-based feature selection methods were applied on feature vectors to select the best features for classification. Two ML classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbour, were used and validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed framework achieved high diagnostic performance with a sensitivity of 85.25% +/- 3.84%, specificity of 95.71% +/- 1.96%, accuracy of 84.90% +/- 3.37% and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.98 for PI-RADS v2 grades (2 to 5) classification using the RF feature selection method and Gaussian SVM classifier with combined features of DWI + ADC. The proposed computer-assisted framework can distinguish between PCa lesions with different aggressiveness based on PI-RADS v2 standards using texture analysis to improve the efficiency of PCa diagnostic performance.

AB  - Epilepsy treatment is challenging because of multiple impediments like lack of efficacy of monotherapy, adverse drug reactions, and different comorbidities. Add-on therapy to first-line antiepileptics may be the option to overcome therapeutic hurdles. The present randomized, double-blind, add-on placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of add-on melatonin in the treatment of generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizure in adults. The control group (n = 52) received add-on placebo, and the test group (n = 52) received add-on melatonin (3 mg/day) with valproate (20 mg/kg in two divided doses). Clinical evaluation of seizure frequency, Chalfont-National Hospital seizure severity scale (NHS3), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), quality of life in epilepsy inventory, Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS), and biochemical estimation of serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and glutathione reductase were done at baseline and compared with follow-up at 8 weeks. Among 104 patients randomized [mean (SD) age of 27.6 (11.5); 84 (80.8%) male], 88 (84.6%) completed the trial. The responder rate and seizure-free rate in the test group were significantly (p = 0.006 and 0.034) higher than the control group. There was a significantly higher reduction in the frequency of seizures (p = 0.016) and NHS3 (-2.39; 95%CI: -4.56 to -0.21; p = 0.032) in the test group compared to the control group. Similarly, improvement in PSQI (-1.40; 95%CI: -2.64 to -0.15; p = 0.029) was significantly better in the test group. There was no significant difference in the change in ESS (p = 0.621) and quality of life scoring (p = 0.456) between the study groups. The decrease in serum NSE was significantly higher with the test group compared to the control group (-2.01; 95% CI: -3.74 to -0.27; p = 0.024). Add-on melatonin increased serum glutathione reductase significantly (p = 0.038), but there was no significant difference between the groups (p = 0.685). Add-on melatonin with valproate for generalized epilepsy with generalized onset motor seizures in adults can achieve a significantly better clinical outcome by reducing the seizure frequency, severity and attaining a better seizure-free rate in comparison to the control group.

AB  - The aim of the study was to develop a novel automated setup for bone grinding to limit the temperature to below 43 degrees C. The feasibility of using ultrasonic actuation during bone osteotomy was explored with different machining variables, such as rotational speed, feed rate and ultrasonic frequency, in terms of the criterion variable (i.e., temperature). A thermal dose model based on the CEM43 degrees C and the Arrhenius model was developed for the prediction of tissue damage during bone grinding. CEM43 degrees C is a normalizing method to convert the time-temperature relationship into an equivalent number of minutes at 43 degrees C. For every degree rise in temperature above 43 degrees C, the cell viability significantly increased. The temperature generated during bone grinding was measured with an infrared thermography technique. The increase in temperature above threshold levels of 43 degrees C and 47 degrees C may harm the bone tissues and cause thermogenesis and osteonecrosis, respectively. A finite-element simulation was conducted to visualise the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature on the bone surface after bone grinding. Furthermore, simulation results were used to measure the depth of thermogenesis and osteonecrosis at the grinding site. Evaluation of the optimised set of bone grinding process parameters was supported with analysis of variance at the 95% confidence level.

AB  - Healing of diabetic wounds present a big challenge due to insufficient vascular supply and bacterial infection. We developed chitosan based biodegradable polymeric hydrogel containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as antimicrobial agent and calcium alginate nanoparticles (Ca-AlgNps) as hemostatic agent to address this problem. The prepared Chitosan/Ca-AlgNps/AgNPs hydrogel showed broad spectrum antimicrobial properties against both Gram negative (E. coli, P. aeruginosa) and Gram positive (B. subtilis, S. aureus) bacteria. Taken into account the blood as a vital material containing various circulatory fibrocytes, growth factors, cytokines, platelets and macrophages etc., we incorporated the fresh blood of the same animal to the prepared Chitosan/Ca-Alg Nps/AgNPs hydrogel. In-vivo animal studies of Chitosan/Ca-AlgNps/AgNPs hydrogel and blood mixed Chitosan/Ca-AlgNps/ AgNPs hydrogel exhibit 83.5 +/- 4.4% and 99.8 +/- 2.0% closure of wound respectively, on day 15 as compared to 41.5 +/- 3.2% in diabetic control and 60.3 +/- 2.2% in commercially available wound healing cream, Silverex Heal. The incorporation of fresh blood to the prepared hydrogel has advantage in terms of supplying growth factors, platelets, circulatory fibrocytes and cytokines which further enhanced the wound healing mechanism in diabetic rats. This work opens a novel idea to formulate hydrogels based dressings for diabetic wound healing.

AB  - Decline in new HIV infections in the Asia-Pacific region (APAC) continues to be slow, emphasising the importance of scaling up new HIV prevention strategies, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). To help inform PrEP rollout in APAC, we conducted a rapid review of published literature on PubMed from 2015 to 2020, to assess feasibility, implementation strategies, cost-effectiveness, and availability of national policies and guidelines; for the latter, we also did an expanded Internet search. This review focussed on nine countries contributing >95% of new infections in this region. A total of 36 PrEP-related studies conducted among men who have sex with men, female sex workers, and transgender women were included, of which 29 were quantitative, six were qualitative and one was a mixed-method study. Most of the studies have addressed the availability and acceptability of PrEP, whereas cost-effectiveness of any approach was assessed by limited studies. Limited published information was available about national PrEP policies and guidelines; of the selected nine countries, five have adopted the recommended World Health Organization PrEP policy of which four have integrated it in their national HIV response. HIV risk perception concerns about safety, side-effects, stigma, and affordability were major challenges to PrEP acceptance. Community-based implementation has the potential to address these. Limited evidence suggested merging PrEP implementation with ongoing targeted intervention and treatment programs could be a cost-effective approach. To stem the epidemic, newer effective prevention strategies, like PrEP, should be urgently adopted within the context of combination HIV prevention approaches.

TI  - Does the Retromandibular Transparotid Approach Provide Quicker Access to Fracture of Mandibular Subcondyle Compared With the Retromandibular Transmasseteric Anterior Parotid Approach?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - CONDYLAR FRACTURES
KW  - SURGICAL-TREATMENT
KW  - EXPERIENCE
AB  - Purpose: Limited studies are available in the literature comparing various surgical approaches for the management of condylar fractures, and those comparing different types of retromandibular approaches are even fewer in number. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of 2 variants of the retromandibular approach?retromandibular transmasseteric anterior parotid (RMTMAP) and retromandibular transparotid (RMTP) in terms of exposure time, blood loss, facial nerve palsy, sialoceles or parotid fistula formation, infection, and esthetics of scar tissue.
   Patients and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was designed in patients with mandibular subcondylar fractures requiring operative intervention. Patients were randomized into 2 groups based on a computer-generated randomization table. Group A included 37 cases, treated with the RMTMAP approach, and group B included 38 cases treated with the RMTP approach. The primary outcome variable was exposure time. Secondary outcome variables were blood loss during exposure, complications like facial nerve palsy, sialocele formation, surgical site infection, and scar esthetics. All patients were followed for 3 months. Collected data were analyzed using the chi(2) and analysis of variance tests.
   Results: The mean exposure time for fractures treated with the RMTMAP approach and RMTP approach was 21.08 +/- 9.18 and 13.57 +/- 6.09, respectively (P < .05). The mean blood loss for RMTMAP and RMTP approach was 11.75 +/- 5.11 and 9.9 +/- 3.77 mL, respectively (P = .078). No facial nerve injury was seen in patients treated with the RMTMAP approach, whereas 3 (7.8%) patients in the RMTP group had transient facial nerve injury (P = .08).
   Conclusions: This study concludes that the RMTP approach provides quicker access to the condyle as compared with the RMTMAP approach. However, the incidence of transient facial nerve injury was more in the RMTP approach. Except for reduced blood loss in the RMTP approach, all other parameters were comparable in both the approaches.

TI  - Pulmonary infections after renal transplantation: a prospective study from a tropical country
T2  - TRANSPLANT INTERNATIONAL
KW  - pulmonary infections
KW  - renal transplantation
AB  - Pulmonary infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. In a prospective study, we characterized their epidemiology in a tropical country with high infectious disease burden. Adult renal transplant recipients presenting with pulmonary infections from 2015 to 2017 were evaluated using a specific diagnostic algorithm. 102 pulmonary infections occurred in 88 patients. 32.3% infections presented in the first year, 31.4% between 1 and 5, and 36.3% beyond 5 years after transplantation. Microbiological diagnosis was established in 69.6%, and 102 microorganisms were identified. Bacterial infection (29.4%) was most common followed by tuberculosis (23.5%), fungal (20.6%), Pneumocystis jiroveci (10.8%), viral (8.8%), and nocardial (6.9%) infections. Tuberculosis(TB) and bacterial infections presented throughout the post-transplant period, while Pneumocystis (72.7%), cytomegalovirus (87.5%) and nocardia (85.7%) predominantly presented after >12 months. Fungal infections had a bimodal presentation, between 2 and 6 months (33.3%) and after 12 months (66.7%). Four patients had multi-drug resistant(MDR) TB. In 16.7% cases, plain radiograph was normal and infection was diagnosed by a computed tomography imaging. Mortality due to pulmonary infections was 22.7%. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, use of ATG (HR-2.39, 95% CI: 1.20-4.78, P = 0.013), fungal infection (HR-2.14, 95% CI: 1.19-3.84, P = 0.011) and need for mechanical ventilation (9.68, 95% CI: 1.34-69.82, P = 0.024) were significant predictors of mortality in our patients. To conclude, community-acquired and endemic pulmonary infections predominate with no specific timeline and opportunistic infections usually present late. Nocardiosis and MDR-TB are emerging challenges.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of wound infiltration with ropivacaine alone or with adjuvants clonidine or dexamethasone for postoperative pain in temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) surgery.
   Materials and Methods: The investigators implemented a randomized controlled trial with 3 parallel groups, among the patients of bilateral TMJA visiting the maxillofacial surgery unit between March 12, 2015 and February 5, 2017. At the completion of surgery, wound infiltration was done with 0.25% of ropivacaine (R group), 0.25% of ropivacaine with 0.5 mcg/kg of clonidine (RC group), 0.25% of ropivacaine with 0.1 mg/kg of dexamethasone (RD group), and 0.2 mg/kg of drug volume on each side. The primary outcome variables were total opioid consumption (fentanyl in micrograms/kilogram) and visual analog scale for pain at rest and movement for 24 hours after surgery. The secondary outcome variables were time (minutes) to first rescue analgesic requirement and patient satisfaction scores. The patients, surgeons, and anesthesiologists collecting the data were blinded to the group allocation. Continuous and qualitative data were summarized using mean (standard deviation) and frequency distribution, respectively.
   Results: About 45 patients were randomized into 3 equal groups. Mean age of the sample was 17.6 +/- 8.04 years (males = 24 [53%]; females = 21 [47%]). Surgery for TMJA included gap arthroplasty (n = 17), interpositional arthroplasty (n = 24), and total TMJ replacement (n = 4). Total fentanyl (micrograms) consumption during 24 hours was comparable between all the 3 groups and statistically not significant (P = .40). The pain scores (visual analog scale at rest and movement) were comparable at all time points. No significant difference was noted for time to first rescue analgesic requirement (P = .31). Patient satisfaction was higher in RC group as compared with R group (P = .009). No adverse effects were noted in any group.
   Conclusions: Within the confines of the sample size and the absence of power calculation, the study implies that wound infiltration with ropivacaine was as efficacious as when mixed with adjuvants, either clonidine or dexamethasone, for control of postoperative pain for 24 hours.

AB  - Penetrating keratoplasty is often required in microbial keratitis not responding to the standard treatments available or the development of complications like corneal perforation. Performing keratoplasty in microbial keratitis has several challenges, the major ones being the availability of donor corneal tissue and the poor success of the corneal graft performed in such a setting. For overcoming these challenges, several alternatives to keratoplasty have been described. Broadly, these options could be categorized into autologous tissues such as conjunctival and tenon tissue, synthetic products like tissue adhesives and therapeutic contact lenses, or biological tissues like amniotic membrane graft. These alternative modalities are not universal. They have their specific indications in microbial keratitis. Most of these alternatives are useful only for small corneal perforations. While autologous tissues are cost-effective and readily available, lack of tectonic support is a significant limitation. Tissue adhesives are excellent alternatives in terms of tectonic support, but surface irregularity and tissue reaction are their potential limitations. The amniotic membrane is useful for small corneal perforations, but availability, cost, and poor tectonic support restrict its use. Herein, we discuss these various alternatives to keratoplasty in microbial keratitis, their indications, advantages, disadvantages, and the various techniques of performing these procedures.

AB  - Intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) enables real-time visualization of ocular structures during surgery and enhances our understanding of intraoperative dynamics. iOCT aids in decision-making during various anterior segment surgeries, and its efficacy and feasibility in anterior lamellar keratoplasty and endothelial keratoplasty is well established. The landmark DISCOVER study observed that iOCT altered the surgeon decision in 38% of cases undergoing lamellar keratoplasty and provided guidance regarding the need for secondary surgical intervention. iOCT also finds an application in phacoemulsification wherein it helps to assess corneal incisions, intralenticular pressure, and posterior capsule integrity during nuclear emulsification. iOCT aids in the visualization of angle structures during placement of tubes and shunts in glaucoma surgeries and allows precise creation of partial thickness scleral flaps. In addition, iOCT helps in establishing a diagnosis, as well as provide intraoperative guidance, in pediatric patients who are not cooperative for examination. The role of iOCT in refractive surgeries and ocular surface disorders is increasingly being evaluated. The limitations of present-day iOCT systems are related to instrument compatibility, automated tracking of the surgical field, and on-table volumetric analysis of the real-time images. Technological advances may facilitate complete integration of OCT in the surgical microscopes for all surgical procedures.

AB  - Mycoplasma hominis, a commensal of the genital tract, is a potential underestimated pathogen causing both genitourinary and extragenital infections including neonatal infections. Septic arthritis, prosthetic joint infection, central nervous system (CNS) infections, infective endocarditis and abscess formation are common extragenital infections associated mainly with immunocompromised patients. Mycoplasma hominis lipoproteins play an important role in pathogenicity and directly interact with the host immune system. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the mainstay of diagnosis. Increasing resistance to tetracyclines and quinolones which are used for treatment, is a matter of global concern. We reviewed PubMed literature and Google search engine on the recent developments of association of Mycoplasma hominis with various diseases, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment.

The primary objective was a comparison of outcomes in terms of bone healing, maximal incisal opening (MIO), and occlusion, and the secondary objective was to review complications. A total of 77 pediatric patients (age <12 years) were managed with closed treatment and 23 with ORIF. In all, 62 patients were found with a single fracture (22 patients with parasymphysis fracture and 21 with condyle fracture, followed by symphysis, angle, and body fracture) and 38 patients with more than one fracture, with symphysis and bilateral condyle fracture being the most common. Bone healing was observed in all the patients. Mean MIO was 26.9 +/- 2.8 mm and 29.3 +/- 1.7 mm in the closed and ORIF group, respectively, and the difference was statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.5). One patient (1.3%) had deranged occlusion, and mobility was observed in one patient (1.3%) in the closed treatment group. Infection and nerve paresthesia were not seen in any patient at follow-up. Although closed treatment is preferred, as it preserves the soft tissue and periosteum, a displaced mandible fracture especially with co-existing condylar fracture should be treated by ORIF.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common carcinoma in women worldwide. The present case-control study was aimed to examine the association of BCL-2 (-938C> A), BAX (-248G > A), and HER2 (I655V i.e. A > G) polymorphisms with breast cancer risk in Indian population. This study enrolled 117 breast cancer cases and 104 controls. BCL-2 (-938C > A), BAX (-248G > A), and HER2 Ile655Val polymorphisms were screened by PCR-RFLP method. There was no significance difference in the allelic and genotype frequency of the BCL-2 (-938C > A) and BAX (-248G > A) polymorphisms between cases and controls. In relation to HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism, the statistical analysis of observed genotypic frequencies showed significant association (p-0.0059). Compared to Ile/Ile (A/A) genotype, frequency of Ile/Val (A/G) genotype was significantly higher among cases than in control group and observed to increase the breast cancer risk (OR, 2.43; 95%CI, 1.32-4.46; p-0.004). The frequency of Val (G) allele was significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (6.83% vs 2.88%, resp.). Compared to Ile (A) allele, significant increase in the risk of breast cancer was observed with Val (G) allele (OR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.35-3.63; p-0.0016). We observed significant association between HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism and breast cancer risk under the dominant (OR. 2.52; 95% CI: 1.41-4.51; p-0.001) and codominant (OR, 2.24; 95% CI: 1.23-4.09; p-0.008) model. In our study, BCL-2 (-938C > A) and BAX (-248G > A) polymorphism were not found to be associated with breast cancer risk. This present study for the first time shows significant association of HER2 Ile655Val polymorphism with risk of breast cancer in Indian population. Therefore, we suggest that each population need to evaluate its own genetic profile for breast cancer risk that may be helpful for better understanding the racial and geographic differences reported for breast cancer incidence and mortality.

AB  - Purpose First, to investigate the added diagnostic value of chest computed tomography (CT) for evaluating COVID-19 in symptomatic children by comparing chest CT findings with chest radiographic findings, and second, to identify the imaging signs and patterns on CT associated with COVID-19 pneumonia in children.
   Materials and Methods From March 2020 to December 2020, 56 consecutive children (33 males and 23 girls; mean age +/- SD, 14.8 +/- 5.0 years; range, 9 months-18 years) with mild to moderate symptom and laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (based on Centers for Disease Control criteria) underwent both chest radiography and chest CT on the same day within the first 2 days of initial presentation to the hospital. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated chest radiographs and chest CT studies for thoracic abnormalities. The findings from chest radiography and chest CT were compared to evaluate the added diagnostic value of chest CT for affecting patient management. Interobserver agreement was measured with Cohen's kappa statistics.
   Results Eleven (19.6%) of 56 patients had abnormal chest radiographic findings, including ground-glass opacity (GGO) in 5/11 (45.4%) and combined GGO and consolidation in 6/11 (54.5%). On chest CT, 26 (46.4%) of 56 patients had abnormal CT findings, including combined GGO and consolidation in 19/26 (73.1%), GGO in 6/26 (23.1%), and consolidation in 1/26 (3.8%). Chest CT detected all thoracic abnormalities seen on chest radiography in 11/26 (42.3%) cases. In 15/26 (57.7%), chest CT detected lung abnormalities that were not observed on chest radiography, which included GGO and consolidation in 9/15 (60%), GGO in 5/15 (33.3%), and consolidation in 1/15 (6.6%) cases. These additional CT findings did not affect patient management. In addition, chest CT detected radiological signs and patterns, including the halo sign, reversed halo sign, crazy paving pattern, and tree-in-bud pattern. There was almost perfect interobserver agreement between the two reviewers for detecting findings on both chest radiographs (kappa, 0.89, p = .001) and chest CT (kappa, 0.96, p = .001) studies.
   Conclusion Chest CT detected lung abnormalities, including GGO and/or consolidation, that were not observed on chest radiography in more than half of symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, these additional CT findings did not affect patient management. Therefore, CT is not clinically indicated for the initial evaluation of mild to moderately symptomatic pediatric patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

AB  - Background: Adaptive or memory natural killer (NK) cells with epigenetic imprints similar to memory T cells have been shown to develop in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with upregulation of activating receptor NKG2C. These cells have been shown to possess strong anti-tumour efficacy both in-vitro as well as in-vivo.
   Objectives: To determine if reconstitution of adaptive NK cells (CD56 th mNKG2C*NKG2A ) in patients with advanced leukemia undergoing haploidentical HCT had any impact on disease progression (DP).
   Study Design: The study cohort comprised of 60 patients with advanced acute leukemia, aged 2-65 years, receiving myeloablative PTCy based haploidentical transplantation from CMV seropositive donors, followed by CTLA4Ig-primed donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). They were evaluated for the kinetics of reconstitution of adaptive NK cells, both phenotypic and functional, at days +30+60, +90 and at regular intervals, to 3 years of follow-up, in relation to DP. Reconstitution of adaptive NK cells was compared with a retrospective cohort of patients in the same protocol receiving DLI without CTLA4Ig.
   Results: Non-relapse mortality, acute and chronic GVHD were 5.1%, 10.3% and 14.5%. DP was 17.5% at a median follow-up of 28 months. Adaptive NK cells were significantly higher in patients without DP at days+30, +60 and +90 (p = 0.0001), irrespective of CMV reactivation and remained elevated until 36 months post-HCT. These cells maintained their functional competence as measured by robust interferon-gamma production with higher expressions of KIR, NKG2D and CD57, without any increase in PD1 expression. Grafts from donors with higher adaptive NK cells were associated with a lower risk of DP (p = 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, adaptive NK cell recovery at day +90 had the most favorable impact on DP (HR-0.7). Tregs reconstituted briskly along with the adaptive NK cells and were sustained as well, without compromising the GVL effect. Comparison with a retrospective cohort receiving the same protocol with DLI without CTLA4Ig, showed a superior reconstitution of adaptive NK cells in those receiving CTLA4Ig-DLI (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that myeloablative transplantation from CMV seropositive haploidentical donors augmented with CTLA4Ig-primed DLI might favor early and sustained expansion of functionally competent adaptive NK cells irrespective of CMV reactivation, with a favorable outcome.

TI  - Device associated infections at a trauma surgical center of India: Trend over eight years
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY
KW  - BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS
KW  - SURVEILLANCE
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Background: Device-associated infections (DAIs) are an important cause of excessive stay and mortality in ICUs. Trauma patients are predisposed to acquire such infections due to various factors. The prevalence of HAIs is underreported from developing nations due to a lack of systematic surveillance. This study reports the rates and outcomes of DAIs at a dedicated Trauma Center in trauma patients and compares the rates with a previous pilot observation.
   Methods: The study reports the finding of ongoing surveillance and the use of an indigenous software at a level-1 trauma center in India. Surveillance for ventilator-associated pneumonia, central line-associated bloodstream infections, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections was done based on standard definitions. The rates of HAIs and the profile of pathogens isolated from June 2010 to December 2018 were analyzed.
   Results: A total of 7485 patients were included in the analysis, amounting to 68,715 patient days. The rates of VAP, CLABSI, and CA-UTI were respectively 12, 9.8 1st 8.5/1000 device days. There was a significant correlation between device days and the propensity to develop infections. Of the 1449 isolates recovered from cases of DAIs, Acinetobacter sp (28.2%) was the most common isolate, followed by Candida sp. A high rate of multi-resistance was observed.
   Conclusion: Automated surveillance was easy and useful for data entry and analysis. Surveillance data should be used for implementing preventive programs.

AB  - Injury from motor vehicle accidents remains a leading cause of death in India with increasing number of fatalities. Timely delivery of lifesaving interventions is critical for survival and in restoring physical functioning. As a part of the Australia India Trauma Systems Collaboration, the Trauma Reception and Resuscitation (TRR (c))-computerized decision support system was implemented in a Level 1 Trauma Centre in India in order to determine whether this system would reduce the time in performing lifesaving interventions and improve vital sign data capture and documentation. This prospective cohort study at the Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Center, All India Institute of Medical Science, New Delhi, recruited a total of 106 participants into two groups: TRR (c) (76) and controls (30). During the first 30 min of resuscitation, the TRR (c) group recorded greater sets of vital signs in compared to the controls for medical records. More importantly, the real-time documentation of the vital signs for the TRR (c) group ensured accuracy for medical records. For lifesaving interventions, oxygen was administered in the TRR (c) group only if SpO(2) < 93%, whereas oxygen was administered as standard of care in the controls. There was no statistical difference in the mean times to endotracheal intubation, intercostal catheter insertion or performance of emergency chest x-ray between the control and TRR (c) groups. Importantly however, these 3 comparable interventions were performed consistently within a smaller timeframe for patients receiving care with TRR (c) decision prompts. There was a greater variability in the time taken to perform lifesaving interventions in the control group in comparison to the clinicians assisted with computerized decision prompts. This preliminary study was not powered to measure difference in mortality and patient recruitment was limited to 8 am-5 pm when trained staff could attend to operating the TRR (c) system.

TI  - Traumatic Arterio-Enteric Fistula-A Report of 2 Cases With Review of Literature
T2  - VASCULAR AND ENDOVASCULAR SURGERY
KW  - arterio-enteric
KW  - fistula
AB  - Background:
   Traumatic arterio-enteric fistula is predominantly seen after penetrating trauma with only 21 reported cases documented in the past 25 years. They may present in an acute or delayed manner with upper or lower gastrointestinal bleed. A detailed clinical examination with requisite imaging can help in detecting such injuries.
   Case Description:
   Case 1: A 20-year-old gentleman, presented with penetrating stab injury to the gluteal region with bleeding per rectum. Imaging revealed evidence of injury to the inferior rectal artery which was found to be communicating with the extraperitoneal portion of the rectum. He was managed with a combination of endovascular and open surgery with a successful outcome. Case 2: A 29-year-old gentleman, presented in a delayed manner 2 weeks after a gunshot wound to the gluteal region, which was managed operatively in another hospital. He developed a massive lower gastrointestinal bleed 2 weeks after presentation. Imaging revealed evidence of a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior gluteal artery which had a fistulous communication with the gastrointestinal tract leading to bleeding. It was managed by endovascular techniques successfully.
   Conclusion:
   Arterio-enteric fistulas following trauma are rare phenomena and they need a high index of suspicion for diagnosis. Once diagnosed, they can be managed based on their location and patient physiology by interventional techniques, surgery, or a combination of the two.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the neurocognitive outcomes and their diffusion tensor imaging correlates in children (aged 6-16 years) with mild traumatic brain injury. This prospective analysis included 74 children with mild traumatic brain injury (52 boys; mean age: 9.5 [+/- 2.7] years). Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Indian adaptation (WISC-IV), Child Behavior Checklist, and Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire were administered for 57 cases (at 3 months postinjury) and 51 controls of similar age. The findings of diffusion tensor imaging (done within 7 days of injury) were correlated with various WISC-IV indices. The presenting features at the time of injury were loss of consciousness (53%), confusion or disorientation (47%), and post-traumatic amnesia (10%). Other features in the acute phase included drowsiness (86%), headache (78%), balance problems (62%), nausea (47%), fatigue (45%), vomiting (35%), nasal or ear bleed (12%), sensitivity to sound and light (12%), etc. At 3 months postinjury, the children with mild traumatic brain injury performed poorly in terms of Intelligence Quotient, perceptual reasoning index, and processing speed index as compared to controls. Based on the Child Behavior Checklist, 17% of children with mild traumatic brain injury had internalizing behavioral problems in comparison with 4% of controls. Prevalence of poor sleepers in the mild traumatic brain injury cohort and controls was 12.3% and 2% respectively. Headache, reduced attention span, and fatigue were common postconcussion symptoms. There was a positive correlation between right uncinate fasciculus fractional anisotropy and verbal comprehension index (r = 0.32; P < .05).

AB  - Objectives Psychiatric morbidity and behavioral problems are quite common in children and adolescents with bronchial asthma, yet they remain underexplored and often ignored in clinical settings. This can impact the child's overall quality of life. There seems to be a dearth of Indian literature and so the current study was planned to assess psychological impact of asthma on the pediatric population. Methods Thirty children and adolescents, attending the Pediatric Chest Clinic at a tertiary care hospital in North India in the age group of 8-15 y having moderate to severe asthma formed the study group and matched healthy controls formed the other group. Sociodemographic and clinical details were obtained. Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. KID) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) were applied. Results Irregular attendance at school was reported by 23.33% of the participants with asthma. About 17% of the thirty study-participants were diagnosed with specific phobia, 10% with conduct disorder, and 7% with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Participants in the study group had significantly more behavioral problems in the syndrome domain anxious/depressed and attention problems. Total CBCL scores were significantly higher in the study group as compared to the control group (t = 3.816, p = 0.0003), indicating the presence of more behavioral problems in pediatric population with bronchial asthma. Conclusion Children and adolescents with bronchial asthma have co-morbid psychiatric morbidities and behavioral problems.

AB  - Background: Despite the modern advances in treatment techniques, the survival of locally advanced lung cancer patients continues to remain poor. Circulating lymphocytes have an important role to play in local immune response to RT as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors, and radiation related lymphopenia has been associated with inferior survival in various tumors.
   Methods: We undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the literature on risk and impact of lymphopenia in thoracic tumors. A systematic methodology search of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library was performed and eligible studies selected based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Review Manager Version 5.4.1 was used for the meta-analysis.
   Results: Fourteen studies were included in the final systematic review and 10 in the quantitative analysis. Overall mean incidence of severe lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count < 500) was 64.24%. The patients with severe lymphopenia were at increased risk of death with a pooled HR of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.40, 1.81, I-2 = 17%, P < 0.001) and progression with a pooled HR of 2.1 (95% CI: 1.57, 2.81, I-2 = 59%, P < 0.001) compared to patients with no severe lymphopenia. Dosimetric parameters including gross tumor volume, lung V5 and heart V5 were predictive of lymphopenia, while advanced age, lower baseline lymphocyte counts, higher stage and large tumor size were other risk factors. Models predicting estimated radiation dose to lymphocytes were a good surrogate for treatment outcomes.
   Conclusion: Radiation related lymphopenia is associated with increased hazard of progression and death in lung cancer. Minimizing the lung and heart dose, especially in patients with concurrent other risk factors can reduce lymphopenia and potentially improve treatment outcomes in these patients.

AB  - This paper addresses an important issue faced by neurosurgeons during surgical skull bone grinding, a common process used to remove bone in skull base tumour removal surgery to enable the neurosurgeon to reach the target region. The heat generated during bone grinding could harm the soft tissues and can lead to osteonecrosis and cell death. In the present study, a novel process of rotary ultrasonic bone grinding (RUBG) was proposed for osteotomy to limit the temperature to a safe level. A systematic investigation was conducted to determine the effect of varying process parameters on osteonecrosis at the cut surface. Three input parameters -rotational speed, feed rate and frequency - were investigated (at three levels) in terms of change in temperature and thermal biological damage. A sterile solution was used as a coolant to irrigate the grinding zone. Viable lacunae (filled osteocytes), non-viable lacunae (empty lacunae), necrosed tissues, and Haversian canal were found during the histological examination. Statistical analysis revealed that feed rate (45.43%) had the highest contribution towards temperature rise during grinding, followed by ultrasonic frequency (23.87%), and rotational speed (12.85%). The optimal machining parameters to avoid osteonecrosis and thermal trauma were rotational speed 35,000 rpm, feed rate 20 mm/min and ultrasonic frequency 20 kHz. Furthermore, histograms revealed that ultrasonic skull bone grinding was associated with greater cell viability and reduced temperature compared with conventional bone grinding.

AB  - Around 85% of childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) are of B-cell origin and characterized by the presence of different translocations including BCR-ABL1, ETV6-RUNX1, E2A-PBX1, and MLL fusion proteins. The current clinical investigations used to identify ETV6-RUNX1 translocation include FISH and fusion transcript specific PCR. In the current study we assessed the utility of IGF2BP1, an oncofetal RNA binding protein, that is over expressed specifically in ETV6-RUNX1 translocation positive B-ALL to be used as a diagnostic marker in the clinic. Further, public transcriptomic and Crosslinked Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) datasets were analyzed to identify the putative targets of IGF2BP1. We also studied the utility of using the mRNA expression of two such targets, MYC and EGFL7 as potential diagnostic markers separately or in conjunction with IGF2BP1. We observed that the expression of IGF2BP1 alone measured by RT-qPCR is highly sensitive and specific to be used as a potential biomarker for the presence of ETV6-RUNX1 translocation in future.

AB  - Background Despite being the most common cause of secondary hypertension, prevalence of primary aldosteronism (PA) among patients with young-onset hypertension (YH - age of hypertension onset <40 years) remains poorly studied.
   Objective We assessed the prevalence of PA in patients with YH referred for evaluation of secondary hypertension.
   Design and Patients In this prospective, cross-sectional study, 202 patients with YH, visiting endocrine and cardiology clinics of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, India, were evaluated.
   Measurements Primary aldosteronism was screened by measuring plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) and direct renin concentration (DRC) and calculating aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR), followed by confirmatory saline infusion test (SIT) according to Endocrine Society Guideline. Those confirmed with post-SIT PAC >5 ng/dl underwent adrenal computed tomography (CT), followed by adrenal venous sampling (AVS).
   Results Of 202 YH patients, 38 (18.8%) screened positive, and PA was confirmed in 36 (17.8%). The mean age was 43.9 +/- 10.9 years, and median duration of hypertension was 10.5 (3.5-18) years. The prevalence of PA increased with grade of hypertension (8.1% in grade 1 to 37.1% in grade 3), number of antihypertensive medications (2.5% in those taking <= 1 to 50% in those taking >= 4 medications) and severity of hypokalaemia (0% in potassium >5 to 85.7% in potassium <3.5 mmol/L). The prevalence of PA by age of hypertension onset was highest in age group 30-39 years (31.3%).
   Conclusions There is a high prevalence and a long delay in diagnosis of PA among patients with YH, and YH should be considered as a separate high-risk category in PA screening algorithm.

AB  - Context: Alfacalcidol and calcitriol are commonly used for managing hypoparathyroidism. Their relative merits have not been systematically assessed.
   Objective: We compared the effect of alfacalcidol and calcitriol on phosphatemic control, hypercalciuria, and associated factors in idiopathic-hypoparathyroidism (IH).
   Design and Setting: Open-label randomized controlled trial, tertiary care center.
   Subjects and Methods: IH patients with optimal calcemic control on alfacalcidol were continued on the same (n=20) or switched to calcitriol (n=25) at half of the ongoing alfacalcidol dose. The dose was adjusted during follow-up to maintain serum total calcium between 8.0 and 9.5 mg/dL. Serum calcium, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, 24-h urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, and fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEPh) were measured at baseline and 6 months. Plasma intact-FGF23 was measured at final follow-up.
   Result: Patients receiving alfacalcidol and calcitriol had comparable serum calcium at 6 months (8.70.4 vs 8.9 +/- 0.4 mg/dL, P=0.13). Their median [interquartile range (IQR)] dose at 6 months was 2.0 (1.0-2.5) and 0.75 (0.5-1.0) mu g/d, respectively. Serum 1,25(OH)(2)D levels were physiological in both (35.3 +/- 11.6 and 32.3 +/- 16.9 pg/mL). Serum phosphate and calcium excretion were comparable in 2 arms. A majority had hyperphosphatemia (75% vs 76%), hypercalciuria (75% vs 72%), and elevated FGF23 (116 +/- 68 and 113 +/- 57 pg/mL). Age showed significant independent association with plasma FGF23 (beta = 1.9, P = 0.001). Average FEPh was low despite high FGF23.
   Conclusion: At optimal calcium control, both alfacalcidol and calcitriol lead to comparable but high serum phosphate levels, hypercalciuria, physiological circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D, and elevated FGF23. Further studies are required to systematically investigate other treatment options.

AB  - Background: With the pandemic of obesity and the growing experience in metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), the number of patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis undergoing MBS is increasing.
   Objective: To analyze the morbidity and mortality following MBS in patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis.
   Setting: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
   Methods: The published literature was systematically reviewed, in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, for studies reporting outcomes of MBS among patients with liver cirrhosis. The predetermined endpoints were the overall complication after MBS, intraoperative complications, liver-related complications after MBS, all-cause 90-day mortality after MBS, and liver-related mortality post-MBS. The pooled weighted proportions for each of the endpoints was calculated using random effect meta-analysis.
   Results: A total of 18 studies, including 471 patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis undergoing MBS, qualified for the final quantitative analysis. The mean age and mean body mass index (BMI) of the pooled patient cohort were 50.2 years and 47.2 kg/m(2). The pooled weighted proportions of the overall post-MBS complications, intraoperative complications, liver-related complications, overall 90-day mortality, and liver failure related mortality post MBS were 22.14% (CI95%: 15.43%-29.55%), .08% (CI95%: 0%-1.02%), 4.62% (CI95%: 1.27%-9.30%), 0% (CI95%: 0%-.44%), .08% (CI95%: 0%-1.03%), respectively. Significantly lower postoperative complications were noted with sleeve gastrectomy (10.08% [95%CI: 5.14%-16%]) compared with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (31.53% [95%CI: 18.62%-45.68%]; (P = .02).
   Conclusion: We found an overall low postoperative surgical and liver-related mortality post MBS among patients with obesity and liver cirrhosis. The overall postoperative complications and liver-related complications were higher among patients with liver cirrhosis than in noncirrhotic patients. Sleeve gastrectomy showed lower postoperative complications compared with Rouxen-Y gastric bypass. (C) 2020 American Society for Bariatric Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emergency care surveillance as well as registries of emergency care are largely absent in most LMICs. Improper data systems in Emergency Department create an important gap in our understanding about the health of large portions of the population. Clinical data systems in LMICs and lower-resource settings will foster research and generation of contextualized evidence.

AB  - Rationale The development of consensus guidelines for interpretation of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is needed to provide more consistent reports in clinical practice. The standardization of PSMA-PET interpretation may also contribute to increasing the data reproducibility within clinical trials. Finally, guidelines in PSMA-PET interpretation are needed to communicate the exact location of findings to referring physicians, to support clinician therapeutic management decisions. Methods A panel of worldwide experts in PSMA-PET was established. Panelists were selected based on their expertise and publication record in the diagnosis or treatment of PCa, in their involvement in clinical guidelines and according to their expertise in the clinical application of radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors. Panelists were actively involved in all stages of a modified, nonanonymous, Delphi consensus process. Results According to the findings obtained by modified Delphi consensus process, panelist recommendations were implemented in a structured report for PSMA-PET. Conclusions The E-PSMA standardized reporting guidelines, a document supported by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM), provide consensus statements among a panel of experts in PSMA-PET imaging, to develop a structured report for PSMA-PET in prostate cancer and to harmonize diagnostic interpretation criteria.

AB  - Background: Musculoskeletal pain disorders are among the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide representing a significant burden to society. Studies investigating a "nociceptive-fusimotor" relationship using experimentally-induced pain/noxious stimuli and muscle spindle afferent (MSA) response have been published over several decades. The purpose of this scoping review was to systematically identify and summarize research findings related to the impact of experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation on direct MSA discharge/response.
   Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane and Embase were searched from database inception to August 2020. Eligible studies were: (a) published in English; (b) clinical or pre-clinical studies; (c) original data studies; (d) included the investigation of MSA response to experimentally-induced pain or noxious stimulation; (e) included quantification of at least one direct physiological measure associated with MSA activity/response. Two-phase screening procedures were conducted by a pair of independent reviewers and data extracted from eligible studies.
   Results: The literature search resulted in 195 articles of which 23 met inclusion criteria. Six studies (26%) were classified as clinical and 17 (74%) as pre-clinical. Two clinical studies investigated the effects of sacral dermatome pin-pricking on MSA response, while the remaining 4 studies investigated the effects of tonic muscle and/or skin pain induced by injection/infusion of hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle or subdermal tissues. In pre-clinical studies, muscle pain was induced by injection of noxious substances or the surgical removal of the meniscus at the knee joint.
   Conclusion: Clinical studies in awake humans reported that experimentally-induced pain did not affect, or else slightly decreased MSA spontaneous discharge and/or response during weak dorsiflexor muscle contraction, thus failing to support an excitatory nociceptive-fusimotor relationship. However, a majority of pre-clinical studies indicated that ipsilateral and contralateral muscle injection of noxious substances altered MSA resting discharge and/or response to stretch predominately through static fusimotor reflex mechanisms. Methodological differences (use of anesthesia, stretch methodology, etc.) may ultimately be responsible for the discrepancies between clinical and pre-clinical findings. Additional investigative efforts are needed to reconcile these discrepancies and to clearly establish or refute the existence of nociceptive-fusimotor relationship in muscular pain.

AB  - Basilar artery fenestration aneurysms are very rare and endovascular management of large and complex aneurysms is extremely challenging. Most of these type of cases are managed with stent assisted coiling, dual flow diverters (FD) and single FD with additional coiling of aneurysm and occlusion of one of the vertebral artery. Here, we report a case of large complex basilar artery fenestration aneurysm successfully treated with single FD using novel technique called "crossing flow diverter technique" without any additional coiling of aneurysm or occlusion of vertebral artery. Using this technique cost of procedure and procedural complexity inherent with other above mentioned techniques can be significantly reduced.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Due to the complexity of disease and its continuous global spread, there is an urgent need to improvise the strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The current anti-TB regimen lasts for months and warrants strict compliance to clear infection and to minimize the risk of development of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis. This underscores the need to have new and improved therapeutics for TB treatment. Several studies have highlighted the unique ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to exploit host factors to support its survival inside the intracellular environment. One of the key players to mycobacterial disease susceptibility and infection are endogenous gases such as oxygen, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide. Nitric oxide and carbon monoxide as the physiological gaseous messengers are considered important to the outcome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The role of hydrogen sulfide in human tuberculosis is yet not fully elucidated, but this gas has been shown to play a significant role in bacterial respiration, growth and pathogenesis. This review will focus on the host factors majorly endogenous gaseous signaling molecules which contributes to Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival inside the intracellular environment and highlight the potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - The authors' objective was to determine the association of clinical and laboratory parameters at admission with septic myocardial dysfunction (SMD) in children with septic shock. A chart review of children aged 3 mo-17 y with fluid refractory septic shock who underwent echocardiography within 3 h of admission was undertaken (2015-2017). Univariate followed by multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with SMD. Of the 95 children fulfilling the inclusion criteria, SMD was diagnosed in 44 (46%) children. Children 'with SMD' had longer capillary refill time (CRT), increased lactate, lower platelet count, increased blood urea, and increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (p < 0.05 for all) compared to those 'without SMD'. On multivariate analysis, none of these were significant. The mortality rate was higher in those 'with SMD' than 'without SMD' [36% vs. 20% (p = 0.07)]. Prolonged CRT, increased lactate, lower platelet count, increased blood urea and elevated liver enzymes at admission may be associated with SMD in children with septic shock and may warrant early assessment of cardiac function.

AB  - Radiochromic films are one of the most suitable dosimetry tools to perform two-dimensional dose measurement and dose verification in radiotherapy. In this work, a novel polymer based radiochromic film composed of amide substituted diacetylene was developed and its various dosimetric characteristics were investigated. The amide derivative of diacetylene was synthesized and its uniform, bubble-free films were coated on a polyester sheet. A comprehensive evaluation of general dosimetric properties like dose response, energy and dose rate dependence of the developed radiochromic films was carried out. The influence of dose fractionation and post irradiation stability was also examined. The commercially available Gafchromic EBT3 film was taken as the reference and the response of the novel radiochromic films with the change in various parameters was compared with it. The developed radiochromic films exhibited color change from white to blue in the dose range 0?10 Gy. These films showed a dependence of 2.5% on the energy variation and 2% on dose rate variation. A stable response with an average variation of 0.5% was observed between post irradiation times of 1 h and 3 h. The influence of change in environmental conditions like storage temperature and light intensity was found to be less than 2.5%. From this study, it can be elucidated that the newly developed radiochromic film renders promising accuracy and versatility which can make it suitable for medical radiation dosimetry.

AB  - Inflammation is a constant in Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), although their relationship is unclear. In a transgenic zebrafish system with chronic systemic overexpression of human IL6 (IL6-OE) we show that inflammation can cause intra-hepatic accumulation of triglycerides. Transcriptomics and proteomics analysis of the IL6-OE liver revealed a deregulation of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, especially a striking down regulation of the glycolytic enzyme aldolase b. Metabolomics analysis by mass spectrometry showed accumulation of hexose monophosphates and their derivatives, which can act as precursors for triglyceride synthesis. Our results suggest that IL6-driven repression of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, specifically aldolase b, may be a novel mechanism for fatty liver. This mechanism may be relevant for NAFLD in lean individuals, an emerging class of NAFLD prevalent more in Asian Indian populations.

AB  - HIV-infected individuals on combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) with virologic suppression exhibit sustained immune dysfunction. Our recent work has highlighted that monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MMDSC) are elevated in these individuals and suppress immune responses. Factors responsible for M-MDSC expansion in vivo are unknown. Here we compared circulating frequency of M-MDSC in HIV-infected persons from the US and India where HIV subtype-B or ?C predominate, respectively. We further investigated soluble mediators of residual immune activation in two cohorts and determined their correlation with M-MDSC expansion. Our findings show that M-MDSC are elevated and correlate with plasma levels of IL-6 in both cohorts. Chemokines CXCL10, CCL4 and CXCL8 were also elevated in HIV-infected individuals, but did not correlate with M-MDSC. These findings support that IL-6 is important in M-MDSC expansion which is independent of HIV subtype.

AB  - Background Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal symptoms, primarily attributed to sensitization of somatosensory system carrying pain. Few reports have investigated the impact of fibromyalgia symptoms on cognition, corticomotor excitability, sleepiness, and the sleep quality - all of which can deteriorate the quality of life in fibromyalgia. However, the existing reports are underpowered and have conflicting directions of findings, limiting their generalizability. Therefore, the present study was designed to compare measures of cognition, corticomotor excitability, sleepiness, and sleep quality using standardized instruments in the recruited patients of fibromyalgia with pain-free controls. Methods Diagnosed cases of fibromyalgia were recruited from the Rheumatology department for the cross-sectional, case-control study. Cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination, Stroop color-word task), corticomotor excitability (Resting motor threshold, Motor evoked potential amplitude), daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index) were studied according to the standard procedure. Results Thirty-four patients of fibromyalgia and 30 pain-free controls were recruited for the study. Patients of fibromyalgia showed decreased cognitive scores (p = 0.05), lowered accuracy in Stroop color-word task (for color: 0.02, for word: 0.01), and prolonged reaction time (< 0.01, < 0.01). Excessive daytime sleepiness in patients were found (< 0.01) and worsened sleep quality (< 0.01) were found. Parameters of corticomotor excitability were comparable between patients of fibromyalgia and pain-free controls. Conclusions Patients of fibromyalgia made more errors, had significantly increased reaction time for cognitive tasks, marked daytime sleepiness, and impaired quality of sleep. Future treatment strategies may include cognitive deficits and sleep disturbances as an integral part of fibromyalgia management.

AB  - The current review critically analyzes obesity as an important risk factor for increased predisposition towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), its severity and causal death in current pandemic. Countries with higher prevalence of exposed obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities. The analysis also proved that individuals having more adipose tissue in body have a higher level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is identified as functional receptor for COVID-19. Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1 protein suggest that mutant strains are more infectious than wildtype as they bind to host ACE2 protein with high binding affinities. Certain specific cancers including cervical cancer, pancreatic and rectal adenocarcinomas have more expression of such receptors and pose additional risk to already immunocompromised cancer patients. This review emphasizes obesity, as the covert risk factor of COVID-19 infection and sensitizes about of calorie restrictions, immunity building and preventive measures.

AB  - Involvement of visual cortex varies during tactile perception tasks in early blind (EB) and late blind (LB) human subjects. This study explored differences in sensory motor networks associated with tactile task in EB and LB subjects and between children and adolescents. A total of 40 EB subjects, 40 LB subjects, and 30 sighted controls were recruited in two subgroups: children (6-12 years) and adolescents (13-19 years). Data were acquired using a 3T MR scanner. Analyses of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD), functional connectivity (FC), correlation, and post hoc test for multiple comparisons were carried out. Difference in BOLD activity was observed in EB and LB groups in visual cortex during tactile perception, with increased FC of visual with dorsal attention and sensory motor networks in EB. EB adolescents exhibited increased connectivity with default mode and salience networks when compared with LB. Functional results correlated with duration of training, suggestive of better performance in EB. Alteration in sensory and visual networks in EB and LB correlated with duration of tactile training. Age of onset of blindness has an effect in cross-modal reorganization of visual cortex in EB and multimodal in LB in children and adolescents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Conservatively managed posttraumatic acute subdural hematoma (SDH) can present with progression of the size of the hematoma with increased mass effect, necessitating delayed surgery. The factors contributing to this progression remain largely unknown.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases was performed to retrieve case control studies, retrospective cohort studies, and prospective studies with retrospective evaluation of risk factors until August 2, 2020. The different risk factors that were evaluated in the studies were compiled and the results were analyzed to arrive at a conclusion.
   RESULTS: A total of 7 studies were included in the systematic review and 6 were included in the analysis, with an aggregate of 679 patients. The following factors were found to have a relation with progression of acute SDH: age (odds ratio, 7.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.52-11.72), use of antiplatelet drugs (odds ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.18-2.77), use of anticoagulants (odds ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.21-7.88), thickness of SDH (odds ratio, 4.13; 95% CI, 3.29-4.97), midline shift (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.69-3.03), hypertension (odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.25-3.96) and ischemic heart disease (odds ratio, 3.32; 95% CI, 1.63-6.76).
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis showed that patients with the risk factors outlined are at higher risk of developing symptomatic chronic SDH after conservatively managed traumatic acute SDH compared with those without them. It is therefore necessary to provide more intensive follow-up for these patients to avoid an adverse outcome.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic is a worldwide public health emergency with widespread impact on health care delivery. Unforeseen challenges have been noted during administration of usual haematology care in these unusual COVID-19 times. Medical services have been overstretched and frontline health workers have borne the brunt of COVID-19 pandemic. Movement restrictions during lockdown prevented large sections of population from accessing health care, blood banks from holding blood drives, and disrupted delivery of diagnostic hematology services. The disruption in hematology care due to COVID-19 pandemic in India has been disproportionately higher compared to other subspecialities as hematology practice in India remains restricted to major cities. In this review we chronicle the challenges encountered in caring for hematology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in India and put forth recommendations for minimizing their impact on provision of hematology care with special emphasis on hematology practice in lower and middle income countries (LMICs).

AB  - Introduction: This prospective study evaluated the outcome of a combination of nonsurgical endodontic (NSET) and vital pulp therapy (VPT) for the management of mature permanent mandibular molar teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP) and apical periodontitis (AP). Methods: Institutional ethical clearance was obtained. Mandibular molar teeth (N = 60) with a definitive diagnosis of SIP and AP with a radiographic periapical index score (PAI) of >= 3 in either 1 of the roots (mesial or distal) were included. Block randomization was used for allocation. In the NSET group (n = 30), single-visit NSET was performed using a standardized operating protocol. In the NSET-VPT group (n = 30), subsequent to full pulpotomy, at the root orifice where a vital pulp was observed (as determined by the arrest of pulpal bleed upon application of a 2.5% sodium hypochlorite pressure pack), a mineral trioxide aggregate radicular barrier was placed, and it was covered with light-cured resin-modified glass ionomer cement. NSET was performed in the root exhibiting a PAI score >= 3. The tooth was permanently restored. Postoperative pain was assessed at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Teeth were followed up clinically and radiographically at 12 months. The presence/absence of symptoms and the change in PAI scores were noted. The data were statistically analyzed. Results: The success rate was 90% in the NSET group and 93.3% in the NSET-VPT group. According to an intergroup comparison between the proportion of teeth healed and nonhealed (radiographic), there was no significant difference (P > .05). Conclusions: The combination of NSET and VPT is a viable biologically based minimally invasive treatment option for multirooted mandibular teeth with SIP and AP.

AB  - Background
   Pediatric diabetes clinics around the world rapidly adapted care in response to COVID-19. We explored provider perceptions of care delivery adaptations and challenges for providers and patients across nine international pediatric diabetes clinics.
   Methods
   Providers in a quality improvement collaborative completed a questionnaire about clinic adaptations, including roles, care delivery methods, and provider and patient concerns and challenges. We employed a rapid analysis to identify main themes.
   Results
   Providers described adaptations within multiple domains of care delivery, including provider roles and workload, clinical encounter and team meeting format, care delivery platforms, self-management technology education, and patient-provider data sharing. Providers reported concerns about potential negative impacts on patients from COVID-19 and the clinical adaptations it required, including fears related to telemedicine efficacy, blood glucose and insulin pump/pen data sharing, and delayed care-seeking. Particular concern was expressed about already vulnerable patients. Simultaneously, providers reported 'silver linings' of adaptations that they perceived as having potential to inform care and self-management recommendations going forward, including time-saving clinic processes, telemedicine, lifestyle changes compelled by COVID-19, and improvements to family and clinic staff literacy around data sharing.
   Conclusions
   Providers across diverse clinical settings reported care delivery adaptations in response to COVID-19-particularly telemedicine processes-created challenges and opportunities to improve care quality and patient health. To develop quality care during COVID-19, providers emphasized the importance of generating evidence about which in-person or telemedicine processes were most beneficial for specific care scenarios, and incorporating the unique care needs of the most vulnerable patients.

AB  - Background: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on well-being has the potential for serious negative consequences on work, home life, and patient care. The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Resilience Task Force collaboration set out to investigate well-being in oncology over time since COVID-19.
   Methods: Two online anonymous surveys were conducted (survey I: April/May 2020; survey II: July/August 2020). Statistical analyses were performed to examine group differences, associations, and predictors of key outcomes: (i) well-being/distress [expanded Well-being Index (eWBI; 9 items)]; (ii) burnout (1 item from eWBI); (iii) job performance since COVID-19 (JP-CV; 2 items).
   Results: Responses from survey I (1520 participants from 101 countries) indicate that COVID-19 is impacting oncology professionals; in particular, 25% of participants indicated being at risk of distress (poor well-being, eWBI >= 4), 38% reported feeling burnout, and 66% reported not being able to perform their job compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. Higher JP-CV was associated with better well-being and not feeling burnout (P < 0.01). Differences were seen in well-being and JP-CV between countries (P < 0.001) and were related to country COVID-19 crude mortality rate (P < 0.05). Consistent predictors of well-being, burnout, and JP-CV were psychological resilience and changes to work hours. In survey II, among 272 participants who completed both surveys, while JP-CV improved (38% versus 54%, P < 0.001), eWBI scores >= 4 and burnout rates were significantly higher compared with survey I (22% versus 31%, P = 0.01; and 35% versus 49%, P = 0.001, respectively), suggesting well-being and burnout have worsened over a 3-month period during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusion: In the first and largest global survey series, COVID-19 is impacting well-being and job performance of oncology professionals. JP-CV has improved but risk of distress and burnout has increased over time. Urgent measures to address well-being and improve resilience are essential.

TI  - Pharmacogenetics of ATP binding cassette transporter MDR1(1236C&gt;T) gene polymorphism with glioma patients receiving Temozolomide-based chemoradiation therapy in Indian population
T2  - PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL
AB  - Temozolomide (TMZ), an alkylating agent with a broad-spectrum antitumor activity, ability to cross blood-brain barrier (BBB), shown to be effective against malignant glioma. This study aims to investigate the effect of 1236C>T (rs1128503) single-nucleotide gene polymorphisms of ABCB1 (MDR1) in north-Indian patients diagnosed with glioma undergoing TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy. Genotyping was performed in 100 patients diagnosed with malignant glioma (50 anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) patients and 50 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients) and 150 age and sex-matched controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) method, followed by sanger sequencing. TMZ plasma levels were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC method. Glioma patient's survival time was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier's curve. Results of MDR1 gene 1236C>T polymorphism showed significant allelic and genotypic frequency association between glioma patients and controls. The plasma TMZ levels between metabolizers group in Grade III and Grade IV were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The mutant genotype (TT) has less survival benefit compared with other genotypes (CT/CC) and the survival difference between AA and GBM was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). Though CT and TT polymorphisms have significant association with lower TMZ levels in both Grade III (AA) and IV (GBM) tumors, the survival difference seems to be mainly among patients with Grade III tumors. Our findings suggest that the MDR1 gene polymorphism plays a role in plasma TMZ levels and in survival time of glioma patients and, hence, TMZ therapy in malignant glioma can be predicted by genotyping MDR1 (1236C>T) gene polymorphism.

AB  - A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was 'Is left ventricular superior to right ventricular pacing in children with congenital or postoperative complete heart block?' Altogether, 19 papers were found using the reported search, of which 9 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. Two large multicentric showed that site of pacing was the major determinant of left ventricular (LV) function with LV pacing being superior to RV pacing, though the number of patients paced via LV was lesser in comparison to right ventricular (RV). There were 2 prospective, 2 retrospective and 1 cross-sectional studies with fewer patients that demonstrated superiority of LV over RV pacing in preserving LV function. Only 1 small-scale retrospective study showed similar results of LV and RV pacing on LV function. One cross-sectional study showed superiority of LV apical pacing on exercise tolerance. As per the existing literature, LV apex seems to be the most optimal site for epicardial pacing while RV free wall pacing has the highest risk of causing LV dysfunction over the long term. We conclude that LV pacing appears to be superior to RV pacing in terms of long-term effect on cardiac function and ventricular synchrony.

KW  - supravalvar aortic stenosis
AB  - Aim To evaluate the imaging features and associations in patients with supravalvar aortic stenosis on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography.
   Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed all CT angiography studies performed for evaluation of congenital heart diseases at our institution through the period from January 2014 to June 2020. Cases with supravalvar aortic stenosis were identified and classified as syndromic and nonsyndromic based on history, physical examination, and relevant investigations. The type and extent of vascular involvement and associated cardiovascular abnormalities were characterized.
   Results Supravalvar aortic stenosis was identified in 26/3926 (0.66%) patients (22 males and 4 females; Age range: 2 months to 20 years). Discrete stenosis was seen in 14/26 (53.8%) patients, while diffuse involvement of the ascending aorta to varying degrees was seen in the remaining 12 (46.2%) patients. About 15/26 (57.7%) patients had pulmonary involvement at some level, namely, infundibular, valvar, supravalvar, or peripheral pulmonic stenosis while 15/26 (57.7%) patients had coronary arterial involvement either in the form of stenosis, occlusion, or ectasia. Aortic valvular abnormality including thickening, partial fusion, and adhesion of leaflet edges to the sinutubular junction causing reduced coronary inflow was seen in 15/26 (57.7%) patients. Associated ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and mitral valvular prolapse were seen in four (15.4%), five (19.2%), and two (7.7%) patients respectively.
   Conclusion Supravalvar aortic stenosis is a rare abnormality showing associated pulmonary arterial involvement, coronary arterial involvement, aortic valvular abnormalities, and associated congenital cardiac defects in the majority of cases, which may influence surgical outcomes.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that ABO blood group may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with group O individuals less likely to test positive and group A conferring a higher susceptibility to infection and propensity to severe disease. The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome-wide-association-analyses and country-level meta-regression analyses. ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection by ABO type. For example, anti-A and/or anti-B antibodies (e.g. present in group O individuals) could bind to corresponding antigens on the viral envelope and contribute to viral neutralization, thereby preventing target cell infection. The SARS-CoV-2 virus and SARS-CoV spike (S) proteins may be bound by anti-A isoagglutinins (e.g. present in group O and group B individuals), which may block interactions between virus and angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2-receptor, thereby preventing entry into lung epithelial cells. ABO type-associated variations in angiotensin-converting enzyme-1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels. In conclusion, group O may be associated with a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and group A may be associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with severe disease. However, prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to verify several of the proposed associations. Based on the strength of available studies, there are insufficient data for guiding policy in this regard.

AB  - Background: A classic ketogenic diet, even though effective in children with drug-resistant epilepsy is not tolerated well by them and cumbersome to prepare. Low glycemic index therapy (LGIT), the least restrictive with minimal adverse effects among ketogenic dietary therapies has been proven effective in uncontrolled trials, but a placebo-controlled trial in this regard is still lacking.
   Methods: In this open-label randomized controlled study, we randomized children above age two years with drug resistant epilepsy into two groups (LGIT and control groups). Patients in the LGIT group received an add-on low glycemic index diet for 3 months along with the ongoing antiepileptic drugs and the patients in the control group did not receive any dietary intervention. Seizure frequency was assessed from the seizure diary maintained by the parents. Diet compliance was assessed using the diet diary that was maintained by the parents for three days just before the scheduled monthly visits of the patients.
   Results: Forty children with drug-refractory epilepsy (20 in each group) were enrolled. While 6/20 children in the LGIT arm have >50 % reduction in seizure frequency, none achieved this in the control arm (p = 0.02). The overall compliance with the low glycemic diet in the intervention group was 88.5 %. Out of six responders to LGIT, one child achieved seizure freedom and one achieved >90 % seizure reduction. Five continued LGIT further for a median duration of 8 months (range-4-12 months) successfully. The number needed to treat for more than 50 % seizure reduction was 3 and for more than 90 % seizure reduction was 10. The mean frequency of seizures for the intervention and control groups at three months of follow-up was not significantly different (p = 0.16), but the change in seizure frequency as compared to baseline was better in the intervention arm (p = 0.01). Three patients in the LGIT arm had non-serious adverse events (lethargy in two, vomiting in one).
   Conclusion: In children aged 2-8 years with drug-refractory epilepsy, the administration of LGIT along with ongoing anti-seizure medications (ASM) is more efficacious in reducing seizure frequency as compared to ASM alone.

AB  - Background Diagnostic tools for liver disease can now include estimation of the grade of hepatic steatosis (S0 to S3). Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a non-invasive method for assessing hepatic steatosis that has become available for patients who are obese (FibroScan XL probe), but a consensus has not yet been reached regarding cutoffs and its diagnostic performance. We aimed to assess diagnostic properties and identify relevant covariates with use of an individual patient data meta-analysis.
   Methods We did an individual patient data meta-analysis, in which we searched PubMed and Web of Science for studies published from database inception until April 30, 2019. Studies reporting original biopsy-controlled data of CAP for non-invasive grading of steatosis were eligible. Probe recommendation was based on automated selection, manual assessment of skin-to-liver-capsule distance, and a body-mass index (BMI) criterion. Receiver operating characteristic methods and mixed models were used to assess diagnostic properties and covariates. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were analysed separately because they are the predominant patient group when using the XL probe. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018099284.
   Findings 16 studies reported histology-controlled CAP including the XL probe, and individual data from 13 papers and 2346 patients were included. Patients with a mean age of 46.5 years (SD 14.5) were recruited from 20 centres in nine countries. 2283 patients had data for BMI; 673 (29%) were normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m(2)), 530 (23%) were overweight (BMI >= 25 to <30 kg/m(2)), and 1080 (47%) were obese (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)). 1277 (54%) patients had NAFLD, 474 (20%) had viral hepatitis, 285 (12%) had alcohol-associated liver disease, and 310 (13%) had other liver disease aetiologies. The XL probe was recommended in 1050 patients, 930 (89%) of whom had NAFLD; among the patients with NAFLD, the areas under the curve were 0.819 (95% CI 0.769-0.869) for S0 versus S1 to S3 and 0.754 (0.720-0.787) for S0 to S1 versus S2 to S3. CAP values were independently affected by aetiology, diabetes, BMI, aspartate aminotransferase, and sex. Optimal cutoffs differed substantially across aetiologies. Risk of bias according to QUADAS-2 was low.
   Interpretation CAP cutoffs varied according to cause, and can effectively recognise significant steatosis in patients with viral hepatitis. CAP cannot grade steatosis in patients with NAFLD adequately, but its value in a NAFLD screening setting needs to be studied, ideally with methods beyond the traditional histological reference standard.

AB  - Microbiota inside the gut plays a vital role in maintaining human health. Microbial dysbiosis is associated with various complications leading to a range of diseases. Epigenetic changes enforced by various environmental and lifestyle factors lead to heritable modifications. These epigenetic modifications include DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin remodelling, and ribonucleic acid-based mechanisms. This review summarizes the impacts of environmental factors on the gut microbiome, epigenetic modifications, and their role in cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Autophagy, a catabolic process, degrades damaged and defective cellular materials through lysosomes, thus working as a recycling mechanism of the cell. It is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated process that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Autophagy is constitutively active at the basal level; however, it gets enhanced to meet cellular needs in various stress conditions. The process involves various autophagy-related genes that ultimately lead to the degradation of targeted cytosolic substrates. Many factors modulate both upstream and downstream autophagy pathways like nutritional status, energy level, growth factors, hypoxic conditions, and localization of p53. Any problem in executing autophagy can lead to various pathological conditions including neurodegeneration, aging, and cancer. In cancer, autophagy plays a contradictory role; it inhibits the formation of tumors, whereas, during advanced stages, autophagy promotes tumor progression. Besides, autophagy protects the tumor from various therapies by providing recycled nutrition and energy to the tumor cells. Autophagy is stimulated by tumor suppressor proteins, whereas it gets inhibited by oncogenes. Due to its dynamic and dual role in the pathogenesis of cancer, autophagy provides promising opportunities in developing novel and effective cancer therapies along with managing chemoresistant cancers. In this article, we summarize different strategies that can modulate autophagy in cancer to overcome the major obstacle, i.e., resistance developed in cancer to anticancer therapies.

AB  - Background: One in every four patients with a first episode of non-gallstone-related acute pancreatitis (AP) develops recurrent disease. Recurrent episodes of AP or acute flares of chronic pancreatitis (CP) are associated with decreased quality of life and progression of the disease. Besides removing the etiology of pancreatitis (which sometimes is not possible), there are no effective measures to prevent recurrence. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials, as well as epidemiological and cohort studies, suggest that statins may be protective against the development of index AP.
   Methods: The SIMBA study is a triple-blind randomized placebo-controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial. Patients with recurrent AP or with acute flares of CP (at least two episodes in the last 12 months) will be randomized to receive simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo. During a 3-year study period, 144 patients (72 per arm of treatment) from 26 centers will be enrolled. The patients will receive the study treatment for 1 year. The primary aim is to compare the recurrence of AP or acute flares in CP. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of new-onset diabetes mellitus, new-onset exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), new-onset imaging signs of CP, frequency of all-cause hospital admissions, severity of AP, adherence to treatment, and frequency of adverse events.
   Discussion: The SIMBA trial will ascertain whether simvastatin, a safe, widely used and inexpensive drug, can change the natural course of recurrent pancreatitis.

AB  - In pancytopenia, the number of cells reaches to white blood cell count (WBC) < 3500 cells/mm(3), hemoglobin (Hb) < 11 g/dL and platelet count <150000 cells/mm(3). Nanomedicine is the specific area of medicine that comprises of tools and knowledge of nanotechnology in the prevention, diagnosis, control and treatment of life-threatening disease. It paved a way to regulate the pancytopenic settings and emerged as an alternative treatment that uses specific delivery system, improves efficacy of drugs and reduces detrimental side effects to healthy cells. In this review article, variant search engines and scientific databases of PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Medline for current status of nanomedicines in the treatment of pancytopenia were reviewed. Among the findings, high quality articles were selected from 2012 to 2020, and after reviewing them, authors have conducted a comprehensive compilation of the research work carried out on various nanomedicines for treatment of pancytopenia.

AB  - Objective: Persons with epilepsy (PWE), especially those with limited education backgrounds from developing countries, are challenged by complicated medication regimens, debilitating seizures, and stigmatization in their daily life. Consequently, it is difficult for physicians to ensure medication adherence. This study validates a novel mobile application which was hypothesized to increase medication adherence and self-management skills in PWE. Created by medical professionals, the application included behavioral and educational components and was built to be easy-to-understand for those of socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
   Methods: This was a parallel, two-armed randomized controlled trial in which a total of 96 participants were enrolled from a Neurology Outpatient Department into a control standard care group and a mobile application group that used the smartphone application (app) in addition to the standard medical treatment. The app was intuitive and easy to understand for those coming from a socio-economically disadvantaged background. Medication adherence and self-efficacy were assessed with the Morisky Green and Levine Scale (MGLS) and the Epilepsy Self Efficacy Scale (ESES). Patients were reassessed 12 weeks later. Change in seizure frequency following administration of the application was a secondary outcome.
   Results: In an intent-to-treat analysis, the mobile application interventional group showed over a 60% increase in the proportion of medication adherence (P < 0.0001). The mean self-efficacy score for the mobile application group was increased from 269.5 to 289.75 (P < 0.0001). The control group showed no statistically significant increases in either the proportion adherent or mean self-efficacy scores.
   Significance: This study demonstrated the statistically significant performance of a mobile application in improving medication adherence and self-management skills in Indian persons with epilepsy. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Alternative splicing of <i>ceramide synthase 2</i> alters levels of specific ceramides and modulates cancer cell proliferation and migration in Luminal B breast cancer subtype
T2  - CELL DEATH & DISEASE
AB  - Global dysregulation of RNA splicing and imbalanced sphingolipid metabolism has emerged as promoters of cancer cell transformation. Here, we present specific signature of alternative splicing (AS) events of sphingolipid genes for each breast cancer subtype from the TCGA-BRCA dataset. We show that ceramide synthase 2 (CERS2) undergoes a unique cassette exon event specifically in Luminal B subtype tumors. We validated this exon 8 skipping event in Luminal B cancer cells compared to normal epithelial cells, and in patient-derived tumor tissues compared to matched normal tissues. Differential AS-based survival analysis shows that this AS event of CERS2 is a poor prognostic factor for Luminal B patients. As Exon 8 corresponds to catalytic Lag1p domain, overexpression of AS transcript of CERS2 in Luminal B cancer cells leads to a reduction in the level of very-long-chain ceramides compared to overexpression of protein-coding (PC) transcript of CERS2. We further demonstrate that this AS event-mediated decrease of very-long-chain ceramides leads to enhanced cancer cell proliferation and migration. Therefore, our results show subtype-specific AS of sphingolipid genes as a regulatory mechanism that deregulates sphingolipids like ceramides in breast tumors, and can be explored further as a suitable therapeutic target.

AB  - Objective: Depression is an important co-morbidity in persons with epilepsy (PWE) and its timely identification is essential. The aim of the study was to assess and compare the psychometric properties of potentially suitable screening tools of depression in PWE in a tertiary care setting in India.
   Methods: After ethical clearance, 449 PWE above 18 years of age, on anti-seizure drugs (ASDs), attending epilepsy clinic in neurology outpatient department (OPD) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, were recruited and evaluated for depression using different tools namely: Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory for Epilepsy (NDDI-E), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI: Module A, version 6.0.0) was used as reference standard. The association if any of depression with PWE variables was also determined.
   Results: A variable percentage of PWE were positive for depression- 40.1% with MINI, 40.5% with NDDI-E, 44.3% with HAM-D and 45.4% with PHQ-9. Suicidal ideation was present in 4.5% of PWE. The sensitivity and specificity of scales using MINI as a reference standard were found to be maximal at scores >= 5, >= 8 and >11 for PHQ-9, HAM-D, and NDDI-E, respectively. The ROC analysis revealed a statistically significant difference among NDDI-E and PHQ-9 (p = 0.0268). Polytherapy in PWE had significant association with risk of depression (p < 0.01) and female PWE had 1.5 times the odds of depression as compared with males (95% CI, 1.02-2.2).
   Conclusion: All the tools used in this study were found to be appropriate for use in PWE if cut-off points are validated. The choice of tool can be based on the clinical setting. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - GBNTD structure
KW  - pH mediated ATPase hydrolysis
KW  - CD spectroscopy And fluorescence spectroscopy
AB  - DNA Gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that utilizes the energy of ATP hydrolysis for introducing negative supercoils in DNA. The protein comprises two subunits GyrA and GyrB that form a GyrA(2)GyrB(2) heterotetramer. GyrB subunit contains the N-terminal domain (GBNTD) for ATPase activity and the C-terminal domain (GBCTD) for interaction with GyrA and DNA. Earlier structural studies have revealed three different conformational states for GBNTD during ATP hydrolysis defined as open, semi-open, and closed. Here we report, the three-dimensional structure of a new transient closed conformation of GBNTD from Salmonella Typhi (StGBNTD) at 1.94 A resolution. Based on the structural analysis of this transient closed conformation, we propose the role of protein in the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis. We further explored the effect of pH on ATPase activity and structural stability of the GBNTD using CD and fluorescence spectroscopy at varying pH environment. Kinetic parameters obtained from the ATPase assay were correlated with its secondary and tertiary structure at their respective pH environment. The protein possessed maximum ATPase activity and structural stability at optimum pH 8. At acidic pH, a remarkable decrease in both enzymatic activity and structural stability was observed whereas at alkaline pH there was no significant change. The structural analysis of StGBNTD reveals the role of polar interactions in stabilizing the overall dimeric conformation of the protein.

AB  - The beneficial health roles of dietary polyphenols in preventing oxidative stress related chronic diseases have been subjected to intense investigation over the last two decades. As our understanding of the role of gut microbiota advances our knowledge of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory functions of polyphenols accumulates, there emerges a need to examine the prebiotic role of dietary polyphenols. This review focused on the role of different types and sources of dietary polyphenols on the modulation of the gut microbiota, their metabolites and how they impact on host health benefits. Inter-dependence between the gut microbiota and polyphenol metabolites and the vital balance between the two in maintaining the host gut homeostasis were discussed with reference to different types and sources of dietary polyphenols. Similarly, the mechanisms behind the health benefits by various polyphenolic metabolites bio-transformed by gut microbiota were also explained. However, further research should focus on the importance of human trials and profound links of polyphenols-gut microbiota-nerve-brain as they provide the key to unlock the mechanisms behind the observed benefits of dietary polyphenols found in vitro and in vivo studies.

AB  - Background and objectives In children with nephrotic syndrome, steroids are the cornerstone of therapy for relapse. The adequate duration and dosage of steroids, however, have not been an active area of research, especially in children with infrequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome. This study investigated the efficacy of an abbreviated regimen for treatment of a relapse in this population. Design, setting, participants, & measurements In a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the efficacy of prednisolone as a "short regimen" (40 mg/m(2) on alternate days for 2 weeks) compared with "standard regimen" (40 mg/m(2) on alternate days for 4 weeks) for children aged 1-16 years who achieved remission of a relapse. The primary outcome was the proportion of children developing frequent relapses or steroid dependence at 12 months. ResultsAtotal of 117patientswere enrolledandrandomized to short (55) or standard(62) regimen. Fourteen (24%) patients in standard regimen and 12 (23%) in short regimen developed frequent relapses or steroid dependence over a period of 1 year (risk difference, 21%; 95% confidence interval, 215 to 16; P=0.90). Alarge 95% confidence interval crossed the proposed noninferioritymargin. In a time to event analysis, therewas no significant difference intheproportion of childrendeveloping frequent relapses or steroiddependence andtime to outcome between the two groups (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.23; P=0.98). Time to relapse, relapse rate, and steroid-relatedadverseeventswere similar inbothgroups. Cumulative steroidexposurewas significantlylower in the short regimen (risk difference, 2541 mg/m(2); 95% confidence interval, 2917 to 2164 mg/m(2); P<0.001). Conclusions In children with infrequently relapsing nephrotic syndrome, a short steroid treatment for relapse resulted in a similar proportion of patients developing frequent relapses or steroid dependence; however, noninferiority of a short regimen was not established.

AB  - Background: Knowledge of genetic determinants in Parkinson's disease is still limited. Familial forms of the disease continue to provide a rich resource to capture the genetic spectrum in disease pathogenesis, and this approach is exploited in this study.
   Methods: Informative members from a three-generation family of Indian ethnicity manifesting a likely autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of Parkinson's disease were used for whole exome sequencing. Variant data analysis and in vitro functional characterisation of variant(s) segregating with the phenotype were carried out in HEK-293 and SH-SY5Y cells using gene constructs of interest.
   Results: Two compound heterozygous variants, a rare missense (c.1139C > T:p.P380L) and a novel splice variant (c.1456 + 2 delTAGA, intron10) in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome like gene (WASL, 7q31), both predicted to be deleterious were shared among the proband and two affected siblings. WASL, a gene not previously linked to a human Mendelian disorder is known to regulate actin polymerisation via Arp2/3 complex. Based on exon trapping assay using pSPL3 vector in HEK-293 cells, the splice variant showed skipping of exon10. Characterisation of the missense variant in SH-SY5Y cells demonstrated: i) significant alterations in neurite length and number; ii) decreased reactive oxygen species tolerance in mutation carrying cells on Tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide induction and iii) increase in alpha-synuclein protein. Screening for WASL variants in two independent PD cohorts identified four individuals with heterozygous but none with biallelic variants. Conclusion: WASL, with demonstrated functional relevance in neurons may be yet another strong candidate gene for autosomal recessive PD encouraging assessment of its contribution across populations.

AB  - The study's purpose was to fabricate a 3-D porous scaffold, in which chitosan was coated onto the pore wall of polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds as a bioactive agent to maximize the cell recognition signals, to improve the osteoconductivity of the scaffolds. The pppporogen leaching technique has been modified and used in the fabrication process, comprising of the coating of chitosan over the porogen followed by transferring of coating to the pore wall of the PCL scaffold. The cytotoxicity and hemolysis results indicated chitosan's presence over the surface of the scaffold's pore walls has significantly enhanced its biocompatibility. Scaffolds coated with 2.5 % (w/v) chitosan shows 6.74 % increase in porosity and 207.96 % upsurge in mechanical strength, compared to PCL scaffolds. The Gene-expression also proves the study groups of scaffolds show the minimal osteogenic expression. Therefore, chitosan coating over the scaffold's pore wall's surface opens an unconventional approach for tissue engineering applications.

KW  - CDH1
KW  - iTRAQ
AB  - MARCH8 is an E3 ligase, primarily involved in immune-modulation. Recently, we reported its aberrant expression in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. However, exact mechanisms by which it regulates cancer have been poorly understood. We applied high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to identify downstream protein targets of MARCH8. Silencing of endogenous MARCH8 in ESCC cells followed by LC-MS/MS analysis led to identification of 1,029 unique proteins showing altered expression post MARCH8 knockdown. Several previously reported MARCH8 target proteins viz. TFR1, syntaxin-4, e-cadherin and CD44 were found to be upregulated. Furthermore, new putative targets of MARCH8, including beta 2M, were identified in the present study. We demonstrated that MARCH8 interacts with and ubiquitinates CDH1 and beta 2M. Inhibiting proteasome activity with MG132 prevented CDH1 and beta 2M degradation, indicating that MARCH8 might be targeting CDH1 and beta 2M for proteasomal degradation. Further, loss of pm and CDH1 expression significantly and inversely correlated with MARCH8 expression in ESCC tissues (r = -0.737 and - 0.651, respectively; p < 0.01). In conclusion, our present study has led to identification of new targets of MARCH8 and suggests the role of MARCH8 in regulating CDH1 and beta 2M turnover in esophageal cancer cells.
   Significance: The use of quantitative proteomics carried out has led to the recognition of new targets of MARCH8. The present study gives a broad understanding of the molecular remodeling arising in the ESCC after MARCH8 knockdown. The study also solidifies the idea that role of MARCH8 is not just limited to immunomodulation as silencing of MARCH8 affects various other processes such as protein processing and localization. This study might help in understanding the regulation of MARCH8 in ESCCs and the mechanism by which MARCH8 might be facilitating cancer cells to evade immune surveillance.

AB  - We analyzed the data from 326 patients with multiple myeloma to evaluate the effect of induction therapy on transplant outcomes. Triplet-based induction was superior to doublet-based induction. However, the overall and complete response rates, median overall and progression-free survival were similar. The initial response (chemosensitivity) to induction therapy prepared patients better for subsequent consolidation, with transplant leading to favorable outcomes.
   Background: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) aged <= 65 to 70 years, with a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and no major comorbid conditions, are considered potential candidates for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) and will be treated with novel agent-based induction therapy for 4 to 6 cycles before ASCT. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the data from 326 patients with MM who had received novel agent-based induction before ASCT at our center to evaluate the effect of induction therapy on ASCT response, stem cell mobilization, engraftment characteristics, and survival. The median age was 52 years (range, 29-72 years), 216 patients were men (66.3%), 32.7% had stage III using the Revised Multiple Myeloma International Staging System, and 15.8% had high-risk cytogenetics. Of the 326 patients, 75 (23.0%) had undergone ASCT in second remission after salvage therapy for relapse. Also, 194 patients (59.5%) had received doublet induction therapy and 132 (40.5%) had received triplet induction therapy. Results: Triplet-based induction therapy was superior to doublet-based therapy for response (95.4% vs. 84.02%; P < .003), stem cell mobilization (CD34(+) >= 2 x 10(6)/kg; 88.6% vs. 76.8%; P < .005), and lower 100-day transplant-related mortality (P < .001). The >= 100 day post-ASCT overall response (97.4% vs. 91.7%; P = .124) and complete response (72.5% vs. 68.0%; P= .38) rates were similar. At a median follow-up of 62.5 months, the overall survival (97.5 months vs. 100.0 months; P = .606) and progression-free survival (54.5 months vs. 57 months; P= .515) were similar between the triplet and doublet induction groups. Conclusion: An initial response (chemosensitivity) to induction therapy will prepare patients better for subsequent consolidation therapy and ASCT, leading to favorable outcomes.

AB  - Smoking is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in different non-communicable diseases, and cessation leads to immense health benefits. The present network meta-analysis has been conducted to evaluate and compare the effects of available pharmacological interventions for smoking cessation in adults. A standard meta-analysis protocol was developed and after performing a comprehensive literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane databases, and International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, reviewers extracted data from 97 randomized controlled trials. PRISMA guidelines were followed in data extraction, analysis and reporting of findings. Random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis was done to pool the effects across the interventions. Network graph was built, and for closed triangles in the network graph, node splitting analysis was performed. The primary outcome measure was self-reported biochemically verified smoking abstinence at six months. The number of participants achieving continuous abstinence was reported. Data for the number of participants reporting at least one adverse event was also extracted, if available. Combination of nicotine receptor agonist and nicotine replacement therapy had a significant odd of 4.4 (95%CrI:2.2-8.7), bupropion and nicotine receptor agonist 4.0 (95%CrI:2.1-7.7), bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy 3.8 (95%CrI:2.3-6.2), combination nicotine replacement therapy has an odd of 2.6 (95%CrI:1.8-3.8), and nicotine receptor agonist had a significant odd of 2.7 (95%CrI:2.3-3.2) when compared to placebo (moderate quality of evidence) for continuous abstinence at 6 months. When compared with behavioural therapy, the odds ratio of interventions was not statistically significant. Combination of nicotine receptor agonist and nicotine replacement therapy has the highest probability of being the best treatment for abstinence from smoking.

AB  - Objectives: The authors herein report the results of esophageal replacement by gastric pull-up technique through the retrosternal route as an option for esophageal replacement in a resource-constrained setup.
   Method: Prospectively collected data upon twenty-two consecutive patients (male:female = 17:5) with mean age 24.9 months (7 months-12 years) and mean weight 7.9 kg (4.2-32 kg) who underwent retrosternal gastric pull-up for esophageal atresia (n = 18; 16 atresia with distal fistula & 2 pure atresia) and corrosive injuries to the esophagus (n = 4) over the past 8 years are presented.
   The management protocol and surgical technique have been described.
   Observations parameters included indication for esophageal replacement, age at surgery, sex of the child and other demographic details, clinical and operative findings, post-operative outcomes and follow-up details.
   Results: Retrosternal gastric pull-up could be performed in all cases with no mortality or graft loss. Of 22, 20 cases were extubated on-table and 2 cases were extubated within 48 hours of surgery.
   Mean operative duration was 265 min (range: 175 min to 310 min) and blood loss was 115.3 ml (range: 80-400 ml). Dense vascular adhesions in the region of the esophageal hiatus were encountered in patients with abdominal esophagostomy (n = 4) which were probably related to the local dissection at the time of previous surgery.
   Minor anastomotic leak was observed in 8 of 22 patients which settled spontaneously over 21 days mean period (range: 18 to 31 days). Antegrade dilatation was required in 3 of 8 cases with minor leak. None of them required revision of anastomosis.
   Mean follow-up duration is 63 months (range: 11 months - 94 months). Weight gain after surgery was close to or beyond the 25th centile. Symptoms of dumping syndrome or GER were not observed in our cohort.
   Conclusion: Our data have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of esophageal replacement by gastric transposition through the retrosternal route in a resource-limited setup. No significant difference has been observed from the results and complications reported in literature for the same procedure.

AB  - Aims Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital malformation. Despite the worldwide burden to patient wellbeing and health system resource utilization, tracking of long-term outcomes is lacking, limiting the delivery and measurement of high-value care. To begin transitioning to value-based healthcare in CHD, the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement aligned an international collaborative of CHD experts, patient representatives, and other stakeholders to construct a standard set of outcomes and risk-adjustment variables that are meaningful to patients.
   Methods and results The primary aim was to identify a minimum standard set of outcomes to be used by health systems worldwide. The methodological process included four key steps: (i) develop a working group representative of all CHD stakeholders; (ii) conduct extensive literature reviews to identify scope, outcomes of interest, tools used to measure outcomes, and case-mix adjustment variables; (iii) create the outcome set using a series of multi-round Delphi processes; and (iv) disseminate set worldwide. The Working Group established a 15-item outcome set, incorporating physical, mental, social, and overall health outcomes accompanied by tools for measurement and case-mix adjustment variables. Patients with any CHD diagnoses of all ages are included. Following an open review process, over 80% of patients and providers surveyed agreed with the set in its final form.
   Conclusion This is the first international development of a stakeholder-informed standard set of outcomes for CHD. It can serve as a first step for a lifespan outcomes measurement approach to guide benchmarking and improvement among health systems.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are an evolutionarily conserved novel class of non-coding endogenous RNAs (ncRNAs) found in the eukaryotic transcriptome, originally believed to be aberrant RNA splicing by-products with decreased functionality. However, recent advances in high-throughput genomic technology have allowed circRNAs to be characterized in detail and revealed their role in controlling various biological and molecular processes, the most essential being gene regulation. Because of the structural stability, high expression, availability of microRNA (miRNA) binding sites and tissue-specific expression, circRNAs have become hot topic of research in RNA biology. Compared to the linear RNA, circRNAs are produced differentially by backsplicing exons or lariat introns from a pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) forming a covalently closed loop structure missing 3 ' poly-(A) tail or 5 ' cap, rendering them immune to exonuclease-mediated degradation. Emerging research has identified multifaceted roles of circRNAs as miRNA and RNA binding protein (RBP) sponges and transcription, translation, and splicing event regulators. CircRNAs have been involved in many human illnesses, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, due to their aberrant expression in different pathological conditions. The functional versatility exhibited by circRNAs enables them to serve as potential diagnostic or predictive biomarkers for various diseases. This review discusses the properties, characterization, profiling, and the diverse molecular mechanisms of circRNAs and their use as potential therapeutic targets in different human malignancies.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) considers COVID-19 a great threat to humanity and, thus, declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To limit its transmission, governments announced lockdowns in their respective nations, and recommended control measures, including behavior change. Persons with disabilities (PwDs) are among the population that may be at a higher risk of becoming infected and may suffer serious illness due to COVID-19. Additionally, lockdowns pose immense challenges and have tremendous impacts on PwDs in terms of receiving their daily support. To mitigate these challenges, their impact, and to reduce the risk of infection, it is important to design strategies that can improve the overall outcome for PwDs. This study therefore intends to provide a uniform strategy or guideline using the person-centered approach principles which is perhaps the most feasible and implementable approach to circumvent the challenges faced by PwDs during emergency lockdowns. Two case studies are used as examples. This pandemic also provides an opportunity for health care planners and policymakers in the health sector to implement reforms to ensure disability inclusiveness in potential future emergency lockdowns.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) failure is not uniform in India. In this study we attempted to determine the prevalence and risk factors of treatment failure among patients who were on ART for >1 y.
   Methods: We conducted an ambispective study from 2017 to 2019 in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Patients and their past medical records were examined to determine clinical, immunological and virological failure.
   Results: Among 301 enrolled patients, the majority was male (61.8%), with a mean age of 36.98 +/- 10.84 y. The prevalence of ART failure in our study was 10.63% (32/301). Clinical, immunological and virological failure rates were 1.66%, 10.63% and 5.65%, respectively. The maximum chance of failure was the tenofovir-lamivudinenevirapine (33.3%) regimen followed by the stavudine-lamivudine-nevirapine (30.4%) regimen. Among the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, a stavudine-based regimen had a significantly greater chance of failure (25.8%) compared with tenofovir (9.6%) and zidovudine (7.9%) regimens (p<0.005). Lowbaseline CD4 count and development of tuberculosis after ART initiation were significantly (p<0.05) associated with treatment failure in univariate analysis. Patients with a low peak CD4 count (adjusted odds ratio [AOR 4.26 {95% confidence interval <CI> 1.83 to 9.88}]) and who developed symptoms after ART initiation (AOR 3.77 [95% CI 1.47 to 9.69]) had significantly higher odds of treatment failure in the multivariate analysis (p<0.001).
   Conclusions: Early identification of risk factors by regular follow-up and selection of the proper ART regimen can reduce the rate of treatment failure.

AB  - Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique with potential applications in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Applications of amide proton transfer-weighted (APT-w), glutamate-weighted (Glu-w) and creatine-weighted (Cr-w) CEST, among others, have been reported. In general, CEST data are acquired at multiple offset-frequencies. In reported studies, different offset-frequency step sizes and interpolation methods have been used during B-0 inhomogeneity correction of data. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the effects of different step sizes and interpolation methods on CEST value computation. In the current study, simulation (Glu-w, Cr-w and APT-w) and experimental data from the brain were used. Experimental CEST data (Glu-w) were acquired from human volunteers at 7 T and brain tumor patients (APT-w) at 3 T. During B-0 inhomogeneity correction, different interpolation methods (polynomial [degree-1, 2 and 3], cubic-Hermite, cubic-spline and smoothing-spline) were compared. CEST values were computed using asymmetry analysis. The effects of different step sizes and interpolation methods were evaluated using coefficient of variation (CV), normalized mean square error (nMSE) and coefficient of correlation parameters. Additionally, an optimum interpolation method for APT-w values was selected based upon fitting accuracy, T-test, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and its diagnostic performance in differentiating low-grade and high-grade tumors. CV and nMSE increase with an increase in step size irrespective of the interpolation method (except for cubic-Hermite and cubic-spline). The nMSE of Cr-w and Glu-w CEST values were least for polynomial (degree-2 and 3). The quality of Glu-w CEST maps became coarse with the increase in step size. There was a significant difference (P < .05) between low-grade and high-grade tumors using polynomial interpolation (degree-1, 2 and 3); however, linear interpolation outperforms other methods for APT-w data, providing the highest sensitivity and specificity. In conclusion, depending upon the saturation parameters and field strength, optimization of step size and interpolation should be carried out for different CEST metabolites/molecules. Glu-w, Cr-w and APT-w CEST data should be acquired with a step size of between 0.2 and 0.3 ppm. For B-0 inhomogeneity correction, polynomial (degree-2) should be used for Glu-w and Cr-w CEST data at 7 T and linear interpolation should be used for APT-w data at 3 T for a limited frequency range.

AB  - Context: Basal-ganglia calcification (BGC) is common (70%) in patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism. Interestingly, cortical gray matter is spared from calcification. The mechanism of BGC, role of hyperphosphatemia, and modulation of osteogenic molecules by parathyroid hormone (PTH) in its pathogenesis is not clear.
   Objective: We assessed the expression of a large repertoire of molecules with proosteogenic or antiosteogenic effects, including neuroprogenitor cells in caudate, dentate, and cortical gray matter from normal autopsy tissues. The effect of high phosphate and PTH was assessed in an ex vivo model of BGC using striatum tissue culture of the Sprague-Dawley rat.
   Methods: The messenger RNA and protein expression of 39 molecules involved in multiple osteogenic pathways were assessed in 25 autopsy tissues using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. The striatal culture was maintained in a hypoparathyroid milieu for 24 days with and without (a) high phosphate (10-mm beta-glycerophosphate) and (b) PTH(1-34) (50 ng/mL Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 media) for their effect on striatal calcification and osteogenic molecules.
   Results: Procalcification molecules (osteonectin, beta-catenin, klotho, FZD4, NT5E, LRP5, WNT3A, collagen-1 alpha, and SOX2-positive neuroprogenitor stem cells) had significantly higher expression in the caudate than gray matter. Caudate nuclei also had higher expression of antiosteogenic molecules (osteopontin, carbonic anhydrase-II [CA-II], MGP, sclerostin, ISG15, ENPP1, and USP18). In an ex vivo model, striatum culture showed an increased propensity for calcified nodules with mineral deposition similar to that of bone tissue on Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, alizarin, and von Kossa stain. Mineralization in striatel culture was enhanced by high phosphate and decreased by exogenous PTH through increased expression of CA-II.
   Conclusion: This study provides a conceptual advance on the molecular mechanisms of BGC and the possibility of PTH therapy to prevent this complication in a hypoparathyroid milieu.

AB  - Nasogastric tube insertion is a common bedside procedure. In an awake patient, unexpected passage into airway is easily noticeable due to the gag reflex; however, in the case of ventilated patients false cannulation is liable to be missed, unless insertion is carried out under direct visualization. We present a case of passage of nasogastric tube into peripheral bronchiole of the right lung, which was initially missed on chest radiography. This case report highlights the fallacy of relying on a chest radiograph.

AB  - Pneumococcal carriage studies are important for vaccine introduction and treatment strategies. Pneumococcal carriage rates estimated in this cohort study among children in a rural community of northern India. Between August 2012 and August 2014, trained nurses made weekly home visits to screen enrolled children aged <10 years for acute upper or lower respiratory infections (AURI/ALRI) in Ballabgarh, Haryana. Nasal swab from infants aged <1year and throat swab from children aged >= 1 year were collected. All specimens were cultured for pneumococci; isolates were serotyped and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. During the study period, 4348 nasal/throat swabs collected from children with clinical features of ARI (836 ALRI, 2492 AURI) and from 1020 asymptomatic children. Overall pneumococcal carriage was 5.1%, the highest carriage rate among children <1 year of age (22.6%). The detection rates were higher among children with ARI (5.6%; 95% CI: 4.8-6.4) than asymptomatic children (3.3%; 95% CI: 2.3-4.6). Among 220 pneumococcal isolates, 42 diverse serotypes were identified, with 6B/C (8.6%), 19A (7.2%), 19F (6.8%), 23F (6.4%), 35A/B/C (6.4%), 15B (5%), 14 (4.5%) and 11A/C/D (3.2%) accounting for 50%. Forty-five percent of the serotypes identified are included in the current formulation of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Ninety-six percent of isolates were resistant to co-trimoxazole, 9% were resistant to erythromycin, and 10% had intermediate resistance to penicillin with minimum inhibitory concentration ranges (0.125 to 1.5 mu g/ml). Pneumococcal detection was relatively low among children in our study community but demonstrated a diverse range of serotypes and half of these serotypes would be covered by the current formulation of 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine.

AB  - Background
   Dysregulated oncomiRs are attributed to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through targeting mTOR signaling pathway responsible for cell growth and proliferation. The potential of these oncomiRs as biomarker for tumor response or as target for therapy needs to be evaluated.
   AIM
   Tumor response assessment by OncomiR changes following locoregional therapy (LRT) and targeting of these oncomiRs modulating pathway
   Methods
   All consecutive viral-HCC patients of BCLC stage-A/B undergoing LRT were included. OncomiRs (miR-21, -221, and -16) change in circulation and AFP-ratio at 1-month post-LRT to baseline was estimated to differentiate various categories of response as per mRECIST criteria. OncomiR modulating mTOR pathway was studied by generating miR-21 and miR-221 overexpressing Huh7 stable cell lines.
   Results
   Post-LRT tumor response was assessed in 90 viral-HCC patients (CR, 40%; PR, 31%, and PD, 29%). Significant increase of miRNA-21 and -221 expression was observed in PD (p = 0.040, 0.047) and PR patients (miR-21, p = 0.045). Fold changes of miR-21 can differentiate response in group (CR from PR+PD) at AUROC 0.718 (95% CI, 0.572-0.799) and CR from PD at AUROC 0.734 (95% CI, 0.595-0.873). Overexpression of miR-21 in hepatoma cell line had shown increased phosphorylation p70S6K, the downstream regulator of cell proliferation in mTOR pathway. Upregulation of AKT, mTOR, and RPS6KB1 genes were found significant (P < 0.005) and anti-miR-21 specifically reduced mTOR gene (P = 0.02) expression.
   Conclusions
   The miR-21 fold change correlates well with imaging in predicting tumor response. Overexpression of miR-21 has a role in HCC through mTOR pathway activation and can be targeted.

TI  - Cytoplasmic vacuolation with endoplasmic reticulum stress directs sorafenib induced non-apoptotic cell death in hepatic stellate cells
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the major cells that secrete the ECM proteins and drive the pathogenesis of fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Targeting of HSCs by modulating their activation and proliferation has emerged as a promising approach in the development of anti-fibrotic therapy. Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor has shown anti-fibrotic properties by inhibiting the survival and proliferation of HSCs. In present study we investigated sorafenib induced cytoplasmic vacuolation mediated decreased cell viability of HSCs in dose and time dependent manner. In this circumstance, sorafenib induces ROS and ER stress in HSCs without involvement of autophagic signals. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide treatment significantly decreased the sorafenib-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation with increasing cell viability. Antioxidant human serum albumin influences the viability of HSCs by reducing sorafenib induced vacuolation and cell death. However, neither caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK nor autophagy inhibitor chloroquine could rescue the HSCs from sorafenib-induced cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death. Using TEM and ER organelle tracker, we conclude that the cytoplasmic vacuoles are due to ER dilation. Sorafenib treatment induces calreticulin and GPR78, and activates IRE1 alpha -XBP1s axis of UPR pathway, which eventually trigger the non-apoptotic cell death in HSCs. This study provides a notable mechanistic insight into the ER stress directed non-apoptotic cell death with future directions for the development of efficient anti-fibrotic therapeutic strategies.

AB  - In this report, we discuss the design of a novel collagen/pectin (CP) hybrid composite hydrogel (CPBG) containing in-situ mineralized bioactive glass (BG) particles to simulate an integrative 3D cell environment. Systematic analysis of the CP sol revealed collagen and pectin molecules interacted regardless of both possessing similar net negative charge through the mechanism of surface patch binding interaction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) confirmed this associative interaction which resulted in the formation of a hybrid crosslinked network with the BG nanoparticles acting as pseudo crosslink junctions. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis (EDAX) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) results confirmed uniform mineralization of BG particles, and their synergetic interaction with the network. The in-vitro bioactivity tests on CPBG indicated the formation of bone-like hydroxyapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)(OH)(2)) microuystals on its surface after interaction with simulated body fluid. This hydrogel was loaded with a model antifungal drug amphotericin-B (AmB) and tested against Candida albicans. The AmB release kinetics from the hydrogel followed the Fiddan mechanism and showed direct proportionality to gel swelling behavior. Rheological analysis revealed the viscoelastic compatibility of CPBG for the mechanical load bearing applications. Cell viability tests indicated appreciable compatibility of the hydrogel against U2OS and HaCaT cell lines. FDA/PI on the hydrogel portrayed preferential U2OS cell adhesion on hydrophobic hydroxyapatite layer compared to hydrophilic surfaces, thereby promising the regeneration of both soft and hard tissues.

AB  - Extraskeletal osteosarcoma is a very infrequently diagnosed soft-tissue sarcoma subtype which has identical histological features to bone osteosarcoma. However, its demographics, presentation, radiology and treatment strategy differ from those of osteosarcoma. Its diagnosis can be at times challenging due to radiological and pathological mimics which have more common incidence. A multimodality approach is essential for optimizing the outcomes in extraskeletal osteosarcoma. Although there are certain caveats on inclusion of adjuvant therapies (radiotherapy and chemotherapy), in all cases surgical resection with wide local margins is considered the gold standard for adequate local control. The outcome in advanced disease remains dismal and there is a huge unmet need for prospective studies addressing the optimal treatment strategy. In this article we review the evidence available for the management of extraskeletal osteosarcoma.
   Lay abstract
   Extraskeletal osteosarcomas are cancerous outgrowths (tumors) arising from the soft tissues of the human body, outside the skeletal framework. They closely resemble their counterparts arising from the bone, known as osteosarcomas (osteo: bone; sarcoma: a type of cancer affecting soft tissues) with the exception that they have no bony connections. These tumors are rare, arising most commonly from the extremities (upper and lower limbs). They present with slowly enlarging masses that may be associated with pain. Treatment involves surgery (removal of the tumor alone or the affected limb), use of chemotherapeutic drugs (drugs acting on cancerous cells) and radiotherapy. The outcome of these tumors is poor, with most patients succumbing to disease during follow-up.

AB  - Despite tremendous resources being invested in prevention and treatment, breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer deaths in women globally. The available treatment modalities are very costly and produces severe side effects. Drug repurposing that relate to new uses for old drugs has emerged as a novel approach for drug development. Repositioning of old, clinically approved, off patent non-cancer drugs with known targets, into newer indication is like using old weapons for new battle. The advances in genomics, proteomics and information computational biology has facilitated the process of drug repurposing. Repositioning approach not only fastens the process of drug development but also offers more effective, cheaper, safer drugs with lesser/known side effects. During the last decade, drugs such as alkylating agents, anthracyclins, antimetabolite, CDK4/6 inhibitor, aromatase inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor and mitotic inhibitors has been repositioned for breast cancer treatment. The repositioned drugs have been successfully used for the treatment of most aggressive triple negative breast cancer. The literature review suggest that serendipity plays a major role in the drug development. This article describes the comprehensive overview of the current scenario of drug repurposing for the breast cancer treatment. The strategies as well as several examples of repurposed drugs are provided. The challenges associated with drug repurposing are discussed.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in both transitioned and transitioning countries and has become a major women's health problem. Although recent advances in our understanding of the biological nature of cancer, improved awareness coupled with better early detection facilities, use of chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy have significantly improved survival from cancer, there are many gaps in providing individual-centric, holistic care. Integrative medicine refers to the use of traditional medicine alongside conventional preventive or therapeutic interventions (allopathic medicine) as a comprehensive, individual-centered, evidence-based care. The three pillars of complementary medicine (lifestyle modifications, mind-body practices, and use of natural products) have the potential for cancer prevention and improving quality-of-life and even treatment response in cancer patients when combined with conventional oncology care. Therefore, continued research into integrative therapies is required to extend the benefits to a broader patient population and improve outcomes in breast and other common cancers. In the present review article, the possible role of integrative medicine across the breast cancer care continuum has been discussed along with the concept of integrating complementary practices into mainstream health delivery. We have focused on breast cancer as a model cancer that is well amenable to prevention, early detection and stage appropriate treatment. However, our observations are pertinent for other common cancers, for which there are several opportunities for improving the continuum of care, especially in developing countries like India.

AB  - Background Sarcopenia and visceral fat independently predict poor outcomes in Crohn's disease (CD). However, combined influence of these parameters on outcomes is unknown, and was investigated in the present study. Methods This retrospective study evaluated skeletal muscle index (SMI-cross-sectional area of five skeletal muscles normalized for height), visceral and subcutaneous fat area and their ratio (VF/SC) on single-slice computed tomography (CT) images at L3 vertebrae in CD patients (CT done: January 2012-December 2015, patients followed till December 2019). Sarcopenia was defined as SMI < 36.5 cm(2)/m(2) and 30.2 cm(2)/m(2) for males and females, respectively. Disease severity, behavior, and long-term outcomes (surgery and disease course) were compared with respect to sarcopenia and VF/SC ratio. Results Forty-four patients [age at onset: 34.4 +/- 14.1 years, median disease duration: 48 (24-95) months, follow-up duration: 32 (12-53.5) months, males: 63.6%] were included. Prevalence of sarcopenia was 43%, more in females, but independent of age, disease severity, behavior and location. More patients with sarcopenia underwent surgery (31.6% vs 4%, p = 0.01). VF/SC was significantly higher in patients who underwent surgery (1.76 + 1.31 vs 0.9 + 0.41, p = 0.002), and a cutoff of 0.88 could predict surgery with sensitivity and specificity of 71% and 65% respectively. On survival analysis, probability of remaining free of surgery was lower in patients with sarcopenia (59.6% vs 94.1% p = 0.01) and those with VF/SC > 0.88 (66.1% vs 91.1%, p = 0.1), and still lower in those with both sarcopenia and VF/SC > 0.88 than those with either or none (38% vs 82% vs 100%, p = 0.01). Conclusions Combination of sarcopenia and high visceral fat predict worse outcomes in CD than either.

AB  - Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO) is an autoimmune disease of the retroocular tissue occurring in patients with Grave's disease leading to exophthalmos. Exophthalmos is usually detected by inspection using Nafziger's method and objectively measured with Hertel's exophthalmometry. Here we have described a novel technique "Pen touch test" to clinically diagnose exophthalmos. This cross-sectional study was conducted on patients with suspicious hyperthyroid ophthalmopathy/Grave's ophthalmopathy (GO) who underwent eye examination by Nafziger's method and our proposed new method "Pen Touch Test (PTT)". In this test, a clean ruler or pen is held straight over the middle of orbital ridge touching the superior orbital margin and ipsilateral malar eminence. In normal persons, the ruler or pen touches both the superior orbital margin and ipsilateral malar eminence with or without touching eyelids. In patients with GO, there is true bulging forward of the eyeball. Hence, the ruler or pen cannot be made to touch both upper orbital margin and malar eminence simultanously. The presence and degree of exophthalmos was measured objectively on Hertel's exophthalmometry, which was considered the "gold standard". Pen touch test was found to have 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity and 100% Positive Predictive value. Whereas Nafziger's method had a sensitivity of only 75% compared to Hertel's exophthalmometry as gold standard test. "Pen touch test" is simple and sensitive method that can be used to screen for exophthalmos in suspected cases of Grave's ophthalmopathy.

AB  - Early-stage diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is difficult due to non-specific symptoms. Circulating miRNAs in body fluids have been emerging as potential non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosis of many cancers. Thus, this study aimed to assess a panel of miRNAs for their ability to differentiate PDAC from chronic pancreatitis (CP), a benign inflammatory condition of the pancreas. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify miRNAs present in 60 FFPE tissue samples (27 PDAC, 23 CP and 10 normal pancreatic tissues). Four up-regulated miRNAs (miR-215-5p, miR-122-5p, miR-192-5p, and miR-181a-2-3p) and four down-regulated miRNAs (miR-30b-5p, miR-216b-5p, miR-320b, and miR-214-5p) in PDAC compared to CP were selected based on next-generation sequencing results. The levels of these 8 differentially expressed miRNAs were measured by qRT-PCR in 125 serum samples (50 PDAC, 50 CP, and 25 healthy controls (HC)). The results showed significant upregulation of miR-215-5p, miR-122-5p, and miR-192-5p in PDAC serum samples. In contrast, levels of miR-30b-5p and miR-320b were significantly lower in PDAC as compared to CP and HC. ROC analysis showed that these 5 miRNAs can distinguish PDAC from both CP and HC. Hence, this panel can serve as a non-invasive biomarker for the early detection of PDAC.

AB  - Transjugular liver biopsy (TJLB) is widely used in adults when percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB) is contraindicated. The authors evaluated the safety, efficacy and utility of TJLB in pediatric patients with contraindications to PLB. Twenty-three children and adolescents (13 male) underwent 24 (one patient had two separate biopsies) consecutive biopsies (TJLB) under general anaesthesia (18) or intravenous sedation (6). PLB was contraindicated because of elevated prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR) (> 15.5/1.5) in 19 (79.2%) and thrombocytopenia (< 60,000/dL) in 15 (62.5%) procedures. Derangement in both INR and platelet count were found in 12 (50%) cases. Significant ascites was present in 10 (41.7%) procedures. Technical success rate with adequate biopsy sample was 95.8% (23/24) with no major complications. A new diagnosis was established in 9 (37.5%) cases. Another 14 (58.34%) biopsies confirmed the initial diagnoses. Four cases also revealed additional information guiding overall management and prognosis. Thus, TJLB is a safe and useful procedure in children.

AB  - Aim: Evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health utility impact of single-agent selinexor in heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients & methods: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) - Lymphoma and EuroQoL five-dimensions five-levels data collected in the single-arm Phase IIb trial SADAL (NCT02227251) were analyzed with mixed-effects models. Results: Treatment responders maintained higher FACT - Lymphoma (p <= 0.05), FACT - General (p < 0.05) and EuroQoL five-dimensions five-levels index scores (p < 0.001) beginning in cycle 3. The estimated difference in health state utilities for treatment response and progressive disease was both statistically significant and clinically meaningful (mean difference: 0.07; p = 0.001). Conclusion: In patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, objective response to selinexor was associated with HRQoL maintenance, reduction in disease-related HRQoL decrements and higher health utilities.
   Lay abstract
   This work examined quality of life (QoL) among patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with two to five prior therapies who received single-agent selinexor in the SADAL clinical trial. Analysis of patient-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma and EuroQoL five-dimensions five-levels data showed that patients who had objective clinical response to selinexor maintained their QoL over the course of treatment. Grade >= 3 adverse events and serious adverse events were not associated with clinically meaningful negative QoL impacts.

AB  - Antiparasitic treatment improves the prognosis for neurocysticercosis (NCC)-induced seizures. However, patients with high lesion loads are typically denied the possible benefit of cysticidal therapy because of fear of complications, and such patients are not represented in clinical trials involving cysticidal therapy. We provide proof of concept for combination treatment with dual antiparasitic therapy and corticosteroids in patients with diffuse lesions, including starry sky patterns, or calcific NCC. The safety and efficacy of treating patients with high lesion loads or calcific NCC should be tested in a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Preoperative testing and evaluation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been an enigmatic challenge for the neurosurgical community during the pandemic. Since the beginning of the pandemic, laboratory diagnostic methods have evolved substantially, and with them has been the necessity for readily available, fast, and accurate preoperative testing methods. In this article, we provide an overview of the various laboratory testing methods that are presently available and a comprehensive literature review how various institutes and neurosurgical communities across the globe are employing them to ensure safe and effective delivery of surgical care to patients. Through this review, we highlight the guiding principles for preoperative testing, which may serve as a road map for other medical institutions to follow. In addition, we provide an Indian perspective of preoperative testing and share our experience in this regard.

AB  - Intermittent hypoxia and transient arousals in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can lead to poor sleep quality and acute stress. Rising levels of obesity and increased incidence of OSA in young adults predisposes them to acute stress. We propose a mediation model to assess if risk of OSA is associated with acute stress and if the relationship between risk for OSA and acute stress is mediated by sleep quality. 493 healthy individuals (F = 237, M = 256) from 18 - 25 years of age (mean age 20.3 +/- 1.53 years) were screened for OSA, sleep quality and acute stress using STOP-BANG questionnaire, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index and American Psychiatry Association's National Stressful Events Survey Acute Stress Disorder Short Scale (NSESS-S), respectively. 73 participants (17.3%) were found at an intermediate and high risk of OSA by STOP BANG questionnaire. 79 (16%) participants reported level of stress as 'None'. Mild, moderate and severe stress was present in 248 (50.3%), 109 (22.1%), 51 (10.3%) and 16 (3.2%) participants, respectively. The odds of having severe and extreme stress among those at risk of sleep apnea is 2.18 times higher than that among those not at risk of sleep apnea (OR: 2.18, 95%, confidence interval: 1.37-3.51). Sobel test established that the relationship between OSA and acute stress is mediated by sleep quality. Sleep quality mediates the relationship between risk for sleep apnea and acute stress. This highlights the importance of screening for OSA in young adults, particularly young men with high BMI, presenting with high stress levels.

AB  - Keratoconus is an ectatic corneal disease characterized by progressive stromal thinning, irregular astigmatism, and defective vision. It can be unilateral or bilateral with asymmetric presentation. It starts at puberty and either progresses rapidly to an advanced stage of the disease or stops in case of delayed onset and slow progression. Pediatric keratoconus is more aggressive than in adults and the management protocols differ because of various rationales such as accelerated progression, advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and co-morbidities. It poses a burden to the society as it affects the quality of life, social, and educational development in children. Hence early diagnosis, recognition of progression, and timely intervention with collagen crosslinking is imperative to arrest the worsening. Association with systemic syndromes and ocular comorbidities can be of concern in pediatric keratoconus. Severe ocular allergy when associated hastens progress and complicates timely intervention of crosslinking treatment and compliance to contact lens wear. Keratoplasty in pediatric keratoconus has good outcomes but can encounter frequent suture-related concerns. This article discusses the epidemiology, etiopathogenesic, dinical challenges, and current perspectives of management of pediatric keratoconus.

AB  - Recovery after ischemic stroke is slow and highly variable. Activated ROCK (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase) pathway hampers recovery of impaired neurons. Though inhibiting ROCK pathway has shown therapeutic effects in vitro, the selectivity of most of the ROCK inhibitors is still not investigated. Present study aims to investigate the binding affinity in silico of nine widely used ROCK inhibitors with brain-specific ROCK2 isoform. Three-dimensional structures of ROCK2 and eight drugs were taken from Protein Data Bank and PubChem Chemical Compound Database, respectively, whereas, FSD-C10 structure was generated based on Xin et al., 2015. In docking, ROCK2 was set to be rigid and drugs were free to rotate. All simulations were carried out using AutoDock 4.2. This study demonstrated strong complexation between all ligands and ROCK2. All ROCK inhibitors, except FSD-C10, were able to bind to ROCK2 more strongly [Binding constant (K-a) between 2.6 - 36.7 X 10(5) M-1] than fasudil (Ka = 2.5 X 10(5) M-1). SLx-2119 (KD-025) had the highest binding constant (K-a = 36.7 X 10(5) M-1) thus succeeding as a better ROCK2 specific inhibitor. Selectivity of ROCK inhibitors (in silico) towards ROCK2 can be an indicative measure to estimate therapeutic benefits or adverse effects prior to in vitro study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been identified as an independent predictor of poor outcome in numerous studies.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential protective role of inhalational anesthetics against angiographic vasospasm, DCI, and neurologic outcome in SAH patients.
   METHODS: After Institutional Review Board approval, data were collected retrospectively for SAH patients who received general anesthesia for aneurysm repair between January 1st, 2010 and May 31st, 2018. Primary outcomes were angiographic vasospasm, DCI, and neurologic outcome as measured by modified Rankin scale at hospital discharge. Univariate and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify independent predictors of these outcomes.
   RESULTS: The cohort included 390 SAH patients with an average age of 56 15 (mean +/- SD). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified inhalational anesthetic only technique, Hunt-Hess grade, age, anterior circulation aneurysm and average intraoperative mean blood pressure as independent predictors of angiographic vasospasm. Inhalational anesthetic only technique and modified Fishers grade were identified as independent predictors of DCI. No impact on neurological outcome at time of discharge was noted.
   CONCLUSION: Our data provide additional evidence that inhalational anesthetic conditioning in SAH patients affords protection against angiographic vasospasm and new evidence that it exerts a protective effect against DCI. When coupled with similar results from preclinical studies, our data suggest further investigation into the impact of inhalational anesthetic conditioning on SAH patients, including elucidating the most effective dosing regimen, defining the therapeutic window, determining whether a similar protective effect against early brain injury, and on long-term neurological outcome exists.

AB  - Background: despite being in the 5th month of pandemic, knowledge with respect to viral dynamics, infectivity and RT-PCR positivity continues to evolve.
   Aim: to analyse the SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCR profiles in COVID-19 patients.
   Design: it was a retrospective, observational study conducted at COVID facilities under AIIMS, New Delhi.
   Methods: patients admitted with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were eligible for enrolment. Patients with incomplete details, or only single PCR tests were excluded. Data regarding demographic details, comorbidities, treatment received and results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR performed on nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs, collected at different time points, was retrieved from the hospital records.
   Results: a total of 298 patients were included, majority were males (75.8%) with mean age of 39.07 years (0.6-88 years). The mean duration from symptom onset to first positive RT-PCR was 4.7 days (SD 3.67), while that of symptom onset to last positive test was 17.83 days (SD 6.22). Proportions of positive RT-PCR tests were 100%, 49%, 24%, 8.7% and 20.6% in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and >4 weeks of illness. A total of 12 symptomatic patients had prolonged positive test results even after 3 weeks of symptom onset. Age > = 60 years was associated with prolonged RT-PCR positivity (statistically significant).
   Conclusion: this study showed that the average period of PCR positivity is more than 2 weeks in COVID-19 patients; elderly patients have prolonged duration of RT-PCR positivity and requires further follow up.

AB  - Background and aims Following the recognition of 'internet gaming disorder' (IGD) as a condition requiring further study by the DSM-5, 'gaming disorder' (GD) was officially included as a diagnostic entity by the World Health Organization (WHO) in the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). However, the proposed diagnostic criteria for gaming disorder remain the subject of debate, and there has been no systematic attempt to integrate the views of different groups of experts. To achieve a more systematic agreement on this new disorder, this study employed the Delphi expert consensus method to obtain expert agreement on the diagnostic validity, clinical utility and prognostic value of the DSM-5 criteria and ICD-11 clinical guidelines for GD.
   Methods A total of 29 international experts with clinical and/or research experience in GD completed three iterative rounds of a Delphi survey. Experts rated proposed criteria in progressive rounds until a pre-determined level of agreement was achieved.
   Results For DSM-5 IGD criteria, there was an agreement both that a subset had high diagnostic validity, clinical utility and prognostic value and that some (e.g. tolerance, deception) had low diagnostic validity, clinical utility and prognostic value. Crucially, some DSM-5 criteria (e.g. escapism/mood regulation, tolerance) were regarded as incapable of distinguishing between problematic and non-problematic gaming. In contrast, ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for GD (except for the criterion relating to diminished non-gaming interests) were judged as presenting high diagnostic validity, clinical utility and prognostic value.
   Conclusions This Delphi survey provides a foundation for identifying the most diagnostically valid and clinically useful criteria for GD. There was expert agreement that some DSM-5 criteria were not clinically relevant and may pathologize non-problematic patterns of gaming, whereas ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines are likely to diagnose GD adequately and avoid pathologizing.

AB  - Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is often associated with higher levels of LH, and arrested ovarian follicular growth. The direct impact of high LH on FSH mediated metabolic responses in PCOS patients is not clearly understood.
   Method: In order to investigate the impact of FSH and LH on glucose metabolism in preovulatory granulosa cells (GCs), we used [U-C-14]-2 deoxyglucose, D-[U-C-14]-glucose or 2-NBD glucose to analyse glucose uptake and its incorporation into glycogen. To reproduce the high androgenic potential in PCOS patients, we administered hCG both in vitro and in vivo. The role of IRS-2/PI3K/Akt2 pathway was studied after knockdown with specific siRNA. Immunoprecipitation and specific assays were used for the assessment of IRS-2, glycogen synthase and protein phosphatase 1. Furthermore, we examined the in vivo effects of hCG on FSH mediated glycogen increase in normal and PCOS rat model. HEK293 cells co-expressing FSHR and LHR were used to demonstrate glucose uptake and BRET change by FSH and hCG.
   Results: In normal human and rat granulosa cells, FSH is more potent than hCG in stimulating glucose uptake, however glycogen synthesis was significantly upregulated only by FSH through increase in activity of glycogen synthase via IRS-2/P13K/Akt2 pathway. On the contrary, an impaired FSH-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in granulosa cells of PCOS-patients indicated a selective defect in FSHR activation. Further, in normal human granulosa cells, and in immature rat model, the impact of hCG on FSH responses was such that it inhibited the FSH-mediated glucose uptake as well as glycogen synthesis through inhibition of FSH-stimulated IRS-2 expression. These findings were further validated in HEK293 cells overexpressing Flag-LHR and HA-FSHR, where high hCG inhibited the FSH-stimulated glucose uptake. Notably, an increased BRET change was observed in HEK293 cells expressing FSHR-Rluc8 and LHR-Venus possibly suggesting increased bete romeri za lion of LHR and FSHR in the presence of both hCG and FSH in comparison to FSH or hCG alone.
   Conclusion: Our findings confirm a selective attenuation of metabolic responses to FSH such as glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis by high activation level of LHR leading to the inhibition of IRS-2 pathway, resulting in depleted glycogen stores and follicular growth arrest in PCOS patients.

AB  - Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is one of the major causes of blindness worldwide. The underlying genetic aetiology is complex in nature and molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we identify genomic alterations using haplotype-based genome-wide association study in 148 PACG and 92 anatomically predisposed non-glaucomatous individuals. Logistic regression was performed on each common haplotype (within blocks of 3-8 SNPs) across the genotype and a total of 59 SNPs were found below genome wide suggestive threshold (p<1e-05). We found majority of these SNPs (n = 13) are located in CNTNAP5 genic region. The prioritized rs780010 of CNTNAP5 is also significantly associated with Cup to Disc ratio, which is a clinical parameter directly correlated with glaucomatous neurodegeneration. We further validated rs780010, present in all the significant haplotype blocks with p-value = 2.131e-06 (discovery phase), in a separate replication cohort (PACG, n = 50; control, n = 39) and observed significant association (p = 0.012, per G allele OR = 2.3079; 95% CI: 1.23-4.33). Bioinformatics analyses also suggested neuronal expression of CNTNAP5 with active chromatin structure. KEGG pathway analysis indicates towards pathways related to apoptosis and neurodegeneration. Overall, these results not only indicate a strong genetic association of CNTNAP5 locus with PACG but also suggest its potential involvement in glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

AB  - Intraosseous pneumatocyst refers to gas-filled cystic lesions inside bone. Vertebral pneumatocysts are rare and most have been described to remain static over time. We report a rare case of an enlarging spinal pneumatocyst. A 58-year-old male patient with cervical ossified posterior longitudinal ligament with two cervical vertebral pneumatocysts (C4 and C5). The C5 cyst (9.91 x 5.9 x 4.3 mm) was larger than the C4. MRI was suggestive of compression at C4-5 and C5-6 level. Repeat imaging done eight months later showed an increase in the size of the C5 pneumatocyst (12.41 x 7.6 x 6.3 mm). In view of the enlarging pneumatocyst, patient underwent C5 corpectomy. Histopathological examination of the cyst wall revealed fibro-collagenous tissue with histiocytes and foreign body giant cells confirming the benign nature of the disease. This case highlights the importance of radiological follow up of a pneumatocyst.

AB  - A tightly regulated protein quality control (PQC) system maintains a healthy balance between correctly folded and misfolded protein species. This PQC system work with the help of a complex network comprised of molecular chaperones and proteostasis. Any intruder, especially environmental pollutants, disrupt the PQC network and lead to PQCs disruption, thus generating damaged and infectious protein. These misfolded/unfolded proteins are linked to several diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and cataracts. Numerous studies on proteins misfolding and disruption of PQCs by environmental pollutants highlight the necessity of detailed knowledge. This review represents the PQCs network and environmental pollutants' impact on the PQC network, especially through the protein clearance system.

TI  - Safety and Feasibility of Cervical Pedicle Screw Insertion in Pediatric Subaxial Cervical Spine Without Navigation: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC ORTHOPAEDICS
KW  - cervical pedicle screws
KW  - cervical spine
KW  - pediatric spine
KW  - spinal deformity
KW  - subaxial cervical spine
AB  - Background: The use of cervical pedicle screws (CPSs) in pediatric subaxial cervical spine has been scarcely reported in the literature. The biomechanical superiority of CPS over other methods of fixation is beneficial in surgery for correcting severe, rigid cervical/cervicothoracic deformity. Our study aims to assess the safety, efficacy, and feasibility of CPS fixation in pediatric subaxial cervical spine without intraoperative navigation. Methods: Eight pediatric patients requiring rigid subaxial cervical spine fixation for complex cervical deformities were operated at a single center between 2014 and 2016. Their hospital records and imaging were retrospectively studied. The feasibility of inserting CPS was assessed by studying pedicle morphometry on preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans. Aberrant vertebral artery anatomy was ruled out using CT angiography. CPS were inserted into selected pedicles without navigation. Postoperative CT scans were studied to look for screw containment within pedicles. Complications were noted and clinicoradiologic follow-up was for a minimum of 36 months. Results: Thirty-seven CPS were inserted in 8 pediatric patients with a mean age of 9.2 years (range: 5 to 13 y). Surgery was done for complex cervical deformities due to various causes-neglected cervical spine trauma (n=3), posttubercular kyphosis (n=2), cervicothoracic scoliosis (n=2), and cervicothoracic osteoblastoma (n=1). The level-wise distribution of the inserted CPS was: C3=4, C4=6, C5=10, C6=10, and C7=7. Postoperative CT scans showed grade-1 medial cortical breach in 5/37 screws and grade-2 medial cortical breach in a single screw (16%). No perioperative complications were noted. At a mean follow-up of 3.6 years (range: 3 to 4.33 y), no patient had implant failure or deformity progression. Conclusions: CPS insertion in pediatric subaxial cervical spine without neuronavigation is safe, feasible, and effective in carefully selected cases. Biomechanical advantages of CPS can be extended to the pediatric subaxial cervical spine.

AB  - Background: Multiple classification systems for psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) based on semiological features have been described. We sought to compare the efficiency of four PNES classification systems.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed medical and video-electroencephalography (VEEG) records of patients with PNES with at least one typical event recorded on VEEG. Semiology of PNES events was stringently classified using Hubsch, Dhiman, Wadwekar, and Asadi-Pooya's classification systems.
   Results: We studied 248 patients with PNES (78% females, mean age 23.1 +/- 10.3 years) and reviewed 498 PNES events. Using Hubsch's scheme, we classified events into: dystonic attacks with primitive gestural activity (5.2%), paucikinetic attacks with preserved responsiveness (9.7%), pseudosyncope (59.8%), hyperkinetic prolonged attacks (16.2%) and axial dystonic prolonged attacks (1.6%), and unclassified (7.5%). Using Dhiman's classification, events were: abnormal motor (hypermotor [10.4%]/ partial motor [12.7%]), dialeptic type (58.6%), mixed patterns (17.3%), and unclassified (1%). Using Wadwekar's classification: dystonic attacks with primitive gestural activity (5.2%), paucikinetic attacks with preserved responsiveness (9.6%), pseudosyncope with/without hyperventilation (65.1%), hyperkinetic prolonged attacks involving limbs +/- trunk (18.5%), and axial dystonic prolonged attacks (1.6%). Using AsadiPooya's classification, events were: hypermotor (30.1%), non-motor (62.9%), and mixed (7.0%). All events could be classified via Wadwekar and Asadi-Pooya systems.
   Conclusion: In our study, pseudosyncope/dialeptic/non-motor semiology emerged as most frequent. Most of our patients with PNES had stereotyped semiology. All events could be classified using the schemes by Asadi-Pooya and Wadweker et al. Dhiman et al. scheme could classify 99% and 7.5% remained unclassified using Hubsch et al. scheme.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the commonest parasitic infection of the central nervous system. There is significant difference in incidence of NCC depending on geographic location, and incidence as high as 4% is reported in the endemic areas. It results from human affliction by the larval stage of Taenia solium. Spinal NCC is quite rare as compared with cranial NCC and accounts for 1.5%-3% of all cases. Both spine and cranium can be rarely involved in NCC, and cranial involvement usually precedes the spinal involvement.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 51-year-old woman who had spinal involvement first in the form of spinal intradural extramedullary disease and then developed cranial involvement more than 1 year later. She developed spinal arachnoiditis. She developed communicating hydrocephalous requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Later she developed isolated fourth ventricle and required excision of the fourth ventricular NCC. The unique aspects of our patient were a very aggressive course and involvement of cranium after spinal involvement. We describe her clinical course over 3 years and the management done.
   CONCLUSIONS: NCC can sometimes follow a very aggressive course and can involve both cranial and spinal compartments. Management of such patients is not standardized given the rarity of such cases.

AB  - Bone injuries and fractures generally take a long period to heal itself. To address this problem, bone tissue engineering (BTE) has gained significant research impetus. Among the several techniques used for scaffold fabrication, electrospinning ought to be the most promising technique for the development of the nanostructured scaffolds. The present study was carried out to fabricate an electrospun nanocomposite scaffold for BTE by using gelatin, polycaprolactone (PCL), and nanohydroxyapatite (nHAp). To prepare Gelatin-PCL-nHAp nanocomposite scaffold: Gelatin-PCL blend was electrospun and then treated with nHAp (1 wt%) for different time periods. The fabricated nanocomposite scaffold was analysed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) to determine the fiber diameter and evaluate the fiber morphology. The Gelatin-PCL-nHAp nanocomposite scaffold 20 min exhibited the average fiber diameter of 615 +/- 269 nm and average pore size 4.7 +/- 1.04 mu m, and also revealed the presence of nHAp particles over the Gelatin-PCL scaffold surface. Further, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis also indicated the deposition of nHAp over the Gelatin-PCL scaffold surface. MTT assay and DNA quantification showed good viability and significant proliferation of human osteoblasts on Gelatin-PCL-nHAp nanocomposite scaffold. Moreover, cell-scaffold constructs illustrated efficient cellular attachment and adequately spread cells, and it also depicts characteristic polygonal morphology of osteoblasts over the Gelatin-PCL-nHAp nanocomposite scaffold. Thus, the results of in-vitro analysis of electrospun nanocomposite scaffold suggest that the Gelatin-PCL-nHAp scaffold can be a potential candidate for BTE applications.

AB  - Aim Infection after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, though rare, is a potentially devastating complication and the evidence-based recommendation on the various topics in its management is limited. The purpose of this study was to develop recommendations for the prevention and management of infections in ACL reconstruction surgery by performing a structured expert consensus survey using Delphi methodology.
   Materials and Methods 22 topics of relevance in the prevention and management of infection following ACL reconstruction were chosen from an extensive literature review. 30 panelists were requested to respond to a three-round survey, with feedback, to develop a consensus statement on the topics.
   Results Consensus statements could be prepared in eleven out of twenty-two topics including: the graft is retained at the first arthroscopic debridement, the graft is removed when repeated debridement are needed, and revision ACL reconstruction is needed only if the patient develops instability. Concurrence could be obtained in the topics including: longer duration of antibiotics is needed in immunocompromised patients, soaking graft in antibiotic solution reduces infection risk, and knee swelling without warmth does not suggest infection.
   Conclusions A proper skin preparation, a longer course of antibiotics in immunocompromised patients, and soaking the graft in antibiotics reduces the risk of infection. In case of infection, a healthy-looking graft must be retained at the first debridement and if the graft must be removed, revision ACL reconstruction is advised only if the patient develops instability.

AB  - Indigenous food (IF) systems, derived from natural ecosystems are perceived to be sustainable and nutritionally adequate. Mundas, an indigenous tribal community in Jharkhand India, are surrounded by rich agroforestry resources, yet display high levels of malnutrition. Our study explored the food environment of Munda community, different IFs they accessed, levels of utilization of IFs in routine diets, their nutritional attributes and factors influencing IF consumption. A cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted in nine villages of Murhu and Torpa blocks in Khunti district, Jharkhand. Using focus group discussions and key informant interviews, we did free-listing of IFs known to the community. This was followed by enumerating preferred and little used/historically consumed IFs, along with reasons. Qualitative enquiries were recorded and transcribed verbatim; data were coded and analyzed using thematic framework approach. The listed IFs were identified through common names and photographs, and verified by ethnobotanist in the team. The nutritive values of identified IFs were searched in literature or nutritional analysis of specific plant based foods were undertaken in an accredited laboratory. The community demonstrated traditional ecological knowledge of several IFs (n = 194), which are accessed from wild, cultivated and built food environments. Taxonomic classification was available for 80% (n = 156) IFs, out of which 60 foods had nutritive values in secondary literature and 42 foods were analyzed in laboratory. Many IFs were rich in micronutrients like calcium, iron, folate, vitamin A and C. Among the listed IFs, only 45% were commonly consumed, while rest were little used/historically consumed. Factors like desirable taste, satiety, perceived nutrition benefits, adaptability to climate variability, traditional practice of food preservation and their cultural importance promoted IF consumption. However, local climatic impacts on agroforestry systems, easy access to foods bought from markets or distributed under government food security schemes, and promotion of hybrid seeds by local agricultural organizations, emerged as potential barriers. Thus, reinforcement of traditional ecological knowledge and informal food literacy, along with promotion of climate resilient attributes of IFs, can contribute to sustainable food systems in Munda community.

AB  - Objectives To assess the effect of rituximab (RTX) on the lung function parameters in SSc interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) patients. Methods PubMed and Embase were searched to identify studies on SSc-ILD treated with RTX, confined to a predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on the included studies on changes in forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) from baseline to 6 and 12 months of follow-up. Results A total of 20 studies (2 randomized controlled trials, 6 prospective studies, 5 retrospective studies and 7 conference abstracts) were included (n = 575). RTX improved FVC from baseline by 4.49% (95% CI 0.25, 8.73) at 6 months and by 7.03% (95% CI 4.37, 9.7) at 12 months. Similarly, RTX improved DLCO by 3.47% (95% CI 0.99, 5.96) at 6 months and 4.08% (95% CI 1.51, 6.65) at 12 months. In the two studies comparing RTX with other immunosuppressants, improvement of FVC by 6 months in the RTX group was 1.03% (95% CI 0.11, 1.94) greater than controls. At the 12 month follow-up, RTX treatment was similar to controls in terms of both FVC and DLCO. Patients treated with RTX had a lower chance of developing infections compared with controls [odds ratio 0.256 (95% CI 0.104, 0.626), I-2 = 0%, P = 0.47). Conclusions Treatment with RTX in SSc-ILD was associated with a significant improvement of both FVC and DLCO during the first year of treatment. RTX use was associated with lower infectious adverse events.

AB  - Objectives: This multicentric study from India aimed to evaluate the long term course and outcome of bipolar disorder (BD).
   Method: Seven hundred and seventy-three participants diagnosed with BD, attending 14 outpatient clinic centers across the country, were evaluated using the National Institute of Mental Health- Retrospective Life Charts to assess the long term course of BD.
   Results: The mean age of onset of the first episode of illness of the study sample was 26.3 (8.54) years, and mean duration of illness at the time of assessment was 233.05 (94.55) months. In terms of the total number of lifetime episodes, the mean number of manic episodes (mean: 3.68; SD: 4.75) exceeded the mean number of depressive episodes (mean: 3.36; SD: 5.51). The mean numbers of total lifetime episodes were 8.58 (10.6%). When the number of episodes per year was computed, the mean number of manic episodes per year exceeded that of the mean number of depressive episodes. Compared to females, a higher proportion of males had a history of co-morbid substance dependence.
   Limitations: The course was assessed retrospectively and the study was limited to participants attending the outpatient clinics.
   Conclusions: The course of BD in India differs from that described from developed countries in the form of a number of manic episodes exceeding the depressive episodes.

AB  - Background There is a paucity of data on use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative agent in mechanically ventilated children. Objectives To compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and midazolam for sedation in mechanically ventilated children aged 1 month - 15 years. Secondary objectives were to compare the need for top-up doses of fentanyl and paralytic agents, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay and hospital stay, and adverse events. Design Open label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. Setting PICU of a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Patients Consecutive children aged 1 month to 15 years who were mechanically ventilated. Intervention Children were randomized to either dexmedetomidine or midazolam and the doses were titrated to maintain target sedation score of 4 or 5 as measured by Penn State Children Hospital Sedation algorithm. Outcome The percentage of time spent in level 4 or 5 of Penn State Children Hospital sedation algorithm for ventilated children. Results 49 children were randomized (24 to 'midazolam group' and 25 to 'dexmedetomidine group'). There was no difference in the percentage of time spent in the targeted sedation between the groups [midazolam 67.3% (18.8) vs. dexmedetomidine 56.3 %. (28.6); P=0.12]. The absolute difference in the percentage of time spent was -10.9% [SE (95% CI) 7.05: (-25.15 to 3.25)]. The lower end of 95% CI for the difference breached the non-inferiority limit of -20%. Number of fentanyl boluses, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospital stay were similar. Four (17.4%) children in dexmedetomidine group developed persistent bradycardia. Conclusion Non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine compared to midazolam for sedation in children on mechanical ventilation could not be established.

AB  - Background There are limited data on congenital lung malformations (CLM) and their clinical course from developing countries. Methods A 10-year retrospective chart review of records of children with CLM attending pediatric chest clinic at an Indian tertiary care center was conducted. Results Among the 48 children (24 boys) included in the review, the malformations included congenital lung hypoplasia/agenesis in 24 (50%), cystic pulmonary airway malformation in 9 (19%), bronchogenic/foregut cyst in 8 (18%), and congenital lobar emphysema in 4 (9%). Median (IQR) age at symptom onset and diagnosis were 1.5 (0.4,9.5) and 24 (3,62) months, respectively. Median (IQR) weight for age for age z-score at presentation was -2.4 (-1.4,- 3.4). More than a third (37.5%) children underwent surgical removal of resectable lesions at median (IQR) age of 14 (6,42) months. 14 (27%) children had associated congenital heart disease. Median duration of follow-up was 13 months. In children with lung hypoplasia, median (IQR) number of hospitalizations in follow-up were significantly less than that prior to diagnosis 0 (0,0) vs 1(0,2) (P=0.001). Median (IQR) numbers of hospitalizations in follow up were significantly less than that of prior to surgical resection 0 (0,0) vs 1(1,1) (P=0.016) in children with CPAM. Conclusion Lung hypoplasia was the most common congenital lung malformation in our setup. Detection of malformation during antenatal period was poor. Age of diagnosis and surgical intervention is often delayed. Regular follow up and definitive and/or supportive management decreased the morbidity.

AB  - Phosphopantetheine Adenylyltransferase (PPAT) is an enzyme that catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of Coenzyme A (CoA), which is the active and physiologically functional form of dietary Vitamin B5. CoA serves as a cofactor for numerous metabolic reactions which makes it essential for cellular survival. This enzyme is also subject to feedback inhibition by CoA to maintain its cellular concentration. The steps of the CoA biosynthesis pathway remain conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, with humans and pathogenic microorganisms showing significant diversity on a sequence, structure and mechanistic level. This suggests that the development of selective inhibitors of microbial CoA biosynthesis should be possible using these enzymes as targets for drug development. Bacterial PPAT shows significant mechanistic difference from its human counterpart CoA synthase, which is a dual protein carrying the activity of both PPAT and next step in the pathway catalyzed by the enzyme Dephospho CoA kinase (DPCK). This review covers the detailed description of the mechanistic, structural and functional aspects of this enzyme. Also, all the attempts to design high efficiency inhibitors of this enzyme using the approach of structure based drug design have been discussed in detail. This comprehensive structural and functional discussion of PPAT will help in further exploiting it as a drug target.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate Descemet membrane (DM) morphology in eyes with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) in vivo using high-definition anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and on histopathology. Methods: Corneal scans of patients with PCG (22 eyes of 15 patients) were evaluated for DM morphology and anterior chamber angle using ASOCT. The DM thickness in PCG eyes was compared with fellow eyes (8 eyes) of unilateral patients with PCG and healthy controls (12 eyes) on ASOCT. The DM morphology was also compared on the histopathology of corneal tissues (9) obtained from PCG eyes after keratoplasty and enucleated eyes of retinoblastoma (6 controls) on light microscopy with immunostaining for collagen IV. Results: On ASOCT, all affected eyes showed the presence of either a thickened DM complex or a hyper-reflective double layer representing the thickened DM and pre-Descemet layer (PDL), unlike a single membrane in the controls and fellow eyes. On ASOCT, among patients with PCG, the DM showed significant thickening (32.0 +/- 11.2 mu m) versus fellow eyes (14.4 +/- 3.3 mu m) and controls (11.5 +/- 1 mu m) (P < 0.001; analysis of variance). The thickened DM complex continued peripherally into the trabecular meshwork as an abnormal membrane in 16/22 affected eyes. On histopathology, thickening of DM was also more among PCG eyes (median: 67.9 mu m range: 27.2-214.9) versus controls (median: 27.7 mu m, range: 22.1-36.1; P = 0.005) as also of PDL (median: 14 mu m, range: 5.9-30.5) of PCG versus (median 3.5, range: 1.3-6.7 mu m) in controls; P = 0.014. Conclusions: Thickening of DM and PDL occurs in eyes with PCG and is seen to have a peripheral extension upto the angle recess.

KW  - Tracheal tissue engineering
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to discuss the successful fabrication of customized tubular scaffolds for tracheal tissue engineering with a novel route using solvent-based extrusion 3D printing.
   Design/methodology/approach - The manufacturing approach involved extrusion of polymeric ink over a rotating predefined pattern to construct customized tubular structure of polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyurethane (PU). Dimensional deviation in thickness of scaffolds were calculated for various layer thicknesses of 3D printing. Physical and chemical properties of scaffolds were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), contact angle measurement, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Mechanical characterizations were performed, and the results were compared to the reported properties of human native trachea from previous reports. Additionally, in vitro cytotoxicity of the fabricated scaffolds was studied in terms of cell proliferation, cell adhesion and hemagglutination assay.
   Findings - The developed fabrication route was flexible and accurate by printing customized tubular scaffolds of various scales. Physiochemical results showed good miscibility of PCL/PU blend, and decrease in crystalline nature of blend with the addition of PU. Preliminary mechanical assessments illustrated comparable mechanical properties with the native human trachea. Longitudinal compression test reported outstanding strength and flexibility to maintain an unobstructed lumen, necessary for the patency. Furthermore, the scaffolds were found to be biocompatible to promote cell adhesion and proliferation from the in vitro cytotoxicity results.
   Practical implications - The attempt can potentially meet the demand for flexible tubular scaffolds that ease the concerns such as availability of suitable organ donors.
   Originality/value - 3D printing over accurate predefined templates to fabricate customized grafts gives novelty to the present method. Various customized scaffolds were compared with conventional cylindrical scaffold in terms of flexibility.

AB  - The pandemic COVID-19 was caused by a novel Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that infects humans through the binding of glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 protein to the glycosylated ACE2 receptor. The spike 2 protein recognizes the N-terminal helices of the glycosylated metalloprotease domain in the human ACE2 receptor. To understand the susceptibility of animals for infection and transmission, we did sequence and structure-based molecular interaction analysis of 16 ACE2 receptors from different mammalian species with SARS-CoV-2 spike 2 receptor binding domain. Our comprehensive structure analysis revealed that the natural substitution of amino acid residues Gln24, His34, Phe40, Leu79 and Met82 in the N-terminal alpha 1 and alpha 2 helices of the ACE2 receptor results in loss of crucial network of hydrogen-bonded and hydrophobic interactions with receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Another striking observation is the absence of N-glycosylation site Asn103 in all mammals and many species, lack more than one N-linked glycosylation site in the ACE2 receptor. Based on the loss of crucial interactions and the absence of N-linked glycosylation sites we categorized Felis catus, Equus caballus, Panthera tigris altaica, as highly susceptible while Oryctolagus cuniculus, Bos Tauras, Ovis aries and Capra hircus as moderately susceptible species for infection. Similarly, the E. asinus, Bubalus bubalis, Canis lupus familiaris, Ailuropoda melaleuca and Camelus dromedarius are categorized as low susceptible with Loxodonta Africana, Mus musculus, Sus scrofa and Rattus rattus as least susceptible species for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyse whether costochondral grafts (CCG) fulfil temporomandibular joint (TMJ) reconstructive goals in children with TMJ ankylosis. A total of 23 patients (12 male, 11 female, aged 3-16 years) with unilateral or bilateral TMJ ankylosis operated on between January 2014 to April 2018 were included in the study. Maximal incisal opening (MIO), frequency of reankylosis, and growth of CCG, were evaluated at one month and six months for one year, and after that once yearly. Mouth opening changes with time were assessed by the Friedman test and growth was compared at follow up and analysed using the paired t test. Mean (range) follow up was 18 (12-48) months. Study results revealed follow up MIO at 12 months was highly significant (p = 0.001). Out of 27 CCG studied, only one graft had undergone re-ankylosis. Based on the predetermined criteria using condylion to gnathion (Co-Gn) measurement in the posteroanterior cephalogram, CCG were categorised into optimum, sub-optimum, and overgrowth. However, long-standing TMJ ankylosis cases still displayed mandibular asymmetry at the end of the study, even with 'optimal growth' radiographically. Overall comparison between the immediate postoperative and last follow up Co-Gn measurements in either unilateral or bilateral cases was not significant. CCG with functional matrix maintained the growth of the mandible and MIO in TMJ ankylosis. It can be concluded that CCG partially fulfils reconstructive goals; however, patients need to be followed up till the end of puberty for a substantive conclusion.

AB  - Objective: Serum melatonin, a biomarker of circadian rhythm, can upregulate Growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) which is involved in neural regeneration and plasticity. The present study was conducted to investigate the adequacy of the first-line antipsychotic drugs to improve sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions by assessing the effect of haloperidol and risperidone on serum melatonin and GAP-43 in schizophrenia.
   Methods: In this cohort study, 100 schizophrenic patients were recruited, and clinical evaluations were done using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). The patients with predominantly positive symptoms taking haloperidol (Group I) and patients with predominantly negative symptoms taking risperidone (Group II) were admitted and serum melatonin, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, GAP-43 and urinary melatonin were estimated. After 8 weeks, all clinical and biochemical parameters were repeated.
   Results: Serum melatonin (2:00 hours) was significantly decreased in both haloperidol (2.42; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.67-4.17; p = 0.008) and risperidone group (3.40; 95% CI: 0.54-6.25; p = 0.021). Urinary melatonin was significantly decreased in both haloperidol (p = 0.005) and risperidone group (p = 0.014). PSQI score was significantly increased in both haloperidol (p = 0.001) and risperidone group (p = 0.003). Serum GAP-43 was significantly decreased in both haloperidol and risperidone group (p < 0.001). PANSS decreased significantly in both the groups and there was a significant negative correlation between serum melatonin at 2:00 hours and PANSS (r = -0.5) at baseline.
   Conclusion: Monotherapy with haloperidol and risperidone can achieve symptomatic improvement but cannot improve sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances in schizophrenia.

AB  - Background: The p53, tumor suppressor protein is inactivated upon mutation in the DNA-binding domain and the non-functional protein leads to cancers. The p53Y220C is one of the most frequently observed mutations in p53 with a scope of rescuing the protein function using small molecules.
   Methods: Using computational modeling, biophysical, and experimental cell-based studies we tried to understand the molecular basis of Curcumin as a potential small molecule to stabilize p53Y220C mutant and restore its function. The pancreatic adenocarcinomas BxPC-3 p53Y220C mutant cell line was used for cell-based assays to determine the therapeutic potential of Curcumin to restore mutant p53 to function like wild type.
   Results: Our results showed that the Curcumin binds p53Y220C with K-d = 3.169 +/- 0.257 mu M and it increases the DNA binding affinity of the mutant by 4-fold with K-d = 851.29 +/- 186.27 nM. By Fluorescence, CD, and IR spectroscopy, we could characterize the secondary structural changes and stabilization of the p53Y220C DNA binding domain upon Curcumin binding. By caspase-3 and Annexin V assays, we could demonstrate that Curcumin at 3 mu M to 8 mu M concentration could initiate p53 mediated apoptosis in BxPC-3 cell line. Based on our experimental studies, we propose a mechanism for the activation of ATM/Chk1 kinases pathways for apoptosis and/or G2/M cell cycle arrest in the BxPC-3 cell line mediated by functionally restored p53Y220C.
   Conclusion: The study indicated that the natural compound Curcumin could rescue mutant p53Y220C in BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinomas cell line to function like wild-type and activate apoptotic pathways.

AB  - Purpose: This review discusses the relevant anatomy, etiopathogenesis, current notions in clinical and imaging features as well as management outline of lower limb entrapment neuropathies.
   Methods: The review is based on critical analysis of the current literature as well as our experience in dealing with entrapment neuropathies of the lower limb.
   Results: The complex anatomical network of nerves supplying the lower extremities are prone to entrapment by a heterogenous group of etiologies. This leads to diverse clinical manifestations making them difficult to diagnose with traditional methods such as clinical examination and electrodiagnostic studies. Moreover, some of these may mimic other common conditions such as disc pain or fibromyalgia leading to delay in diagnosis and increasing morbidity. Addition of imaging improves the diagnostic accuracy and also help in correct treatment of these entities. Magnetic resonance imaging is very useful for deeply situated nerves in pelvis and thigh while ultrasound is well validated for superficial entrapment neuropathies.
   Conclusion: The rapidly changing concepts in these conditions accompanied by the advances in imaging has made it essential for a clinical radiologist to be well-informed with the current best practices.

AB  - Introduction: Cystatin C (Cys C) has been found as a novel biomarker of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Published studies on the role of Cys C as a biomarker of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not been reviewed systematically. Objective: Present meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the association between Cys C and risk of MCI. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Trip databases, Worldwide Science, and Google Scholar from January 1, 1950, to April 30, 2020. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) using fixed or random effect models were used to calculate summary estimates. Quality of evidence was also assessed using the Diagnostic Accuracy Quality Scale (DAQS) and grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations approach. Results: In our meta-analysis, 12 studies with a total of 2,433 MCI patients and 1,034 controls were included. Our findings suggest a strong association between increased levels of Cys C and risk of MCI as compared to control subjects (SMD = 2.39, 95% CI = 0.22-4.57). Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity, a significant association for the high level of Cys C with the risk of MCI was observed in the Asian population (SMD = 1.63, 95% CI = 0.44-2.82) but not in the Caucasian population (SMD = 2.80, 95% CI = [-0.66]-6.26). Conclusion: Cys C was associated with MCI, and it could be considered as a predictor for the risk of cognitive impairment.

KW  - neuropsychiatric features
AB  - Background: During the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, psychological problems like anxiety, depression, irritability, mood swings, inattention and sleep disturbance are fairly common among quarantined children in several studies. A systematic review of these publications to provide an accurate burden of these psychiatric/behavioral problems is needed for planning mitigating measures by the health authorities.
   Methods: Different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CENTRAL, medRxiv and bioRxiv) were searched for articles describing psychological/behavioral complications in children/adolescents with/without pre-existing behavioral abnormalities and their caregivers related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only original articles with/without comparator arms and a minimum sample size of 50 were included in the analysis. The pooled estimate of various psychological/behavioral problems was calculated using a random-effect meta-analysis.
   Results: Fifteen studies describing 22 996 children/adolescents fulfilled the eligibility criteria from a total of 219 records. Overall, 34.5%, 41.7%, 42.3% and 30.8% of children were found to be suffering from anxiety, depression, irritability and inattention. Although the behavior/psychological state of a total of 79.4% of children was affected negatively by the pandemic and quarantine, at least 22.5% of children had a significant fear of COVID-19, and 35.2% and 21.3% of children had boredom and sleep disturbance. Similarly, 52.3% and 27.4% of caregivers developed anxiety and depression, respectively, while being in isolation with children.
   Conclusion: Anxiety, depression, irritability, boredom, inattention and fear of COVID-19 are predominant new-onset psychological problems in children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children with pre-existing behavioral problems like autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have a high probability of worsening of their behavioral symptoms.

AB  - The corneal endothelium is the posterior monolayer of cells that are responsible for maintaining overall transparency of the avascular corneal tissue via pump function. These cells are non-regenerative in vivo and therefore, approximately 40% of corneal transplants undertaken worldwide are a result of damage or dysfunction of endothelial cells. The number of available corneal donor tissues is limited worldwide, hence, cultivation of human corneal endothelial cells (hCECs) in vitro has been attempted in order to produce tissue engineered corneal endothelial grafts. Researchers have attempted to recreate the current gold standard treatment of replacing the endothelial layer with accompanying Descemet's membrane or a small portion of stroma as support with tissue engineering strategies using various substrates of both biologically derived and synthetic origin. Here we review the potential biomaterials that are currently in development to support the transplantation of a cultured monolayer of hCECs.

AB  - Background Placing the left ventricular (LV) lead in a viable segment with the latest mechanical activation (vSOLA) may be associated with optimal cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response. We assessed the role of gated SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (gSPECT MPI) in predicting clinical outcomes at 6 months in patients submitted to CRT. Methods Ten centers from 8 countries enrolled 195 consecutive patients. All underwent gSPECT MPI before and 6 months after CRT. The procedure was performed as per current guidelines, the operators being unaware of gSPECT MPI results. Regional LV dyssynchrony (Phase SD) and vSOLA were automatically determined using a 17 segment model. The lead was considered on-target if placed in vSOLA. The primary outcome was improvement in >= 1 of the following: >= 1 NYHA class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by >= 5%, reduction in end-systolic volume by >= 15%, and >= 5 points in Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ). Results Sixteen patients died before the follow-up gSPECT MPI. The primary outcome occurred in 152 out of 179 (84.9%) cases. Mean change in LV phase standard deviation (PSD) at 6 months was 10.5 degrees. Baseline dyssynchrony was not associated with the primary outcome. However, change in LV PSD from baseline was associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P = .007). Change in LV PSD had an AUC of 0.78 (0.66-0.90) for the primary outcome. Improvement in LV PSD of 4 degrees resulted in the highest positive likelihood ratio of 7.4 for a favorable outcome. In 23% of the patients, the CRT lead was placed in the vSOLA, and in 42% in either this segment or in a segment within 10 degrees of it. On-target lead placement was not significantly associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.71-3.28). Conclusion LV dyssynchrony improvement by gSPECT MPI, but not on-target lead placement, predicts clinical outcomes in patients undergoing CRT.

AB  - Marine algae are a promising source of potent bioactive agents against oxidative stress, diabetes, and inflammation. However, the possible therapeutic effects of many algal metabolites have not been exploited yet. In this regard, we explored the therapeutic potential of Enteromorpha intestinalis extracts obtained from methanol, ethanol, and hexane, in contrasting oxidative stress. The total phenolic (TPC) and flavonoids (TFC) content were quantified in all extracts, with ethanol yielding the best values (about 60 and 625 mg of gallic acid and rutin equivalents per gram of extract, respectively). Their antioxidant potential was also assessed through DPPH center dot, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide anion scavenging assays, showing a concentration-dependent activity which was greater in the extracts from protic and more polar solvents. The alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities were estimated for checking the antidiabetic capacity, with IC50 values of about 3.8 mu g/mL for the methanolic extract, almost as low as those obtained with acarbose (about 2.8 and 3.3 mu g/mL, respectively). The same extract also showed remarkable anti-inflammatory effect, as determined by hemolysis, protein denaturation, proteinase and lipoxygenase activity assays, with respectable IC50 values (about 11, 4, 6, and 5 mu g/mL, respectively), also in comparison to commercially used drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid.

KW  - ACCURACY
AB  - Introduction: Globally around 47.4% of children and in India, 58% of children aged 6-59 months are anemic. Diagnosis of anemia in children using accurate technologies and providing adequate treatment is essential to reduce the burden of anemia. Point-of-care testing (POCT) devices is a potential option for estimation of hemoglobin in peripheral and field settings were the hematology analyzer and laboratory services are not available.
   Objectives: To access the validity of the POCTs (invasive and non-invasive devices) for estimation of hemoglobin among children aged 6-59 months compared with hematology analyzer.
   Methods: The study participants were enrolled from the pediatric outpatient department in Haryana, India, from November 2019 to January 2020. Hemoglobin levels of the study participants were estimated in Sahli's hemoglobinometer and invasive digital hemoglobinometers (DHs) using capillary blood samples. Hemoglobin levels in non-invasive DH were assessed from the finger/toe of the children. Hemoglobin levels measured in POCTs were compared against the venous blood hemoglobin estimated in the hematology analyzer.
   Results: A total of 120 children were enrolled. The mean (SD) of hemoglobin (g/dl) estimated in auto-analyzer was 9.4 (1.8), Sahli's hemoglobinometer was 9.2 (1.9), invasive DH was 9.7 (1.9), and non-invasive DH was 11.9 (1.5). Sahli's hemoglobinometer (95.5%) and invasive DH (92.2%) had high sensitivity for the diagnosis of anemia compared with non-invasive DH (24.4%). In contrast, non-invasive DH had higher specificity (96.7%) compared with invasive DH (83.3%) and Sahli's hemoglobinometer (70%). Invasive DH took the least time (2-3 min) for estimation of hemoglobin per participant, followed by Sahli's (4-5 min) and non-invasive DH (5-7 min).
   Conclusion: All three POCT devices used in this study are reasonable and feasible for estimating hemoglobin in under-5 children. Invasive DHs are potential POCT devices for diagnosis of anemia among under-5 children, while Sahli's can be considered as a possible option, where trained and skilled technicians are available. Further research and development are required in non-invasive DH to improve accuracy.
   LAY SUMMARY
   In India, anemia is a serious public health problem, where 58% of the children aged 6-59 months are anemic. Point-of-care testing (POCT) using digital hemoglobinometers (DHs) has been recommended as one of the key interventions by the Anemia Mukt Bharat program since 2018 in India. These POCT devices are easy to use, less invasive, can be carried to field, require minimal training and results are available immediately. Therefore this study assessed the validity of POCT devices-invasive DH, non-invasive DH and Sahli's hemoglobinometer among 6-59 months children in facility setting compared with the gold standard hematology analyzer. A total of 120 children under 659 months of age were enrolled from the pediatric outpatient department in Haryana, India, from November 2019 to January 2020. The (mean hemoglobin in g/dl) invasive (9.7) and non-invasive DH (11.9) overestimated hemoglobin value, while Sahli's (9.2) underestimated hemoglobin compared with hematology analyzer (9.4). Invasive DH (92.2%) and Sahli's hemoglobinometer (95.5%) reported high ability to correctly identify those with anemia compared with non-invasive DH (24.4%). In contrast, non-invasive DH (96.73%) had higher ability to correctly identify those without the anemia compared with invasive DH (83.3%) and Sahli's (70%).

AB  - Purpose: To compare the outcomes of vitreoretinal surgery in patients with primary and recurrent rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) on 3 dimensional digitally assisted visualization system (3D-DAVS) and conventional analogue microscope (CAM). Methods: 68 patients with primary (50) and recurrent (18) RRD with PVR > C1 were included. One group underwent surgery on 3D-DAVS while the other on CAM. The parameters studied included detachment rate, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), duration of surgery, mean endo-illumination levels of 23 G (Gauge) micro incision vitrectomy system (MIVS) and microscope and satisfaction of surgeon and observers based on a framed questionnaire. The mean duration of follow up was three months. Results: 68 eyes of 68 patients with median age 52.5 (range 18-68) years were included. 50 had primary RRD and 18 had recurrent RRD. Detachment rate at the end of three months was comparable in both groups of primary (P > 0.99) and recurrent (P = 0.21) RRD. Mean duration of surgery in minutes for 3D DAVS and CAM group was 61.8 (+/- 22.07) and 58.04 (+/- 12.33), respectively, in primary RRD and 37.22 (+/- 10.27) and 36.55 (+/- 5.92), respectively, in recurrent RRD group. Mean endo-illumination in 3D DAVS (14.5%) group was half of that in CAM (34.17%) group. Surgeon and observer satisfaction scores were significantly higher for 3D DAVS group. Conclusion: 3D DAVS is a safe and effective modality or performing VR surgery in RRD with PVR. 3D DAVS allows lower endo-illumination levels provides superior surgeon ergonomics and offers better learning opportunities to the trainees.

AB  - Introduction
   With the global incidence of ovarian cancer set to rise by 55% to 371 000 per year by 2035, current 5-year survival rates below 50%, and 15% of women with ovarian cancer dying within 2 months of diagnosis, urgent action is required to improve survival and quality of life.
   Objective
   To deal with the evidence gap relating to the experience of women with the disease around the globe and identify opportunities to drive progress.
   Methods
   The study included a review of global trends in incidence, mortality, and survival (October 2017); qualitative interviews with women and clinicians in 16 countries (December 2017); and an online survey for women available in 15 different languages (open for 2 months, March to early May 2018). Women were eligible to participate if they had been diagnosed in the previous 5 years and were proficient in one of the 15 languages offered.
   Results
   A total of 1531 women from 44 countries took part in the analysis. On average, 69.1% of women were not aware of ovarian cancer before their own diagnosis, varying from 50.9% (Hungary) to 86.4% (Brazil). A total of 78.3% of symptomatic women sought medical help, varying from 62.8% (Japan) to 87.7% (UK). Fewer than half of the women visited a doctor within 1 month (46.3%) of experiencing symptoms, varying from 38.5% (USA) to 77.3% (Germany), and a quarter of women waited 3 months or more. On average, 43.2% of women were diagnosed within 1 month of visiting a doctor, ranging from 30% (UK) to 62.3% (Italy). The average estimated time from experiencing symptoms to diagnosis was 31 weeks, but this ranged from 21.3 (Germany) to 39.7 (Brazil). Rates of post-diagnosis genetic testing ranged from 5.0% (Japan) to 79.1% (USA). Clinicians indicated that access to specialist treatment in high-volume centers varies greatly by country and region.
   Conclusion
   The findings of this study identify some of the major challenges and opportunities to improve the time to diagnosis and management of women with ovarian cancer. These problems vary widely by country, and reducing the variability is an important first step towards improving outcomes for women with ovarian cancer.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is universally expressed in the endothelial cells of tumor-associated neovasculature of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Functional Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT also enables easier differentiation of the residual tumor from postoperative changes. An 18-year-old man with the residual intracranial disease received radiotherapy after surgery. In PSMA PET/CT imaging, uptake was noted initially only in the residual disease, and the same was absent after successful response to radiotherapy, unlike contrast MRI, which showed persistent enhancement. Functional Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT may be a very useful tool clinically for identifying early responses to radiotherapy compared with conventional structural imaging.

AB  - The current practice for low vision management in India exclusively focuses on clinical aspects without much of the rehabilitation components. While making all efforts to improve independent living skills, daily living activities, and quality of life as a whole for people living visual disabilities, vision rehabilitation is an indispensable component. There is no single appropriate low vision and rehabilitation model implementable at health care institutions in the country to cover these fundamental aspects of a visually impaired individual. We did a literature review to know the existing practices of low vision and various disability models. The purpose of the review is to discern any pitfalls and shortcomings in managing visually disabled in India and to underpin the credibility and feasibility as well as suitability of the developed model. The review was done using search key terms low vision, current practices, visual disability, disability models, vision rehabilitation, and service delivery. Therefore, the article discusses the development of an inclusive low vision management model name as "Clinico-Social Model", which we consider the most appropriate for the best management of people with vision loss. The primary aim of this model is to provide both clinical and vision rehabilitation components of management for people with visual disabilities. Such an approach is likely to have the potential to improve the quality of life of people with vision loss and can provide practical guide to eye care managers across India. Given the specific context in the current practices of low vision in India, it is desirable to design a similar model to care for the visually disabled.

AB  - Peripapillary Atrophy (PPA, hereafter) is one of the major indicators of an irreversible eye disease named Glaucoma. An early detection of PPA is vital to avoid vision reduction caused by pathological myopia, or a permanent loss caused by Glaucoma. PPA is a pigmented crescent-shaped abnormality around the optic disc region. In this paper, we propose a fusion method to detect the atrophy by combining ResNet50-based deep features along with clinically significant statistical features of the region of interest (containing PPA). We show results of extensive experimentation with six publicly available databases, on which the system is also trained. The testing is on a rather difficult dataset of community camp-based images captured under poor lighting conditions with hand-held low-resolution ophthalmoscopes. We show encouraging experimental results of the combination of the generalization power of deep features and the medical science behind clinical hand-crafted features. Such a feature combination out-performs any one of the modalities in the difficult experimental set. We compare our results with the state-of-the-art in the area. The proposed method outperforms existing methods with average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of 95.83% each. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best accuracy reported in the literature, on large and varied datasets.

Subsequently, the STP of EM were quantified using a cross-correlogram analysis. Decision trees were used to identify the relevant STP and classify the populations. Results: We achieved a classification accuracy of 94.5% (TPR/sensitivity = 96%, TNR/specificity = 90%) between patients and controls. Individually, the algorithm achieved an accuracy of 86.3% (TPR for neuro-ophthalmology [97%], glaucoma [60%], and controls [86%]). The STP of EM were highly similar across two different control cohorts. Conclusions: In an ocular tracking task, patients with VFD due to different underlying pathology make EM with distinctive STP. These properties are interpretable based on different clinical characteristics of patients and can be used for patient classification. Translational Relevance: Our EM-based screening tool may complement existing perimetric techniques in clinical practice.

TI  - Outcomes of Cultivated Oral Mucosal Epithelial Transplantation in Eyes With Chronic Stevens- Johnson Syndrome Sequelae
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
AB  - PURPOSE: To study the outcomes of cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET) in eyes with chronic Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) sequelae.
   DESIGN: Prospective interventional case series.
   METHODS: Forty-five eyes of 41 patients with chronic SJS sequelae were recruited and evaluated from 2013 to 2017 in an institutional setting. All patients underwent COMET, with an aim of fornix reconstruction and visual rehabilitation. Change in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), severity scores of various ocular surface param-eters, and the occurrence of complications were docu-mented during a follow up period of 2 years. Attainment and maintenance of a stable ocular surface, as assessed by change in the ocular surface severity scores was the primary outcome measure, while change in CDVA was the secondary outcome measure.
   RESULTS: The mean preoperative CDVA was 2.7 +/- 0.5 logMAR, which improved to 1.5 +/- 0.7 logMAR and 1.49 +/- 0.98 postoperatively, at 1-and 2-year follow-up visit. Overall, 82.2% eyes (37/45) had improvement in visual acuity, 13.3% (6/45) experienced no change, whereas 2 eyes (4.4%) had worsening of visual acuity. The total ocular surface severity scores improved from a mean preoperative value of 29.1 +/- 9.7 to 18.7 +/- 7.2 post-operatively, at 2-year follow-up. Two eyes developed persistent epithelial defects, with progression to corneal melting requiring keratoplasty.
   CONCLUSIONS: COMET allows successful and sus-tained restoration of ocular surface anatomy with func-tional improvement, in eyes with chronic sequelae of SJS.

AB  - Till date, there is paucity of published literature on clinical manifestations of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children from low-middle-income countries (LMIC). Most of the reports are from Europe, USA or China. Our study aimed to capture data on varied and unusual clinical presentation and management of MIS-C (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children) with COVID-19 and compare the MIS-C and non-MIS-C children. This was a single-centre cohort study of 41 COVID positive children 0-12 years age hospitalized between 1 April 2020 and 31 July 2020. Data were entered into standardized WHO Case Report Form and analysed using strata 15.0 statistical software. Twenty out of 41 children fulfilled the criteria of MIS-C. Male-to-female ratio in the cohort was 1.73:1. In MIS-C cases, predominant clinical manifestation was fever (100%), neurological manifestations (80%), lower respiratory tract infection (50%), rash (35%) and acute gastroenteritis (25%). They were categorized into Acute Encephalitis-like illness in 35%, Kawasaki-like disease, Toxic Shock-like syndrome and Comorbidity with systemic complications in 20% each. Ninety percent of MIS-C cases required oxygen supplementation with odds ratio (OR) 18 (3.22-100.48), whereas 65% required mechanical ventilation with OR 37.14 (4.08-338.10). Most of them had raised inflammatory markers and hepatic enzymes derangement. Steroids, Intravenous immunoglobulin and supportive therapy were mainstay of management for MIS-C group. Most MIS-C group children had multisystem involvement with predominant neurological manifestations at time of presentation. Delay in diagnosis and referral may have adversely affected the prognosis and outcome.

TI  - Cadaveric Study of Topographic Anatomy of Temporal and Marginal Mandibular Branches of the Facial Nerve in Relation to Temporomandibular Joint Surgery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
AB  - Purpose: Detailed anatomy of the facial nerve, including the variations among different ethnic groups, is essential to prevent an iatrogenic injury. The purpose of the study was to document topographic anatomy of temporal and marginal mandibular (MM) branches of the facial nerve in relation to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery. The specific aim was to demonstrate detailed course of temporal and MM nerves, their surgical implications, and to compare the results obtained with the previous studies.
   Methods: The investigators implemented a prospective cadaveric study. A dissection was carried out on 52 facial halves. The facial nerve was dissected according to the instructions described in the Cunningham's dissection manual. Anatomic landmarks were selected as determined by Al-Kayat and Bramley, and results obtained were compared with previous published articles.
   Results: The study sample was composed of 52 facial halves (males, n = 35; females, n = 17). The number of branches of temporal nerve varied in dissected facial halves from 3 (n = 37 [70%]), 2 (n = 14 [26%]), to 1 (n = 1 [2%]). The distance between the lowest concavity of the bony external auditory meatus to the point at which the facial nerve bifurcates (distance B) was considerably less in the study population (1.79 cm) when compared with the reported literature (2.3 cm). There was no significant influence of gender and cephalic index on distances measured. There was 1 branch in 15% of the dissected facial halves (1 in 52) and 2 branches in 85% (44 of 52). The MM nerve was seen coursing below the inferior border of the mandible, and in 44 (85%), the nerve was present above the inferior border of mandible all along the course.
   Conclusions: The topographic anatomy of the temporal and MM nerves is the same as reported in the literature. The only considerable difference was found in distance B; hence, surgical procedures involving the distance B require special consideration.

AB  - There is a need for a sensitive, safe, and cost-effective tool for coronary assessment among asymptomatic post-operative children who have undergone arterial switch operation (ASO) for transposition of great arteries (TGA). Adenosine stress echocardiography may be useful in assessing major structures as well for coronary functional assessment. Twenty-six children [median age 6.0 years; IQR 4.9-7.1 years, (22 boys)], who had undergone ASO at a median age of 40 days (IQR 30-75 days), were prospectively included. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was calculated in both rest and stress studies (140 mu g/kg/min of adenosine IV over 4 min), along with assessment of regional myocardial wall motion. Coronary flow reserve (CFR) was also measured in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Technetium 99m-MIBI [0.2mCi/kg] was injected after 2 min of adenosine infusion. Adenosine infusion had to be stopped in two children, due to transient atrioventricular (AV) block. The LVEF increased from 55.87 +/- 7.27 to 61.20 +/- 7.70% (p < 0.001) with adenosine stress. No significant regional wall motion abnormality was seen in rest or stress. Distal LAD could not be visualized in four patients. Basal and peak coronary flow velocities were 41.51 +/- 14.12 and 74.18 +/- 6.01 cm/s. Mean CFR was 1.91 +/- 0.51. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) was normal in all the patients. Four patients were lost to follow-up and remaining children did not develop any adverse events in the follow-up period of 64.5 +/- 7.19 months. Adenosine stress echocardiography is feasible as the initial screening test in the assessment of asymptomatic post-operative children with ASO, at minimal to no inconvenience to the patient. The findings concurred with stress MPS.

AB  - The discovery of Sanal flow choking in the cardiovascular-system calls for multidisciplinary and global action to develop innovative treatments and to develop new drugs to negate the risk of asymptomatic-cardiovascular-diseases. Herein, it is shown that when blood-pressure-ratio (BPR) reaches the lower-critical-hemorrhage-index (LCHI) internal-flow-choking a shock wave generation can occur in the cardiovascular-system, with sudden expansion/divergence/vasospasm or bifurcation regions, without prejudice to the percutaneous-coronary-intervention (PCI). Analytical findings reveal that the relatively high and the low blood-viscosity are cardiovascular-risk factors. In vitro studies have shown that nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide gases are dominant in fresh blood samples of humans/guinea pigs at a temperature range of 98.6-104 F. An in silico study demonstrated the Sanal flow choking phenomenon leading to shock-wave generation and pressure-overshoot in the cardiovascular-system. It has been established that disproportionate blood-thinning treatment increases the risk of the internal-flow-choking due to the enhanced boundary-layer-blockage-factor, resulting from an increase in flow-turbulence level in the cardiovascular-system, caused by an increase in Reynolds number as a consequence of low blood-viscosity. The cardiovascular-risk can be diminished by concurrently lessening the viscosity of biofluid/blood and flow-turbulence by raising the thermal-tolerance-level in terms of blood-heat-capacity-ratio (BHCR) and/or by decreasing the systolic-to-diastolic blood-pressure-ratio.

AB  - Background: Despite the acceptance of non-operative management (NOM), there is no consensus on the optimal length of hospital stay in patients with blunt liver and splenic injury (BLSI). Recent studies on pediatric patients have demonstrated the safety of early discharge following NOM for BLSI. We aimed at evaluating the feasibility and safety of early discharge in adult patients with BLSI following NOM in a randomized controlled trial.
   Materials and methods: After initial assessment and management, patients aged 18-60 years with BLSI planned for NOM were randomized into 2 groups: Group A (test group; discharge day 3), and Group B (control group; discharge day 5). Standard NOM protocol was followed. These patients were discharged on the proposed day if they met the pre-defined discharge criteria. All patients were followed at days 7, 15, and 30 of discharge.
   Results: Sixty patients were recruited, 30 randomized to each arm. Most patients were males and aged less than 30 years. Road traffic injury was the most common mode of injury. Both groups were comparable in demography and injury-related parameters. 27 patients (90%) from group A and 28 patients (93%) from group B were discharged on the proposed day. Three patients had unplanned hospital visits for reasons unrelated to BLSI. All patients were asymptomatic and had a normal examination during their scheduled follow-up visits.
   Conclusion: Adult patients undergoing NOM for BLSI can be safely discharged after 48 h of in-hospital observation, provided other injuries precluding discharge do not exist. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A review of literature was performed, focused on the etiopathogenesis of aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (APROP), the characteristic and atypical clinical features, management strategies, anatomical and visual outcomes. Characteristically APROP has zone I/posterior zone II involvement with prominent plus disease, featureless junction, large vascular loops, flat extra-retinal fibrovascular proliferation, and a rapidly progressive course. The risk factors for APROP are extreme prematurity (birth weight <= 1000 gram and/or gestational age <= 28 weeks), dysregulated oxygen supplementation, intrauterine growth retardation, sepsis, and thrombocytopenia. The uncommon presentations include small zone I disease, a hybrid disease with additional ridge tissue, and APROP in bigger babies with birth weight greater than 1500 g. Laser photocoagulation role is limited by the resultant visual field loss and high refractive error. Although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection allows peripheral retinal vascularization; reactivation of disease, systemic absorption of the drug and long-term safety are the chief concerns. Early vitrectomy is required when tractional retinal detachment develops. The visual outcome depends upon the morphology and vascular development of the macula. With the limited yet emerging new understanding of the pathophysiology, a multifaceted rational and individualized treatment strategy is suggested for APROP. Best practices in neonatal intensive care may prevent the occurrence of APROP. Further studies need to be performed for the prevention and safe, effective management of APROP.

TI  - Varied parameters and utility of the anal position index: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PEDIATRIC SURGERY INTERNATIONAL
KW  - Anal position
KW  - Anterior anus
AB  - Purpose The anal position index (API) was described in 1984 by Reisner et al. Since then, it has been measured in different ethnic populations and its utility in various medical conditions have been explored. We aimed to review the literature regarding the various values reported analytically. Method A Pubmed Search was carried out with the terms Anal Position Index. There were 158 articles hit by the search. The description of the API was uniform in all studies, described as ratio of anus-fourchette distance in girls and anus-scrotum distance in boys to the distance between coccyx and fourchette/scrotum. 18 relevant studies were included describing the values in different ethnic groups and describing its utility. One study was excluded from statistics due to different landmark for measurement. The studies were grouped into 4. Group A:B:C:D comprised of Newborns:Infants:All age groups:Constipated children. We carried out meta-analysis to estimate effect size (mean difference) using STATA software version 16.0. Results The different ethnic populations in which API were measured, and were Indian (2), Turkish (3), Israel (2), Taiwanese, Thai, Iranian, Spanish, Italian, and Mexican. The API was higher by 0.129 in boys. The mean API in males was 0.53:0.54:0.48:0.52 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.51 (0.04). The mean API in females was 0.40:0.40:0.38:0.37 in Group A:B:C:D with an overall mean (SD) API of 0.40(0.03). Two studies were done in mice and showed the relation of API to intrauterine exposure to androgens. In children, API was mostly used to diagnose an anterior ectopic anus and see correlation with constipation. The abnormal values varied from less than 0.30-0.34 in girls and less than 0.41-0.46 in boys. The effect size by regions showed that the estimated effect size for all the regions were within 95% Confidence limits of overall estimate (0.13: 95% CI: 0.13-0.14). Therefore, it can be inferred that there was no significant ethnic variation in the study parameter. The anal position in relation to genitalia was measured in nulliparous women, menopause women, and women with levator deficiency. It was affected in vulvovaginal atrophy. Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy was reported to alter the anal position in male infants. Conclusion The anteriorly positioned anus has been associated with constipation. API been measured in various ethnic populations with insignificant variations. The API is significantly (p < 0.05) higher in males. The presence of constipation does not seem to alter API. One should adopt a single method for measurement. API should not be considered at the sole indication for any surgical intervention.

AB  - Whenever some phenomenon can be represented as a graph or a network it seems pertinent to explore how much the mathematical properties of that network impact the phenomenon. In this study we explore the same philosophy in the context of immunology. Our objective was to assess the correlation of "size" (number of edges and minimum vertex cover) of the JAK/STAT network with treatment effect in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), phenotype of viral infection and effect of immunosuppressive agents on a system infected with the coronavirus. We extracted the JAK/STAT pathway from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, hsa04630). The effects of the following drugs, and their combinations, commonly used in RA were tested: methotrexate, prednisolone, rituximab, tocilizumab, tofacitinib and baricitinib. Following viral systems were also tested for their ability to evade the JAK/STAT pathway: Measles, Influenza A, West Nile virus, Japanese B virus, Yellow Fever virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Kaposi's sarcoma virus, Hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, Hendra and Nipah virus and Coronavirus. Good correlation of edges and minimum vertex cover with clinical efficacy were observed (for edge, rho=-0.815, R-2=0.676, p=0.007, for vertex cover rho=-0.793, R-2=0.635, p=0.011). In the viral systems both edges and vertex cover were associated with acuteness of viral infections. In the JAK/STAT system already infected with coronavirus, maximum reduction in size was achieved with baricitinib. To conclude, algebraic and combinatorial invariant of a network may explain its biological behaviour. At least theoretically, baricitinib may be an attractive target for treatment of coronavirus infection.

AB  - PURPOSE: Image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT) recently has shown excellent clinical outcomes with superior local control and less toxicity. For IGABT, T2W (T2-weighted) MRI is the gold standard. However, studies have shown that target delineation with the same results in uncertainties, poor interobserver variabilities, and low conformity indices for high-risk clinical target volume contours. In this study, we investigate the role of diffusion-weighted imaging-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps to aid in IGABT. We also evaluated ADC from the baseline to brachytherapy.
   METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty selected patients were enrolled for this study, and two MRIs were taken at diagnosis and before brachytherapy. Patients were divided into two groups, Group 1 being patients with parametrial involvement before external beam radiotherapy and no parametrial involvement before brachytherapy. Group 2 included patients with parametrial involvement before external beam radiotherapy and persistent parametrial involvement before brachytherapy. ADC was measured at the center, edge, and 1 cm from the edge.
   RESULTS: The measured ADC increased from diagnosis to brachytherapy, and this increase was more for the patients in Group 1 than in Group 2. The mean TDadc (diagnosis ADC, center), TEadc (tumor edge ADC diagnosis), and T1cmDadc (1 cm from edge at diagnosis) were 0.884, 1.45, and 1.9 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively. The TBadc (ADC at brachytherapy, center), TEBadc (tumor edge ADC at brachytherapy), and TE1cmBadc (1 cm from edge brachytherapy) were 1.2, 1.8, and 2.3 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively, p-value <0.00001. No abnormal ADC was present outside the high-risk clinical target volume contours.
   CONCLUSION: MRI-based IGABT using T2W imaging essentially covers all functionally abnormal zones at brachytherapy. Diffusion-weighted imaging, along with ADC maps, should only be used as a supplement for target delineation. (c) 2021 American Brachytherapy Society. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) are integral to the homeostasis of periodontal tissue. The transcription factor Dec1 functions to modulate Porphyromonas gingivalis-induced periodontal inflammation. Here, we aimed to characterize the Dec1-mediated autophagy in PDLFs under inflammatory conditions. Human PDLFs were subjected to an inflammatory environment using P. gingivalis Lipopolysaccaride (LPS) along with Dec1 siRNA in vitro. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were used to evaluate the expression levels of autophagy-related genes and their upstream AKT/mTOR signaling pathways. An experimental P. gingivalis-treated Dec1 knockout (Dec1KO) mouse model was used to confirm the expression of autophagy in PDLFs in vivo. Treatment with P. gingivalis LPS induced the expression of ATG5, Beclin1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) and elevated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta and Dec1 in human PDLFs. Knockdown of Dec1 partly reversed the detrimental influences of LPS on these autophagy markers in human PDLFs. The inhibition of autophagy with Dec1 siRNA suppressed the inflammatory effect of AKT/mTOR signaling pathways following treatment with P. gingivalis LPS. P. gingivalis-treated Dec1KO mice partly reduced autophagy expression. These findings suggest that a Dec1 deficiency can modulate the interaction between autophagy and inflammation in PDLFs.

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis study was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of CD in low and high risk groups in this region. Following keywords were searched in the Medline, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane database according to the MeSH terms; celiac disease, prevalence, high risk population and Asian-Pacific region. Prevalence studies published from January 1991 to March 2018 were selected. Prevalence of CD with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using STATA software, version 14. The pooled sero-prevalence of CD among low risk group in Asia-Pacific region was 1.2% (95% CI 0.8-1.7%) in 96,099 individuals based on positive anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-t-TG Ab) and/or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA). The pooled prevalence of biopsy proven CD in Asia-Pacific among high and low risk groups was 4.3% (95% CI 3.3-5.5%) and 0.61% (95% CI 0.4-0.8%) in 10,719 and 70,344 subjects, respectively. In addition, the pooled sero-prevalence and prevalence of CD in general population was significantly higher in children compared with adults and it was significantly greater in female vs. male (P<0.05). Our results suggest high risk individuals of CD are key group that should be specifically targeted for prevention and control measures, and screening may prove to have an optimal cost-benefit ratio.

AB  - Aim To present the endodontic management of a patient diagnosed with a high-flow arteriovenous malformation (AVM) requiring root canal treatment and to discuss the relevant endodontic literature for this rare but significant problem.
   AVM is a complex communication of an artery and a vein in which the oxygenated blood is forced away from the intended tissue. The incidence of its occurrence in the face and neck is rare, and when present, the most common sign is gingival bleeding. Arteriovenous malformation is both a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for dentists. Also, there is ambiguity regarding the precautions to be taken whilst doing endodontic procedures in such cases. Hence, there is a need to understand the disease process and its implications in order to prevent life-threatening complications during treatment. This case report highlights the successful endodontic management of a cariously exposed right maxillary second premolar in a patient diagnosed with high-flow AVM. On an orthopantomogram, the AVM was spreading in the left submandibular space involving the left ramus area. The clinical findings of limited mouth opening with inter-appointment swelling and trismus during treatment made the case unusual and challenging. This paper addresses the current understanding of the classification, diagnosis, clinical features and endodontic management, together with specific guidelines and recommendations whilst performing endodontic procedures in AVM cases.
   Key learning points
   The classification and oral manifestations of AVM must be known and understood.
   Practitioners should be aware of the radiographic appearance of AVM.
   Recommended precautions should be taken when carrying out restorative and endodontic procedures in a patient with AVM.
   Antibiotic prophylaxis may be considered before endodontic treatment in a patient with AVM.
   Multidisciplinary treatment planning may be required.

AB  - Nanoparticles with longer blood circulation, high loading capacity, controlled release at the targeted site, and preservation of camptothecin (CPT) in its lactone form are the key characteristics for the effective delivery of CPT. In this regard, natural membrane-derived nanovesicles, particularly those derived from RBC membrane, are important. RBC membrane can be engineered to form vesicles or can be coated over synthetic nanoparticles, without losing their basic structural features and can have prolonged circulation time. Here, we developed a hybrid system to encapsulate CPT inside the amphiphilic micelle and coat it with RBC membrane. Thus, it uses the dual ability of polymeric micelles to preserve CPT in its active form, while maintaining its "stealth" effect due to conserved RBC membrane coating. The hybrid system stabilized 60% of the drug in its active form even after 30 h of incubation in serum, in contrast to 15% active form present in free drug formulation after 1 h of incubation. It showed strong retention inside the Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) mice models for at least 72 h, suggesting camouflaging ability conferred by RBC membrane. Additionally, the nano formulation retarded the tumor growth rate more efficiently than free drug, with no evident signs of necrotic skin lesions. Histopathological analysis showed a significant reduction in cardiac atrophy, hepato-renal degeneration, and lung metastasis, which resulted in the increased overall survival of mice treated with the nano formulation. Hence, CPT-loaded polymeric micelles when coated with RBC membrane can prove to be a better system for the delivery of poorly soluble drug camptothecin.
   Statement of significance
   RBC-derived nanovesicles have the ability to evade host's immune response and act as an alternative to synthetic analogues for personalized chemotherapy. Topoisomerase inhibitors, specifically camptothecin and its analogues, show optimum antitumor activity, but their therapeutic potential is limited due to their water insolubility and hydrolysis at physiological pH before cell uptake. Although most of the previous studies have focused on using RBC-derived nanovesicles for the delivery of water-soluble therapeutics, we could not find much studies where such a system has been used to deliver insoluble and hydrolytically labile camptothecin. Here, we report polymeric micelles coated with hybrid nanovesicles derived from erythrocytes that protect CPT against hydrolysis and act as a long-time circulating nanoparticle system, thus limiting its side effects.

AB  - The quest for effective anticancer therapeutics continues to be extensively pursued. Over the past century, several drugs have been developed, however, a majority of these drugs have a poor therapeutic index and increased toxicity profile. Hence, there still exists ample opportunity to discover safe and effective anticancer drugs. Aurora Kinase B (AurB), a member of the Aurora kinase family and a key regulator of mitotic cell division, is found to be frequently overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and has thus emerged as an attractive target for the design of anticancer therapeutics. In the present study, a structure-based scaffold hopping approach was utilized to modify the heterocyclic moiety of (S)-3-(3-aminopyrrolidine-1-carbonyl)-4,11-dihydroxy-2-methylanthra [2,3-b]furan-5,10-dione (anthrafuran 1) to generate a series of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives, which were then subjected to virtual screening for the identification of potential AurB inhibitors. The obtained hits were subsequently synthesized and evaluated by using a combination of in silico and biophysical techniques for elucidating their in vitro binding and inhibition activity with recombinantly expressed AurB. Four identified hits presented an improved binding profile as compared to their parent analog anthrafuran 1. One derivative, anthrathiophene 2 demonstrated excellent in vitro inhibition of AurB (7.3 mu M). (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota is involved in the metabolic transformations of dietary components into oncometabolites and tumor-suppressive metabolites that in turn affect CRC development. In a healthy colon, the major of microbial metabolism is saccharolytic fermentation pathways. The alpha-bug hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the colorectal site. Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus showed higher abundance whereas Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia showed reduced abundance in CRC patients. The alterations of gut microbiota may be used as potential therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat CRC. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit the growth of CRC through inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis and enhancing the function of the intestinal barrier through the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Crosstalk between lifestyle, host genetics, and gut microbiota is well documented in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Future studies are required to understand the interaction between gut microbiota and host to the influence and prevention of CRC. However, a better understanding of bacterial dysbiosis in the heterogeneity of CRC tumors should also be considered. Metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic studies are considered a powerful omic tool to understand the anti-cancer properties of certain bacterial strains. The clinical benefits of probiotics in the CRC context remain to be determined. Metagenomic approaches along with metabolomics and immunology will open a new avenue for the treatment of CRC shortly. Dietary interventions may be suitable to modulate the growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut.

AB  - The discovery and development of safinamide, an alpha-aminoamide, has been a valuable addition to the existing clinical management of Parkinson's disease (PD). The journey of safinamide dates back to the year 1983, when an alpha-aminoamide called milacemide showed a weak anticonvulsant activity. Milacemide was then structurally modified to give rise to safinamide, which in turn produced robust anticonvulsant activity. The underlying mechanism behind this action of safinamide is attributed to the inhibition of voltage gated calcium and sodium channels. Moreover, owing to the importance of ion channels in maintaining neuronal circuitry and neurotransmitter release, numerous studies explored the potential of safinamide in neurological diseases including PD, stroke, multiple sclerosis and neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and non-dystrophic myotonias. Nevertheless, evidence from multiple preclinical studies suggested a potent, selective and reversible inhibitory activity of safinamide against monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B enzyme which is responsible for degrading dopamine, a neurotransmitter primarily implicated in the pathophysiology of PD. Therefore, clinical studies were conducted to assess safety and efficacy of safinamide in PD. Indeed, results from various Phase 3 clinical trials suggested strong evidence of safinamide as an add-on therapy in controlling the exacerbation of PD. This review presents a thorough developmental history of safinamide in PD and provides comprehensive insight into plausible mechanisms via which safinamide can be explored in other neurological and muscular diseases.

AB  - Introduction. Intra-cavitary brachytherapy (ICB) remains an integral part of radiotherapy treatment in cervical cancer. Two-dimensional X ray point-based planning remains common and blind insertion leads to uterine perforations and higher toxicity. We conducted a randomised controlled trial of using trans-abdominal ultrasound in performing ICB to reduce perforation and organ at risk doses. Patient and methods. The present study is a phase III open label randomised controlled trial of ultrasound guided ICB conducted on invasive cervical cancer patients. Patients were randomised by a simple computergenerated randomization chart into Arm A (No Ultrasound guidance) and Arm B (ICB with ultrasound guidance). The uterine perforation rates, tandem length change rates, bladder doses, rectal dose and procedure times were compared. Fischer exact test was used to compare the arms and p value <0.05 considered significant. Results. A total of 160 patients were randomised. With US assistance, the uterine perforation rate was 1.25% (n = 1). In the non-US assistance arm the perforation rate was 12.5% (n = 10) (p = 0.005). Mean time to complete the entire procedure was significantly shortened from 26 min to 19 min favouring the US arm (p = 0.001). Dosimetric assessment between the two groups showed significant decrease in dose received by the various organs at risk with US assistance. Conclusion. The present study confirms significant improvement in application quality as well as dosimetry with reduction in procedure time. Trans-Abdominal US should be routinely used for ICB procedures, particularly in resource limited settings. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Various new clinical signs and symptoms, such as dysfunction of smell (anosmia) and taste (dysgeusia) have emerged ever since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic begun. The objective of this study was to identify the clinical presentation and factors associated with 'new loss/change of smell (anosmia) or taste (dysgeusia)' at admission in patients positive by real time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All adult COVID-19 patients with new onset anosmia or dysgeusia at admission were included in study group. Equal number of age and gender matched COVID-19 patients without anosmia or dysgeusia at admission were included in the control group. A total of 261 COVID-19 patients were admitted during the study period of which 55 (21%) had anosmia and or dysgeusia. The mean (SD) age was 36 (13) years and majority were males (58%, n = 32). Comorbidity was present in 38% of cases (n = 21). Anosmia and dysgeusia were noted in more than 1/5th of the cases. Anosmia (96%, n = 53) was more common than dysgeusia (75%, n = 41). Presence of both ansomia and dysgeusia was noted in 71% of patients (n = 39). On comparing the cases with the controls, on univariate analysis, fever (higher in cases), rhinitis (lower in cases), thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine and bilirubin (all higher in cases) were significantly associated with anosmia or dysgeusia. On multivariate analysis, only rhinitis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.09-0.83; p = .02) thrombocytopenia (OR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.99-0.99; p = .01) and elevated creatinine (OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 1.5-37.6; p = .01) remained significant. In this retrospective study of COVID-19 patients, we found anosmia and dysgeusia in more than 1/5th of the cases. Absence of rhinitis, low platelet counts and elevated creatinine were associated with anosmia or dysgeusia in these patients.

AB  - Lymphomas are a group of neoplasm arising from immune cells with varied clinical presentation, molecular profile, morphology and immunophenotype. The epidemiology and response to treatment varies among patients from different geographical locations. We analyze the demographic characteristics of lymphomas in a tertiary care center of India over a period of five years. This was a retrospective study including cases from 2015 to 2019 which were classified according to WHO classification 2017. A total of 4115 lymphoma cases were diagnosed. Hodgkin lymphomas (HL) comprised 30.35% (n = 1249), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) was 69.65% (n = 2866). Site of presentation was nodal in 64.76% cases, and 35.23% were extranodal. There was an overall male predominance. Among the NHLs, B-cell type comprised of 84.08% and 15.38% was T- and NK cell lymphomas. Mature B cell lymphomas comprised 82.41% with predominant being diffuse large B cell lymphoma type (42.53%) followed by follicular lymphoma (10.81%) and small lymphocytic lymphoma (6.10%). Among the T-cell type, PTCL NOS (2.65%) was the predominant subtype followed by ALK positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL-ALK+) (2.44%), extranodal NK-T cell lymphoma (2.02%) and others. Classical type was predominant type (97.91%) among HL, and 2.08% were nodular lymphocyte predominant type. Among the classical HL, nodular sclerosis (28.1%) and mixed cellularity (32.18%) co-dominated. Our study indicates that the Indian population differs in the prevalence, presentation and the subtyping among various lymphomas. Higher prevalence of Hodgkin lymphoma, DLBCL, ALK + ALCL and immature cell neoplasm was noted.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Centella asiatica (CA) is commonly used herbal medicine for treatment of epilepsy. CA has CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes inhibition property and used as an adjuvant therapy with conventional antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). That may be responsible for herb-drug interaction.
   Aim of the study: The present study was planned to evaluate interactions profile of hydroalcoholic extract Centella asiatica (HECA) with antiepileptic drugs in experimental models of epilepsy in rats.
   Materials and methods: Wistar rats (175-200 g) were used. In the pharmacodynamic interaction study, seizures were induced using pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and maximal electroshock seizure (MES) (70 mA for 0.2 s). The therapeutic and sub-therapeutic doses of valproate (VPA) and phenytoin (PHT) were co-administrated with HECA in PTZ and MES model of seizures respectively. Behavioural parameters were assessed using elevated plus maze test and passive avoidance paradigm. Rat brain oxidative stress parameters were also assessed. In the pharmacokinetic interaction study, the serum levels of the VPA and PHT were estimated at different time intervals by HPLC and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed by WinNonlin software.
   Results: The VPA and PHT produced complete protection against seizures in their therapeutic doses but not with sub-therapeutic doses. However, co-administration of HECA with a sub-therapeutic dose of VPA and PHT enhanced the protection of seizures and significantly (p < 0.001) attenuated the seizure induced oxidative stress and cognitive impairment. It also significantly increased (p < 0.001) serum levels of VPA and PHT. The alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters (maximum serum concentration, area under the curve, clearance) of AEDs were also found with co-administration of HECA.
   Conclusion: The results suggested that co-administration of HECA could improve the therapeutic efficacy of VPA and PHT. But, alteration in pharmacokinetic parameters revel that needs critical medical supervision to avoid any toxic reactions.

AB  - Genome analysis of Halomonas shambharensis, a novel species, was performed to understand the osmoprotectant strategies used by the strain to overcome the salinity stress and to explore the prospective industrial uses. It will also help to better understand the ecological roles of Halomonas species in hypersaline habitats. Ultrastructure of the cell was determined by using transmission electron microscopy. Standard microbiological methods were used to find out growth parameters and heterotrophic mode of nutrition. For Genome analysis, complete bacterial genome sequencing was performed using the Oxford Nanopore MinION DNA Sequencer. Assembly, annotation and finishing of the obtained sequence were done by using a Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP) (SPAdes v. 3.10.1). Predicted Coading sequences (CDSs) obtained through the PGAP were used for functional annotation using Clusters of Orthologous Groups and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) platforms. The H. shambharensis was found to be a Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, motile with a peritrichous flagella. The H. shambharensis bacterium can grow in a wide range of temperature (from 25 to 65 degrees C), pH (pH 4 to pH 12.0) and salt concentration (5.0% NaCl to 30.0% NaCl). After annotation and assembly, the total genome size obtained was 1,533,947 bp, which revealed 146 subsystems, 3847 coding sequences, and 19RNAs with G+C content of 63.6%. Gene annotation identified the genes related to various metabolic pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and stress tolerance. The genomic dataset of H. shambharensis will be useful for analysis of protein-coding gene families and how these coding genes are significant for the survival and metabolism among the different species of Halomonas.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence patients' motivation and ability to self-manage their diabetes and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: From 2016 to 17, in-depth interviews were conducted with 62 patients receiving the INDEPENDENT care model across two clinics in India. Using a realist evaluation approach, a hypothesized program theory for patient activation was tested and refined.
   Findings: The refined theory demonstrates that motivation, education, and engagement cumulatively contribute to patient activation.
   Conclusion: The results indicate that positive and sustained patient-provider relationships drive patient motivation and enhance implementation of the care model.

AB  - Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a benign condition with difficulties associated with its diagnosis and management. We present the 5-year experience of management and outcomes following laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the patients of a predominantly northern Indian population cohort. A retrospective study was conducted in patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy between January 2013 and December 2017. Pre-operative characteristics, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes were obtained from medical records. Out of the 1513 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy during the study period, 60 (3.9%) were histologically confirmed as XGC, 26 (43.3%) were men, and 34 (56.7%) were women with a mean age of 50.6 years (range 15-76). The mean follow-up period was 45.5 SD10.6 months. Most patients presented with right hypochondrium pain (63.6%). Cholelithiasis was the most common ultrasonographic (USG) finding (91.7%). On noting suspicious findings of malignancy on USG, a further contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) was performed, and if further doubt persisted USG-guided cytological examination was performed. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 55 (91.7%) patients with a conversion rate of 8.3%. Eight patients underwent partial cholecystectomy. The overall complication rate was 10%, with no early (30-day) mortality. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has shown effective results with minimal morbidity in the management of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC). A comprehensive evaluation with CECT and image guided-FNAC may help in differentiating this condition from gallbladder carcinoma.

AB  - Purpose: Circulating tumor cells (CTC) have been demonstrated to have prognostic and predictive role in certain human cancers. However, studies exploring their role in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of CTC in mRCC.
   Materials and methods: In this prospective study, 35 patients with mRCC were analyzed for the presence of CTC before starting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Progression-free and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. The prediction to TKI therapy was calculated with the response to treatment determined by standard imaging techniques.
   Results: Outcomes were assessed according to the CTC positivity at baseline, before the patients started TKI for mRCC. At a mean follow-up of 12.4 +/- 4.1 months, disease progression was noted in 17 patients (48.6%) including 8 deaths (22.9%). CTC positive patients had a significantly lower progression-free survival rate (12.5% vs. 64.1%, respectively; P = 0.009) but not in the overall survival rate (75% vs. 76.3%, respectively; P = 0.88) in the Kaplan-Meier estimation curves. CTC positivity at baseline significantly predicted a poorer response to TKI (87.5% vs. 37.1%, P = 0.01). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis showed that CTC at baseline was the most significant predictor of progression-free survival (hazard ratio 4.17, 95% confidence interval 1.41-11.99, P = 0.01).
   Conclusions: Baseline CTC detection can be an important prognostic factor of progression-free survival and significant predictor of poor response to TKI in patients with metastatic RCC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Our aim is to propose an evidence-based strategy for screening postpartum dysglycemia.
   Methods: This study included adult non-pregnant women who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes (GDM) using International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group (IADPSG) criteria during their index pregnancy (2012-2019). Eligible participants underwent a concurrent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) test. A detailed questionnaire documenting relevant personal and medical history was filled, and the relevant anthropometric parameters were recorded.
   Results: We evaluated data from 377 women at a mean (+/- SD) age of 32.1 +/- 4.6 years and at a median duration of 15 (10-33) months following childbirth. Diabetes was diagnosed in 42 (11.1%) women. Use of a combination cutoff [fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >= 6.1 mmol/L or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >= 6.0% (42 mmol/mol)] avoided OGTT in 80.9% of the study cohort, without missing the diagnosis of diabetes in any study subject. The diagnosis was missed in 2.4% of women with diabetes (and 0.3% of whole cohort) using only the FPG criterion (>= 5.6 mmol/L) or HbA1c criterion [HbA1c >= 5.7% (39 mmol/mol)] alone. These tests avoided the need for an OGTT in 75.3% and 65.5% of women, respectively.
   Conclusions: The proposed strategies are likely to be both patient- and physician-friendly and have the potential to address several barriers for postpartum screening among women with prior GDM.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the prescription pattern of patients with BD, currently in clinical remission. Additional aim of the study was tocompare the prescription pattern across different study centres.
   Methodology: Prescription of 773 patients, currently in clinical remission, recruited from the outpatient setting of 14 General Hospital Tertiary Care Units of tertiary care centres in the country were evaluated.
   Results: Almost all (98.1 %) participants were on medications at the time of assessment. In terms of conventional mood stabilizers, those receiving valproate (44.2 %), out-numbered those receiving lithium (38.9 %). A small proportion (7.4 %) was receiving a combination of both valproate and lithium. About two-third (62.5 %) were receiving at least one antipsychotic medication, with olanzapine (31.7 %) being the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic, followed by quetiapine (11.1 %), and risperidone (9.6 %). About one-third (34.4 %) of the participants were receiving antidepressants, with sertraline (22.6 %) forming bulk of the prescription. Less than half (43.9 %) of the participants were also receiving a benzodiazepine medication at the time of assessment, with chlordiazepoxide (18 %) being the most common agent, followed by clonazepam (14.5 %). There was variation in the prescription patterns across different centres, in terms of monotherapy, polypharmacy, use of preferred conventional mood stabilizers, use of various antipsychotics and antidepressants.
   Conclusion: Besides conventional mood stabilizers, about two-third of patients with bipolar disorder received concomitant antipsychotics, one-third received concomitant antidepressants and less than half received benzodiazepines.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection assays are crucial for gathering seroepidemiological information and monitoring the sustainability of antibody response against the virus. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein's receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very specific target for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detection. Moreover, many neutralizing antibodies are mapped to this domain, linking antibody response to RBD with neutralizing potential. Detection of IgG antibodies, rather than IgM or total antibodies, against RBD is likely to play a larger role in understanding antibody-mediated protection and vaccine response. Here we describe a rapid and stable RBD-based IgG ELISA test obtained through extensive optimization of the assay components and conditions. The test showed a specificity of 99.79% (95% CI: 98.82-99.99%) in a panel of pre-pandemic samples (n = 470) from different groups, i.e., pregnancy, fever, HCV, HBV, and autoantibodies positive. Test sensitivity was evaluated using sera from SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive individuals (n = 312) and found to be 53.33% (95% CI: 37.87-68.34%), 80.47% (95% CI: 72.53-86.94%), and 88.24% (95% CI: 82.05-92.88%) in panel 1 (days 0-13), panel 2 (days 14-20) and panel 3 (days 21-27), respectively. Higher sensitivity was achieved in symptomatic individuals and reached 92.14% (95% CI: 86.38-96.01%) for panel 3. Our test, with a shorter runtime, showed higher sensitivity than parallelly tested commercial ELISAs for SARS-CoV-2-IgG, i.e., Euroimmun and Zydus, even when equivocal results in the commercial ELISAs were considered positive. None of the tests, which are using different antigens, could detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in 10.5% RT-PCR positive individuals by the fourth week, suggesting the lack of IgG response.

AB  - Objectives To study whether a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) can be of assistance to radiologists in differentiating Coronavirus disease (COVID)-positive from COVID-negative patients using chest X-ray (CXR) through an ambispective clinical study. To identify subgroups of patients where artificial intelligence (AI) can be of particular value and analyse what imaging features may have contributed to the performance of AI by means of visualisation techniques.
   Methods CXR of 487 patients were classified into [4] categories-normal, classical COVID, indeterminate, and non-COVID by consensus opinion of 2 radiologists. CXR which were classified as "normal" and "indeterminate" were then subjected to analysis by AI, and final categorisation provided as guided by prediction of the network. Precision and recall of the radiologist alone and radiologist assisted by AI were calculated in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. Attention maps of the CNN were analysed to understand regions in the CXR important to the AI algorithm in making a prediction.
   Results The precision of radiologists improved from 65.9 to 81.9% and recall improved from 17.5 to 71.75 when assistance with AI was provided. AI showed 92% accuracy in classifying "normal" CXR into COVID or non-COVID. Analysis of attention maps revealed attention on the cardiac shadow in these "normal" radiographs.
   Conclusion This study shows how deployment of an AI algorithm can complement a human expert in the determination of COVID status. Analysis of the detected features suggests possible subtle cardiac changes, laying ground for further investigative studies into possible cardiac changes.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate safety and efficacy of angiogenesis induced by intraarterial autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell (BMSC)injection in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
   Materials and Methods: Eighty-one patients with severe PAD (77 men), including 56 with critical limb ischemia (CLI) and 25 with severe claudication, were randomized to receive sham injection (group A) or intraarterial BMSC injection at the site of occlusion (groupB). Primary endpoints included improvement in ankle-brachial index (ABI) of > 0.1 and transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) of> 15% at mid- and lower foot at 6 mo. Secondary endpoints included relief from rest pain, > 30% reduction in ulcer size, and reductionin major amputation in patients with CLI and > 50% improvement in pain-free walking distance in patients with severe claudication.
   Results: Technical success was achieved in all patients, without complications. At 6 mo, group B showed more improvements in ABI of > 0.1 (35 of 41 [85.37%] vs 13 of 40 [32.50%]; P <.0001) and TcPO2 of > 15% at the midfoot (35 of 41 [85.37%] vs 17 of 40[42.50%]; P <.0001] and lower foot (37 of 41 [90.24%] vs 19 of 40 [47.50%]; P <.0001). No patients with CLI underwent major amputation in group B, compared with 4 in group A (P <.0390). No significant difference was observed in relief from rest pain or >30% reduction in ulcer size among patients with CLI or in > 50% improvement in pain-free walking distance among patients with severe claudication.
   Conclusions: Intraarterial delivery of autologous BMSCs is safe and effective in the management of severe PAD.

AB  - Cryptococcosis is a life-threatening infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii species complex. In the present study, to understand the molecular epidemiology of 208 clinical isolates of Cryptococcus from different parts of India, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) using ISHAM MLST consensus scheme for C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex was used. MLST analysis yielded a total of 10 Sequence Types (STs)-7 STs for C. neoformans and 3 for C. gattii species complex. The majority of isolates identified as C. neoformans belonged to molecular type VNI with predominant STs 31 and 93. Only 3 isolates of C. gattii species complex were obtained, belonging to ST58 and ST215 of VGI and ST69 of VGIV. Phylogenetic analysis revealed less diversity among the clinical Indian isolates compared to the global MLST database. No association between prevalent STs and HIV status, geographical origin or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) could be established.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic having spread globally has profound implications on medical and surgical care, which is given by the health care providers. At this time, though there are guidelines and recommendations for medical management of these patients, there is a lack of guidance on how a plastic surgeon should approach the COVID-19 suspect or infected patient who presents either in an elective or emergency setting. We aim to provide a consensus guideline based on the current recommendations of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the pooled experience of the major centers performing plastic and reconstructive surgery in India.
   Methods: The current guidelines and recommendations on the COVID-19 pandemic were studied from both government and nongovernment sources including ICMR. The problems in the specialty of plastic surgery were categorized into four groups and for each group, separate and individual guidelines have been formulated.
   Guidelines: Consensus guidelines have been formulated for the specialty of Plastic and Reconstructive surgery. The patients requiring plastic surgery service have been categorized into four groups of acute, subacute, chronic, and late category. Acute cases are the ones who require intervention within 24-48 h. Subacute cases are the ones who require intervention in the next 3-10 days, while the chronic are the ones who need plastic surgery preferably within a month. The late category are the ones who need surgery within the next six months. This has been done based on the urgency and priority of surgical intervention titrated against the risks of operating and inadvertently acquiring the exposure of COVID-19-positive patients. Conclusion: Currently, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, there are no clear guidelines specific to the vast majority of patients who come for a plastic surgery intervention. This puts the patients at risk due to the impending plastic surgery problem while at the same time it poses a risk of exposure to COVID-19 for the surgical team. Consensus guidelines are presented, to steer the plastic surgeon in his work, in the wake of COVID-19 crisis. The guidelines are based on firm scientific evidence from the reputed research and regulatory bodies and have been made in consonance with plastic surgery experts around the country, so that these practices best suit the needs of the patients, while being mindful of resource limitations and infection risks. The approach of "delayed conservative treatment" works best in the present case scenario. (C) 2020 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons. Published by El-sevier Ltd.

AB  - Loss of somatosensory feedback after amputation inflicts a serious challenge to achieve postural stability. Improving motor skills by incorporating sensory feedback in rehabilitation protocols for persons with lower limb amputation has been gaining traction over time. However, the control mechanisms involved in this regarding time-frequency analysis have not been investigated yet. The purpose of this study was to explore the frequencies/time-scales responsible for postural stability in trans-femoral amputees with vibrotactile feedback. Center of Pressure (COP) signals were collected from 5 trans-femoral amputees and 10 healthy subjects during weight shifting balance tasks. A customized foot insole was used to estimate the COP for actuation of vibratory feedback. The evaluation of postural sway fluctuations by means of COP excursions with vibrotactile feedback was computed by wavelet transform method. Vibrotactile feedback was found to be effective in controlling low frequency postural sway in amputees. We found significantly higher energy (p = 0.004, 0.0007) at shorter time-scales (j = 6,7, freq. = 0.6-1.25 Hz) and lower energy (p = 0.0006) at longer time-scale (j = 10, freq. = 0.078 Hz) in amputees with vibrotactile feedback in comparison to healthy subjects using Coif 1 wavelet. We also found significant increase in energy (p = 0.003) during forward weight shifting with vibrotactile feedback in the sound limb of amputees in comparison to no feedback session at frequency/time-scales corresponding to somatosensory acuity (j = 6-8, freq. = 0.3-1.5 Hz) using Haar wavelet. These findings reflect the higher contribution of somatosensory receptors in amputees with vibrotactile feedback and may provide a better understanding of the mechanisms associated with standing balance in terms of time-frequency analysis.

KW  - Ectopic pancreas
KW  - Bariatric surgery
AB  - Incidental gastric and small bowel lesions are commonly encountered during bariatric surgery. Resection of these lesions with negative margins in the same sitting is curative; however, this may necessitate intraoperative change of plan. We present a 44-year-old super obese lady in whom an exophytic jejunal mass was found at 80 cm from the ligament of Treitz, which necessitated a change of procedure from one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). The final pathology was ectopic pancreatic tissue. Running the small bowel during initial diagnostic laparoscopy should be a routine step before division of stomach, to avoid technical complexities when operative plan is changed in order to resect an incidentaloma. Bariatric surgeons should be well versed with all the standard bariatric procedures.

AB  - Nickel-titanium (nitinol) is a biocompatible shape memory alloy with hyperelasticity and biocompatibility property. A three-dimensional heat diffusion model was used in conjunction with phase explosion theory to explain the formation of core-shell nanoparticles of nitinol. The diffusion model was used to evaluate the melt-pool temperature in the ablation region, while the phase explosion theory was used to estimate the thermophysical expansion and subsequent fragmentation of molten and vaporized nitinol. The mathematical parameters were formulated in conjunction with the experimental results of pulsed laser ablation of core-shell nitinol nanoparticles of various sizes. The model was further employed to predict the sizes of the nanoparticles produced at other higher fluences and the results were experimentally validated.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a systemic-skeletal disorder characterized by enhanced fragility of bones leading to increased rates of fractures and morbidity in large number of populations. Probiotics are known to be involved in management of various-inflammatory diseases including osteoporosis. But no study till date had delineated the immunomodulatory potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR) in bone-health. In the present study, we examined the effect of probiotic-LR on bone-health in ovariectomy (Ovx) induced postmenopausal mice model. In the present study, we for the first time report that LR inhibits osteoclastogenesis and modulates differentiation of Treg-Th17 cells under in vitro conditions. We further observed that LR attenuates bone loss under in vivo conditions in Ovx mice. Both the cortical and trabecular bone-content of Ovx+LR treated group was significantly higher than Ovx-group. Remarkably, the percentage of osteoclastogenic CD4(+)Ror gamma t(+)Th17 cells at distinct immunological sites such as BM, spleen, LN and PP were significantly reduced, whereas the percentage of anti-osteoclastogenic CD4(+)Foxp3(+)Tregs and CD8(+)Foxp3(+)Tregs were significantly enhanced in LR-treated group thereby resulting in inhibition of bone loss. The osteoprotective role of LR was further supported by serum cytokine data with a significant reduction in osteoclastogenic cytokines (IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-alpha) along with enhancement in anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, IFN-gamma) in LR treated-group. Altogether, the present study for the first time establishes the osteoprotective role of LR on bone health, thus highlighting the immunomodulatory potential of LR in the treatment and management of various bone related diseases including osteoporosis.

AB  - Background Non-surgical factors have been found to have significant impact on outcome following Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA). The study was conducted to know the independent effect of each of the four interacting psychological factors: anxiety, depression, pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia on early outcome following TKA in an Indian population.
   Materials and Methods 104 consecutive patients undergoing TKA were included in the study and followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year. Preoperatively, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to diagnose and quantify anxiety and depression, pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia were assessed using Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, respectively. Outcome was assessed on the basis of Knee Society Score and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Regression analysis was done to know independent effect of each factor on outcome scores.
   Results Nine (8.7%) patients were found to have undiagnosed psychopathology. The patients with psychopathologies were found to have significantly worse knee outcome scores on follow-up, although the rate of improvement in knee symptoms and function was not significantly different from those without psychopathology. The degree of Anxiety correlated with worse knee pain and stiffness up to 6 months while it correlated with poor knee function for a longer duration. The degree of depression and pain catastrophizing correlated with worse knee pain, stiffness and function at all visits while kinesiophobia didn't show correlation independent other factors.
   Conclusion Psychopathology was found to be associated poor knee outcome scores with degree of preoperative depression and pain catastrophizing as significant independent predictors as poor outcome, whereas the effect of degree of anxiety on knee pain and stiffness was found to wane over time. Kinesiophobia didn't show any independent correlation.

AB  - Background Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in humans. Hypoxia has been correlated with the aggressive form of glial tumors, poor prognosis, recurrence and resistance to various therapies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical mediators of hypoxic responses and have shown great potential for cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we focus on the regulatory and functional characterization of miR-196a, a hypoxia-inducible miRNA, in GBM.
   Methods Hypoxia/HIF regulation of miR-196a was assessed by RT-qPCR, promoter-luciferase and ChIP assays in GBM cell lines. miR-196a levels were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-GBM, Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) and Indian GBM patient cohorts. miR-target interactions were studied using RNA/protein quantification and 3'UTR luciferase assays. The effect of miR-196a overexpression/inhibition was assessed on cellular viability, migration and apoptosis under hypoxia and normoxia. Microarray-based gene expression profiling studies were performrd to study the effect of miR-196a on the GBM cellular transcriptome under hypoxia.
   Results We identified miR-196a as a hypoxia-inducible and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-regulated miRNA that plays an oncogenic role in GBM. miR-196a was found to be significantly up-regulated in TCGA-GBM, CGGA glioma as well as Indian GBM patient cohorts. miR-196a overexpression was found to induce cellular proliferation, migration, spheroid formation and colony formation and to inhibit apoptosis, while miR-196a inhibition using anti-miR-196a yielded opposite results, suggesting an oncogenic role of miR-196a in GBM. We further unveiled NRAS, AJAP1, TAOK1 and COL24A1 as direct targets of miR-196a. We also report a complex competitive regulation of oncogenic NRAS by miR-196a, miR-146a and let-7 in GBM. Analysis of microarray-based gene expression data obtained by miR-196a inhibition under hypoxia revealed a role of miR-196a in HIF, calcium adhesion, Wnt and cell adhesion pathways. Interestingly, miR-196a was found to positively regulate the expression of various genes involved in the induction or stabilization of HIFs and in maintenance of hypoxic conditions, thereby suggesting the existence of an indirect miR-196a/HIF positive feedback loop under hypoxia.
   Conclusions Overall, our work identifies a novel association between hypoxia/HIF signalling and miR-196a in GBM and suggests its therapeutic significance.

AB  - Vitamin D is customarily involved in maintaining bone and calcium homeostasis. However, contemporary studies have identified the implication of vitamin D in several cellular processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, wound healing, repair and regulatory systems inclusive of host defence, immunity, and inflammation. Multiple studies have indicated corelations between low serum levels of vitamin D, perturbed pulmonary functions and enhanced incidences of inflammatory diseases. Almost all of the pulmonary diseases including acute lung injury, cystic fibrosis, asthma, COPD, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis, all are inflammatory in nature. Studies have displayed strong inter-relations with vitamin D deficiency and progression of lung disorders; however, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Vitamin D has emerged to possess inhibiting effects on pulmonary inflammation while exaggerating innate immune defenses by strongly influencing functions of inflammatory cells including dendritic cells, monocyte/macrophages, T cells, and B cells along with structural epithelial cells. This review dissects the effects of vitamin D on the inflammatory cells and their therapeutic relevance in pulmonary diseases. Although, the data obtained is very limited and needs further corroboration but presents an exciting area of further research. This is because of its ease of supplementation and development of personalized medicine which could lead us to an effective adjunct and cost-effective method of therapeutic modality for highly fatal pulmonary diseases.

AB  - Background Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) induced oxidative stress and inflammation is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular dementia. The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target for neuroprotection. In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects of dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an Nrf2 activator in an experimental model of vascular dementia.
   Methods Permanent occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries (2-VO) was performed to induce CCH in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. DMF (15, 30, and 60 mg/kg) was administered for 4 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object (NOR) tests. After behavior tests, various oxidative and inflammatory markers were assessed in the hippocampus.
   Results The obtained results indicate that treatment with DMF significantly improved 2 VO-induced cognitive deficits. DMF decreased MDA (p < 0.001), protein carbonyl (PCO) contents (p < 0.001), and acetylcholinesterase (p < 0.01) activities, and inhibited inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, NF-kappa beta, and COX-2) levels. Furthermore, our results showed that DMF augmented GSH (p < 0.001) levels and SOD (p < 0.05), CAT, and GSH-Px (p < 0.001) activities in the hippocampus. Nrf2 (p < 0.05) and its downstream targets HO-1 levels (p < 0.01) and NQO1 (p < 0.05) levels were also up-regulated after DMF treatment.
   Conclusion Taken together, the results demonstrate that DMF could serve as a promising neuroprotective agent for treating vascular dementia.

AB  - This study was performed to determine the efficacy of a fixed (weight based) low dose of rasburicase, as the recommended dose is cost prohibitive. Low-dose rasburicase led to a significant reduction in serum uric acid and creatinine within 24 hours, and response was maintained up to 72 hours. A single dose was effective in 94.5% of patients and led to 95% direct cost savings.
   Background: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a metabolic emergency in hematology patients. The recommended dose of rasburicase for the management of TLS is 0.2 mg/kg per day for 5 days, which is cost prohibitive for many patients. We sought to determine the efficacy of single low-dose rasburicase in the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in TLS. Patients and Methods: We planned a prospective study for the safety and efficacy of fixed (weight based) dose of rasburicase to manage TLS. Patients diagnosed with leukemia/lymphoma with laboratory or clinically confirmed TLS or presence of >= 2 high-risk factors and serum uric acid > 7.5 mg/dL were included. The primary endpoint was uric acid normalization (< 7.5 mg/dL) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. Results: Fifty-five patients were recruited for this study. Pediatric patients (< 18 years) accounted for 43.6% of cases. Rasburicase was provided prophylactically to 43 patients (78.2%) and for treating TLS to 12 (21.8%). Mean standard deviation serum uric acid at baseline and 24 hours was 9.2 +/- 1.8 mg/dL and 3.2 +/- 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. There was significant reduction in the serum uric acid and creatinine (P < .001) within 24 hours of rasburicase administration. The response was maintained up to 72 hours. A single dose of rasburicase was effective in 94.5% of patients. Single low-dose rasburicase led to 95% direct cost savings compared to the recommended dose. Conclusion: Single-dose rasburicase with frequent laboratory monitoring is effective in the management of TLS and offers significant cost reductions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Gluten-free (GF) diet is the only reliable treatment for patients with celiac disease (CeD), but data on the extent of gluten contamination in GF food available in India is scanty. We evaluated gluten content in labeled, imported, and non-labeled GF food products currently available in the Indian market.
   Methods Overall, 794 processed and commercially available packaged GF products (labeled GF (n = 360), imported GF (n = 80), and non-labeled/naturally GF (n = 354)) were collected from supermarkets of National Capital Region of India. Those unavailable in stores were purchased from e-commerce sites or directly from the manufacturers. Gluten level in them was determined by Ridascreen Gliadin sandwich R5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R-Biopharm AG, Germany). As per Codex Alimentarius and Food Safety and Standard Authority of India, "gluten free" labeled products must not contain > 20 mg/kg of gluten.
   Results Overall, 10.1% of 794 GF products including 38 (10.8%) of 360 labeled and 42 (11.8%) of 354 non-labeled/naturally GF food products had gluten content > 20 mg/kg (range: 24.43-355 and 23.2-463.8 mg/kg, respectively). None of the imported GF products had gluten more than the recommended limits. Contaminated products most commonly belonged to cereal and their products (flours, coarse grains, pasta/macaroni, snack foods) pulse flours, spices, and bakery items.
   Conclusions A substantial proportion (10.1%) of GF food products (both labeled and non-labeled) available in India have gluten content greater than the prescribed limits of <20 mg/kg. Physicians, dietitians, support group, and patients with CeD should be made aware of this fact and regulatory bodies should ensure quality assurance.

AB  - The role of Saxagliptin in diabetes-associated cardiovascular complications is controversial. This study aimed to investigate whether Saxagliptin could prevent Isoproterenol-induced myocardial changes in diabetic rats and to identify the possible mechanism as well. The high-fat diet/low-dose Streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats were divided into 3 groups: the control group (0.25% CMC for 28 days), the Isoproterenol group (85 mg/kg Isoproterenol for the last 2 days plus 0.25% CMC for 28 days), and the treatment group (10 mg/kg Saxagliptin for 28 days plus 85 mg/kg Isoproterenol for the last 2 days). Hemodynamic measurements were performed, and samples were examined for RAGE and NF-kappa B expressions, histopathological and ultrastructural changes, AGEs level, myocardial injury markers, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Saxagliptin significantly recovered cardiac function (p < .001), reverted myocardial injury and oxidative stress levels back to the control value (p < .05 to p < .001). Saxagliptin alleviates Isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury in diabetic rats by suppressing AGE-RAGE pathway.

AB  - Sandwich composites are three-dimensional (3D) composite structures that offer higher stiffness with overall low density. However, they suffer from low strength; thus, not suited for load bearing applications. In this work, an attempt is made to develop a high strength lightweight sandwich composite suited for load-bearing applications. A sandwich composite based on 3D integrally woven fabric with thickness 3 mm as the core and strengthened with additional 2x2 twill woven carbon fabric face-sheets is reported. The samples were manufactured by wet hand lay co-lamination process using Araldite (R) LY 1564 epoxy as the matrix polymer and with fiber fraction of 50% by weight. The number of additional carbon face-sheets over the core was varied from two to eight in steps of two. The composite samples were experimented under three-point bending and edgewise compression tests to determine the flexural and compressive strengths in both warp and weft directions. The weft direction samples yielded higher flexural and compressive strengths due to the continuous arrangement of the core pile yarn. The samples with six carbon face-sheets tested along the weft direction offered the highest specific strengths of-409 kN m/kg and 259 kN m/kg in bending and compression tests. Similarly, the flexural strength was-340 MPa, and compressive strength was-217 MPa. A detailed fractography study revealed no core crushing or compression failure of the core during bending tests.

AB  - Oxysterols play vital roles in the human body, ranging from cell cycle regulation and progression to dopaminergic neurogenesis. While naive human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have been explored to have neurogenic effect, there is still a grey area to explore their regenerative potential after in vitro differentiation. Hence, in the current study, we have investigated the neurogenic effect of 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (22-HC) on hMSCs obtained from bone marrow, adipose tissue and dental pulp. Morphological and morphometric analysis revealed physical differentiation of stem cells into neuronal cells. Detailed characterization of differentiated cells affirmed generation of neuronal cells in culture. The percentage of generation of non-DA cells in the culture confirmed selective neurogenic potential of 22-HC. We substantiated the efficacy of these cells in neuro-regeneration by transplanting them into Parkinson's disease Wistar rat model. MSCs from dental pulp had maximal regenerative effect (with 80.20 +/- 1.5% in vitro differentiation efficiency) upon transplantation, as shown by various behavioural examinations and immunohistochemical tests. Subsequential analysis revealed that 22-HC yields a higher percentage of functional DA neurons and has differential effect on various tissue-specific primary human MSCs. 22-HC may be used for treating Parkinson's disease in future with stem cells.

AB  - The neural crest cell-derived enteric nervous system (ENS) is the intrinsic innervation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) which consists of neurons and enteric glia cells in the myenteric ganglia and forming plexus. The ENS consists mainly of submucosal and myenteric plexuses. It has various functions on the GIT, which include control of local blood flow, motility, mucosal transport, secretions, immune modulation as well as endocrine functions and coordinated contractile activity of smooth muscle. The knowledge on the development of the innervations at different segments of the gut in humans from 11 to 26 weeks of gestation (WG) may help in understanding the pathophysiology of various congenital diseases affecting the ENS. The aim of this study is to determine the morphology of the myenteric plexus in the esophagus, ascending colon and sigmoid colon at various weeks of gestation. Tissue samples from 10 naturally terminated fetuses aged 11-26 WG were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry assay. The neurons, enteric glia, the smooth muscle were visualized using PGP9.5, Vimentin and S-100 antibodies. The number of neurons and enteric glial cells appeared lowest in the esophagus than the ascending and sigmoid colon. The myenteric ganglion was closely apposed to each other, forming a continuous arch along the entire circumference of gut sections of ascending and sigmoid colon but the myenteric ganglia in the esophagus was thinly populated and widely spread in the fetus at 13 WG. As the fetal gastrointestinal tract grew in diameter and length, the myenteric ganglia became discernible.

AB  - The first incidence of COVID-19 was reported in the Wuhan city of Hubei province in China in late December 2019. Because of failure in timely closing of borders of the affected region, COVID-19 spread across like a wildfire through air travel initiating a pandemic. It is a serious lower respiratory track viral infection caused by highly contagious, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavims-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronavims including COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 causes zoonotic diseases and thought to be originated from bats. Since its first incidence, the virus has spread all across the world, causing serious human casualties, economic losses, and disrupting global supply chains. As with SARS-CoV, COVID-19 causing SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar path of airborne infection, but is less lethal and more infectious than SARS and MERS. This review focusses on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, especially on the dysfunctional immune responses following a cytokine storm in severely affected persons. The mode of entry of SARS-CoV-2 is via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors present on the epithelial lining of lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and mucus membranes. Older persons with weaker immune system and associated co-morbidities are more vulnerable to have dysfunctional immune responses, as most of them concomitantly have severe hypovitaminosis D. Consequently, causing severe damage to key organs of the body including lungs and the cardiovascular system. Since, vast majority of persons enters to the intensive care units and died, had severe vitamin D deficiency, thus, this area must be investigated seriously. In addition, this article assesses the role of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19. Vitamin D is a key regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that is exploited by SARS-CoV-2 for entry into the host cells. Further, vitamin D modulates multiple mechanisms of the immune system to contain the virus that includes dampening the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, reduces concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increases levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, enhances the production of natural antimicrobial peptide and activates defensive cells such as macrophages that could destroy SARS-CoV-2. Thus, this article provides the urgency of needed evidences through large population based randomized controlled trials and ecological studies to evaluate the potential role of vitamin D in COVID-19.

AB  - This paper deals with the identification of terrain that is crucial to trigger the damping in semi-active lower limb prosthesis. Objective: To identify level ground and ramp terrains using foot-to-ground angle (FGA) measurement. Methods: First, Instrumented shoe for FGA measurement was developed. Next, data collection from able-bodied (n = 5) and amputee (n = 1) participants was carried out. Finally, a comparison of identification accuracy using support vector machine (SVM) and convolution neural network (CNN) algorithms was done. Results: The average classification accuracy obtained for able-bodied participants and amputee is 79.57% +/- 20.32% and 73.06% +/- 12.70%, respectively using SVM, whereas it is 83.45% +/- 14.50% and 80% +/- 12.15% respectively using CNN. Our off-line analysis shows that overall, CNN outperformed SVM with an average of 4.86% increment in classification accuracy in able-bodied participants and 9.54% in an amputee. This study introduced a simplified, low-cost method for terrain identification in the prosthetic control application.

AB  - India imposed one of the world's strictest population-wide lockdowns on March 25, 2020 for COVID-19. We estimated epidemiological parameters, evaluated the effect of control measures on the epidemic in India, and explored strategies to exit lockdown.
   We obtained patient-level data to estimate the delay from onset to confirmation and the asymptomatic proportion. We estimated the basic and time-varying reproduction number (R-0 and Rt) after adjusting for imported cases and delay to confirmation using incidence data from March 4 to April 25, 2020. Using a SEIR-QDPA model, we simulated lockdown relaxation scenarios and increased testing to evaluate lockdown exit strategies.
   R-0 for India was estimated to be 2.08, and the R-t decreased from 1.67 on March 30 to 1.16 on April 22. We observed that the delay from the date of lockdown relaxation to the start of the second wave increases as lockdown is extended farther after the first wave peak-this delay is longer if lockdown is relaxed gradually.
   Aggressive measures such as lockdowns may be inherently enough to suppress an outbreak; however, other measures need to be scaled up as lockdowns are relaxed. Lower levels of social distancing when coupled with a testing ramp-up could achieve similar outbreak control as an aggressive social distancing regime where testing was not increased.

AB  - Background: Laryngeal sarcoma is rare. We performed a systematic review and individual patient analysis to evaluate the patterns of care, prognostic factors, and role of radiotherapy in laryngeal soft tissue sarcoma.
   Methods: A systematic search on PubMed and Google scholar was done. An individual patient data analysis was done.
   Results: Of the 300 cases of laryngeal sarcoma, 80% underwent surgery. 44% underwent larynx preservation surgery and 25% received radiotherapy with surgery. Median progression free survival (PFS) was 48 months and overall survival (OS) of 224 months for the entire cohort. Patients with large primary, cartilage invasion, and positive margins had numerically worse PFS. Cartilage invasion and primary tumor size >3 cm were the most common risk factors for adjuvant radiation therapy. Patients receiving radiotherapy were not associated with better survival.
   Conclusion: Laryngeal sarcoma associated with a good survival. Larynx preservation surgery is feasible in nearly half patients. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be warranted in patients poor prognostic factors.

AB  - In the twenty-first century, the collaboration of control engineering and the healthcare sector has matured to some extent; however, the future will have promising opportunities, vast applications, and some challenges. Due to advancements in processing speed, the closed-loop administration of drugs has gained popularity for critically ill patients in intensive care units and routine life such as personalized drug delivery or implantable therapeutic devices. For developing a closed-loop drug delivery system, the control system works with a group of technologies like sensors, micromachining, wireless technologies, and pharmaceuticals. Recently, the integration of artificial intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic, neural network, and reinforcement learning with the closed-loop drug delivery systems has brought their applications closer to fully intelligent automatic healthcare systems. This review's main objectives are to discuss the current developments, possibilities, and future visions in closed-loop drug delivery systems, for providing treatment to patients suffering from chronic diseases. It summarizes the present insight of closed-loop drug delivery/therapy for diabetes, gastrointestinal tract disease, cancer, anesthesia administration, cardiac ailments, and neurological disorders, from a perspective to show the research in the area of control theory.

AB  - Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM), has been recently distinguished as an entity distinct from the spectrum of Steven-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). It is characterized by a younger age of onset, predominant mucosal lesions and sparse skin involvement, in contrast to widespread cutaneous lesions in TEN/SJS. While therapy with azithromycin and a short course of corticosteroids suffices in the majority of cases, intravenous immunoglobulin and cyclosporine may be useful in refractory cases. The authors report a 6-y-old girl with mucopurulent conjunctivitis, hemorrhagic oral mucosal crusting, maculopapular skin rash, and positive serology for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The girl recovered following therapy with azithromycin and oral prednisolone. The index case is instructive in highlighting a rare complication of a common infection, and delineates the importance of clinical suspicion and a systematic approach to evaluation and management of MIRM in patients with unusual mucosal lesions and skin rash.

AB  - Thyroid hormones affect testicular development as well as functions like spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis, thereby influencing male fertility. Our group earlier showed that the stimulatory role of the thyroid hormone, T-3, on the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by murine Leydig cells is mediated by steroids and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1 alpha). The current study further defines the signalling pathway(s) utilised by T-3 to stimulate the production of steroids, VEGF and HIF-1 alpha in mouse Leydig tumour cell line (MLTC-1). Specific inhibitors for different signalling molecules were used to study the role of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and its downstream mediators. Expression of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha mRNA were measured by quantitative RT-PCR; VEGF secretion by ELISA; steroid secretion by radioimmunoassay and HIF-1 alpha protein levels by western blotting. Inhibitors of adenylate cyclase (AC), protein kinase A (PKA), sarcoma kinase (SrcK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and MAP kinase kinase (MEK1/2) abolished the T-3-induced increase in VEGF mRNA and protein levels. The same signalling molecules also mediated the increased production of steroids and HIF-1 alpha protein in response to T-3. Therefore, it was concluded that T-3 stimulates steroid secretion and HIF-1 alpha protein in MLTC-1 cells through the AC-cAMP-PKA-PI3K-MEK pathway, which in turn stimulate VEGF production.

AB  - d-Cycloserine is a partial agonist at the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Results have been inconsistent in trials on the efficacy of d-Cycloserine in patients with schizophrenia. We examined the efficacy of d-Cycloserine against negative and cognitive symptoms (primary and co-primary outcomes). Secondary outcomes were efficacy of d-Cycloserine against positive symptoms and the examination of early treatment outcomes. A systematic literature search was carried out using following selection criteria: Population = Patients with Schizophrenia; Intervention = Trials using d-Cycloserine either as monotherapy or adjuvant therapy; Comparison = Placebo or active comparator; Outcome = Change in negative symptoms, cognitive symptoms and positive symptoms; Study design = Randomized controlled trials with parallel design. We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool for risk of bias for study quality appraisal. Effect sizes for trials were calculated separately for negative, positive and cognitive symptom dimensions using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model. Seven studies (pooled N = 413) provided data for meta-analysis. The pooled Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for negative, cognitive, and positive symptom change scores were - 0.32 (95% CI, - 0.75 to 0.11), - 0.05 (95% CI, - 0.91 to 0.81), and - 0.08 (95% CI, - 0.37 to 0.20), respectively. No significant improvement was noted with regard to early outcome. I-2 values for heterogeneity were 61%, 67%, and 0% for studies assessing negative, cognitive, and positive symptom ratings, respectively. d-Cycloserine did not exhibit significant efficacy in treating negative, cognitive, or positive symptoms of schizophrenia at either study-defined endpoint (4-36 weeks) or at four weeks (early outcome).

AB  - We describe a pedicled latissimus dorsi myocutaneous (LDMC) flap with a wing-shaped skin paddle to cover large breast defects. It allows primary closure of the donor site with the added advantage of some flap projection. This is performed utilising the principles of M-plasty and the anatomy of thoracodorsal musculocutaneous perforators, which would not be possible with the conventional flap design. Analysis of a series of 23 patients who underwent breast reconstruction using wing shaped skin component LDMC technique between 2011 and 2019 in a breast unit of a Tertiary Care Hospital is presented here. Patient characteristics, technical details, and outcomes were analysed. Mean patient age was 41 (SD 10.9) years. The mean defect dimensions were 13.5 (SD 3.4) cm and 10.5 (SD 2.6) cm in length and width, respectively. The mean flap area was 147 (SD 67.2 cm(2)).The donor site defect was closed primarily in all the cases. The average length of inhospital stay was 4.9 (SD 1.5) days (range 3-9 days). One patient (4.3%) had marginal necrosis of the flap, three patients (13%) had donor site seroma, and two patients (8.7%) suffered donor site wound dehiscence. None of the complications entailed re-surgery or delay the onset of adjuvant therapy. At a mean follow-up of 37.5 (SD 33.9) months, none of the patients reported tumour recurrence or donor site morbidity. Wing-shaped skin component of latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap offers a simple and reliable pedicled flap to cover large breast defects with minimal donor site morbidity. It creates a mild breast mound and may avoid the use of implants and its associated complications in small-breasted patients. It can be conveniently performed in non-microsurgical setups.

AB  - Background: Intravenous corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC), but 30%-40% of patients fail to respond.
   Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) as adjunctive therapy to intravenous corticosteroids in patients with ASUC.
   Methods: This was an open-label randomised controlled trial, in which patients who were admitted with ASUC between August 2018 and May 2020 were randomised 1:1 to EEN or standard of care (SOC). Patients on EEN received a semi-elemental formula for 7 days along with SOC. The primary outcome was corticosteroid failure, defined by the need for salvage medical therapy or colectomy. Faecal microbial analysis was performed on day 1 and day 7 by 16s ribosomal RNA sequencing in some patients.
   Results: Of 62 patients (mean age 35.3 +/- 12.1 years, 40% male), 32 were randomised to EEN and 30 to SOC. Corticosteroid failure was lower on EEN compared to SOC (intention-to-treat analysis 25% vs 43%, P = 0.051; per protocol analysis 19% vs 43%, P = 0.04), without any difference in colectomy rate (9% vs 13%; P = 0.41). Patients on EEN had a shorter hospital stay [median (range) 10 (8-17) vs 13 (8-24) days; P = 0.04], higher day 7 albumin level (34 +/- 4 vs 29 +/- 3 g/L, P < 0.01), greater reduction in serum C-reactive protein and faecal calprotectin levels (both P = 0.04) and a lower composite outcome of colectomy/hospitalisation at 6 months (16% vs 39%; P = 0.045) compared to SOC. Patients on EEN showed increased abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae on day 7, with reduced Bifidobacterium and Veillonellaceae compared to SOC.
   Conclusions: EEN for 7 days may augment corticosteroid responsiveness in patients with ASUC.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a very aggressive disease with a poor prognosis for advanced-stage tumors. Recent clinical, genomic, and cellular studies have revealed the highly heterogeneous and immunosuppressive nature of HNSCC. Despite significant advances in multimodal therapeutic interventions, failure to cure and recurrence are common and account for most deaths. It is becoming increasingly apparent that tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in HNSCC tumorigenesis, promotes the evolution of aggressive tumors and resistance to therapy, and thereby adversely affects the prognosis. A complete understanding of the TME factors, together with the highly complex tumor-stromal interactions, can lead to new therapeutic interventions in HNSCC. Interestingly, different molecular and immune landscapes between HPV+ve and HPV-ve (human papillomavirus) HNSCC tumors offer new opportunities for developing individualized, targeted chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimen. This review highlights the current understanding of the complexity between HPV+ve and HPV-ve HNSCC TME and various tumor-stromal cross-talk modulating processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), anoikis resistance, angiogenesis, immune surveillance, metastatic niche, therapeutic resistance, and development of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Furthermore, we summarize the recent developments and the rationale behind CIT strategies and their clinical applications in HPV+ve and HPV-ve HNSCC.

AB  - Introduction Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide. Yet there is significant variation in practice concerning its various aspects. This paper report results from the first modified Delphi consensus-building exercise on SG. Methods We established a committee of 54 globally recognized opinion makers in this field. The committee agreed to vote on several statements concerning SG. An agreement or disagreement amongst >= 70.0% experts was construed as a consensus. Results The committee achieved a consensus of agreement (n = 71) or disagreement (n = 7) for 78 out of 97 proposed statements after two rounds of voting. The committee agreed with 96.3% consensus that the characterization of SG as a purely restrictive procedure was inaccurate and there was 88.7% consensus that SG was not a suitable standalone, primary, surgical weight loss option for patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) without dysplasia. There was an overwhelming consensus of 92.5% that the sleeve should be fashioned over an orogastric tube of 36-40 Fr and a 90.7% consensus that surgeons should stay at least 1 cm away from the angle of His. Remarkably, the committee agreed with 81.1% consensus that SG patients should undergo a screening endoscopy every 5 years after surgery to screen for BE. Conclusion A multinational team of experts achieved consensus on several aspects of SG. The findings of this exercise should help improve the outcomes of SG, the commonest bariatric procedure worldwide, and guide future research on this topic.

AB  - Narrow band ultraviolet B (NB UVB) radiation doses are administered during phototherapy for various dermatological ailments. Precise quantification of these doses is vital because the absorbed irradiation can cause adverse photochemical reactions which can lead to potential phototherapeutic side effects. The paper presents development of diacetylene based dosimeter for the determination of therapeutic NB UVB doses during phototherapy. The amide terminated diacetylene analogues have been synthesized by tailoring them with different functional groups. The synthesized diacetylene monomers have been introduced in a polyvinyl alcohol binder solution to obtain a film dosimeter. The influence of different headgroups on the colorimetric response to UV radiation has been studied. Among all the synthesized diacetylene analogues, the naphthylamine substituted diacetylene exhibited excellent color transition from white to blue color at 100 mJ cm(-2) NB UVB radiation dose. The developed amide films can be easily pasted on multiple sites of the patient's skin to monitor doses during phototherapy simultaneously at different anatomical regions. The digital image processing of the scanned images of the irradiated films facilitates rapid dose measurement which enables facile implementation of the developed film dosimeters and promising application in routine clinical dosimetry.

AB  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) cohorts across the world have allowed better understanding of SLE, including its bimodal mortality, and the impact of social factors and ethnicity on outcomes. The representation of patients from South Asia has been poor in the existing SLE cohorts across the world. Hence, we planned to initiate an inception cohort to understand the diversity of lupus in India. Indian SLE Inception cohort for REsearch (INSPIRE), planned over 5 years is a multi-centric cohort of adult and childhood lupus patients of Indian origin, fulfilling the SLICC-2012 classification criteria, with an aim to provide cross-sectional information on demography, ethnicity, socio-economic status, standard disease variables, quality of life, and prospective information on new events like hospitalization, infections, pregnancies, changes in disease activity, and damage. One of the other deliverables of this project is the establishment of a biorepository. The instruments to be used for each variable and outcome were finalized, and a web-enabled case report form was prepared to encompass SLEDAI, BILAG, SLICC damage scores, and Lupus quality-of-life index. Ten centers located in different geographic areas of India would enroll patients who are seen for the first time after the start of the study. In the first 8 months, 476 patients (63 children, 36 males) have been enrolled with a median disease duration of 10 (IQR 4-17) months and mucocutaneous features being the most prevalent clinical manifestations. INSPIRE is the first prospective Indian SLE cohort to study the diversity of Indian patients.

AB  - Background Sovateltide (IRL-1620, PMZ-1620), an endothelin-B receptor agonist, has been previously shown to increase cerebral blood flow, have anti-apoptotic activity and produce neurovascular remodeling when administered intravenously following acute cerebral ischemic stroke in rats. Its safety and tolerability were confirmed in healthy human volunteers (CTRI/2016/11/007509).
   Objective Our objective was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of sovateltide as an addition to standard of care (SOC) in patients with acute cerebral ischemic stroke.
   Methods A prospective, multicentric, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted to compare the safety (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of sovateltide in patients with acute cerebral ischemic stroke. Adult males or females aged 18-70 years who had experienced a radiologically confirmed ischemic stroke within the last 24 h were included in the study. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage and those receiving endovascular therapy were excluded. Patients randomized to the sovateltide group received three doses of sovateltide (each dose 0.3 mu g/kg) administered as an intravenous bolus over 1 min at an interval of 3 +/- 1 h on day 1, day 3 and day 6 (total dose of 0.9 mu g/kg/day). Patients randomized to the placebo group received an equal volume of saline. Every patient in both groups received SOC for stroke. Efficacy was evaluated using neurological outcomes based on National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index (BI) scores from day 1 through day 90. Quality of life was measured using the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL) at 60 and 90 days of follow-up.
   Results A total of 40 patients with acute cerebral ischemic stroke were enrolled in this study, of whom 36 completed the 90-day follow-up. Patients received saline (n = 18; 11 male and 7 female) or sovateltide (n = 18; 15 male and 3 female) within 24 h of onset of stroke. The number of patients receiving investigational drug within 20 h of onset of stroke was 14/18 in the saline group and 10/18 in the sovateltide group. The baseline characteristics and SOC in both cohorts was similar. Sovateltide was well-tolerated, and all patients received complete treatment with no incidence of drug-related adverse events. Hemodynamic, biochemical or hematological parameters were not affected by sovateltide. Sovateltide treatment resulted in improved mRS and BI scores on day 6 compared with day 1 (p < 0.0001), an effect not seen in the saline group. Sovateltide increased the frequency of favorable outcomes at 3 months. An improvement of >= 2 points on the mRS was observed in 60 and 40% of patients in the sovateltide and saline groups, respectively (p = 0.0519; odds ratio [OR] 5.25). An improvement on the BI of >= 40 points was seen in 64 and 36% of the sovateltide and saline groups, respectively (p = 0.0112; OR 12.44). An improvement of >= 6 points on the NIHSS was seen in 56% of patients in the sovateltide group versus 43% in the saline group (p = 0.2714; OR 2.275). The number of patients with complete recovery (defined as an NIHSS score of 0 and a BI of 100) was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in the sovateltide group than in the saline group. An assessment of complete recovery using an mRS score of 0 did not show a statistically significant difference between the treatment groups. Sovateltide treatment resulted in improved quality of life as measured by the EQ-5D and SSQoL on day 90.
   Conclusion Sovateltide was safe and well-tolerated and resulted in improved neurological outcomes in patients with acute cerebral ischemic stroke 90 days post-treatment.

AB  - The parental rotavirus strain 116E (G9P[11]) used to generate Rotavac (R) vaccine was isolated in 1986 in New Delhi. Thenceforward, there is no comprehensive report on diversity of G9 rotavirus strains from 116E; therefore, the present study evaluates the VP7 gene sequence diversity of G9 strains (retrieved from GenBank) from different geographical regions (1987-2016). Additionally, 22 recently collected G9 strains from Himachal Pradesh and Delhi (2013-2016) were included in the phylogenetic analysis. Interestingly, unlike 116E which belong to lineage-II all other G9 rotavirus including these 22 samples clustered together in a separate lineage (III). Further, six amino acid substitutions including one novel, K143M (epitope 7-2) different from 116E were detected mostly in the neutralization epitopes of VP7 protein (neutralization escape mutants). Overall, the accumulation of identified substitutions in VP7 epitopes and evolution of G9 strains in India may have impact on Rotavac (R) efficacy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Preparation and characterization of nanocurcumin based hybrid virosomes as a drug delivery vehicle with enhanced anticancerous activity and reduced toxicity
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The present study represents a formulation of nanocurcumin based hybrid virosomes (NC-virosome) to deliver drugs at targeted sites. Curcumin is a bioactive component derived from Curcuma longa and well-known for its medicinal property, but it exhibits poor solubility and rapid metabolism, which led to low bioavailability and hence limits its applications. Nanocurcumin was prepared to increase the aqueous solubility and to overcome all the limitations associated with curcumin. Influenza virosomes were prepared by solubilization of the viral membrane with 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DSPC). During membrane reconstitution, the hydrophilic nanocurcumin was added to the solvent system, followed by overnight dialysis to obtain NC-virosomes. The same was characterized using a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope (SEM), MTT assay was used to evaluate it's in vitro-cytotoxicity using MDA-MB231 and Mesenchyme stem cells (MSCs). The results showed NC-virosomes has spherical morphology with size ranging between 60 and 90 nm. It showed 82.6% drug encapsulation efficiency. The viability of MDA-MB231 cells was significantly inhibited by NC-virosome in a concentration-dependent manner at a specific time. The IC50 for nanocurcumin and NC-virosome was 79.49 and 54.23 mu g/ml, respectively. The site-specific drug-targeting, high efficacy and non- toxicity of NC-virosomes proves its future potential as drug delivery vehicles.

AB  - This study presents nanoparticle-based vaccine development for Hepatitis E virus (HEV). Gold nanoparticles (GNP) of average size 12 nm were synthesized by citrate reduction method followed by functionalization with cysteamine hydrochloride for nano-conjugation. Immune response of nano-conjugates of GNP with 26 kDa protein (368-606 amino acids) and 54 kDa protein (112-606 amino acids) were evaluated. In vitro release kinetics of GNP-conjugated 54 kDa (GNP54) and 26 kDa (GNP26) proteins showed slower rate of release of 54 kDa protein as compared to 26 kDa protein. Humoral immune response of mice immunized intramuscularly with GNP54, GNP26 and GNP alone, exhibited HEV-specific IgG titer of 7.9 +/- 2.9, 5.686 +/- 4.098 and 0.698 +/- 0.089, respectively, after 14 days of booster immunization. In addition to this, HEV-specific cell-mediated immune response was demonstrated by splenocyte proliferation assay. Analysis of results using one-way ANOVA, showed statistically significant (p value<0.05) increase in splenocyte proliferation for GNP54- and GNP26-immunized mice in comparison to GNP alone immunized mice. Stimulation index of HEV ORF2 proteins in GNP54/GNP26-immunized mice were comparable to Concanavalin A-treated positive control. These results indicate GNP-based vaccine as a promising candidate for efficiently mediating both humoral and cell-mediated immune response against HEV.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase, a heme-containing glycoprotein, catalyzes the oxidation of thiocyanate by hydrogen peroxide into hypothiocyanite which acts as an antibacterial agent. The prosthetic heme moiety is attached to the protein through two ester linkages via Glu258 and Asp108. In lactoperoxidase, the substrate-binding site is formed on the distal heme side. To study the effect of physiologically important potassium ion on the structure and function of lactoperoxidase, the fresh protein samples were isolated from yak (Bos grunniens) colostrum and purified to homogeneity. The biochemical studies with potassium fluoride showed a significant reduction in the catalytic activity. Lactoperoxidase was crystallized using 200 mM ammonium nitrate and 20% PEG-3350 at pH 6.0. The crystals of LPO were soaked in the solution of potassium fluoride and used for the X-ray intensity data collection. Structure determination at 2.20 angstrom resolution revealed the presence of a potassium ion in the distal heme cavity. Structure determination further revealed that the propionic chain attached to pyrrole ring C of the heme moiety, was disordered into two components each having an occupancy of 0.5. One component occupied a position similar to the normally observed position of propionic chain while the second component was found in the distal heme cavity. The potassium ion in the distal heme cavity formed five coordinate bonds with two oxygen atoms of propionic moiety, N-epsilon 2 atom of His109 and two oxygen atoms of water molecules. The presence of potassium ion in the distal heme cavity hampered the catalytic activity of lactoperoxidase.

AB  - Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition of CNS which leads to loss of sensory as well as motor functions. Secondary damage after SCI initiates cascade of events that creates an inhibitory milieu for axonal growth and repair. Combinatorial therapies are the hope to attenuate secondary injury progression and make the microenvironment growth and repair friendly for the neurons. We fabricated gelatin- genipin hydrogel system which was impregnated with IONPs and injected at the lesion site in a clinically relevant contusion rat model of SCI. 24 h later, the rats were exposed to magnetic fields (17.96 mu T, 50 Hz uniform EMF) for 2 h/day for 5 weeks. A significant (P < 0.001) improvement in Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor score, amplitude and threshold of spinally mediated reflexes and motor and somatosensory evoked potentials (MEP & SSEP) was observed following IONPs implantation and EMF exposure. Moreover, retrograde tracing showed a higher level of neuronal connectivity and survival after the intervention. There was also a reduction in activated microglia and lesion volume which attenuate secondary damage as evident by reduction in the scaring following intervention for 5 weeks. Moreover, we observed increase in the neuronal growth cone marker, GAP-43, growth promoting neurotrophins (GDNF, BDNF & NT-3) and reduction in the inhibitory molecule (Nogo-A) after this combinatorial therapy. We obsrvered that a significant improvement in behavioral, electrophysiological and morphological parameters was due to an alteration in neurotrophin levels, reduction in activated microglia and increase in GAP-43 expression after the combinatorial therapy. We propose that implantation of IONPs embedded gelatin-genipin hydrogel system along with MF exposure modulated the microenvironment, making it conducive for neural repair and regeneration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Facet tropism (FT) refers to the difference in the orientation of facet joints with respect to each other in the sagittal plane. FT leads to unequal biomechanical forces on facet joint and intervertebral disc during rotation and other physiologic movements. Most of the studies have reported the incidence of FT in the lumbar spine to vary between 40% and 70%, with L4-5 level being the most commonly afflicted level. The objective of this study was to find the association between FT and various lumbar and cervical degenerative disorders.
   METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed was performed with the keywords "facet tropism" and "facet asymmetry." Data for meta-analysis were extracted from the studies to obtain pooled impact of FT on lumbar disc herniation (LDH) and lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS).
   RESULTS: Eighty-two articles were included in the systematic review and 18 studies had the required data to be included in the meta-analysis. The pooled standard mean difference between FT angles in patients with or without LDH was 0.31 with (P = 0.04). The pooled odds ratio for FT in patients with LDH was 3.27 with (P = 0.02). Subgroup analysis showed that there is no significant difference in the 13/4, L4/5, and L5S1 subgroups. The pooled standard mean difference between FT angles in patients with or without LDS was 0.54 (P = 0.009).
   CONCLUSIONS: FT is significantly associated with LDH and LDS along with various other lumbar and cervical degenerative diseases.

AB  - Objectives: Endoxifen is a protein kinase C inhibitor. The objective of the present phase III study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of endoxifen in treating bipolar I disorder (BPD I) patients.
   Methods: A multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study was conducted using a daily dose of 8 mg endoxifen compared to 1000 mg divalproex, the current standard treatment, in patients with BPD I acute manic episodes with/without mixed features. The primary endpoint of our study was the mean change in total Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at day 21.
   Results: Endoxifen (n = 116) significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced total YMRS score (from 33.1 to 17.8. A significant (p < 0.001) improvement in Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score was observed for endoxifen (4.8 to 2.5). Early time to remission of the disease was observed with endoxifen compared to divalproex. None of the patients required rescue medication and there was no drug-associated withdrawals. Changes in Clinical Global Impressions-Bipolar Disorder and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness scores showed that treatment with endoxifen was well-tolerated.
   Conclusions: Endoxifen at a low daily dose of 8 mg was as efficacious and safe in patients with BPD I acute manic episodes with/without mixed features.

AB  - Introduction and hypothesis While the anatomical closure rates of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) following transabdominal (TA) and transvaginal (TV) repairs seem comparable, studies comparing urinary and sexual outcomes following successful repair are lacking. We aimed to report patient-reported outcomes on sexual and urinary functions after long-term follow-up with successful repair.
   Methods We retrospectively reviewed 81 women who had successful VVF repair at our institute. Pre-, intra- and post-operative details were retrieved from electronic data software. Patient-reported sexual and urinary function outcomes were assessed using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) questionnaire and International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF), respectively, at last follow-up. We also compared such outcomes among TA and TV repairs.
   Results Of 81 women, 28 (34.6%) had TA and 53 (65.4%) had TV repairs. Mean age was 37.5 years and mean fistula diameter was 12.9 mm. The most common aetiology was hysterectomy. Thirty-three patients (40.7%) had previous failed repairs. At a mean follow-up of 29.8 months, 24 (34.3%) women had sexual dysfunction and 15 (18.5%) women experienced urinary dysfunction. The TA and TV groups had comparable mean FSFI scores (28.7 +/- 6.1 vs. 30.9 +/- 5.2, p = 0.13) and ICIQ-SF scores (0.7 +/- 1.7 vs. 0.5 +/- 1.4, p = 0.59). In multivariate analysis, fistula size and site were significant predictors of urinary dysfunction whereas multiparity was the most significant predictor of sexual dysfunction.
   Conclusions Sexual and urinary dysfunction is found in a considerable number of women after VVF repair. However, our data suggest comparable long-term sexual and continence outcomes between TA and TV repairs.

AB  - Objectives In this pilot study, the authors developed and evaluated a working memory intervention (WMI) using a combination of mobile phone-based application and an activity booklet, among children with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Methods Pre- and post-intervention cognitive evaluation at 8 wk included: subtests comprising working memory index from Wechsler Intelligence Scale-IV, color cancellation task for sustained attention, and parent's rating from the Conners' ADHD/DSM-IV Scales of the Conners' Rating Scales-Revised. Results Fourteen children completed the intervention; one was lost to follow-up. Significant improvement in most working memory parameters occurred at 8 wk: digit span [scaled scores: median 7 (IQR 4-9) to 12 (IQR 9-14.25); p = 0.001]; letter-number sequencing [scaled scores: median 9 (IQR 5-10) to 11.5 (IQR 6.75-13); p = 0.03]; WMI [median 14 (IQR 9-18) to 22 (IQR 16.75-27); p = 0.001] and sustained attention [time for cancellation test improved from 95 (72-117) to 85 (63-98) s; p = 0.001]. Conclusion This indigenous WMI was feasible and efficacious in improving working memory deficits in CWE in low-resource settings.

AB  - Duodenal trauma is rare in children and its diagnosis and management often pose a challenge. In complex duodenal injuries, primary closure may not be feasible and complications are prone to occur in the post-operative period. Herein, we share our experience of such a case managed by an infrequently utilized technique, Roux-en-Y lateral duodenojejunostomy.

AB  - Background: Children with congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are at high risk of progressive deterioration of kidney function and further developing stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD 5), even after a successful surgery. This prospective study was designed to determine whether urinary biomarkers can predict progressive deterioration of kidney function in children with CAKUT.
   Methods: The study included 50 consecutive children, aged < 14 years, who were diagnosed with congenital uropathies (PUV, VUR, and PUJO) and 20 age-matched controls. Examination of four urinary biomarkers, i.e., trefoil family factors (TFF) 1 and 3, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and microalbuminuria (MALB) was done at the beginning of follow-up. Kidney function was assessed, at the beginning and after 12-months of follow-up, by technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans. Progressive deterioration in the kidney function was defined as a fall in the GFR from >= 60 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) on comparing the baseline and latest DTPA scans; and/or new-onset cortical scar/scars or increase in the size of previous scar/scars on serial DMSA scans. Group 1 and group 2 included children without and with progressive functional deterioration respectively.
   Results: The median (IQR) age of children with CAKUT and controls was 3 (1.5-5) and 2.3 (1.2-3.6) years, respectively, and showed no significant difference (p = 0.29). Median concentrations of TFF1, TFF3, NGAL, and microalbumin in patients were 44.5, 176.5, 281.2, and 15.5 mcg/gCr, respectively, and were significantly elevated as compared to controls (p < 0.05). Children belonging to group 2 had significantly higher concentration of biomarkers as compared to those in group 1. TFF3 was found have the highest AUC (0.9198) on ROC curve for predicting progressive functional deterioration.
   Conclusion: Urinary TFFs, NGAL, and microalbumin significantly correlate with progressive deterioration of kidney function in children harboring CAKUT. TFF3, with the strongest prediction of functional deterioration, is an emerging peptide showing sufficient potential to be included in the biomarker panel.

AB  - BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a public health priority in Latin America. While the burden of HIV is historically concentrated in urban areas and high-risk groups, subnational estimates that cover multiple countries and years are missing. This paucity is partially due to incomplete vital registration (VR) systems and statistical challenges related to estimating mortality rates in areas with low numbers of HIV deaths. In this analysis, we address this gap and provide novel estimates of the HIV mortality rate and the number of HIV deaths by age group, sex, and municipality in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Mexico.MethodsWe performed an ecological study using VR data ranging from 2000 to 2017, dependent on individual country data availability. We modeled HIV mortality using a Bayesian spatially explicit mixed-effects regression model that incorporates prior information on VR completeness. We calibrated our results to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.ResultsAll countries displayed over a 40-fold difference in HIV mortality between municipalities with the highest and lowest age-standardized HIV mortality rate in the last year of study for men, and over a 20-fold difference for women. Despite decreases in national HIV mortality in all countries-apart from Ecuador-across the period of study, we found broad variation in relative changes in HIV mortality at the municipality level and increasing relative inequality over time in all countries. In all six countries included in this analysis, 50% or more HIV deaths were concentrated in fewer than 10% of municipalities in the latest year of study. In addition, national age patterns reflected shifts in mortality to older age groups-the median age group among decedents ranged from 30 to 45years of age at the municipality level in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico in 2017.ConclusionsOur subnational estimates of HIV mortality revealed significant spatial variation and diverging local trends in HIV mortality over time and by age. This analysis provides a framework for incorporating data and uncertainty from incomplete VR systems and can help guide more geographically precise public health intervention to support HIV-related care and reduce HIV-related deaths.

AB  - L-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule that plays an important role in modulating immune cell trafficking. The expression of L-selectin has been found to be upregulated in several human cancers. However, the association of L-selectin expression with the immune profile and its prognostic value in breast cancer has not been explored in detail. We utilized TCGA and Oncomine datasets to compare SELL (L-selectin gene) expression between tumor and normal breast tissues. The association of SELL expression with its promoter DNA methylation and infiltrating immune cells was evaluated by using Wanderer, TIMER, and CIBERSORT tools. Single cell RNA sequencing data was utilised to determine the cell specific expression of L-selectin in breast cancer. Furthermore, the relationship between SELL expression and patient survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier plotter. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to determine functional associations of SELL expression. We found that SELL expression was significantly higher in breast tumors and regulated by DNA methylation. L-selectin exhibited a strong positive correlation with markers of the inflammatory microenvironment, including M1 macrophages. Interestingly, single cell sequencing data analysis revealed that B-cells and T-cells exhibited comparable expression levels of SELL, suggesting both B-cells and T cells contribute to SELL expression in breast cancer. Higher expression of SELL was associated with better survival outcome in basal, Her2+and luminal B subtypes of breast cancer. GSEA revealed association of SELL expression with several immunological features in breast cancer. SELL expression increases in breast tumor tissues with reduced DNA methylation and associated inflammatory microenvironment. Also, high SELL expression is associated with favorable survival outcomes in breast cancer.

AB  - Purpose Tonsil cancer being predominantly treated by non-surgical means, there is a paucity of data on lymph nodal drainage pathways and histo-pathologically confirmed metastatic rates. This study assesses the retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) in N0 squamous cell carcinoma tonsil as a possible first echelon node and a site for occult metastasis. Methods Prospective study involving treatment naive N0 carcinoma tonsil treated by primary surgery and adjuvant treatment from June 2017 to March 2019. In-vivo lymph nodal drainage patterns were assessed by sentinel node mapping by preoperative SPECT-CT and intra-operative hand-held Gamma probe. All patients had a subsequent Level I-III/IV sampling neck dissection supplemented with RPLN dissection. Histological evaluation of sentinel nodes and RPLN involved step-serial sectioning and pan-cytokeratin immunohistochemistry. A comprehensive literature review was performed with keywords "retropharyngeal lymph node", "oropharynx", "tonsil", "squamous cell carcinoma" to determine the incidence of RPLN positivity in previously published series. Results Sentinel node was successfully identified by SPECT-CT in all 17 patients (ipsilateral level 2a-13/17, 2b-1/17, 3-1/17; bilateral 2a-1/17; isolated contralateral retropharyngeal node-1/17). 8/17 had occult neck metastasis. In no patient was an ipsilateral RPLN identified as the sentinel node. Histological sampling did not indicate metastatic tumor in the RPLN in any patient (0/17). A systematic literature review further confirmed that RPLN metastasis in oropharyngeal cancer is noted only in the presence of pN + disease at other neck levels, and isolated RPLN metastasis is extremely rare (1.2%). Conclusion The ipsilateral RPLN is not identified either as the first echelon node or as a site of occult metastatic disease in N0 tonsil cancer. CTRI registration CTRI/2019/06/019551.

TI  - Prediction of angular kyphosis after cervical laminoplasty using radiologic measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE
KW  - Cervical laminoplasty
KW  - Preoperative radiologic measurement
KW  - Angular kyphosis
AB  - Angular kyphosis is an important complication after cervical laminoplasty. Previous reports have suggested that T1 slope (T1s) and extension function (EF) have key roles in kyphosis, and no different radiologic measuments which affects postoperative kyphosis were seen between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) or cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). We tried to find preoperative radiologic measurements predicting angular kyphosis after laminoplasty according to disease entities. We retrospectively analyzed 133 patients with OPLL or CSM who underwent expansive laminoplasty. Preoperative neutral and extension C2-7 cobb angle (CA), T1s, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, and C2-7 slope angle (SA) were measured. EF of C2-7 CA and C2-7 SA was defined as extension CA/SA minus neutral CA/SA. Significant angular kyphosis was defined as LCL less than -10 square after surgery. Mean loss of lordosis was -3.23, and 16.5% of patients showed significant kyphosis. Preoperative EF-CA, EF-SA, and T1s were found to be predictive for angular kyphosis by Pearson correlation analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of radiologic measurements could not reach 0.7. In patients with OPLL, the AUC of preoperative neutral CA was 0.716. However, in patients with CSM ROC curve analysis revealed that EF-CA and EF-SA could predict the significant angular kyphotic changes. Examining OPLL and CSM separately, preoperative radiologic measurements were found to influence postoperative cervical kyphosis, respectively. However, preoperative C2-7 neutral CA in OPLL patients and both EF-CA and EF-SA in CSM patients could predict significant angular kyphosis after cervical laminoplasty.

AB  - Background/Aims: In a linguistically diverse country such as India, challenges remain with regard to diagnosis of early cognitive decline among the elderly, with no prior attempts made to simultaneously validate a comprehensive battery of tests across domains in multiple languages. This study aimed to determine the utility of the Indian Council of Medical Research-Neurocognitive Tool Box (ICMR-NCTB) in the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and its vascular subtype (VaMCI) in 5 Indian languages. Methods: Literate subjects from 5 centers across the country were recruited using a uniform process, and all subjects were classified based on clinical evaluations and a gold standard test protocol into normal cognition, MCI, and VaMCI. Following adaptation and harmonization of the ICMR-NCTB across 5 different Indian languages into a composite Z score, its test performance against standards, including sensitivity and specificity of the instrument as well as of its subcomponents in diagnosis of MCI, was evaluated in age and education unmatched and matched groups. Results: Variability in sensitivity-specificity estimates was noted between languages when a total of 991 controls and 205 patients with MCI (157 MCI and 48 VaMCI) were compared due to a significant impact of age, education, and language. Data from a total of 506 controls, 144 patients with MCI, and 46 patients with VaMCI who were age- and education-matched were compared. Post hoc analysis after correction for multiple comparisons revealed better performance in controls relative to all-cause MCI. An optimum composite Z-score of -0.541 achieved a sensitivity of 81.1% and a specificity of 88.8% for diagnosis of all-cause MCI, with a high specificity for diagnosis of VaMCI. Using combinations of multiple-domain 2 test subcomponents retained a sensitivity and specificity of >80% for diagnosis of MCI. Conclusions: The ICMR-NCTB is a "first of its kind" approach at harmonizing neuropsychological tests across 5 Indian languages for the diagnosis of MCI due to vascular and other etiologies. Utilizing multiple-domain subcomponents also retains the validity of this instrument, making it a valuable tool in MCI research in multilingual settings. (c) 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background The association of air pollution with multiple adverse health outcomes is becoming well established, but its negative economic impact is less well appreciated. It is important to elucidate this impact for the states of India.
   Methods We estimated exposure to ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution, and ambient ozone pollution, and their attributable deaths and disability-adjusted life-years in every state of India as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. We estimated the economic impact of air pollution as the cost of lost output due to premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution for every state of India, using the cost-of-illness method.
   Findings 1.67 million (95% uncertainty interval 1.42-1.92) deaths were attributable to air pollution in India in 2019, accounting for 17.8% (15.8-19.5) of the total deaths in the country. The majority of these deaths were from ambient particulate matter pollution (0.98 million [0.77-1.19]) and household air pollution (0.61 million 10.39-0.861). The death rate due to household air pollution decreased by 64.2% (52.2-74.2) from 1990 to 2019, while that due to ambient particulate matter pollution increased by 115.3% (28.3-344.4) and that due to ambient ozone pollution increased by 139.2% (96.5-195.8). Lost output from premature deaths and morbidity attributable to air pollution accounted for economic losses of US$28.8 billion (21.4-37.4) and $8.0 billion (5.9-10.3), respectively, in India in 2019. This total loss of $36.8 billion (27.4-47.7) was 1.36% of India's gross domestic product (GDP). The economic loss as a proportion of the state GDP varied 3.2 times between the states, ranging from 0.67% (0.47-0.91) to 2.15% (1.60-2.77), and was highest in the low per-capita GDP states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh. Delhi had the highest per-capita economic loss due to air pollution, followed by Haryana in 2019, with 5.4 times variation across all states.
   Interpretation The high burden of death and disease due to air pollution and its associated substantial adverse economic impact from loss of output could impede India's aspiration to be a $5 trillion economy by 2024. Successful reduction of air pollution in India through state-specific strategies would lead to substantial benefits for both the health of the population and the economy.

KW  - apps
AB  - Background
   Predicting and preventing relapse presents a crucial opportunity and first step to improve outcomes and reduce the care gap for persons living with schizophrenia. Using commercially available smartphones and smartwatches, technology now affords opportunities to capture real-time and longitudinal profiles of patients' symptoms, cognition, physiology and social patterns. This novel data makes it possible to explore relationships between behaviours, physiology and symptoms, which may yield personalised relapse signals.
   Aims
   Smartphone Health Assessment for Relapse Prevention (SHARP), an international mental health research study supported by the Wellcome Trust, will inform the development of a scalable and sharable digital health solution to monitor personal risk of relapse. The resulting technology will be studied toward predicting and preventing relapse among individuals diagnosed with serious mental illness.
   Method
   SHARP is a two-phase study with research sites in Boston, Massachusetts, and Bangalore and Bhopal, India. During phase 1, focus groups will be conducted at each study site to collect feedback on the design and features available on mindLAMP, a digital health platform. Individuals with serious mental illness will use mindLAMP for the duration of a year during phase 2.
   Results
   The results of the research outlined in this protocol will guide the development of technology and digital tools to help address pervasive challenges in global mental health.
   Conclusions
   The digital tools developed as a result of this study, and participants' experiences using them, may offer insight into opportunities to expand digital mental health resources and optimize their utilisation around the world.

AB  - Early hip fracture surgery is recommended to decrease the morbidity and mortality. The extent to which such guidelines are being followed in developing countries like India is unknown. About 20% of the patients presented to hospital after 24 hours of injury, and only one-third had surgery within 48 hours of presentation.IntroductionEarly hip fracture surgery is recommended to decrease the morbidity and mortality following hip fractures. Understanding the factors responsible for delay in surgery is important to improve the quality of hip fracture care. This study was conducted to study the factors causing delay in elderly hip fracture surgery in India.
   MethodsIn this prospective study, 272 consecutive hip fracture surgeries at a single hospital were included. Delayed surgery was defined as when the time to surgery (reaching hospital to start of incision) was more than 48 hours. Additionally, the total time to surgery (including time taken for patients to reach hospital after injury) was studied. Factors associated with delayed surgery were assessed using regression models.
   ResultsEighty-seven (32%) patients had a surgery within 48 hours of presentation. Majority of the patients had a delay (82%, N = 151/185) due to one or more medical reasons. Fifty-four (20%) patients presented to hospital after 24 hours of injury. The mean total time to surgery was 112 90 hours with time after reaching hospital contributing to 78% of the total time. Multiple comorbidities (odds ratio, OR = 3.47 [1.42-8.45]), fall as mode of injury (OR = 3.54 [1.61-7.80]), requiring an additional investigation (OR = 10.4 [3.4-31.81]), and requiring arthroplasty (OR = 40.57 [7.01-234.97]) were independently associated with delayed surgery.
   Conclusion Only about one-third of the patients received surgery within 48 hours of reaching the hospital, and about 20% of the patients presented to hospital after 24 hours of injury. Delayed surgery was primarily due to medical comorbidities. Hospitals should establish protocols to ensure faster optimization of patients.

AB  - The present study describes a special lipid-polyethylene glycol matrix solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs; 138 nm; -2.07 mV) for ocular delivery. Success of this matrix to encapsulate (entrapment efficiency - 62.09%) a hydrophilic drug, fluconazole (FCZ-SLNs), with no burst release (67% release in 24 h) usually observed with most water-soluble drugs, is described presently. The system showed 164.64% higher flux than the marketed drops (Zocon(R)) through porcine cornea. Encapsulation within SLNs and slow release did not compromise efficacy of FCZ-SLNs. Latter showed in vitro and in vivo antifungal effects, including antibiofilm effects comparable to free FCZ solution. Developed system was safe and stable (even to sterilisation by autoclaving); and showed optimal viscosity, refractive index and osmotic pressure. These SLNs could reach up to retina following application as drops. The mechanism of transport via corneal and non-corneal transcellular pathways is described by fluorescent and TEM images of mice eye cross sections. Particles streamed through the vitreous, crossed inner limiting membrane and reached the outer retinal layers.

AB  - Biomineralization can be considered as nature's strategy to produce and sustain biominerals, primarily via creation of hard tissues for protection and support. This review examines the biomineralization process within the hard tissues of the human body with special emphasis on the mechanisms and principles of bone and teeth mineralization. We describe the detailed role of proteins and inorganic ions in mediating the mineralization process. Furthermore, we highlight the various available models for studying bone physiology and mineralization starting from the historical static cell line-based methods to the most advanced 3D culture systems, elucidating the pros and cons of each one of these methods. With respect to the mineralization process in teeth, enamel and dentin mineralization is discussed in detail. The key role of intrinsically disordered proteins in modulating the process of mineralization in enamel and dentine is given attention. Finally, nanotechnological interventions in the area of bone and teeth mineralization, diseases and tissue regeneration is also discussed.
   Statement of Significance
   This article provides an overview of the biomineralization process within hard tissues of the human body, which encompasses the detailed mechanism innvolved in the formation of structures like teeth and bone. Moreover, we have discussed various available models used for studying biomineralization and also explored the nanotechnological applications in the field of bone regeneration and dentistry.

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a musculoskeletal pain of different parts of the body, which is also associated with fatigue, lack of sleep, cognition deficits, family history, gender bias, and other disorders such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. It is generally initiated after trauma, surgery, infection, or stress. Fibromyalgia often coexists with several other conditions or disorders such as temporomandibular joint disorders, bowel and bladder syndrome, anxiety, depression, headaches, and interstitial cystitis. While there is no permanent cure for fibromyalgia, some interventions are available with multiple side effects. rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation), a noninvasive management strategy is used widely for various pain-related etiologies including fibromyalgia in both the laboratory and clinical settings. In this Review, we discuss the role and mechanism of action of rTMS in fibromyalgia patients and on associated comorbidities including anxiety, pain, depression, neurotransmitter alterations, sleep disorders, and overall quality of life of the patients suffering from this chronic problem. We also provide an update on the rTMS application in the clinical trials of fibromyalgia patients and prospective management therapy for multiple problems that these patients suffer.

AB  - Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are xenobiotics that disrupt the endocrine system in humans at ecologically significant concentrations. Various substances are exposed to human health via routes including food, water, air and skin that result in disastrous maladies at low doses as well. Therefore EDCs need a meticulous strategy of analysis for dependable and consistent monitoring in humans. The management and risk assessment necessitate advancements in the detection methodologies of EDCs. Hyphenated MS-based chromatograph and other validated laboratory analysis methods are widely available and employed.

AB  - Objective To establish reference ranges for aortic isthmus Doppler indices in appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetusesand to evaluate its association with perinatal outcome in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) fetuses.
   Methods Prospective cohort observational study in which 30 pregnant women with SGA fetuses and 60 women with AGA fetuses were recruited from the prenatal clinic of the hospital. The AGA group was eventually followed from 24 weeks by 4-weekly Doppler assessment, and the SGA group was examined as per institutional protocol. We analyzed the data using STATA version 14.0 statistical software. Continuous variables were examined for normality assumption using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. To develop a nomogram for appropriate gestational age, we adopted a mixed linear model analysis. For each of the variables Ao pulsatility index (PI), Ao peak systolic velocity (PSV), Ao systolic nadir (Ns), and Ao isthmic systolic index (ISI) mean predicted values, 3rd centile and 97th centile were calculated based on the parameter estimation of mixed model. Observed data for each of the variables in the SGA group were plotted in the nomogram developed for the AGA group to show the trend of SGA data in comparison to AGA data.
   Results The total number of observations made on 60 AGA and 30 SGA fetuses were 240 and 67, respectively. Nomograms for the 3rd and 97th centiles were derived for Ao PI, Ao PSV, Ao Ns, and Ao ISI. Mean Ao PI values were significantly higher in SGA group (2.37 vs 2.22; P < .05); mean Ao PSV was significantly lower in the SGA group (67.1 vs 76.3; P < .05), but mean Ao Ns and mean Ao ISI values were significantly higher in the SGA group (-5.24 vs 2.0 and -0.04 vs -0.01; P < .05).
   Conclusions Aortic Doppler assessment seems to provide beneficial information for monitoring small fetuses. Ao PI and Ao ISI, which were raised in fetuses with SGA, can be used in prognosis.

AB  - As mortality and morbidity from novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to mount worldwide, the scientific community as well as public health systems are under immense pressure to contain the pandemic as well as to develop effective medical countermeasures. Meanwhile, desperation has driven prescribers, researchers as well as administrators to recommend and try therapies supported by little or no reliable evidence. Recently, hydroxychloroquine-sulfate (HCQS) has got significant media and political attention for the treatment as well as prophylaxis of COVID-19 despite the lack of convincing and unequivocal data supporting its efficacy and safety in these patients. This has unfortunately, yet foreseeably led to several controversies and confusion among the medical fraternity, the patient community as well as the general public. Based on the available studies, many with high risk of bias, relatively small sample sizes, and abbreviated follow-ups, HCQS is unlikely to be of dramatic benefit in COVID-19 patients and yet has the potential to cause harm, particularly when used in combination with azithromycin or other medications in high risk individuals with comorbidities. Although definitive data from larger well-controlled randomized trials will be forthcoming in the future, and we may be able to identify specific patient subpopulations likely to benefit from hydroxychloroquine, till that time it will be prudent to prescribe it within investigational trial settings with close safety monitoring. Here we review the current evidence and developments related to the use of HCQS in COVID-19 patients and highlight the importance of risk-benefit assessment and rational use of HCQS during this devastating pandemic.

AB  - Esophageal cancer (EC) is a disease often marked by aggressive growth and poor prognosis. Lack of targeted therapies, resistance to chemoradiation therapy, and distant metastases among patients with advanced disease account for the high mortality rate. The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains several cell types, including fibroblasts, immune cells, adipocytes, stromal proteins, and growth factors, which play a significant role in supporting the growth and aggressive behavior of cancer cells. The complex and dynamic interactions of the secreted cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and their receptors mediate chronic inflammation and immunosuppressive TME favoring tumor progression, metastasis, and decreased response to therapy. The molecular changes in the TME are used as biological markers for diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment in patients. This review highlighted the novel insights into the understanding and functional impact of deregulated cytokines and chemokines in imparting aggressive EC, stressing the nature and therapeutic consequences of the cytokine-chemokine network. We also discuss cytokine-chemokine oncogenic potential by contributing to the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), angiogenesis, immunosuppression, metastatic niche, and therapeutic resistance development. In addition, it discusses the wide range of changes and intracellular signaling pathways that occur in the TME. Overall, this is a relatively unexplored field that could provide crucial insights into tumor immunology and encourage the effective application of modulatory cytokine-chemokine therapy to EC.

AB  - Background IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multi-organ immune-mediated disorder characterized by fibroinflammatory mass-forming lesions, mimicking malignancy or infection. While well-documented in salivary glands, orbit and thyroid in the head and neck, sinonasal IgG4-RD is rare. Methods Cases of sinonasal IgG4-RD were retrieved, and clinicopathological features reviewed. Results Seven cases of sinonasal IgG4-RD were identified over a 2-year period, including three males and four females, with an age range of 13-48 years (median: 32 years). Patients presented with cheek swelling, pain and visual disturbances. Serum IgG4 levels were mildly elevated. Storiform fibrosis, obliterative phlebitis and plasma cell infiltration were seen in varying proportions. Destruction of bone and subepithelial mucoserous glands was present. ALK-1 negativity distinguished from inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Conclusion Sinonasal IgG4-RD expands the growing spectrum of IgG4-RD. A high degree of suspicion is required to include IgG4-RD in differential diagnosis of sinonasal masses, and perform detailed histological and immunohistochemical workup for accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Objective To assess if telemedicine can be used successfully for follow-up care of children with respiratory illnesses. The authors also assessed problems faced by the doctors and satisfaction of caregivers of these patients with telemedicine. Methods The authors conducted an ambispective observational study. Data related to demographic details and diagnoses of patients who had telemedicine consultation (teleconsultation) appointments between 2nd April 2020 to 15th May 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. They noted proportion of patients having successful prescription. To assess problems faced by doctors and satisfaction of caregiver of patients with teleconsultation, a prospective questionnaire was sent via Google Forms 6-10 wk after the initial appointment date. Those who did not respond to Google Forms were called by phone to assess the same. Results A total of 188 patients received teleconsultation during the study period. Team was able to prescribe treatment in 181 (96.3%) patients via teleconsultation and other seven (3.7%) required physical evaluation. Mean (SD) age of patients was 9.7 (4.9) y, range 3 mo to 18 y. There were 117 (62.2%) boys and 71 (37.8%) girls. Majority (58%) of the patients were asthmatics. The team advised refill prescription in 83% patients as symptoms were controlled. Three out of five residents faced minor problems while providing teleconsultation. In satisfaction assessment, 78% of caregivers rated teleconsultation 8 or more, out of 10 points, suggesting that most of them were satisfied with telemedicine. Conclusion In majority of children with respiratory illnesses, successful follow-up care can be provided by telemedicine.

AB  - Background Variants in CDKN2B/CDKN2B-AS1 have been reported to modulate glaucoma risk in several GWAS across different populations. CDKN2B/CDKN2A encodes tumor suppressor proteins p16(INK4A)/p15(INK4B) which influences cell proliferation/senescence in RGCs, the degeneration of which is a risk factor for glaucoma. CDKN2B-AS1 codes a long non-coding RNA in antisense direction and is involved in influencing nearby CDKN2A/CDKN2B via regulatory mechanisms. Methods Current study investigated four SNPs (rs2157719, rs3217992, rs4977756, rs1063192) of aforementioned genes in a case-control study in a North Indian cohort. Genotyping was done with Taqman chemistry. In addition, an updated meta-analysis was performed. Results Two SNPs, rs3217992 and rs2157719 were found to be significantly associated with the disease. The frequency of 'T' allele of rs3217992 was significantly lower in cases (POAG/PACG) [p = 0.045; OR = 0.80(CI = 0.65-0.99) and p = 0.024; OR = 0.73(CI = 0.55-0.96)], respectively than in controls. Genetic model analysis revealed that TT + CT genotype confers 0.73-fold protection against POAG [p = 0.047; OR = 0.73(CI = 0.54-0.99)] and trend assumed additive model gives 0.53 times higher protection against PACG progression. However the association of rs3217992 with POAG and PACG did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. For rs2157719, the 'C' allele was found to be less prevalent among cases (POAG/PACG) with respect to controls. Cochran Armitage trend test assuming additive model revealed 0.77 and 0.64-fold protection against POAG and PACG respectively. Bonferroni correction (p(corr )= 0.003) was applied and the association of rs2157719 remained significant in PACG cases but not among POAG cases (p = 0.024). The 'CC' genotype also confers protection against primary glaucoma (POAG/PACG) among males and female subjects. The frequency rs1063192 and rs4977756 did not vary significantly among subjects, however the haplotype 'CATA' was found to be associated with increased glaucoma risk. An updated meta-analysis conducted on pooled studies on POAG cases and controls revealed significant association between rs1063192, rs2157719, rs4977756 and POAG except rs3217992. Conclusion The study concludes significant association between INK4 variants and primary glaucoma in the targeted North Indian Punjabi cohort. We believe that deep-sequencing of INK4 locus may help in identifying novel variants modifying susceptibility to glaucoma. Functional studies can further delineate the role of CDKN2B and CDKN2B-AS1 in primary glaucoma for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - The proportion of CD34 (+) CD38 (-) CD123 (+) leukemia stem cells (LSCs) at diagnosis of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) correlated with induction remission (IR), relapse free survival and overall survival in few studies. Prospectively bone marrows of AML patients were immunophenotyped for CD34 (+) CD38 (-) CD123 (+) LSCs at baseline using sequential gating, relevant clinical and laboratory data collected and clinical outcomes were studied.The patients (n = 47) were risk stratified as favorable risk, intermediate risk and adverse risk. The percent of LSCs at baseline in favorable risk group (mean = 13.06%) was significantly less than the adverse (mean = 34.8%, p = 0.027) and the intermediate risk group (mean = 53.2%, p = 0.001). On further analysis, 12 patients attaining IR in intermediate risk group had significantly less LSCs than 15 in non-IR group (mean = 21.18%; range 3-85.6% vs mean = 73.85%; range 12.1-97.9%, p = 0.0002). Of all 47 patients, the proportion of LSCs at baseline was significantly less in those achieving IR (p = 0.024) and correlated with time to response (TTR) (r(s) = 0.432). Thus to conclude, the proportion of CD34 (+) CD38 (-) CD123 (+) LSCs at diagnosis is less in the favorable than the intermediate and adverse risk groups and is an emerging novel marker for predicting remission in the prognostically diverse intermediate risk group.

AB  - The aim of this prospective observational study was to compare the incidence of endotracheal tube (ETT) malposition using weight-based (Tochen), gestation-based (Kempley), and nasotragal length (NTL) methods in deceased neonates and fresh stillbirths. We enrolled deceased neonates and fresh stillbirths within 2 +/- 1 h of death or delivery, respectively; without hydrops, tracheostomy or major congenital anomalies affecting face, neck, or thorax. Each enrolled subject was intubated orotracheally, with lip-to-tip distance determined by three methods in random succession. Chest X-ray was acquired after each insertion. The primary outcome was proportion of malpositioned ETTs on chest X-ray (defined as ETT tip not lying between upper border of T1 and lower border of T2 vertebrae), assessed by two experts masked to the methods used. The proportion of malpositioned tubes was not significantly different with any of the three methods: (weight 27/50 (54%), gestation 35/50 (70%), and NTL 35/50 (70%), p value 0.055). The malpositioned tubes were too far in (87/150; 58%) than too far out (10/150; 6.7%). Conclusions: None of the currently recommended methods accurately predicts optimal ETT length in neonates. There is an urgent need for newer bedside modalities for estimating ETT position in neonates.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the role of composite (Chitosan/Chondroitin sulphate/gelatin/nano-bioglass) scaffold in the union of critical size bone defect created in the rabbit's ulna. Methods The composite (Chitosan/Chondroitin sulphate/gelatin/nano-bioglass) scaffold was fabricated using the freeze-drying technique under standard laboratory conditions. The scaffold was cut into the appropriate size and transferred into the defect created (critical bone size defect 1 cm) over the right ulna in the rabbit. The scaffold was not implanted on the left side thus the left side ulna served as control. Results were assessed on serial radiological examination. Rabbits were sacrificed at 20 weeks for histopathological examination (Haematoxylin-Eosin staining and Mason's trichrome staining) and scanning electron microscope observation. Radiological scoring was done by Lane and Sandhu's scoring. Results Among 12 rabbits, 10 could complete the follow-up. Among those 10 rabbits, 8 among the test group showed good evidence of bone formation at the gap non-union scaffold implanted site. Histological evidence of new bone formation, collagen synthesis, scaffold resorption, minimal chondrogenesis was evident by 20 weeks in the test group. Two rabbits had poor bone formation. Conclusion The chitosan-chondroitin sulphate-gelatin-nano-bioglass composite scaffold is efficient in osteoconduction and osteoinduction in the gap non-union model as it is biocompatible, bioactive, and non-immunogenic as well.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a heme containing oxido-reductase enzyme. It is secreted from mammary, salivary, lachrymal and mucosal glands. It catalyses the conversion of thiocyanate into hypothiocyanate and halides into hypohalides. LPO belongs to the superfamily of mammalian heme peroxidases which also includes myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO). The heme prosthetic group is covalently linked in LPO through two ester bonds involving conserved residues Glu258 and Asp108. It was isolated from colostrum of yak (Bos grunniens), purified to homogeneity and crystallized using ammonium iodide as a precipitating agent. The crystals belonged to monoclinic space group P2(1) with cell dimensions of a = 53.91 angstrom, b = 78.98 angstrom, c = 67.82 angstrom and beta = 92.96 degrees. The structure was determined at 1.55 angstrom resolution. This is the first structure of LPO from yak. Also, this is the highest resolution structure of LPO determined so far from any source. The structure determination revealed that three segments (Ser1-Cys15), (Thr117-Asn138) and (Cys167-Leu175) were disordered and formed one surface of LPO structure. In the substrate binding site, the iodide ions were observed in three subsites which are formed by (1) heme moiety and residues, Gln105, Asp108, His109, Phe113, Arg255, Glu258, Phe380 and Phe381, (2) residues, Asn230, Lys232, Pro236, Cys248, Phe254, Phe381 and Pro424 and (3) residues, Ser198, Leu199 and Arg202. The structure determination also revealed that the side chain of Phe254 was disordered. It was observed to adopt two conformations in the structures of LPO.

AB  - Objectives: With the increasing recognition of gastrointestinal (GI) manifestation of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), various abdominal imaging findings are increasingly being noted. We scoped the existing literature on the abdominal imaging findings in COVID-19.
   Methods: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Google scholar and World Health Organization COVID-19 database.
   Results: 35 studies were included in the final descriptive synthesis. Among the studies reporting positive abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, majority described imaging abnormalities of the GI tract (16 studies), of which bowel wall thickening was most frequently reported. Other findings noted were abdominal imaging manifestations of bowel ischemia with thrombosis of the splanchnic vasculature, and imaging features suggestive of pancreatitis. Imaging findings suggestive of solid organ infarction were reported in nine studies. An association between imaging evidence of hepatic steatosis and COVID-19 was noted in three studies. Incidental lung base findings on abdominal imaging were noted in 18 studies, where patients presented with predominant GI symptoms. The most common finding was bilateral ground glass opacities (90.7%) with predominant multilobar (91.1%) and peripheral (64.4%) distribution.
   Conclusion: This systematic review provides insight into the abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19. Knowledge of these imaging manifestations will not only help in further research but also will aid in curtailing transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Further prospective studies are needed to gain better insight into the pathophysiology of these imaging manifestations.
   Advances in knowledge: This review highlights the abdominal imaging findings in patients with COVID-19, to gain insight into the disease pathophysiology and gear the abdominal radiologist through the pandemic.

AB  - A corneal descemetocele, the anterior herniation of an intact Descemet membrane through an overlying stromal defect, is a rare, but serious outcome of progressive corneal ulceration and mandates urgent intervention owing to the imminent risk of perforation. Various ocular and systemic abnormalities that can lead to the formation of descemetocele include microbial keratitis, neurotrophic keratopathy, dry eye disorders, and corneal inflammation associated with immune-mediated disorders. The primary aim of management of a descemetocele remains prompt restoration of ocular integrity to prevent the rupture of the Descemet membrane and further complications. Medical therapy is instituted immediately while deciding on the most suitable operative modality for an individual case. Commonly available treatment options include therapeutic bandage contact lenses, tissue adhesives, amniotic membrane transplantation, corneal patch grafts, penetrating or lamellar keratoplasty, and conjunctival flaps. Infrequently, platelet-rich fibrin membrane grafting and umbilical cord patch transplantation have also been tried with success. The surgical strategy and the outcome are commonly determined by the size, location, and etiology of descemetoceles. Despite the availability of all these treatment options, ambiguity remains about management. We review the available literature on pathogenesis, causes, presentation, differential diagnoses, and management of this disorder and also discuss our experience. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Most of the adrenal masses are incidentally detected. Multiphasic CT forms the mainstay for diagnosis and characterization of adrenal masses. MRI can further be used if the masses are indeterminate on CT scan. But as these investigations are expensive with risk of radiation exposure, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is currently under evaluation to assess its utility to act as a screening modality to differentiate benign vs malignant adrenal masses This investigative modality is relatively safe and can be used in patients having renal dysfunction or allergy to CT contrast. We, hereby, present a pictorial review of imaging appearance of various adrenal lesions on CEUS with CT and MRI correlation.

AB  - Background This research prioritization aimed to identify major research gaps in maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health (MNCAH) to help mitigate the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods We adapted the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology. We defined scope, domains, themes and scoring criteria. We approached diverse global experts via email to submit their research ideas in MNCAH and MNCAH-related cross-cutting/health systems area. We curated the research ideas as research questions (RQs) and sent them to the consenting experts for scoring via the online link. For each RQ, the research priority score (RPS) was calculated as an average of individual criterion scores and ranked based on RPS in each area.
   Results We identified top-ranked 10 RQs in each maternal, newborn, and child and adolescent health and 5 in the cross-cutting/health systems area. In maternal health, indirect effects on care, measures to improve care, health risks and outcomes, and preventing and managing SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease were priority RQs. In newborn health, clinical characterization and managing SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease, mode of transmission and interventions to prevent transmission were the focus. For child and adolescent health, top-ranked RQs were indirect effects on care, clinical status and outcomes, interventions to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 disease, and educational institute-related RQs. The cross-cutting RQs were the effects of the pandemic on availability, access, care-seeking and utilization of MNCAH services and potential solutions.
   Conclusions We call on partners, including governments, non-governmental organizations, research institutes, and donors, to address this urgent research agenda.

AB  - Contrast enhancement in MRI using magnetization or saturation transfer techniques promises better sensitivity, and faster acquisition compared to T-1 or T-2 contrast. This work reports the synthesis and evaluation of 5-HT1A targeted PARACEST MRI contrast agent using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacycloDOdecane-4,7,10-triacetAMide (DO3AM) as the bifunctional chelator, and 5-HT1A-antagonist methoxyphenyl piperazine (MPP) as a targeting unit. The multistep synthesis led to the MPP conjugated DO3AM with 60% yield. CEST-related physicochemical parameters were evaluated after loading DO3AM-MPP with paramagnetic MRI active lanthanides: Gadolinium (Gd-DO3AM-MPP) and Europium (Eu-DO3AM-MPP). Luminescence lifetime measurements with Eu-DO3AM-MPP and computational DFT studies using Gd-DO3AM-MPP revealed the coordination of one water molecule (q = 1.43) with metal-water distance (r(M)-H2O) of 2.7 angstrom and water residence time (tau(m)) of 0.23 ms. The dissociation constant of K-d 62 +/- 0.02 pM as evaluated from fluorescence quenching of 5-HT1A (protein) and docking score of -4.81 in theoretical evaluation reflect the binding potential of the complex Gd-DO3AM-MPP with the receptor 5-HT1A. Insights of the docked pose reflect the importance of NH2 (amide) and aromatic ring in Gd-DO3AM-MPP while interacting with Ser 374 and Phe 370 in the antagonist binding pocket of 5-HT1A. Gd-DO3AM-MPP shows longitudinal relaxivity 5.85 mM(-1)s(-1) with a water residence lifetime of 0.93 ms in hippocampal homogenate containing 5-HT1A. The potentiometric titration of DO3AM-MPP showed strong selectivity for Gd3+ over physiological metal ions such as Zn2+ and Cu2+. The in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the minimal cytotoxicity and presential binding of Gd-DO3AM-MPP with 5-HT1A receptor in the hippocampus region of the mice. Summarizing, the complex Gd-DO3AM-MPP can have a potential for CEST imaging of 5-HT1A receptors.

AB  - Seizures are the most common brain dysfunction. Electroencephalography (EEG) is required for their detection and treatment initially. Studies show that if seizures are detected at their early stage, instant and effective treatment can be given to the patients. In this paper, an automated system for seizure onset detection is proposed. As the power spectrum of normal person's EEG and EEG of someone with epilepsy is plotted, powers present at different frequencies are found to be different for both. The proposed algorithm utilizes this frequency discrimination property of EEG with some statistical features to detect the seizure onset using simple linear classifier. The tests conducted on EEG data of 30 patients, obtained from the two different datasets, show the presence of all 183 seizures with mean latency of 0.9 s and 1.02 false detections per hour. The main contribution of this study is the use of simple features and classifier in the field of seizures onset detection that reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm. Also, the classifier used is patient independent. This patient independency in the classification system would be helpful in the implementation of the proposed algorithm to develop an online detection system.

AB  - Background: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory granulomatous disease which commonly affects intrathoracic lymph nodes, lung parenchyma and airways. Objectives: To measure respiratory impedance using Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and compare the parameters with healthy controls. Methods: Patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis (n=28); and age and gender matched healthy controls (n=17) were recruited. Lung volumes and capacities were measured by spirometry and respiratory system impedance was assessed using Impulse Oscillometry System (IOS). Measurements were performed before and 15 minutes after inhalation of a short acting bronchodilator. The IOS and spirometric parameters were compared between two groups and correlated. ROC curve analysis was also performed to identify the IOS parameters which can discriminate between sarcoidosis and healthy controls. Results: Resistance at 5 and 20 Hz (R5 and R20), small airway resistance (R5-R20), resonant frequency (F-Res) and area of reactance (AX) were significantly higher in Sarcoidosis subjects compared with controls. Reactance at 5 and 20 Hz (X5 and X20) were significantly lower in sarcoidosis. FEV1 (% predicted) and FVC (% predicted) were significantly lower in patients with sarcoidosis while FEV1/FVC ratio and peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) values were comparable. Post bronchodilator inhalation, there was improvement in airway resistance and reactance, but no significant changes observed in spirometric parameters. R5, X5 and R5-R20 are promising parameters to discriminate sarcoidosis from healthy controls. Conclusion: Increased airway resistance is a better indicator of airway involvement than airflow limitation by spirometry in pulmonary sarcoidosis.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of sclerotherapy agents in low-flow vascular malformations (LFVM) and identify clinical/imaging features to predict response.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of hospital records of symptomatic LFVM patients who underwent phlebosclerotherapy from January 2015 to April 2018 was done. Patients were subdivided into venous malformations (VM) and lymphatic malformations (LM). Out of 246 cases, 223 patients (132 males, 91 females; age range,2-52 years) had VM and 23 (13 males,10 females; age range, 3 months to 45 years) had LM. The clinical response was graded as excellent (>60%), good (30%-60%), and poor (<30%). More than 30% was considered as acceptable response. The chi(2) test was performed for correlation between clinical response and clinical, sonographic, magnetic resonance imaging, phlebographic parameters followed by multilinear regression.
   Results: Cavitary (43%) and spongy (37.7%) were the most common phlebographic patterns seen among VM and a cavitary pattern (87%) was most frequent in LM. Sodium tetradecyl sulphate and bleomycin were most commonly used sclerosants in VM and LM, respectively. The mean number of sessions was 4.35 (range, 1-23) in VM and 2.64 (range, 2-7) in LM. Among VM, 114 patients (51.1%) had excellent response to treatment (>60%) and 75.8% patients had an acceptable response (>30%). All patients with LM had an acceptable response (excellent response in 86.9%). Clinical disfigurement, discoloration, diffuse involvement, dysplastic venous morphology on phlebogram, and late and indirect draining vein correlated with poor response to sclerotherapy in VM (P = .003, P = .036, P = .007, P = .008, P = .003, and P = .035, respectively). Cystic components on ultrasound examination and direct draining vein were seen more often in excellent responders (P= .004 and P= .007) in addition to absence of disfigurement, discoloration, and diffuse involvement (P = .032, P= .003, and P = .002). Models comprising clinical disfigurement, dysplastic veins, and late draining vein had the greatest predictive value for poor response (R-2 = 0.256). Also, the best model for predicting excellent response comprised presence of direct draining vein and absence of skin discoloration (R-2 = 0.109). Eleven instances of minor complications occurred among a total of 1032 sessions, seven with sodium tetradecyl sulphate and four with polidocanol.
   Conclusions: Acceptable response to sclerotherapy was achieved in majority of LFVM with extremely low complication rates. Clinicoradiologic features, especially phlebographic findings, correlated with response to sclerotherapy.

AB  - An exoskeleton needs reference joint angle profiles at various speeds and slopes for its application in real-world scenarios. Recording these profiles and their implementation in the control system of an exoskeleton are time-consuming and complex processes. Therefore, there is a need for an artificial system that can predict subject-specific joint angle profiles for various real-world scenarios from a minimum amount of input data. This study aims to propose a predictive neural network (NN) called MoveNet, for joints angle profile prediction across variable walking speeds and slopes. MoveNet consists of three NN modules, namely, encoder, mapper, and decoder. The encoder module is trained to convert the knee joint angle profile into its 6-D latent representation. The mapper module is trained to map the latent representation of angle profile at zero degrees angle of inclination (AOI) to latent representation of angle profile at the target AOI. The decoder module is trained to predict an angle profile from its given latent representation. The proposed model successfully predicted knee joint angle profiles at three walking speeds (0.8, 1, and 1.2 m/s) and nine AOI ranging from -10 degrees to 10 degrees. MoveNet obtained root mean squared error of 3.24 +/- 1.19 degrees and mean absolute error of 2.66 +/- 1.00 degrees from tenfold cross validation. These results suggest that artificial intelligence can predict subject-specific knee joint angle profiles for variable slopes at a given walking speed from the data of knee joint angle profiles recorded at a flat surface.

AB  - Gait disorders in children with cerebral palsy (CP) affect their mental, physical, economic, and social lives. Gait assessment is one of the essential steps of gait management. It has been widely used for clinical decision making and evaluation of different treatment outcomes. However, most of the present methods of gait assessment are subjective, less sensitive to small pathological changes, time-taking and need a great effort of an expert. This work proposes an automated, comprehensive gait assessment score (A-GAS) for gait disorders in CP. Kinematic data of 356 CP and 41 typically developing subjects is used to validate the performance of A-GAS. For the computation of A-GAS, instance abnormality index (AII) and abnormality index (AI) are calculated. AII quantifies gait abnormality of a gait cycle instance, while AI quantifies gait abnormality of a joint angle profile during walking. AII is calculated for all gait cycle instances by performing probabilistic and statistical analyses. Abnormality index (AI) is a weighted sum of AII, computed for each joint angle profile. A-GAS is a weighted sum of AI, calculated for a lower limb. Moreover, a graphical representation of the gait assessment report, including AII, AI, and A-GAS is generated for providing a better depiction of the assessment score. Furthermore, the work compares A-GAS with a present rating-based gait assessment scores to understand fundamental differences. Finally, A-GAS's performance is verified for a high-cost multi-camera set-up using nine joint angle profiles and a low-cost single camera set-up using three joint angle profiles. Results show no significant differences in performance of A-GAS for both the set-ups. Therefore, A-GAS for both the set-ups can be used interchangeably.

AB  - Identification of an individual is the prime object in forensic case works both in civil or criminal situations like paternity/maternity disputes, sexual assaults, murder, mass disaster victims etc. STR analysis has already proved its potential to give accurate results. In addition to autosomal chromosomes, sex determination at many times is crucial in forensic situations, especially in situations like rape cases or in cases of missing persons. The chances of wrong interpretations may arise due to false detection (or nondetection) of STR fragments overall or only at amelogenin-specific fragments, in situation like mutations, intersex conditions, trans-sexualism etc., due to natural or artificial chimersim. The forensic relevance of the possible misinterpretation of STR's or amelogenin should never be underestimated.
   The present study was carried out to identify an individual using Y-STR in sex mismatch patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a method to replace patient's stem cell with the stem cell donated by the donor preferably biological related in order to cure malignant and non malignant diseases.
   This study enrolled ten female patients of HSCT. Samples were collected as pre and post transplant after 15 days, 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days of time interval from sex mismatch patient (female) and from donor (male) and chimeric status of the patient was analyzed using Y-STR markers (23 loci). Results demonstrated that donor genotype existed in blood and buccal swab of the recipient but no genetic profile existed for Y-STR in hair follicle of the recipient. This study suggests that only hair follicle out of three biological samples tested serves as reliable source of recipient's origin after HSCT for accurate personal identification especially in forensic situations.

AB  - Background: Cancer in the aging population presents manifold challenges. In the resource-limited settings of developing countries, concrete steps to optimize care for older adults with cancer are required.
   Materials and method: This prospective, observational study was divided in two parts. In the first part, older adults (>= 60 years) with a tissue diagnosis of cancer underwent a preliminary, detailed assessment of relevant geriatric domains. The patients were followed up at 4,12 and 24 weeks, and their survival status was recorded. In the sec ond part a newly developed screening tool, "SCreening of the Older PErson with Cancer", Version1 (SCOPE-C) was validated on patients with similar characteristics.
   Results: 419 participants were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the participants was 66.6 6.2 years, 75% had functional impairment, 35% had malnutrition, and 64% had more than one co-morbidity. The median survival time was 22 weeks from the index visit. Male gender, functional decline, cognitive impairment, malnutrition, and treatment modality were found to be independently associated with survival. Individual Scores on the SCOPE-C Version1 scale were correlated with survival status at 24 weeks, and a cutoff score of 64 had a 72.2% sensitivity and 77.3% specificity for better prognosis.
   Conclusion: The present study is a comprehensive attempt to assess older adults with cancer with limited resources in a busy health system. A preliminary assessment with a prognostic screening tool may streamline care in resource-limited settings and aid clinicians in making treatment decisions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To determine if D-dimers are elevated in individuals with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection who have adverse clinical outcomes including all-cause mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) admission or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases through April 9, 2020 for studies evaluating D-dimer levels in SARS-COV-2 infected patients with and without a composite clinical endpoint, defined as the presence of all-cause of mortality, Intensive care unit (ICU) admission or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A total of six studies were included in the meta-analysis.
   Results: D-dimers were significantly increased in patients with the composite clinical end point than in those without (SMD, 1.67 ug/ml (95% CI, 0.72-2.62 ug/ml). The SMD of the studies (Tang et al, Zhou et al, Chen et al), which used only mortality as an outcome measure was 2.5 ug/mL (95% CI, 0.62-4.41 ug/ml).
   Conclusion: We conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with elevated D-dimers have worse clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, ICU admission or ARDS) and thus measurement of D-dimers can guide in clinical decision making. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Alcoholic neuropathy is a chronic disorder caused by the excessive consumption of alcohol. Damage to the nerves results in unusual sensations in the limbs, decreased mobility and loss of some body functions.
   Objective: Alcohol is considered a major cause for exclusively creating the debilitating condition of the neuropathic state. This review critically examines the key mediators involved in the pathogenesis of alcoholic neuropathy and the targets, which, upon selective inhibition, alleviate the progression of alcoholic neuropathy.
   Methods: A thorough study of research and review articles available on the internet from PubMed, MEDLINE, and concerned sites was performed on alcoholic neuropathy.
   Results: Impairment in axonal transportation is quite common with the progression of alcoholic neuropathy. Nutritional deficiencies lead to axonal neuropathies that escalate a variety of complications that further worsen the state. PKC and PKA play a significant role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic neuropathy. PKC plays a marked role in modulating NMDA receptor currents, manifesting excitations in neurons. MMPs are involved in the number of pathologies that destroy the CNS and reduction in the level of endogenous antioxidants like alpha-tocopherol, vitamin E with ethanol, promotes oxidative stress by generating free radicals and lipid peroxidation.
   Conclusion: Oxidative stress is implicated in the activation of MMPs, causing disruption in the blood-brain barrier, the latter are involved in the trafficking and passage of molecules in and out of the cell. Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the downregulation of CNS receptors, consequently precipitating the condition of alcoholic neuropathy.

AB  - Objective and Background: Diabetic retinopathy is amongst the most common microvascular complications associated with diabetes. Controlling blood glucose level alone cannot manage diabetes associated complications. Thus, mechanisms that additionally prevent diabetes associated complications are the need of the hour, driving the researchers towards herbal therapies. Terminalia catappa is renowned for its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-hyperglycemic and anti-angiogenic activity. The current study explores the effect of Terminalia catappa fruit extract on streptozotocin- induced diabetic retinopathy in rats.
   Methods: Streptozotocin-induced chronic diabetic rat model was utilized in the study. The hydro-alcoholic fruit extract of T. catappa in 20mg/kg, 30mg/kg and 40mg/kg dose and standard anti-diabetic drug, glibenclamide (10mg/kg) was given orally. Retinopathy was evaluated by monitoring lenticular, fundus images and measuring arteriole and venule tortuosity index. Oxidative, angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers were assessed at the 12th week in the retinal homogenate. Histopathological changes in the retina were also examined. Data was analyzed using one-way Repeated Measure ANOVA followed by the Mann-Whitney test.
   Results: The hydro-alcoholic fruit extract of T. catappa significantly decreased blood glucose (p<0.001) in a dose-dependent manner in diabetic rats. Cataract lens was observed in all experimental groups and became clear (grade 0) with 40mg/kg and with 40mg/kg along with glibenclamide at the eighth and sixth week, respectively. The hydro-alcoholic fruit extract in all three doses significantly reduced (p<0.01) arteriole and venule tortuosity in diabetic rats.
   T. catappa in all three doses in diabetic rats showed a modulatory effect in oxidative, angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers.
   Conclusion: T. catappa reverses diabetes-induced retinopathy by anti-hyperglycemic, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory actions, and thus has a potential to be used in diabetes-induced retinopathy.

AB  - Background and objectives COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) has been used, predominantly in high-income countries (HICs) to treat COVID-19; available data suggest the safety and efficacy of use. We sought to develop guidance for procurement and use of CCP, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for which data are lacking.
   Materials and methods A multidisciplinary, geographically representative group of individuals with expertise spanning transfusion medicine, infectious diseases and haematology was tasked with the development of a guidance document for CCP, drawing on expert opinion, survey of group members and review of available evidence. Three subgroups (i.e. donor, product and patient) were established based on self-identified expertise and interest. Here, the donor and product-related challenges are summarized and contrasted between HICs and LMICs with a view to guide related practices.
   Results The challenges to advance CCP therapy are different between HICs and LMICs. Early challenges in HICs related to recruitment and qualification of sufficient donors to meet the growing demand. Antibody testing also posed a specific obstacle given lack of standardization, variable performance of the assays in use and uncertain interpretation of results. In LMICs, an extant transfusion deficit, suboptimal models of donor recruitment (e.g. reliance on replacement and paid donors), limited laboratory capacity for pre-donation qualification and operational considerations could impede wide adoption.
   Conclusion There has been wide-scale adoption of CCP in many HICs, which could increase if clinical trials show efficacy of use. By contrast, LMICs, having received little attention, require locally applicable strategies for adoption of CCP.

AB  - Platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGFRB) gene maps for the receptor tyrosine kinase PDGRF beta. PDGFRB gene fusions have been implicated in multiple myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms and have shown exquisite sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We report a case of a 29-year-old male who presented with acute myeloid leukemia who was eventually found to harbor a unique three-way translocation t(5;7;7)(q33.2;q32;q11.2) involving the PDGFRB gene. The patient initially achieved a complete response after induction with daunorubicin and cytarabine, but when he returned for consolidation, his white cell count had increased, and he was found to have an underlying myeloproliferative neoplasm. He was given consolidation with high-dose cytarabine and imatinib with excellent response, and ultimately received a matched unrelated donor transplant. The patient remains in remission to this day more than eight years later.

AB  - Background
   Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women. Surgical removal of the cancer is the mainstay of treatment; however, tumour handling during surgery can cause microscopic dissemination of tumour cells and disease recurrence. The body's hormonal response to surgery (stress response) and general anaesthesia may suppress immunity, promoting tumour dissemination. Paravertebral anaesthesia numbs the site of surgery, provides good analgesia, and blunts the stress response, minimising the need for general anaesthesia.
   Objectives
   To assess the eHects of paravertebral anaesthesia with or without sedation compared to general anaesthesia in women undergoing breast cancer surgery, with important outcomes of quality of recovery, postoperative pain at rest, and mortality.
   Search methods
   On 6 April 2020, we searched the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group (CBCG); CENTRAL (latest issue), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (via OvidSP); Embase (via OvidSP); the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal; and ClinicalTrials.gov for all prospectively registered and ongoing trials.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in adult women undergoing breast cancer surgery in which paravertebral anaesthesia with or without sedation was compared to general anaesthesia. We did not include studies in which paravertebral anaesthesia was given as an adjunct to general anaesthesia and then this was compared to use of general anaesthesia.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methods and outcome data from eligible trials. When data could be pooled, analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis, and the random-eHects model was used if there was heterogeneity. When data could not be pooled, the synthesis without meta-analysis (SWiM) approach was applied. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.
   Main results
   Nine studies (614 participants) were included in the review. All were RCTs of parallel design, wherein female patients aged > 18 years underwent breast cancer surgery under paravertebral anaesthesia or general anaesthesia.
   None of the studies assessed quality of recovery in the first three postoperative days using a validated questionnaire; most assessed factors aHecting quality of recovery such as postoperative analgesic use, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), hospital stay, ambulation, and patient satisfaction.
   Paravertebral anaesthesia may reduce the 24-hour postoperative analgesic requirement (odds ratio (OR) 0.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.34; 5 studies, 305 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to general anaesthesia. Heterogeneity (IM = 70%) was attributed to the fixed dose of opioids and non-steroidal analgesics administered postoperatively in one study (70 participants), masking a diHerence in analgesic requirements between groups.
   Paravertebral anaesthesia probably reduces the incidence of PONV (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.30; 6 studies, 324 participants; moderatecertainty evidence), probably results in a shorter hospital stay (mean diHerence (MD) -79.39 minutes, 95% CI -107.38 to -51.40; 3 studies, 174 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and probably reduces time to ambulation compared to general anaesthesia (SWiM analysis): percentages indicate vote counting based on direction of eHect (100%, 95% CI 51.01% to 100%; P = 0.125; 4 studies, 375 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Paravertebral anaesthesia probably results in higher patient satisfaction (MD 5.52 points, 95% CI 1.30 to 9.75; 3 studies, 129 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) on a 0 to 100 scale 24 hours postoperatively compared to general anaesthesia.
   Postoperative pain at rest and on movement was assessed at 2, 6, and 24 postoperative hours on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS). Four studies (224 participants) found that paravertebral anaesthesia as compared to general anaesthesia probably reduced pain at 2 postoperative hours (MD -2.95, 95% CI -3.37 to -2.54; moderate-certainty evidence). Five studies (324 participants) found that paravertebral anaesthesia may reduce pain at rest at 6 hours postoperatively (MD -1.54, 95% CI -3.20 to 0.11; low-certainty evidence). Five studies (278 participants) found that paravertebral anaesthesia may reduce pain at rest at 24 hours postoperatively (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.27 to -0.10; low-certainty evidence). DiHerences in the methods of two studies (119 participants) and addition of clonidine to the local anaesthetic in two studies (109 participants), respectively, contributed to the heterogeneity (IM = 96%) observed for these two outcomes.
   Two studies (130 participants) found that paravertebral anaesthesia may reduce pain on movement at 6 hours (MD-2.57, 95% CI -3.97 to -1.17) and at 24 hours (MD -2.12, 95% CI -4.80 to 0.55; low-certainty evidence). Heterogeneity (IM = 96%) was observed for both outcomes and could be due to methodological diHerences between studies.
   None of the studies reported mortality related to the anaesthetic technique. Eight studies (574 participants) evaluated adverse outcomes with paravertebral anaesthesia: epidural spread (0.7%), minor bleeding (1.4%), pleural puncture not associated with pneumothorax (0.3%), and Horner's syndrome (7.1%). These complications were self-limiting and resolved without treatment.
   No data are available on disease-free survival, chronic pain, and quality of life.
   Blinding of personnel or participants was not possible in any study, as a regional anaesthetic technique was compared to general anaesthesia. Risk of bias was judged to be serious, as seven studies had concerns of selection bias and three of detection bias.
   Authors' conclusions
   Moderate-certainty evidence shows that paravertebral anaesthesia probably reduces PONV, hospital stay, postoperative pain (at 2 hours), and time to ambulation and results in greater patient satisfaction on the first postoperative day compared to general anaesthesia. Paravertebral anaesthesia may also reduce postoperative analgesic use and postoperative pain at 6 and 24 hours at rest and on movement based on low-certainty evidence. However, RCTs using validated questionnaires are needed to confirm these results. Adverse events observed with paravertebral anaesthesia are rare.

AB  - Western democracies continue to 'legalize recreational cannabis use' after its 'medicinal approval', while India continues to debate whether to 'decriminalize' cannabis or not. One of the strongest arguments against cannabis decriminalization is cannabis dependence and the risk of psychosis, at-least in the vulnerable groups. Endocannabinoids are involved in neuronal proliferation and differentiation during 'patterning of the central nervous system'. Aberrant neurostimulation caused by repeated heavy exocannabinoid exposure may increase the probability of pro-psychotic experiences. Various animal and human studies have demonstrated increased but abnormal activation of cortical and subcortical areas due to chronic cannabis use. Some of these areas are involved in the pathogenesis of psychosis or schizophrenia. A review of the literature was done to hypothesize the possible role of cannabis to cause (or precipitate) psychosis through repeated "aberrant neurostimulation". The 'aberrant neurostimulation model of cannabis psychosis' may explain pathogenesis, individual vulnerabilities and developing therapeutic strategies for this debated entity. In future, well designed placebo-controlled studies may find the answer with more confidence.

AB  - Background
   There is great global variation in the sleeping arrangements for healthy newborn infants. Bed sharing is a type of sleeping practice in which the sleeping surface (e.g. bed, couch or armchair, or some other sleeping surface) is shared between the infant and another person. The possible physiological benefits include better oxygen and cardiopulmonary stability, fewer crying episodes, less risk of hypothermia, and a longer duration of breastfeeding. On the other hand, the most important harmful effect of bed sharing is that it may increase the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Studies have found conflicting evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of bed sharing during infancy.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of bed sharing, started during the neonatal period, on breastfeeding status (exclusive and total duration of breastfeeding), incidence of SIDS, rates of hypothermia, neonatal and infant mortality, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
   Search methods
   We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2020, Issue 7) in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 23 July 2020), CINAHL (1982 to 23 July 2020), and LILACS (1980 to 23 July 2020). We also searched clinical trials databases, and the reference lists of retrieved articles, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS.
   Selection criteria
   We planned to include RCTs or quasi-RCTs (including cluster-randomised trials) that included term neonates initiated on bed sharing within 24 hours of birth (and continuing to bed share with the mother in the first four weeks of life, followed by a variable time period thereafter), and compared them to a 'no bed sharing' group.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We planned to use the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.
   Main results
   Our search strategy yielded 6231 records. After removal of duplicate records, we screened 2745 records by title and abstract. We excluded 2739 records that did not match our inclusion criteria. We obtained six full-text studies for assessment. These six studies did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded.
   Authors' conclusions
   We did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria. There is a need for RCTs on bed sharing in healthy term neonates that directly assess efficacy (i.e. studies in a controlled setting, like hospital) or effectiveness (i.e. studies conducted in community or home settings) and safety. Future studies should assess outcomes such as breastfeeding status and risk of SIDS. They should also include neonates from high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, especially those countries where bed sharing is more prevalent because of cultural practices (e.g. Asian countries).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world globally causing widespread repercussions on individuals' physical, mental and emotional well-being. In such times, sleep is likely to be affected.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to present the available literature on sleep and also the foresight as to the future national strategy to mitigate the effects of this pandemic.
   Materials and Methods: An extensive literature search on PubMed, Google Scholar, Epistemonikos database (https://www.epistemonikos.org, PsycINFO for available literature on the prevalence of sleep problem on COVID-19 was done. Cross-citation search was also conducted to increase relevance of the review. The key words used were- (((((((((((insomnia)) OR (sleep)) OR (sleepiness)) OR ("sleep quality")) OR (OSA)) OR ("obstructive sleep apnoea")) OR ("obstructive sleep apnea")) OR (("sleep problem")) AND "covid-19" OR covid19* OR "COVID-19" OR "2019-nCoV" OR cv19* OR "cv-19" OR "cv 19" OR "n-cov" OR ncov* OR "sars-cov-2" OR "sars-cov2" OR "2019-ncov" OR "SARS-Coronavirus-2" OR "SARS-Coronavirus2" OR (wuhan* AND (virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR (covid* AND (virus OR viruses OR viral)) OR "covid-19-related" OR "SARS-CoV-2-related" OR "SARS-CoV2-related" OR "2019-nCoV-related" OR "cv-19-related" OR "n-cov-related"). Inclusion criteria consisted of articles in English, published from Jan 2020 till 19 Apr 2020. Two reviewers independently screened each research study for inclusion and eligibility.
   Results and Conclusion: Sleep is affected during COVID-19 pandemic in patients, their families, health-care workers and their families, population in isolation, and quarantine and as such in public. Limited literature exists with subjective data and no objective criteria were found to study sleep in COVID-19 pandemic. OSA was found to be a frequent baseline characteristic of COVID-19 patients. A need to follow guidelines is of paramount importance and strategies to better sleep in the population needs to be addressed.

AB  - Background: Frailty is a major challenge for healthcare systems in ageing societies. This dynamic state of health is a reflection of reduced reserve in various organ systems and enhanced vulnerability to stressors. Research in this area of geriatrics and gerontology is limited in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) like India. This study is directed at development of a culturally appropriate and validated assessment scale for frailty among older Indians.
   Methods: After extensive review of the literature on existing scales, a preliminary draft scale was formed. This draft was pre- and pilot-tested to check feasibility and modified accordingly. The final scale was validated on 107 older adults by confirmatory factor analysis and was named the Frailty Assessment and Screening Tool (FAST). The Fried's frailty phenotype was also administered on the same 107 older adults and scores of both were co-related. Suitable cut-off scores were found for frail and pre-frail older adults.
   Results: The final version of the FAST consisted of 14 questions pertaining to 10 domains. It has good reliability. Cronbach's alpha co-efficient was 0.99; test-retest reliability was 0.97 and validity by confirmatory factor analysis was adequate. The Kaiser-CMeyer-Olkin (KMO) of sampling adequacy was 0.699, and Bartlett's test of sphericity was significant (chi(2) = 353.471, p < 0.001). FAST scores had a cut-off of >= 7/14 for frail and >= 5/14 for prefrail elderly.
   Conclusion: The FAST is a validated tool with good psychometric properties. It is expected that it will be helpful in screening pre-frail and frail older adults in India and other LMICs and guide in clinical decision making for intervention.

AB  - Implantation in humans is a multistep process that involves apposition, adhesion, and invasion of the developing blastocyst into the receptive maternal endometrium. Though significant volume of research in this direction has identified important players orchestrating this delicate process, there are still gaps in our understanding of all the sequence of events during embryo implantation. Also, the early pregnancy-related complications that lead to fetal loss and miscarriage often occur in this critical window of implantation, which is primarily defined as the time when the maternal endometrium is supposed to be most receptive to the free blastocyst that emerges out from the zona pellucida. Studies in humans and rodents have identified several mediators like folliculin, LIF, IL11R alpha, splicing factor SC35, etc. to be essential for early implantation. Trophoblasts, that form the outer epithelial layer of the blastocyst, participate in the formation of the placenta. During placentation, invasive extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs), migrate into the endometrium, and a transient epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and remodel the uterine arteries for blood and nutrient exchange.

AB  - With its 1.3 billion population and faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, India is at the junction of two crucial decisions, balancing healthcare and the economy. To prevent the community spread of the virus, the Indian Government imposed a nationwide lockdown. Though initially successful to some extent in containing the disease spread, the extended lockdown eventually leads to a spiraling out effect resulting in the slowdown of the economy, which, in turn, lead to widespread consequences affecting the lives of millions of people, mostly those at the base of the social pyramid. We investigated the implications of few government policies taken during this pandemic and their impact on society, thereby suggesting short-term crisis management with long-term solutions. Here, we present a comprehensive account of Indian policy in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, balancing both economic and public health. We also explored a future contingency plan for risk mitigation along with few recommendations. This viewpoint will be useful for effective healthcare management and the economy in Asia's populous nation in the COVID-19 and prepare for a future crisis of this nature.

AB  - Multiple Myeloma (MM) arises from malignant transformation and deregulated proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) harbouring heterogeneous molecular anomalies. The effect of evolving mutations on clone fitness and their cellular prevalence shapes the progressing myeloma genome and impacts clinical outcomes. Although clonal heterogeneity in MM is well established, which subclonal mutations emerge/persist/perish with progression in MM and which of these can be targeted therapeutically remains an open question. In line with this, we have sequenced pairwise whole exomes of 62 MM patients collected at two time points, i.e., at diagnosis and on progression. Somatic variants were called using a novel ensemble approach where a consensus was deduced from four variant callers (Illumina's Dragen, Strelka2, SomaticSniper and SpeedSeq) and actionable/druggable gene targets were identified. A marked intraclonal heterogeneity was observed. Branching evolution was observed among 72.58% patients, of whom 64.51% had low TMBs (<10) and 61.29% had 2 or more founder clones. The hypermutator patients (with high TMB levels >= 10 to <= 100) showed a significant decrease in their TMBs from diagnosis (median TMB 77.11) to progression (median TMB 31.22). A distinct temporal fall in subclonal driver mutations was identified recurrently across diagnosis to progression e.g., in PABPC1, BRAF, KRAS, CR1, DIS3 and ATM genes in 3 or more patients suggesting such patients could be treated early with target specific drugs like Vemurafenib/Cobimetinib. An analogous rise in driver mutations was observed in KMT2C, FOXD4L1, SP140, NRAS and other genes. A few drivers such as FAT4, IGLL5 and CDKN1A retained consistent distribution patterns at two time points. These findings are clinically relevant and point at consideration of evaluating multi time point subclonal mutational landscapes for designing better risk stratification strategies and tailoring time to time risk adapted combination therapies in future.

AB  - Background & objectives: Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), reported to inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication in in vitro studies, has been recommended for prophylaxis of COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCWs). The objective of this study was to assess short-term adverse events (AEs) of HCQ in HCWs.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study among consenting HCWs taking prophylaxis and working in hospitals with COVID-19 patients used online forms to collect details of HCWs, comorbidities, prophylactic drugs used and AEs after the first dose of HCQ. Verification of dose and AEs was done by personal contact. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the effect of age, gender and dose of HCQ on AE.
   Results: Of the 1303 HCWs included, 98.4 per cent (n=1282) took HCQ and 66 per cent (n61) took 800 mg as first day's dose. Among the 19.9 per cent (n=259) reporting AEs, 1.5 per cent (n=20) took treatment for AE, none were hospitalized and three discontinued HCQ. Gastrointestinal AEs were the most common (172, 13.2%), with less in older [odds ratio (OR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.89], with more in females (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.78-3.38) and in those taking a total dose of 800 mg on day one compared to a lower dose. Hypoglycaemia (1.1%, n=14), cardiovascular events (0.7%, n=9) and other AEs were minimal.
   Interpretation & conclusions: HCQ prophylaxis first dose was well tolerated among HCWs as evidenced by a low discontinuation. For adverse effects, a small number required treatment, and none required hospitalization. The study had limitations of convenience sampling and lack of laboratory and electrocardiography confirmation of AEs.

AB  - The World Heart Federation (WHF) commenced a Roadmap initiative in 2015 to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease and resultant burgeoning of healthcare costs. Roadmaps provide a blueprint for implementation of priority solutions for the principal cardiovascular diseases leading to death and disability. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of these conditions and is an increasing problem due to ageing of the world's population and an increase in cardiovascular risk factors that predispose to AF. The goal of the AF roadmap was to provide guidance on priority interventions that are feasible in multiple countries, and to identify roadblocks and potential strategies to overcome them.
   Since publication of the AF Roadmap in 2017, there have been many technological advances including devices and artificial intelligence for identification and prediction of unknown AF, better methods to achieve rhythm control, and widespread uptake of smartphones and apps that could facilitate new approaches to healthcare delivery and increasing community AF awareness. In addition, the World Health Organisation added the non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to the Essential Medicines List, making it possible to increase advocacy for their widespread adoption as therapy to prevent stroke. These advances motivated the WHF to commission a 2020 AF Roadmap update. Three years after the original Roadmap publication, the identified barriers and solutions were judged still relevant, and progress has been slow.
   This 2020 Roadmap update reviews the significant changes since 2017 and identifies priority areas for achieving the goals of reducing death and disability related to AF, particularly targeted at low-middle income countries. These include advocacy to increase appreciation of the scope of the problem; plugging gaps in guideline management and prevention through physician education, increasing patient health literacy, and novel ways to increase access to integrated healthcare including mHealth and digital transformations; and greater emphasis on achieving practical solutions to national and regional entrenched barriers. Despite the advances reviewed in this update, the task will not be easy, but the health rewards of implementing solutions that are both innovative and practical will be great.

AB  - Background & objectives: In the current scenario, with availability of different surgical procedures for limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), there exists no common consensus as to the standardization of the management protocol for the same. In addition, there also exists diversity in the views about the clinical diagnosis, ancillary investigations and clinical parameters. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the reported outcomes of surgical interventions for the management of LSCD.
   Methods: A systematic review of published literature on limbal stem cell transplantation (LSCT) was performed using Ovid Medline, Embase and PubMed for a duration of 2009 to 2019. Original studies including prospective, retrospective case series and randomized controlled trials, articles in English language, articles with access to full text and studies with more than or at least 10 patients were included in this review. Data related to clinical and visual outcomes were evaluated, and pool estimates of different surgeries were calculated using random-effects model and individually using Pearson's Chi-square test.
   Results: A total of 1133 abstracts were evaluated. Finally, 17 studies were included for the analysis. Among these 17 studies, direct limbal lenticule transplantation was performed in five studies, of which autologous tissue from the fellow eye [conjunctival limbal autograft (CLAU)], allograft from a cadaver/live donor [keratolimbal allograft (KLAL)/conjunctival limbal allograft (CLAL)] and combination of CLAU plus KLAL were done in one, three and one studies, respectively. The ex vivo expanded cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) was reported in six studies and simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) in four studies. Two were comparative studies comparing CLET and CLAL (living-related CLAL) with cadaveric KLAL, respectively. Outcome analysis of the included studies showed significant heterogeneity. Calculated pool rate for various types of surgeries was calculated. The pool estimate for CLAL was 67.56 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI), 41.75-93.36; I-2=83.5%, P=0.002]. For KLAL, this value was 63.65 per cent (95% CI, 31.38-95.91; I-2=92.4%, P=0.000). Pool estimate for CLET was 78.90 per cent (95% CI, 70.51-87.28; I-2=73.6%, P=0.001). Corresponding values for SLET were 79.08 per cent (95% CI, 74.10-84.07; I-2=0.0%, P=0.619). CLAU and combination of CLAU plus KLAL were done in one study each; hence, statistical analysis could not be done. The functional outcome in terms of gain in visual acuity post-operatively was better in KLAL (P<0.005) and SLET group as compared to CLET group.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The present analysis suggests that though the anatomical success rates were almost identical between SLET, CLET, CLAL, and KLAL procedures, the functional success rates were better following KLAL and SLET procedures as compared to CLET. Decision for LSCT for cases of ocular burns based on either clinical judgement of the surgeon or individual diagnosis remains a suitable option.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) of the chest plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it should not be used indiscriminately. This review provides indications of CT chest in COVID-19 suspect, positive and recovered patients based on the current scientific evidence and our personal experience. CT chest is not indicated as a routine screening modality due to its poor sensitivity and specificity. However, it is useful in a small subset of COVID-19 suspects who test negative on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with normal/indeterminate chest X-ray (CXR) but have moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms and high index of clinical suspicion. CT chest is not indicated in every RT-PCR-positive patient and should be done only in specific clinical scenarios, where it is expected to significantly contribute in the clinical management such as COVID-19 patients showing unexplained clinical deterioration and/or where other concurrent lung pathology or pulmonary thromboembolism needs exclusion. Serial CXR and point-of-care ultrasound are usually sufficient to evaluate the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia. CT chest is also indicated in COVID-19-positive patients with associated co-morbidities (age >65 yr, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, immune-compromise, etc.) who, despite having mild symptoms and normal/indeterminate CXR, record oxygen saturation of <93 per cent at rest while breathing room air or de-saturate on six-minute walk test. Finally, CT chest plays a crucial role to rule out lung fibrosis in patients recovered from COVID-19 infection who present with hypoxia/impaired lung function on follow up. In conclusion, though CT chest is an indispensable diagnostic tool in COVID-19, it should be used judiciously and only when specifically indicated.

AB  - COVID-19 is an ongoing pandemic with many challenges that are now extending to its intriguing long-term sequel. 'Long-COVID-19' is a term given to the lingering or protracted illness that patients of COVID-19 continue to experience even in their post-recovery phase. It is also being called 'post-acute COVID-19', 'ongoing symptomatic COVID-19', 'chronic COVID-19', 'post COVID-19 syndrome', and 'long-haul COVID-19'. Fatigue, dyspnea, cough, headache, brain fog, anosmia, and dysgeusia are common symptoms seen in Long-COVID-19, but more varied and debilitating injuries involving pulmonary, cardiovascular, cutaneous, musculoskeletal and neuropsychiatric systems are also being reported. With the data on Long-COVID-19 still emerging, the present review aims to highlight its epidemiology, protean clinical manifestations, risk predictors, and management strategies. With the re-emergence of new waves of SARS-CoV-2 infection, Long-COVID-19 is expected to produce another public health crisis on the heels of current pandemic. Thus, it becomes imperative to emphasize this condition and disseminate its awareness to medical professionals, patients, the public, and policymakers alike to prepare and augment health care facilities for continued surveillance of these patients. Further research comprising cataloging of symptoms, longer-ranging observational studies, and clinical trials are necessary to evaluate long-term consequences of COVID-19, and it warrants setting-up of dedicated, post-COVID care, multi-disciplinary clinics, and rehabilitation centers.

TI  - Disulfiram Ethanol Reaction with Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer: An Exploratory Study
T2  - ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM
AB  - Aims: We conducted a cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence and clinical manifestation of disulfiram ethanol reaction (DER) and isopropanol toxicity (IT) in patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram. Alcohol-based hand rub contains either ethanol or isopropanol or both. COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide scale usage of sanitizers. Patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram, might experience disulfiram ethanol like reactions with alcohol-based sanitizers.
   Methods: We telephonically contacted 339 patients, prescribed disulfiram between January 2014 and March 2020. The assessment pertained to the last 3 months (i.e. third week of March to third week of June 2020).
   Result: The sample consisted of middle-aged men with a mean 16 years of alcohol dependence. Among the 82 (24%) patients adherent to disulfiram, 42 (12.3%) were using alcohol-based hand rubs. Out of these, a total of eight patients (19%; 95% CI 9-33) had features suggestive of DER; four of whom also had features indicative of IT. Five patients (62.5%) had mild and self-limiting symptoms. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by three (37.5%). Severe reactions were observed with exposure to sanitizers in greater amounts, on moist skin or through inhalation.
   Conclusion: Patients on disulfiram should be advised to use alternate methods of hand hygiene.

AB  - Background: In vivo neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) are useful techniques to understand brain anatomical structure, functional activity, source localization, neurochemical profiles, and tissue susceptibility respectively. Integrating unique and distinct information from these neuroimaging modalities will further help to enhance the understanding of complex neurological diseases.
   Objective: To develop a processing scheme for multimodal data integration in a seamless manner on healthy young population, thus establishing a generalized framework for various clinical conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease).
   Methods: A multimodal data integration scheme has been developed to integrate the outcomes from multiple neuroimaging data (fMRI, MEG, MRS, and QSM) spatially. Furthermore, the entire scheme has been incorporated into a user-friendly toolbox- "PRATEEK".
   Results: The proposed methodology and toolbox has been tested for viability among fourteen healthy young participants. The data-integration scheme was tested for bilateral occipital cortices as the regions of interest and can also be extended to other anatomical regions. Overlap percentage from each combination of two modalities (fMRI-MRS, MEG-MRS, fMRI-QSM, and fMRI-MEG) has been computed and also been qualitatively assessed for combinations of the three (MEG-MRS-QSM) and four (fMRI-MEG-MRS-QSM) modalities.
   Conclusion: This user-friendly toolbox minimizes the need of an expertise in handling different neuroimaging tools for processing and analyzing multimodal data. The proposed scheme will be beneficial for clinical studies where geometric information plays a crucial role for advance brain research.

AB  - Background & objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has so far affected over 41 million people globally. The limited supply of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) kits and reagents has made meeting the rising demand for increased testing incompetent, worldwide. A highly sensitive and specific antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (RDT) is the need of the hour. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of a rapid chromatographic immunoassay-based test (index test) compared with a clinical reference standard (rRT-PCR).
   Methods: A cross-sectional, single-blinded study was conducted at a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. Paired samples were taken for RDT and rRT-PCR (reference standard) from consecutive participants screened for COVID-19 to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the RDT. Further subgroup analysis was done based on the duration of illness and cycle threshold values. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to measure the level of agreement between the two tests.
   Results: Of the 330 participants, 77 were rRT-PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. Sixty four of these patients also tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RDT. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81.8 and 99.6 per cent, respectively. The sensitivity of RDT was higher (85.9%) in participants with a duration of illness <= 5 days.
   Interpretation & conclusions: With an excellent specificity and moderate sensitivity, this RDT may be used to rule in COVID-19 in patients with a duration of illness <5 days. Large-scale testing based on this RDT across the country would result in quick detection, isolation and treatment of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global health crisis. Non-COVID diseases across specialties have been significantly compromised. The greatest challenge has been to continue providing care to non-COVID cases with minimum transmission risk to health care workers, patients, and caregivers. In this specter, better described as a medical holocaust, we present our experiences of dealing with acute neurological patients who could access our facility. We attempted to work on three key areas - initial screening using a more inclusive, dynamic checklist for COVID suspicion over and above the emergency triage, a mandatory initial holding on a separate floor of our inpatient service equipped with infection control strategies similar to a COVID-designated area, and daily screening of health care workers and caregivers for symptoms and possible exposures. It was a steep learning curve, a couple of close shaves, and many more lessons that went into the development of an algorithm that seems to be working well.

AB  - Objective Prospective data on clinical profile, natural history and outcomes of NSAA (non-specific aortoarteritis) in children is limited. We initiated this prospective study to evaluate the short-term and medium-term outcomes of NSAA in children. Design Prospective observational study. Setting Tertiary care hospital in India. Patients We included 28 consecutive children (<15 years) with a diagnosis of NSAA. Main outcome measures Clinical profile, symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the pattern of vessel involvement, complications and markers of disease activity were assessed at the time of diagnosis. All the patients underwent treatment and interventions as per the current guidelines and were followed up for a mean duration of 13.5 +/- 6.7 months for disease activity and outcomes. Results The mean age of the cohort was 10 +/- 2.9 years (14 boys). Twenty (71%) patients had hypertension. Half of the children presented with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Only 21 patients (75%) met Sharma et al modified Ishikawa criteria for the diagnosis. The children with active disease (36%) were managed with immunosuppressive drugs. Percutaneous and surgical interventions were performed in 26 (93%) children. New York Heart Association functional class, LVEF and control of hypertension improved in most children on follow-up. Four children developed vascular restenosis requiring reinterventions. There was no death during mid-term follow-up. Conclusions Children with NSAA, unlike adults seldom present with classical features of the disease. ADHF and ventricular dysfunction are strikingly common in children. Appropriate immunosuppressive therapy for active disease and timely intervention improves clinical outcomes over a medium term follow-up. Future studies assessing long-term outcome are needed.

AB  - Background: Infections are a common cause of childhood stroke with variable presentation. The current case describes a rare infective cause of venous and arterial stroke in an immunocompetent girl with management implications.
   Case description: A 12 year old girl, presented with history of fever for 10 days, painful swelling of right eye for 7 days and altered sensorium for 2 days. On examination, she had right eye orbital cellulitis and fullness of right paranasal area. On nervous system examination, she was delirious, had right eye ophthalmoparesis, left upper motor neuron facial palsy and signs of meningeal inflammation. Her contrast enhanced CT head and subsequent MRI brain with arteriography and venography revealed right cavernous sinus and distal internal carotid artery thrombosis. She was started on intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin and subcutaneous heparin. In view of persistent symptoms, endoscopic debridement of right nasal cavity was done, which showed growth of aspergillus flavus. Subsequently, she was started on intravenous voriconazole. Within a week, she was afebrile, her inflammatory and neurological signs started improving. She was discharged after 3 weeks of intravenous voriconazole which was continued for 3 more weeks orally. Her procoagulant and immunodeficiency work up were normal. At 4 months follow up, she showed both clinical and radiological resolution.
   Conclusions: Despite high mortality described in sino-orbital aspergillosis, early and appropriate treatment led to optimal outcome. In deep seated infections, isolation of etiological organism should be attempted, particularly when patient doesn't respond to conventional antimicrobial therapy.

AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with higher morbidity. The prevalence of the metabolite changes in the brain associated with cognitive impairment in anti-retroviral therapy naive patients with HIV is unknown.
   Objective: To estimate the prevalence of the neurometabolites associated with cognitive impairment in antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive patients with HIV.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among ART naive patients with HIV aged 18-50 years in a tertiary care center in India. Cognition was tested using the Post Graduate Institute battery of brain dysfunction across five domains; memory, attention-information processing, abstraction executive, complex perceptual, and simple motor skills. We assessed the total N-acetyl aspartyl (tNAA), creatine (tCr) and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) using 3T magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Cognitive impairment was defined as an impairment in >= 2 domains.
   Results: Among 43 patients eligible for this study, the median age was 32 years (IQR 29, 40) and 30% were women. Median CD4 count and viral load were 317 cells/mu L (IQR 157, 456) and 9.3 copies/mu L (IQR 1.4, 38), respectively. Impairment in at least one cognitive domain was present in 32 patients (74.4%). Impairment in simple motor skills and memory was present in 46.5% and 44% of patients, respectively. Cognitive impairment, defined by impairment in >= 2 domains, was found in 22 (51.2%) patients. There was a trend towards higher concentration of tNAA (7.3 vs. 7.0 mmol/kg), tGlx (9.1 vs. 8.2 mmol/kg), and tCr (5.5 vs. 5.2 mmol/kg) in the frontal lobe of patients with cognitive impairment vs. without cognitive impairment but it did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05 for all). There was no difference in the concentration of these metabolites in the two groups in the basal ganglia.
   Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in ART naive patients with HIV. There is no difference in metabolites in patients with or without cognitive impairment. Further studies, with longitudinal follow-up are required to understand the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

AB  - Introduction: Outcomes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have vastly improved after introducing tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, patients in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges due to social and financial barriers.
   Objective: This study was conducted to understand socio-economic hindrances, knowledge-attitudes-practices, and assessing nonadherence to treatment in chronic phase CML patients taking imatinib.
   Materials and Methods: Patients of chronic phase CML, aged 15 and above, taking imatinib for six months or more were included in the study. A questionnaire (in the Hindi language) was administered, inquiring about the nature of the disease and its treatment, how imatinib was obtained, drug-taking behavior, and the treatment's economic and social burden. Nonadherence was assessed by enquiring patients for missed doses since the last hospital visit and for any treatment interruptions of >= 7 days during the entire course of treatment (TIs).
   Results: Four hundred patients were enrolled (median age 37 years, median duration on imatinib 63 months). Patients hailed from 16 different Indian states, and 29.75% had to travel more than 500 kilometers for their hospital visit. Scheduled hospital visits were missed by 14.75%. A third of the patients were unaware of the lifelong treatment duration, and 41.75% were unaware of the risks of discontinuing treatment. Treatment was financed by three different means- 61.75% received imatinib via the Glivec International Patient Assistance Program (GIPAP), 14.25% through a cost-reimbursement program, and 24% self-paying. 52.75% of patients felt financially burdened due to the cost of drugs (self-paying patients), cost of investigations, the expenditure of the commute and stay for the hospital visit, and loss of working days due to hospital visits. 41.25% of patients reported missed doses in the last three months, and 9% reported missing >10% doses. 16.5% of patients reported TIs. Nonadherence>10% and TIs were significantly higher in self-paying patients (15.6% and 25% respectively).
   Conclusion: We observed that patient awareness about the disease was suboptimal. Patients felt inconvenienced and financially burdened by the treatment. Nonadherence and treatment interruptions were observed in 41.25% and 16.5%, respectively. These issues were prevalent in self-paying patients.

KW  - temporoparietal cortex
AB  - Objective: The use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in schizophrenia has shown improvement as well as deficits in memory. Though most studies had focused on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex only, but impact of rTMS on cognitive functions remain inconclusive. The need of the study is to assess the impact of rTMS on memory in schizophrenia.
   Materials and Methods: Forty right-handed male patients with schizophrenia were included by purposive sampling and rated on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) before starting the rTMS treatment with the experimental group. Low frequency 1 Hz rTMS including 1200 stimulations were given over temporo-parietal cortex for 20 min as add on to medications. At the end of 10 session treatment (5 days a week for 2 weeks), the patients were re-evaluated.
   Results: A total of 39 patients (20 for experimental group and 19 for control group) with mean age of 29.70 +/- 9.05 and 31.26 +/- 7.78 years, respectively, shows significant difference to pre- and post-treatment mean PANSS score in positive, negative and general psychopathology domains. The pre- and post-treatment mean Postgraduate Institute Memory Scale Scores with multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant improvements in all memory domains (P < 0.01) except remote memory in both experimental and control groups.
   Conclusion: RTMS in combination with antipsychotics has shown improvement in psychopathology in patients of schizophrenia without any deterioration of memory.

AB  - Background & objectives: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are considered to be at a high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Besides, control of nosocomial infections transmitted from HCWs to the patients is also a cause of concern. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus among the hospital staff of a tertiary care health facility in north India.
   Methods: The HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG+IgM) using chemiluminescence immunoassay between June 22 and July 24, 2020. Venous blood (2 ml) was collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies.
   Results: Of the 3739 HCWs tested, 487 (13%) were positive for total SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The highest seroprevalence was observed in administrative staff (19.6%) and least in physicians (5.4%). The staff who used public (20%) and hospital transportation (16.9%) showed higher seroprevalence compared to staff using personal transportation (12.4%). No difference was observed between HCWs posted in COVID versus non-COVID areas. All seropositive symptomatic HCWs in our study (53.6%) had mild symptoms, and the remaining 46.4 per cent were asymptomatic. The antibody positivity rate progressively increased from 7.0 per cent in the first week to 18.6 per cent in the fourth week during the study.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a significant number of asymptomatic HCWs, association with the use of public transport, relatively lower seroprevalence compared with the non-HCWs and rising trend during the period of the study highlight the need for serosurveillance, creating awareness for infection control practices including social distancing and study of infection dynamics in the community for effective control of an infectious pandemic.

AB  - Freezing of gait (FoG) leads to imbalance and falls in Parkinson's disease. Cues potentially prevent FoG occurrence and unfreeze the patient from FoG. Although FoG detection and its prediction have been intensively studied, its termination is mostly neglected. Continuous cueing after the termination of freezing is annoying and has potential side effects in the long term. In this article, for the first time, we attempt to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of start and termination of freezing, which can potentially provide automated controlled cueing in Parkinson's individuals. We hypothesize certain attributes that correspond to the transition from walking to freezing and vice versa. To this end, we propose unique labeling of classes to predict freezing termination as follows: no FoC, pre-FoC (immediate state preceding FoG), FoG, and pre of post FoG (state just before unfreezing). Daphnet dataset, freely available online, was utilized to develop customized attributes measured from accelerometers with the data recorded from ten participants. The high-dimensional attributes were reduced using a principal component (PC) analysis before being fed to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier for prediction. With 45 PCs, we achieved average (SD) precision, sensitivity, specificity, f1 score, and accuracy of 95.55% (4.60%), 94.97% (4.86%), 99.19% (0.85%), 95.25% (4.72%), and 98.92% (1.56%), respectively, across the four classes while utilizing the attributes from 60 data points (approximate to 0.93 s) prior to a given instant. Specifically, for the newly introduced labeling-pre of post FoG, we observed average (SD) precision, sensitivity, specificity, and f1 score of 92.73% (10.15%), 91.50% (10.34%), 99.83% (032%), and 92.10% (10.25%), respectively, with 60 previous data points and 45 PCs. These results show the potential of the present approach in the timely deactivation of cues in real time to avoid any side effects of cueing. Enhanced clinical benefit for Parkinson's patients is the major contribution of this study.

AB  - Purpose: To assess and compare: the outcomes of various endavascttlar interventions in patients with Budd-Chiar syndrome (BCS).
   Materials and Methods: In this single-center retrospective study, 51O consecutive patients with BCS who had undergone a total of 618 endovascular procedures from January 2001 to December 2019 were included. Details of the type of endovascular intervention, technical success, clinical success, patency rate, complications, and survival outcomes were analyzed.
   Results: The overall technical success rate was 96% (593 of 618 procedures; 500 in treatment-naive patients and 93 repeat interventions for recurrent disease). Endovascular procedures included recanalization procedures (angioplasty and stent placement) in 355 patients (71%) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in 145 (29%). Major postprocedure complications occurred in 14 patients (2.8%). Vascular/stent restenosis occurred in 95 patients (19%), and successful repeat intervention was performed in 82 of those 95 (86.3%). An additional I I of these 82 (13.4%) underwent a third intervention for restenosis. In the recanalization and TIPS groups, the 1- and 5-y cumulative patency rates were 87% and 74% and 95% and 68%, respectively. The I- and 5-v survival rates were 96% and 89% and 900/0 and 76%, respectively.
   Conclusions: Endovascular interventions for BCS are feasible and safe in the majority of patients, with long-term patency and survival rates.

AB  - Background
   Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder with an approximate prevalence of 1 in 3500 live births. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a lung disease caused by aspergillus-induced hypersensitivity with a prevalence of 2% to 15% in people with cystic fibrosis. The mainstay of treatment includes corticosteroids and itraconazole. The treatment with corticosteroids for prolonged periods of time, or repeatedly for exacerbations of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, may lead to many adverse effects. The monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, has improved asthma control in severely allergic asthmatics. The drug is given as a subcutaneous injection every two to four weeks. Since allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is also a condition resulting from hypersensitivity to specific allergens, as in asthma, it may be a candidate for therapy using anti-IgE antibodies. Therefore, anti-IgE therapy, using agents like omalizumab, may be a potential therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of the review.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of anti-IgE therapy for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Last search: 09 September 2021.
   We searched two ongoing trial registries (Clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials platform). Date of latest search: 16 August 2021.
   Selection criteria
   Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing anti-IgE therapy to placebo or other therapies for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in people with cystic fibrosis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included study. They planned to perform data analysis using Review Manager.
   Main results
   Only one study enrolling 14 participants was eligible for inclusion in the review. The double-blind study compared a daily dose of 600 mg omalizumab or placebo along with twice daily itraconazole and oral corticosteroids, with a maximum daily dose of 400 mg. Treatment lasted six months but the study was terminated prematurely and complete data were not available. We contacted the study investigator and were told that the study was terminated due to the inability to recruit participants into the study despite all reasonable attempts. One or more serious side effects were encountered in six out of nine (66.67%) and one out of five (20%) participants in omalizumab group and placebo group respectively.
   Authors' conclusions
   There is lack of evidence for the efficacy and safety of anti-IgE (omalizumab) therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is a need for large prospective randomized controlled studies of anti-IgE therapy in people with cystic fibrosis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis with both clinical and laboratory outcome measures such as steroid requirement, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis exacerbations and lung function.

AB  - Objective To develop and validate a simple risk scores chart to estimate the probability of poor outcomes in patients with severe head injury (HI). Design Retrospective. Setting Level-1, government-funded trauma centre, India. Participants Patients with severe HI admitted to the neurosurgery intensive care unit during 19 May 2010-31 December 2011 (n=946) for the model development and further, data from same centre with same inclusion criteria from 1 January 2012 to 31 July 2012 (n=284) for the external validation of the model. Outcome(s) In-hospital mortality and unfavourable outcome at 6 months. Results A total of 39.5% and 70.7% had in-hospital mortality and unfavourable outcome, respectively, in the development data set. The multivariable logistic regression analysis of routinely collected admission characteristics revealed that for in-hospital mortality, age (51-60, >60 years), motor score (1, 2, 4), pupillary reactivity (none), presence of hypotension, basal cistern effaced, traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage/intraventricular haematoma and for unfavourable outcome, age (41-50, 51-60, >60 years), motor score (1-4), pupillary reactivity (none, one), unequal limb movement, presence of hypotension were the independent predictors as its 95% confidence interval (CI) of odds ratio (OR)_did not contain one. The discriminative ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (95% CI)) of the score chart for in-hospital mortality and 6 months outcome was excellent in the development data set (0.890 (0.867 to 912) and 0.894 (0.869 to 0.918), respectively), internal validation data set using bootstrap resampling method (0.889 (0.867 to 909) and 0.893 (0.867 to 0.915), respectively) and external validation data set (0.871 (0.825 to 916) and 0.887 (0.842 to 0.932), respectively). Calibration showed good agreement between observed outcome rates and predicted risks in development and external validation data set (p>0.05). Conclusion For clinical decision making, we can use of these score charts in predicting outcomes in new patients with severe HI in India and similar settings.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The rapid spread of the virus worldwide prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. COVID-19 discontinuing's a global health crisis. Approximately 80% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 display undetectable to mild inflammation confined in the upper respiratory tract. In remaining patients, the disease turns into a severe form affecting almost all major organs predominantly due to an imbalance of innate and adaptive arms of host immunity. The purpose of the present review is to narrate the virus's invasion through the system and the host's reaction. A thorough discussion on disease severity is also presented regarding the behavior of the host's immune system, which gives rise to the cytokine storm particularly in elderly patients and those with comorbidities. A multifaceted yet concise description of molecular aspects of disease progression and its repercussion on biochemical and immunological features in infected patients is tabulated. The summary of pathological, clinical, immunological, and molecular accounts discussed in this review is of theranostic importance to clinicians for early diagnosis of COVID-19 and its management.

AB  - There is a gap in existing literature regarding Over the Top (OTT) platform use contributing to the excessive and problematic screen time. We aimed to assess OTT platform use among college students and its associations with increased screen time, mental well-being, COVID-19 related anxiety and personality traits. A total of 1039 students from a college in India were invited to participate in this web-based survey. A majority of participants used OTT platforms regularly. Subscription to paid OTT platforms, poor mental well-being were associated with problematic OTT use; whereas personality trait of conscientiousness seemed to offer protection against problematic OTT use.

AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, the postgraduate activities in physiology were shifted from live (face to face teaching) to virtual mode. This transition posed a challenge to postgraduate students and faculty moderators, especially for participant-centric group discussion, wherein face-to-face interaction contributes significantly to active learner engagement. To bridge the gap between live group discussion (GD) and virtual GD in the conventional format (VGD), we implemented an innovative yet feasible multistep approach of conducting structured virtual group discussion (sVGD). It involved priming of students during the preparatory phase and incorporation of the Tuckman model of group dynamics, which consists of sequential substages of forming, storming, norming, and performing into the virtual format. Unsupervised synchronous and asynchronous, as well as supervised synchronous interactions within and in between the minigroups in a structured way, led to active engagement of students with one another and the moderator, despite the constraints imposed by the virtual format. After establishing the feasibility of the approach during the first GD (sVGD-1), sVGD-2 was conducted, further refining the approach, and feedback was obtained from the postgraduate students. Pre-GD feedback revealed that the live session was preferred over virtual for the conduct of GD, whereas both live GD and sVGD were perceived to be more effective than VGD in the post-GD feedback. Such pedagogical innovations may also help to address the challenges posed in traditional teaching across the undergraduate and postgraduate courses in medical education and beyond during such unforeseeable circumstances.

AB  - Background: An outreach (OR) health-care facility providing broad specialty outpatient services was started by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in rural area of district Jhajjar, Haryana. Objectives: This study aimed to ascertain the resource requirement for establishing an OR health-care facility and patient satisfaction with regard to the services being provided. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 at an OR Outpatient Department (OPD) of AIIMS, New Delhi, at Jhajjar. Service delivery model adopted for health-care delivery was hub and spoke. Traditional method of costing was used for economic evaluation. Feedback pro forma of 400 patients who attended OPD services was analyzed to measure health service accessibility. Results: Capital expenditure to set up the facility was calculated to be approximately INR 17,57,49,074/- ($ 2,703,832) and operational cost per year was approximately INR 8,73,86,370/- ($ 1,344,406). Approximate per-patient cost for single OPD consultation was calculated to be INR 874 ($13.45) which included medicines and investigations. High scores for all domains of accessibility of health care were observed. Conclusion: The study provides a preliminary evidence that OR health-care facilities can be instrumental in increasing access to health-care delivery with lesser capital outlays, however, large-scale multicentric studies are needed to arrive at any conclusion. The services have been very well accepted by the local community members being quality medical care with highly subsidized health-care services.

AB  - Background and objectives Crohn's disease (CD) and Intestinal tuberculosis (ITB) are chronic inflammatory ulcero-constrictive intestinal diseases with similar phenotype. Although both are disease models of chronic inflammation and their clinical presentations, imaging, histological and endoscopic findings are very similar, yet their etiologies are diverse. Hence, we aimed to look at differences in the prevalence of pathobionts like adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Yersinia enterocolitica in CD and ITB as well as their associations with host-associated genetic polymorphisms in genes majorly involved in pathways of microbial handling and immune responses. Methods The study cohort included 142 subjects (69 patients with CD, 32 with ITB and 41 controls). RT- PCR amplification was used to detect the presence of AIEC, L. monocytogenes, C. jejuni, and Y. enterocolitica DNA in colonic mucosal biopsies. Additionally, we tested three SNPs in IRGM (rs13361189, rs10065172, and rs4958847), one SNP in ATG16L1 (rs2241880) and one SNP in TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) by real-time PCR with SYBR green from peripheral blood samples in this cohort. Results In patients with CD, AIEC was most frequently present (16/ 69, 23.19%) followed by L. monocytogenes (14/69, 20.29%), C. jejuni (9/69, 13.04%), and Y. enterocolitica (7/69, 10.14%). Among them, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were significantly associated with CD (p = 0.02). In addition, we identified all the three SNPs in IRGM (rs13361189, rs10065172, and rs4958847), one SNP in ATG16L1 (rs2241880) and TNFRSF1A (rs4149570) with a significant difference in frequency in patients with CD compared with ITB and controls (p<0.05). Conclusion Higher prevalence of host gene polymorphisms, as well as the presence of pathobionts, was seen in the colonic mucosa of patients with CD as compared to ITB, although both are disease models of chronic inflammation.

AB  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically active species which are involved in maintaining cellular and signalling processes at physiological concentrations. Therefore, cellular components that regulate redox balance are likely to play a crucial role in viral life-cycle either as promoters of viral replication or with antiviral functions. Zinc is an essential micronutrient associated with anti-oxidative systems and helps in maintaining a balanced cellular redox state. Here, we show that zinc chelation leads to induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in epithelial cells and addition of zinc restores ROS levels to basal state. Addition of ROS (H2O2) inhibited dengue virus (DENV) infection in a dose-dependent manner indicating that oxidative stress has adverse effects on DENV infection. ROS affects early stages of DENV replication as observed by quantitation of positive and negative strand viral RNA. We observed that addition of ROS specifically affected viral titres of positive strand RNA viruses. We further demonstrate that ROS specifically altered SEC31A expression at the ER suggesting a role for SEC31A-mediated pathways in the life-cycle of positive strand RNA viruses and provides an opportunity to identify drug targets regulating oxidative stress responses for antiviral development.

AB  - In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes (canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the field.

KW  - systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
AB  - This is a report of a case of a 25-year-old woman, who presented with a rapidly progressive sensory-motor flaccid quadriparesis which had developed over a few days along with bladder and bowel involvement. She had a past history of photosensitive rash and joint pains along with mild-to-moderate grade fever; for which she had never been evaluated. Serological markers for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were strongly positive and helped in establishing the diagnosis of SLE-related holocord myelitis. High-dose intravenous glucocorticoid followed by intravenous pulse cyclophosphamide was used to treat her and there was a significant improvement. In this case report, the diagnosis of SLE was made for the first time in a patient presenting with holocord myelitis.

AB  - Objective: To determine the efficacy of pectointercostal fascial block in relieving postoperative pain in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
   Design: Single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Single-center tertiary care teaching hospital.
   Participants: A total 40 participants undergoing cardiac surgery aged 18 to 80 years.
   Interventions: Subjects were categorized into 2 groups of 20 each. In group 2 participants (interventional group), bilateral pectointercostal fascial block was given using ropivacaine injection 0.25% after completion of surgery, before shifting to the intensive care unit.
   Measurements and Main Results: Postoperative pain was measured after extubation at 0, 3, 6, and 12 hours, using a numeric rating scale. Pain in group 2 was significantly less and lasted for a longer duration than in group 1. Fentanyl requirement was significantly higher in group 1 (1.06 +/- 0.12 mu/kg) than in group 2 (0.82 +/- 0.19 mu/kg).
   Conclusions: Pectointercostal fascial block is an easy and efficient technique to reduce postoperative pain after cardiac surgery. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - Home confinement
KW  - Dopamine
AB  - Background: Literature shows that home confinement during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected sleep. However, such information regarding subjects having Parkinson's disease (PD) is unavailable.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire, developed and validated by experts. PD subjects from nine centers across India were included. Questionnaire assessed presence as well as change in sleep-related parameters and PD symptoms during home confinement. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) and REM sleep behavior disorder (REMBD) was diagnosed using validated questionnaire. Additionally, changes in physical activity, adoption of new hobbies during home confinement and perceived quality of life were assessed.
   Results: Of 832 subjects, 35.4% reported sleep disturbances. New-onset/worsening of sleep disturbances (NOWS) was reported by 23.9% subjects. Among those with sleep disturbances (n = 295), insomnia symptoms worsened in half (51.5%) and nearly one-fourth reported worsening of RLS (24.7%) and REMBD (22.7%) each. NOWS was common in subjects lacking adequate family support during home confinement (P = 0.03); home confinement > 60 days (P = 0.05) and duration of PD > 7 years (P = 0.008). Contrarily, physical activity >1 h/day and engagement in new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep. NOWS was associated with worsening of motor as well as non-motor symptoms of PD (P < 0.001) and poorer life quality (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Home confinement during COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with NOWS among PD subjects. NOWS was associated with global worsening of PD symptoms and poorer life quality. Physical activity >1 h/day and adoption of new hobbies during home confinement were associated with better sleep. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Incidence, risk factors, and viral etiology of community-acquired acute lower respiratory tract infection among older adults in rural north India

KW  - PNEUMONIA

AB  - Background There are limited data on incidence, risk factors and etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) among older adults in low- and middle-income countries.
   Methods We established a cohort of community dwelling older adults >= 60 years and conducted weekly follow-up for acute respiratory infections (ARI) during 2015-2017. Nurses assessed ARI cases for LRTI, collecting combined nasal/throat swabs from all LRTI cases and an equal number of age- and sex-matched asymptomatic neighbourhood controls. Swabs were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) using polymerase chain reaction. LRTI and virus-specific LRTI incidence was calculated per 1000 person-years. We estimated adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) for risk factors using Poisson regression and calculated etiologic fractions (EF) using adjusted odds ratios for detection of viral pathogens in LRTI cases vs controls.
   Results We followed 1403 older adults for 2441 person-years. LRTI and LRTI-associated hospitalization incidences were 248.3 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 229.3-268.8) and 12.7 (95% CI = 8.9-18.1) per 1000 person-years. Persons with pre-existing chronic bronchitis as compared to those without (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 4.7, 95% CI = 3.9-5.6); aged 65-74 years (IRR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.3-2.0) and =75 years (IRR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4-2.4) as compared to 60-64 years; and persons in poorest wealth quintile (IRR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1-1.8) as compared to those in wealthiest quintile were at higher risk for LRTI. Virus was detected in 10.1% of LRTI cases, most commonly influenza (3.8%) and RSV (3.0%). EF for RSV and influenza virus was 83.9% and 83.6%, respectively.
   Conclusion In this rural cohort of older adults, the incidence of LRTI was substantial. Chronic bronchitis was an important risk factor; influenza virus and RSV were major viral pathogens.

AB  - Obesity and diabetes are the two major metabolic complications linked with bad eating habits and the sedentary (lazy) lifestyle. In the worst-case situation, metabolic problems are a causative factor for numerous other conditions. There is also an increased demand to control the emergence of such diseases. Dietary and lifestyle improvements contribute to their leadership at an elevated level. The present review, therefore, recommends the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in obesity and diabetes treatment. The KD involves a diet that replaces glucose sugar with ketone bodies and is effective in numerous diseases, such as metabolic disorders, epileptic seizures, autosomal dominant polycystic disease of the kidney, cancers, peripheral neuropathy, and skeletal muscle atrophy. A lot of high profile pathways are available for KD action, including sustaining the metabolic actions on glucose sugar, suppressing insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, altering homeostasis of the systemic ketone bodies, contributing to lowering diabetic hyperketonemia, and others. The KD regulates the level of glucose sugar and insulin and can thus claim to be an effective diabetes approach. Thus, a stopgap between obesity and diabetes treatment can also be evidenced by KD.

AB  - Background: Several human diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease, and systemic amyloidosis are associated with the misfolding and aggregation of protein molecules.
   Objective: The present study demonstrated the comparison of 4-methyl coumarin and 4-methylthiocoumarin derivative for their anti-amyloidogenic and disaggregation activities. The hen egg-white lysozyme is used as a model system to study protein aggregation and disaggregation under in vitro conditions.
   Methods: Techniques used in the study were Thioflavin T fluorescence assay, intrinsic fluorescence assay, circular dichroism, transmission electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics.
   Results: Fifteen compounds were screened for their anti-amyloidogenic and disaggregation potential. Six compounds significantly inhibited the fibril formation, whereas ten compounds showed disaggregation property of pre-formed fibrils. Under in vitro conditions, the compound C3 and C7 showed significant inhibition of fibril formation in a concentration-dependent manner as compared to control. C3 and C7 demonstrated 93% and 76% inhibition of fibril formation, respectively. Furthermore, C3 and C7 exhibited 83% and 76% disaggregation activity, respectively, of pre-formed HEWL fibrils at their highest concentration. These anti-amyloidogenic and disaggregation potential of C3 and C7 were validated by intrinsic fluorescence, CD, molecular dynamics, and TEM study.
   Discussion: 4-methylthiocoumarins derivatives have shown better anti-amyloidogenic activity as compared to 4-methylcoumarin derivatives for both amyloid formation as well as disaggregation of preformed amyloid fibrils. Structurally, the derivatives of 4-methylthiocoumarins (C3 and C7) contain thio group on 2nd position that might be responsible for anti-amyloidogenic activity as compared to 4-methylcoumarin derivatives (C2 and C4).
   Conclusion: C3 and C7 are novel 4-methylthiocoumarin derivatives that can be used as a lead for alleviation and symptoms associated with protein aggregation disorders.

AB  - Cervical cancer, caused by HPV infection, is responsible for more than 311 000 preventable deaths every year. A global call to accelerate efforts to eliminate this disease has generated a new global strategy proposing ambitious, but achievable, targets for HPV vaccination of girls, and screening and treatment of women. The present paper addresses the suboptimal access to HPV vaccination in low-income and lower-middle-income countries (LICs/LMICs), where the burden of disease weighs most heavily, in part through co-infection with HIV. A proposed framework for action was formulated by first reviewing the reasons underlying gaps in HPV vaccine coverage. Good practices from recent introductions of HPV vaccine at scale in LICs/LMICs were then assessed based on targeted literature reviews and the experience and views of the authors. Difficulties in uptake and coverage of the HPV vaccine relate to the costs of the vaccine and service delivery, lack of prioritization, the challenges of vaccinating adolescents, and shortage of vaccines as the supply failed to keep pace with the rapid expansion in global demand, including from LICs/LMICs. The framework for action calls for new strategic thinking to consolidate global learning and invigorate operationalization at a country level.

AB  - Mentors at seven U.S. and Australian academic institutions initially partnered with seven leading Indian academic palliative care and cancer centers in 2017 to undertake a program combining remote and in-person mentorship, didactic instruction, and project-based learning in quality improvement (QI). From its inception in 2017 to 2020, the Palliative Care-Promoting Accesst and Improvement of the Cancer Experience Program conducted three cohorts for capacity building of 22 Indian palliative care and cancer programs. Indian leadership established a Mumbai QI training hub in 2019 with philanthropic support. In 2020, the project which is now named Enable Quality, Improve Patient care India (EQuIP-India) focuses on both palliative care and cancer teams. EQuIP-India now leads ongoing Indian national collaboratives and training in QI and is integrated into India's National Cancer Grid. Palliative Care-Promoting Accesst and Improvement of the Cancer Experience demonstrates a feasible model of international collaboration and capacity building in palliative care and cancer QI. It is one of the several networked and blended learning approaches with potential for rapid scaling of evidence-based practices.

AB  - Addressing oxygen requirements of rural India should aim at using a safe, low-cost, easily available, and replenishable source of oxygen of moderate purity. This may be possible with the provision of a self-sustaining oxygen concentrator (pressure swing adsorption with multiple molecular sieve technology) capable of delivering oxygen at high-flow rates, through a centralized distribution system to 100 or more bedded rural hospitals, with back up from an oxygen bank of 10 x 10 cylinders. This will provide a 24 x 7 supply of oxygen of acceptable purity (similar to 93%) for the treatment of hypoxemic conditions and will enable hospitals to specifically provide for high-flow oxygen in at least 15% of the beds. It may also serve as a facility for a local refill of oxygen cylinders for emergency use within the hospital as well as to subsidiary primary health centers, subcenters, and ambulances, thereby nudging our health-care system toward self-sufficiency in oxygen generation and utilization.

AB  - Failure of anterior cruciate ligament often occurs in young sports personnel hampering their career. Such ACL ruptures are quite prevalent in sports such as soccer during dynamic loading which occurs at more than one rate of loading. In this work, a structural constitutive equation has been used to predict the forces acting on ACL for different rates of loading. Methods: Ligaments with distal femur and proximal tibia were subjected to tensile loading to avoid crushing of tissue ends and slipping at higher rates of strain. Custom designed cylindrical grippers were fabricated to clamp the distal femur and proximal tibial bony sections. To estimate parameters for the model, eighteen fresh cadaveric femur-ACL-tibia complex (FATC) samples were experimented on by pure tensile loading at three orders of rates of strain viz., 0.003, 0.03, and 0.3 s(-1). The experimental force-elongation data was used to obtain parameters for De-Vita and Slaughter's equation. The model was validated with additional tensile experiments. Results: Statistical analysis demonstrated failure stress, Young's modulus and volumetric strain energy to vary significantly as a function of rate of strain. Midsection failure was observed only in samples tested at 0.03 s(-1). Femoral or tibial insertion failure were observed in all other experiments irrespective of rate of strain. Conclusion: Human FATC samples were tensile tested to failure at three rates of strain using custom-designed cylindrical grippers. A structural model was used to model the data for the ACL behaviour in the linear region of loading to predict ligament behaviour during dynamic activities in live subjects.

AB  - Intestinal epithelium represents a dynamic and diverse cellular system that continuously interacts with gut commensals and external cues. Intestinal stem cells, which lie at the heart of epithelial renewal and turnover, proliferate to maintain a steady stem cell population and differentiate to form functional epithelial cell types. This rather sophisticated assembly-line is maintained by an elaborate micro-environment, sculpted by a myriad of host and gut microbiota-derived signals, forming an intestinal stem cell niche. This complex, yet crucial signaling niche undergoes dynamic changes during homeostasis and chronic intestinal inflammation. Inflammatory bowel disease refers to a chronic inflammatory response toward pathogenic or commensal microbiota, in a genetically susceptible host. Compositional and functional alterations in gut microbiota are pathognomonic of IBD. The present review highlights the modulatory role of gut microbiota on the intestinal stem cell niche during homeostasis and inflammatory bowel disease. We discuss the mechanisms of direct action of gut commensals (through microbiota-derived or microbiota-influenced metabolites) on ISCs, followed by their effects via other epithelial and immune cell types.

AB  - Objective: To assess the predictors of achieving and maintaining guideline-recommended glycemic control in people with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Trial (n = 1146), to identify groups that achieved guideline-recommended glycemic control (HbA1c < 7%) and those that remained persistently poorly controlled (HbA1c > 9%) over a median of 28 months of follow-up. We used generalized estimation equations (GEE) analysis for each outcome i.e. achieving guideline-recommended control and persistently poorly controlled and constructed four regression models (demographics, disease-related, self-care, and other risk factors) separately to identify predictors of HbA1c < 7% and HbA1c > 9% at the end of the trial, adjusting for trial group assignment and site.
   Results: In the final multivariate model, adherence to prescribed medications (RR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.95), adherence to diet plans (RR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.43, 2.23) and middle-aged: 5064 years (RR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.02-1.71) were associated with achieving guideline-recommended control (HbA1c < 7%). Presence of microvascular complications (RR: 0.70; 95%CI: 0.53-0.92) reduced the probability of achieving guideline-recommended glycemic control (HbA1c 7%). Further, longer duration of diabetes (>15 years), RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.72, hyperlipidemia, RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.34 and younger age group (35-49 years vs. >64 years: RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.47-0.79) were associated with persistently poor glycemic control (HbA1c > 9%).

AB  - Objective To generate national estimates of key non-communicable disease (NCD) risk factors for adolescents (15-17 years) identified in the National NCD Monitoring Framework and, study the knowledge, attitudes and practices towards NCD risk behaviours among school-going adolescents. Design and setting A community-based, national, cross-sectional survey conducted during 2017-2018. The survey was coordinated by the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research with 10 reputed implementing research institutes/organisations across India in urban and rural areas. Participants A multistage sampling design was adopted covering ages between 15 and 69 years-adolescents (15-17 years) and adults (18-69 years). The sample included 12 000 households drawn from 600 primary sampling units. All available adolescents (15-17 years) from the selected households were included in the survey. Main outcome measures Key NCD risk factors for adolescents (15-17 years)-current tobacco and alcohol use, dietary behaviours, insufficient physical activity, overweight and obesity. Results Overall, 1402 households and 1531 adolescents completed the survey. Prevalence of current daily use of tobacco was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.0% to 4.7%), 25.2% (95% CI: 22.2% to 28.5%) adolescents showed insufficient levels of physical activity, 6.2% (95% CI: 4.9% to 7.9%) were overweight and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.0% to 2.9%) were obese. Two-thirds reported being imparted health education on NCD risk factors in their schools/colleges. Conclusion The survey provides baseline data on NCD-related key risk factors among 15-17 years in India. These national-level data fill information gaps for this age group and help assess India's progress towards NCD targets set for 2025 comprehensively. Though the prevalence of select risk factors is much lower than in many developed countries, this study offers national evidence for revisiting and framing appropriate policies, strategies for prevention and control of NCDs in younger age groups.

AB  - Introduction: In 2016, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) led to 17.9 million deaths worldwide, representing 31% of all global deaths. CVDs are the leading cause of mortality worldwide and significant barriers to achieving the sustainable development goals. Modern medicines have been significant in improving health outcomes. However, non-adherence to medication is one of the reasons behind adverse health-related outcomes among patients suffering from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countries.
   Patients and Methods: This qualitative study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in India and Ghana. A total of 35 in-depth interviews were conducted with atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) patients. The data were analysed thematically using the Capability Opportunity and Motivation (COM-B) framework.
   Findings: The findings were summarised under three important broad themes of the COM-B framework: capability, opportunity and behaviour. Under capability, comprehension of disease, medication schedule, and unplanned travel affected adherence among patients. Cost of medication, insurance and access were the critical factors under opportunity, which negatively influenced medication adherence. Mood, beliefs about treatment and outcome expectations under motivation led to non-adherence among patients. Apart from these factors, some important health system factors such as health care experience and trust in the facilities and reliance on alternative medication also affected adherence in both countries.
   Conclusion: This study has highlighted that the health system factors have dominantly influenced adherence to medication in India and Ghana. In India, we found participants to be satisfied with their health care provided at the government hospitals. However, limited time for consultation, lack of well-stocked pharmacy and unclear prescription negatively influenced adherence among participants in India and Ghana. The study emphasises that the health system needs to be strengthened, and the patients' belief system needs to be explored to address the issue of medication adherence in LMICs.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this cone-beam computed tomographic study was to evaluate the association between the mesiobuccal root canal configuration (RCC), interorifice distance (IOD), and the corresponding root length of a permanent maxillary first molar tooth. Methods: One hundred cone-beam computed tomographic scans obtained from the computerized data bank of the institute were studied. The IOD between the first mesiobuccal and second mesiobuccal canal was measured in the axial section where the second mesiobuccal canal was first visualized. The root length was measured from the cementoenamel junction to the root apex in the coronal and sagittal section. The associations of these parameters with the RCC (based on Vertucci's classification) were evaluated. Results: The predominant RCC was observed to be Vertucci type II (89%). The mean root length with this configuration was 11.19 +/- 1.35 mm. In type IV RCC, the mean root length was 9.13 +/- 0.52 mm. A statistically significant association was established between the root length and RCC (P < .05). In roots with type II and type IV RCC, the mean IOD was 2.58 +/- 0.04 mm and 2.62 +/- 0.1 mm, respectively. No statistically significant relation was established between the IOD and the type of RCC (P > .05). Conclusions: The length of the mesiobuccal root is an important anatomic parameter for predicting the type of RCC in the permanent maxillary first molar tooth.

AB  - Objective: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory joint disease. The identification of multifaceted etiological changes at the protein level in RA remains an important need. We aimed to identify differential proteins (DPs) and gene profiles to uncover inflammatory indicators and their association to RA pathogenesis. Methods: 2-DE and SWATH-MS were used to identify DPs in RA and healthy control plasma. Fluorescence phenylboronate gel electrophoresis (Flu-PAGE) with mass spectro-metry was used for protein glycation in RA plasma. Disease specificity of identified DPs was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot analysis. The gene expressions of selected DPs were evaluated by qRT-PCR in PBMCs of RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), spondyloar-thritis (SpA), and osteoarthritis (OA). The functional implication of glycated protein was determined by in-silico and validated by in vitro analysis in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Results: A total of 150 DPs (127 increased and 23 decreased) were identified by 2-DE and SWATH-MS analysis in RA plasma compared to healthy control (HC). Nine proteins were identified as glycated by Flu-PAGE LC-MS/MS. Transthyretin (TTR), serotransferrin, and apolipoprotein-A1 (Apo-A1) were found to be differential and glycated. ELISA and Western blot results revealed the disease-specific increased expression of TTR and RAGE in RA. The qRT-PCR results signify the aberrant gene expression of TTR and RAGE, found to be associated with RA when compared with SLE, SpA, and OA PBMCs. TTR-RAGE interac-tions were predicted by in-silico and validated by in-vitro analysis using RA-FLS. The increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and differently expressed TTR and RAGE were confirmed in fibroblast-like synoviocytes under inflamma-tory conditions. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the level of TTR was increased in RA plasma, along with an altered glycation rate. TTR and RAGE aberrant gene expression in PBMCs are the key events associated with RA, and TNF-alpha activates the NF-KB pathways and promote TTR and RAGE differential expressions that may have pathogenic/inflammatory significance.

AB  - Neurological disorders significantly impact the world's economy due to their often chronic and life-threatening nature afflicting individuals which, in turn, creates a global disease burden. The Group of Twenty (G20) member nations, which represent the largest economies globally, should come together to formulate a plan on how to overcome this burden. The Neuroscience-20 (N20) initiative of the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) is at the vanguard of this global collaboration to comprehensively raise awareness about brain, spine, and mental disorders worldwide. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the various brain initiatives worldwide and highlight the need for cooperation and recommend ways to bring down costs associated with the discovery and treatment of neurological disorders. Our systematic search revealed that the cost of neurological and psychiatric disorders to the world economy by 2030 is roughly $16T. The cost to the economy of the United States is $1.5T annually and growing given the impact of COVID-19. We also discovered there is a shortfall of effective collaboration between nations and a lack of resources in developing countries. Current statistical analyses on the cost of neurological disorders to the world economy strongly suggest that there is a great need for investment in neurotechnology and innovation or fast-tracking therapeutics and diagnostics to curb these costs. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, SBMT, through this paper, intends to showcase the importance of worldwide collaborations to reduce the population's economic and health burden, specifically regarding neurological/brain, spine, and mental disorders.

AB  - Purpose: Therapeutic contact lenses (TCL) are known to help in epithelial healing and decreasing pain after various corneal surgeries. However, literature lacks any data describing their use following Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) where intraoperative epithelial debridement is commonly performed. Here we study the efficacy and safety of TCL in patients undergoing DSAEK. Methods: In this prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. 40 eyes of 40 patients of pseudophakic bullous keratopathy undergoing DSAEK were enrolled and randomized into two groups, control (no TCL) and test (TCL). Primary outcome was time taken for epithelial healing and secondary outcomes were postoperative pain score, graft attachment, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, and endothelial cell loss at 3 months. Results: Average time taken for epithelial healing was 3.35 +/- 0.49 days in the test group and 4.95 +/- 1.05 days in the control group (P < 0.001). Average pain scores in first operative week were significantly lower in the test group as compared to control (P < 0.001). Graft detachment occurred in eight patients in control group and two in test group (P = 0.03). Both rebubbling rates and average endothelial cell loss at 3 months were higher in the control group with P = 0.07 and 0.06 respectively. No contact lens-related adverse effects were noted during the study period. Conclusion: Use of TCL in DSAEK leads to faster epithelial healing and lesser postoperative pain. In addition, it may also contribute to lower rebubbling rates and endothelial cell loss.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate tear neuropeptides (NPs) (vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), neuropeptide Y (NPY), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP), nerve growth factor (NGF)) in chronic ocular topical hypotensive therapy with and without benzalkonium chloride (BAK) preservative.
   Methods A comparative, open label, cross-sectional study of patients using antiglaucoma medications for >6 months with BAK (group I), without BAK (group II) and controls was done. Tear NPs (ELISA), ocular surface evaluation tests (tear breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer's test, corneal and conjunctival staining score) and confocal central corneal subbasal nerve fibre layer (SBNFL) imaging was done.
   Results Of 153 eyes evaluated, group 1 (82 eyes (41 patients; mean age 48 +/- 14.5 years)) and group 2 (71 eyes (36 patients; mean age 43.11 +/- 15 years)) were on therapy for a mean duration of 10.05 +/- 2.0 and 9.67 +/- 2.3 months, respectively. Tear analysis showed elevated SP and NGF (p<0.01); decreased CGRP (p=0.03), VIP and NPY (p<0.01) compared with controls (n=30, mean age 29.33 +/- 5.7 years). Tear NP levels (SP (p=0.1), NGF (p=0.33), CGRP (p=1), VIP (p=0.87), NPY (p=0.83)) and SBNFL (p=0.09) were comparable in both groups. There was no correlation seen between tear NP levels and clinical tests and SBNFL.
   Conclusion Our study analysis points towards altered tear NP levels in eyes on chronic topical hypotensive therapy in comparison with controls with no significant difference in tear NP levels and central corneal SBNFL density between the BAK preservative and BAK-free antiglaucoma therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neural crest cell-derived neoplasm of infants. Histologically, melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy usually consists of 2 types of cells: neuroblast-like and melanocyte-like cells. Here we present a rare case of melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy containing a third type of cell population, that is, rhabdomyoblasts in addition to the above two.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a 10-month-old female child who was brought to us with complaints of swelling over the right forehead for the last 9 months, which started increasing in size rapidly 3 months before presenting to us. Noncontrast computed tomography scan showed a large well-defined extra-axial lesion in the right frontotemporal region. The child underwent an open biopsy under general anesthesia. Histopathological sections showed a malignant small round cell tumor consisting of hyperchromatic cells lying in sheets and lobules separated by fibrous septae. The patient underwent 7 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy over a period of 2 months. The patient underwent right frontotemporal craniotomy and gross total excision of the lesion as a definitive surgery. Postoperatively, the patient was stable, and there was no new deficit. Histopathology revealed neuroblast-like and melanocyte-like cells with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation. The patient received chemotherapy in the postoperative period. The patient had recurrence of the tumor and died 8 months after the surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Calvarial malignant neuroectodermal tumor of infancy with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is a rare entity with no cases being reported before. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with surgical excision can be a promising modality of treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Inactivating mutations of the SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4) gene and/or loss of the BRG1 (brahma-related gene 1) protein defines SMARCA4-deficient thoracic sarcoma (SMARCA4-dTS), an aggressive neoplasm with a usually fatal outcome. Similar SMARCA4 mutations/BRG1 loss is also seen in a subset of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs; SMARCA4-dNSCLCs) that lack alterations in currently targetable oncogenic drivers, that is, EGFR, ALK, and ROS1. There is limited knowledge on the cytomorphological features of these SMARCA4-deficient thoracic neoplasms. Methods: We retrospectively analysed the cytology of 2 cases each of SMARCA4-dNSCLC and SMARCA4-dTS to understand their cytomorphological overlap, if any, and identify features that would prompt testing for BRG1 loss. Results: All 4 patients were males presenting with advanced disease, with a mean age of 41.5 years (SMARCA4-dTS) and 58.5 years (SMARCA4-dNSCLC) at presentation. The cytology of the 2 SMARCA4-dTSs was strikingly similar, showing predominantly singly dispersed rhabdoid phenotype tumour cells with perinuclear cytoplasmic condensations in an inflammatory or necrotic background. The cytology raised suspicion for a wide range of differentials, including melanoma, high-grade lymphoma, germ cell tumour, undifferentiated carcinoma, and undifferentiated sarcoma. SMARCA4-dNSCLCs, on the other hand, were recognizable as poorly differentiated (adeno)carcinomas and were easily distinguished from SMARCA4-dTSs, with both cases showing cohesive clusters of frequently large tumour cells with abundant pale cytoplasm. Conclusion: A diagnosis of SMARCA4-dTS is possible on cytology with appropriate ancillary testing and a high index of suspicion. The cytology of SMARCA4-dNSCLCs does not overlap with SMARCA4-dTS; rather, it resembles that of any poorly differentiated (adeno)carcinoma in the limited numbers analysed in this study.

AB  - Context.-Somatic mutations in SMARCA4 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, member 4) gene and/or BRG1 (Brahma-related gene 1) loss identifies a subset of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) lacking alterations in EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), and ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1) genes. Preliminary observations suggest responsiveness to immunotherapy and targeted therapies.
   Objective.-To study BRG1 loss in NSCLCs and elucidate the clinicopathologic profile of such SMARCA4-deficient NSCLCs.
   Design.-Non-small cell lung carcinomas diagnosed during 6 years were subject to immunohistochemistry for BRG1 and BRM (Brahma). Tumors with BRG1 loss were stained with antibodies against thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), p40, cytokeratins, hepatocyte paraffin 1 (Hep Par 1), Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4), CD34, SRY-box 2 (SOX2), chromogranin, synaptophysin, p53, integrase interactor 1, ALK, and ROS1. EGFR mutation testing was performed by polymerase chain reaction-based method.
   Results.-Among 100 NSCLCs tested, 4 cases (4%) showed BRG1 loss. The histology ranged from solid adenocarcinomas (n = 1) to large cell/poorly differentiated carcinomas (n = 3) with clear cell cytology in 2 cases. All showed loss/reduction of BRM with variable cytokeratin and SALL4 expression, and were negative for TTF-1, p40, Hep Par 1, ALK, ROS1, and EGFR mutations. CD34 and SOX2 were negative in all 4 cases. Isolated BRM loss was common (21%), distributed across all NSCLC subtypes including squamous cell carcinomas and a hepatoid adenocarcinoma.
   Conclusions.-BRG1 loss occurs in a subset of TTF-1/p40-negative poorly differentiated NSCLCs. Identification and follow-up will clarify the prognosis, diagnostic criteria, and potential for therapeutic personalization.

AB  - Introduction We compared diabetes incidence in South Asians aged >= 45 years in urban India (Chennai and Delhi) and Pakistan (Karachi), two low-income and middle-income countries undergoing rapid transition, with blacks and whites in the US, a high-income country. Research design and methods We computed age-specific, sex-specific and body mass index (BMI)-specific diabetes incidence from the prospective Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Study (n=3136) and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (blacks, n=3059; whites, n=9924). We assessed factors associated with incident diabetes using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results South Asians have lower BMI and waist circumference than blacks and whites (median BMI, kg/m(2): 24.9 vs 28.2 vs 26.0; median waist circumference, cm 87.5 vs 96.0 vs 95.0). South Asians were less insulin resistant than blacks and whites (age-BMI-adjusted homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, mu IU/mL/mmol/L: 2.30 vs 3.45 vs 2.59), and more insulin deficient than blacks but not whites (age-BMI-adjusted homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell dysfunction, mu IU/mL/mmol/L: 103.7 vs 140.6 vs 103.9). Age-standardized diabetes incidence (cases/1000 person-years (95% CI)) in South Asian men was similar to black men and 1.6 times higher (1.37 to 1.92) than white men (26.0 (22.2 to 29.8) vs 26.2 (22.7 to 29.7) vs 16.1 (14.8 to 17.4)). In South Asian women, incidence was slightly higher than black women and 3 times (2.61 to 3.66) the rate in white women (31.9 (27.5 to 36.2) vs 28.6 (25.7 to 31.6) vs 11.3 (10.2 to 12.3)). In normal weight (BMI <25 kg/m(2)), diabetes incidence adjusted for age was 2.9 times higher (2.09 to 4.28) in South Asian men, and 5.3 times (3.64 to 7.54) in South Asian women than in white women. Conclusions South Asian adults have lower BMI and are less insulin resistant than US blacks and whites, but have higher diabetes incidence than US whites, especially in subgroups without obesity. Factors other than insulin resistance (ie, insulin secretion) may play an important role in the natural history of diabetes in South Asians.

AB  - Introduction South Asians (SA) and Pima Indians have high prevalence of diabetes but differ markedly in body size. We hypothesize that young SA will have higher diabetes incidence than Pima Indians at comparable body mass index (BMI) levels. Research design and methods We used prospective cohort data to estimate age-specific, sex, and BMI-specific diabetes incidence in SA aged 20-44 years living in India and Pakistan from the Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia Study (n=6676), and compared with Pima Indians, from Pima Indian Study (n=1852). Results At baseline, SA were considerably less obese than Pima Indians (BMI (kg/m(2)): 24.4 vs 33.8; waist circumference (cm): 82.5 vs 107.0). Age-standardized diabetes incidence (cases/1000 person-years, 95% CI) was lower in SA than in Pima Indians (men: 14.2, 12.2-16.2 vs 37.3, 31.8-42.8; women: 14.8, 13.0-16.5 vs 46.1, 41.2-51.1). Risk of incident diabetes among 20-24-year-old Pima men and women was six times (relative risk (RR), 95% CI: 6.04, 3.30 to 12.0) and seven times (RR, 95% CI: 7.64, 3.73 to 18.2) higher as compared with SA men and women, respectively. In those with BMI <25 kg/m(2), however, the risk of diabetes was over five times in SA men than in Pima Indian men. Among those with BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), diabetes incidence in SA men was nearly as high as in Pima men. SA and Pima Indians had similar magnitude of association between age, sex, BMI, and insulin secretion with diabetes. The effect of family history was larger in SA, whereas that of insulin resistance was larger in Pima Indians Conclusions In the background of relatively low insulin resistance, higher diabetes incidence in SA is driven by poor insulin secretion in SA men. The findings call for research to improve insulin secretion in early natural history of diabetes.

AB  - Background The prevalence of obesity and dyslipidaemia was observed to be increased among the tribal populations, due to globalization. Materials and methods In the present study, data on demographic, somatometric and blood samples were collected from 613 participants of both sex, age 18-60 years, further lipid profiling and genotyping was executed. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) software was used for gene-gene interactions analysis. Results Significantly differences were observed with respect to the general characteristic and selected gene polymorphisms in both the tribes. Among the Liangmai tribe, MC4R gene was found to pose significant decreased risk for waist-height ratio (WHtR) (OR = 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.32-0.99; p value = .04) and HDL (OR = 0.58; 95% CI = 0.36-0.92; p value = .02). Similar trends of significant decreased risk (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.20-0.76; p value=.006) for BMI were observed among the Mizo tribe. The gene-gene interaction revealed the combined model of FTO+MC4R genes shows an increased risk for BMI in both the tribes. The independent significant increased risk posed by FTO gene was moderated by interaction with MC4R gene. Conclusions The observed differences can possibly attribute to both their respective ancestries resulting in different gene pools and the physical environment. The results of the study highlight the importance of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in adverse phenotype groups. KEY MESSAGE Among the tribal population, the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidaemia has been increased. Differential distribution and associations of selected markers hint towards differential genetic architecture in these populations. MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism was found to show a significantly decreased risk for WHtR and low HDL among the Liangmai tribe and BMI among the Mizo tribe. Significant increased risk posed by FTO rs9939609 gene polymorphism was moderated by the interaction with MC4R rs17782313.

AB  - Imaging of repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the common indications for cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations. With advances in CMR imaging techniques like phase contrast imaging and functional imaging, it has superseded investigations like echocardiography for anatomical and functional assessment of the pathophysiological changes in repaired TOF. Common repair procedures for TOF include infundibulectomy, transannular patch repair and right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit. While each of these procedures cause dynamic changes in heart and pulmonary arteries resulting in some expected imaging findings, CMR also helps in diagnosing the complications associated with these repair procedures like pulmonary stenosis, right ventricular outflow tract aneurysm, pulmonary regurgitation, RV-PA conduit stenosis, tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular failure, and residual ventricular septal defects. Hence, it is imperative for a radiologist to be familiar with the expected changes on CMR in repaired TOF along with some of the common complications that may be encountered on imaging in such patients.

AB  - Intracellular signaling complexes of the innate immune system orchestrate the development of inflammation. Porphyromonas gingivalis is a commensal bacterium that induces periodontal pyroptosis. The transcription factor Dec1 can regulate the expression of inflammatory molecules. In this study, we investigated whether a deficiency of Dec1 activates/represses Caspase-1 and/or Gasdermin-D in periodontal pyroptosis, resulting in the release of the proinflammatory mediator interleukin-1 beta. Dec1 expression in human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPDLFs) treated with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was assessed and pyroptosis activation was determined by microscopy, qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Moreover, a siRNA targeting Dec1 was introduced into HPDLFs to determine the function of Dec1 in periodontal pyroptosis and a Dec1-deficient experimental mouse model of periodontitis was used. Treatment of HPDLFs with P. gingivalis LPS-stimulated levels of cleaved-Caspase-1 and cleaved-GSDMD and increased levels of phosphorylated NF-kappa B and interleukin-1 beta. In contrast, Dec1 knockdown maintained cellular homeostasis with low levels of pyroptosis. Treatment with P. gingivalis alleviated periodontal pyroptosis in PDLFs of wild-type mice and a Dec1 deficiency subsequently repressed the inflammatory effect of P. gingivalis. These results reveal for the first time the novel function of Dec1 in periodontal pyroptosis, suggesting that Dec1 is a crucial target to prevent periodontal inflammation.

AB  - Ingestion of excess systemic fluoride results in physiological and pathological disturbances of bone homeostasis. We and others have established that treatment with 50 mu M sodium fluoride (NaF) is safe and effective for bone remodeling in cellular and animal models. This study aimed to study the effects of treatment with 50 mu M NaF on macrophage-driven osteoclastogenesis and to characterize the function of 50 mu M NaF in alveolar bone resorption during aging. Murine RAW264.7 monocytic cells were treated with RANKL in the presence or absence of 50 mu pM NaF. The mRNA expression levels of Cathepsin K and nuclear factor-activated T-cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which are involved in the mechanism of osteoclast induction, were measured using quantitative real time RT-PCR. An experimental 50 mu M NaF-treated aging mouse model was used to confirm alveolar bone resorption. Micro-CT was used to assess bone loss and immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the protein expression levels of RANKL and Cathepsin K in periodontal tissues. Treatment of RAW264.7 cells with 50 mu M NaF repressed osteoclastogenesis. Micro-CT results confirmed that treatment with 50 mu M NaF alleviated alveolar bone resorption in aging. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed decreased expression levels of RANKL and cathepsin K in 50 mu M NaF-treated mice during aging. Taken together, these results contribute fascinating experimental clues that 50 mu M NaF has the potential to function as an anti-resorptive agent during alveolar bone aging.

AB  - Importance The Cancer Aging Research Group (CARG) toxicity score is used to assess toxicity risk in geriatric patients receiving chemotherapy. Objective The primary aim was to validate the CARG score in geriatric patients treated with curative intent chemotherapy in predicting grade 3-5 toxicities. Design This was a longitudinal prospective observational study. Setting Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India, a tertiary cancer care referral centre. Participants Patients, aged >= 65 years, with gastrointestinal, breast or gynaecological stage I-III cancers being planned for curative intent chemotherapy. A total of 270 patients were required for accrual in the study. Exposure(s) Total risk score ranged from 0 (lowest toxicity risk) to 19 (highest toxicity risk). Main outcome(s) and measure(s) The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate whether the CARG risk score predicted for grade 3-5 toxicities. Results The study cohort of 270 patients had a mean age of 69 (65-83) years, with the most common cancers being gastrointestinal (79%). Fifty-two per cent of patients had atleast one grade 3-5 toxicity. The risk of toxicity was increased with an increasing risk score (42% low risk, 51% medium risk and 79% high risk; p<0.001). There was no association between either Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (p=0.69) or age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (p=0.79) risk categories and grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicities. Conclusions and relevance This study validates the CARG risk score in predicting for grade 3-5 toxicities in geriatric oncology patients receiving curative intent chemotherapy and can be considered as the standard of care before planning chemotherapy in every elderly patient.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the effect of ambient temperature, humidity and wind speed on disease occurrence in Delhi, India. Data and Methods: Data regarding daily corona cases, temperature, humidity, wind speed, doubling time and basic reproduction number (R-0) was retrieved from online sources. Pearson's coefficient was used to assess the correlation between daily as well as weekly corona cases and various environmental factors. Results: During the study period of 97 days, there was a steady rise in number of corona cases with median (interquartile range) cases per day being 224 (58 to 635). The doubling time demonstrated a strong positive correlation with temperature while R-0 had strong negative correlation with temperature (correlation coefficients 0.814 and -0.78, respectively). No significant correlation with humidity or wind speed was observed. Conclusion: Increasing temperature decreases COVID-19 infectivity; however, actual role of environmental factors in expansion of pandemic needs further evaluation globally.

AB  - The multi-lineage differentiation potential is one of the prominent mechanisms through which stem cells can repair damaged tissues. The regenerative potential of stem cells is the manifestation of several changes at the structural and molecular levels in stem cells that are regulated through intricate mitochondrial-nuclear interactions maintained by Ca2+ ion signaling. Despite the exhilarating evidences strengthening the versatile and indispensible role of Ca2+ in regulating mitochondrial-nuclear interactions, the extensive details of signaling mechanisms remains largely unexplored. In this review we have discussed the effect of Ca2+ ion mediated mitochondrial-nuclear interactions participating in stem plasticity and its regenerative potential.

AB  - Introduction. Invasive mucormycosis (IM) is a life-threatening infection caused by fungi belonging to the order Mucorales. Histopathology, culture and radiology are the mainstay of diagnosis but lack sensitivity, leading to a delay in timely diagnosis and intervention. Recently, PCR- based approaches have been shown to be a promising method in diagnosing IM.
   Hypothesis/Gap Statement. Molecular -based approaches may be a valuable adjunct to standard conventional methods for diagnosing IM, especially among culture negatives and patients on antifungal therapy.
   Aim. In the present study we aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of panfungal and Mucoralesspecific PCR for diagnosing IM from various clinical specimens.
   Methodology. This was a prospective study in which 239 clinically suspected cases of IM attending our tertiary care hospital from August 2015 to March 2018 were enrolled. All the cases were defined as 'proven', 'probable' or 'possible' based on EORTC/ MSGERC guidelines. In addition to conventional diagnostics (KOH-calcofluor stain and culture), panfungal and Mucoralesspecific PCR assays were also performed. The amplified products were sequenced for species identification. In vitro antifungal susceptibility was performed on all the culture-positive isolates.
   Results. Among 239 clinically suspected cases of IM, only 140 cases were diagnosed by the demonstration of aseptate ribbonlike hyphae on direct microscopy. Culture was positive in 35.7 % (54/140) of direct microscopy-positive samples. Among the proven cases (n=11), the sensitivity for both Mucoralesspecific nested PCR and panfungal PCR was 100 %, but specificity was 91.9 and 73.7% respectively. In probable cases (n=129), the sensitivity of both the PCRs was 98.5 % and specificity for panfungal PCR was 73.7 and 91.9 % for Mucoralesspecific PCR.
   Conclusion. Pan fungal PCR in combination with Mucoralesspecific PCR, followed by sequencing, may play a significant role in IM diagnosis especially among those negative for both direct microscopy and culture.

AB  - Genomic characterization of lung cancer has not only improved our understanding of disease biology and carcinogenesis but also revealed several therapeutic opportunities. Targeting tumor dependencies on specific genomic alterations (oncogene addiction) has accelerated the therapeutic developments and significantly improved the outcomes even in advanced stage of disease. Identification of genomic alterations predicting response to specific targeted treatment is the key to success for this "personalized treatment" approach. Availability of multiple choices of therapeutic options for specific genomic alterations highlight the importance of optimum sequencing of drugs. Multiplex gene testing has become mandatory in view of constantly increasing number of therapeutic targets and effective treatment options. Influence of genomic characteristics on response to immunotherapy further makes comprehensive genomic profiling necessary before therapeutic decision making. A comprehensive elucidation of resistance mechanisms and directed treatments have made the continuum of care possible and transformed this deadly disease into a chronic condition. Liquid biopsy-based approach has made the dynamic monitoring of disease possible and enabled treatment optimizations accordingly. Current lung cancer management is the perfect example of "precision-medicine" in clinical oncology.

AB  - Background: Limb girdle muscular dystrophy recessive type 1 (LGMDR1, Previously LGMD2A) is characterized by inactivating mutations in CAPN3. Despite the significant burden of muscular dystrophy in India, and particularly of LGMDR1, its genetic characterization and possible phenotypic manifestations are yet unidentified.
   Material and Methods: We performed bidirectional CAPN3 sequencing in 95 LGMDR1 patient samples characterized by calpain-3 protein analysis, and these findings were correlated with clinical, biochemical and histopathological features.
   Results: We identified 84 (88.4%) cases of LGMDR1 harboring 103 CAPN3 mutations (71 novel and 32 known). At least two mutant alleles were identified in 79 (94.2%) of patients. Notably, 76% exonic variations were enriched in nine CAPN3 exons and overall, 41 variations (40%) correspond to only eight exonic and intronic mutations. Patients with two nonsense/out of frame/splice-site mutations showed significant loss of calpain-3 protein as compared to those with two missense/inframe mutations (P = 0.04). We observed a slow progression of disease and less severity in our patients compared to European population. Rarely, presenting clinical features were atypical, and mimicked other muscle diseases like FSHMD, distal myopathy and metabolic myopathies.
   Conclusion: This is first systematic study to characterize the genetic framework of LGMDR1 in the Indian population. Preliminary calpain-3 immunoblot screening serves well to direct genetic testing. Our findings prioritized nine CAPN3 exons for LGMDR1 diagnosis in our population; therefore, a targeted-sequencing panel of nine exons could serve well for genetic diagnosis, carrier testing, counseling and clinical trial feasibility study in LGMDR1 patients in India.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the closure of various academic institutions, leaving online learning the only option for continuity of education and curricular activities among children and adolescents. It is unclear whether the adoption of online learning will persist in the post-pandemic period. However, enhanced exposure to gadgets impacts the socio-emotive-adaptive development of young children. It sprouts various short-term as well as long-term deleterious physical and mental health effects among children and adolescents. Research has focused mainly on the epidemiology, risks modeling, pathophysiology, and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2, but the impact of increased exposure to gadgets and technology due to online learning activity and the "digital new-norm" has largely been unnoticed. The enforced/self-quarantine leading to less outdoor activities during this pandemic, may have a cumulative poor health consequence. Early detection and management of those at risk and signs and symptoms of these adverse health effects are important. Awareness regarding these ill-effects on this vulnerable group is relevant for parents, guardians, teachers, mentors, health-care providers, and policy-makers.

AB  - Background: Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is an underdiagnosed and life-threatening condition. Histopathological diagnosis is difficult due to the risks and variable diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy. Objectives: To study the clinical profile and compare the diagnostic criteria of CS in a cohort of sarcoidosis. Methods: A retrospective review of the Sarcoidosis database (375 patients) was performed to identify patients with CS. Demographic and clinical details were retrieved. We applied the available diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of CS: The World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Diseases (WASOG), Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), and Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare ( JMHW ) criteria. Results: Out of the 375 patients, 15 (4%) were identified with CS. The median age was 41 years, and 53% were female. The most common symptoms were breathlessness, palpitation, and fatigue in 80%, 53.3%, and 46.6% of patients, respectively. Tuberculin positivity (>= 10mm induration) was seen in 26.6%. 80% and 53.3% of the patients had abnormal ECG and 2D echocardiography findings, respectively. Six patients had a history of Ventricular tachycardia (40%). LV Ejection fraction was reduced in 12 subjects (80%). Cardiac-MRI showed late gadolinium enhancement in 53.3%. A definitive histopathological diagnosis for sarcoidosis was established in 86.6% (13/15) patients. Of the 15, all satisfied JMHW criteria and WASOG criteria (12 (80%) at least probable category, 3 (20%) possible CS), and 13 (86.6%) met HRS criteria for a diagnosis of CS. Conclusion: In a cohort of 375 patients with sarcoidosis in a tuberculosis endemic setting, 4% were diagnosed with cardiac sarcoidosis. Histopathological diagnosis may be obtained by sampling from extracardiac sites. JMHW and WASOG criteria perform equally well in TB endemic settings.

AB  - Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of uncertain histogenesis that preferentially involves the abdominal and pelvic cavities. DSRCT mainly develops in adolescent and young adults with a strong male predominance; the male to female ratio is 4:1. Ovarian location is exceptional. DSRCT generally develops in the abdomen and have a tendency towards peritoneal spread, with subsequent metastasis to distant lymph nodes, liver and lungs. It is a poorly understood malignancy with a very characteristic morphology, immunophenotype, cytogenetic features, and poor prognosis. This tumor can co-express epithelial, neuronal, and mesenchymal markers. Despite intensive therapy, including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and immunotherapy; the 5-year survival is less than 15%.

AB  - Cut-out or holes are unavoidable features in composites for structural assembly and functionality. To enhance the strength of the unidirectional glass fiber reinforced plastic (UD-GFRP) laminates around the cut-outs, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs) were locally aligned at the periphery of the cut-outs via non-uniform electric field. These multi-scale UD-GFRP composites were fabricated in two configurations based on CNT alignment in parallel and perpendicular directions to the glass fiber orientation. The performance was compared with composites containing randomly oriented MW-CNTs in epoxy matrix and composites without MW-CNTs. The damage evolution was investigated using digital image correlation (DIC) techniques during open hole tensile (OHT) tests. The presence of aligned MW-CNTs around the hole perpendicular to the fiber orientation was able to arrest the pertinent damage modes leading to an increase of the tensile strength by 27% as compared to the control samples fabricated using neat epoxy resin.

AB  - In addition to cancer and diabetes, inflammatory and ROS-related diseases represent one of the major health problems worldwide. Currently, several synthetic drugs are used to reduce oxidative stress; nevertheless, these approaches often have side effects. Therefore, to overcome these issues, the search for alternative therapies has gained importance in recent times. Natural bioactive compounds have represented, and they still do, an important source of drugs with high therapeutic efficacy. In the "synthetic" era, terrestrial and aquatic photosynthetic organisms have been shown to be an essential source of natural compounds, some of which might play a leading role in pharmaceutical drug development. Marine organisms constitute nearly half of the worldwide biodiversity. In the marine environment, algae, seaweeds, and seagrasses are the first reported sources of marine natural products for discovering novel pharmacophores. The algal bioactive compounds are a potential source of novel antioxidant and anticancer (through modulation of the cell cycle, metastasis, and apoptosis) compounds. Secondary metabolites in marine Algae, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, and tannins, could have great therapeutic implications against several diseases. In this context, this review focuses on the diversity of functional compounds extracted from algae and their potential beneficial effects in fighting cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory diseases.

AB  - Introduction The rising economic burden of cancer on healthcare system and patients in India has led to the increased demand for evidence in order to inform policy decisions such as drug price regulation, setting reimbursement package rates under publicly financed health insurance schemes and prioritising available resources to maximise value of investments in health. Economic evaluations are an integral component of this important evidence. Lack of existing evidence on healthcare costs and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) makes conducting economic evaluations a very challenging task. Therefore, it is imperative to develop a national database for health expenditure and HRQOL for cancer. Methods and analysis The present study proposes to develop a National Cancer Database for Cost and Quality of Life (CaDCQoL) in India. The healthcare costs will be estimated using a patient perspective. A cross-sectional study will be conducted to assess the direct out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE), indirect cost and HRQOL among cancer patients who will be recruited at seven leading cancer centres from six states in India. Mean OOPE and HRQOL scores will be estimated by cancer site, stage of disease and type of treatment. Economic impact of cancer care on household financial risk protection will be assessed by estimating prevalence of catastrophic health expenditures and impoverishment. The national database would serve as a unique open access data repository to derive estimates of cancer-related OOPE and HRQOL. These estimates would be useful in conducting future cost-effectiveness analyses of management strategies for value-based cancer care. Ethics and dissemination Approval was granted by Institutional Ethics Committee vide letter no. PGI/IEC-03/2020-1565 of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India. The study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented to the policymakers at national level.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of axillary ultrasonog-raphy (axUS) and ultrasound-guided pre-operative wire localisation of pre-treatment positive clipped node (CN) for prediction of nodal response to neoadjuvant chemo-therapy (NACT) in node positive breast carcinoma patients. Methods and materials: A prospective study was conducted between June 2018 and August 2020 after Ethics Committee approval. Breast carcinoma patients (cT1- cT4b) with palpable axillary nodes (cN1- cN3) and suitable for NACT were recruited after written informed consent. Single, most suspicious node was biopsied and clipped. Nodal response to NACT was assessed on axUS. Wire localisation of CN was performed prior to axil-lary lymph node dissection (ALND). Diagnostic perfor-mances of axUS and CN excision were assessed. Results: Of the 69 patients evaluated, 32 patients (mean age, 43.5 +/- 11.8 years; females, 31/32 [97%]; pre-menopausal, 18/32 [56.3%]) with metastatic nodes who received NACT were included. Nodal pathological complete response rate was 34.4% (11/32) overall and 70% (7/10) in patients with <2 suspicious nodes on pre- NACT axUS. False-negative rates (FNRs) of axUS and CN excision were 4.8% and 28.6% respectively. Combination of post- NACT axUS and CN excision had an FNR of 4.8% overall and 0% in patients with <2 suspicious nodes on pre- NACT axUS. Conclusion: Combination of AxUS and ultrasound-guided wire localisation of pre-treatment positive CN has high diagnostic accuracy for nodal restaging after NACT in node positive breast cancer patients. Advances in knowledge: Addition of axUS assessment to wire localisation of CN reduces its FNR for detecting residual metastasis after NACT.

AB  - Hemorrhagic complications are uncommon after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage. The presenting features include bleeding through or around the drainage catheter, hematemesis or melena. Diagnosis requires cholangiography, CT angiography or conventional angiography. Minor venous hemorrhage is managed by catheter repositioning, clamping or upgrading to a larger bore catheter. Major vascular injuries require percutaneous or endovascular procedures like embolization or stenting. A complete knowledge of these complications will direct the interventional radiologist to take adequate precautions to reduce their incidence and necessary steps in their management. This review presents and discusses various hemorrhagic complications occurring after percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage along with their treatment options and suggests a detailed algorithm.

AB  - Corpus luteum rupture presenting as acute abdomen is an underdiagnosed condition. Though a self-limiting entity, its differentiation from other causes is essential to prevent unnecessary surgical procedures, The radiologist should be aware of the possibility of a ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst in a female of reproductive age group presenting with pelvic pain and a large amount of haemorrhagic ascites. Imaging characteristically reveals a thick-walled cystic structure in the adnexa with internal echoes, focal discontinuity or irregularity of its wall with haemoperitoneum. While sonography is usually indicative of corpus luteum rupture, cross-sectional imaging (CT/MRI) can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Extracorporeal telescopes (exoscopes) have been the latest addition to the neurosurgeons' armamentarium, acting as a bridge between operating microscopes and endoscopes. However, to the authors' knowledge there are no published preclinical laboratory studies of the accuracy, efficiency, and dexterity of neurosurgical training for the use of 2D or 3D exoscopes compared with microscopes.
   METHODS In a controlled experimental setup, 22 participating neurosurgery residents performed simple (2D) and complex (3D) motor tasks with three visualization tools in alternating sequence: a 2D exoscope, 3D exoscope, and microscope, using a block randomization model based on the neurosurgeons' prior training experience (novice, intermediate, and senior: n = 6, 12, and 4, respectively). Performance scores (PS; including error and efficiency scores) and dexterity scores (DS) were calculated to objectify the accuracy, efficiency, and finesse of task performance. Repeated measures ANOVA analysis was used to compare the PS, DS, and cumulative scores (CS) of candidates using the three visualization aids. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients were generated to quantify intraobserver and interobserver agreement for DS. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the impact of participants' prior training. A postexercise survey was conducted to assess the comfort level (on a 10-point analog scale) of the participants while using each visualization tool for performing the suturing task.
   RESULTS PS, DS, and CS were significantly impacted by the visualization tool utilized for 2D motor tasks (p < 0.001 for each), with the microscope faring better than the 2D exoscope (p = 0.04) or 3D exoscope (p = 0.008). The PS for the 3D object transfer task was significantly influenced by the visualization aid used (p = 0.007), with the microscope and 3D exoscope faring better than the 2D exoscope (p = 0.04 for both). The visualization instrument used significantly affected the DS and CS for the suturing task (p < 0.001 for both), with the microscope again scoring better than the 2D exoscope (p < 0.001) or 3D exoscope (p = 0.005). The impact of the visualization aid was more apparent in participants with a shorter duration of residency (novice, p = 0.03; intermediate, p = 0.0004). Participants also felt the greatest operational comfort while working with a microscope, 3D exoscope, and 2D exoscope, in that order (p < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS Compared with 3D and 2D exoscopes, an operating microscope provides better dexterity and performance and a greater operational comfort level for neurosurgeons while they are performing 2D or 3D motor tasks. For performing complex 3D motor tasks, 3D exoscopes offer selective advantages in dexterity, performance, and operational comfort level over 2D exoscopes. The relative impact of visualization aids on surgical proficiency gradually weakens as the participants' residency duration increases.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is an international crisis placing tremendous strain on medical systems around the world. Like other specialties, neuroanesthesiology has been adversely affected and training programs have had to quickly adapt to the constantly changing environment. Methods: An email-based survey was used to evaluate the effects of the pandemic on clinical workflow, clinical training, education, and trainee well-being. The impact of the International Council on Perioperative Neuroscience Training (ICPNT) accreditation was also assessed. Results: Responses were received from 14 program directors (88% response rate) in 10 countries and from 36 fellows in these programs. Clinical training was adversely affected because of the cancellation of elective neurosurgery and other changes in case workflow, the introduction of modified airway and other protocols, and redeployment of trainees to other sites. To address educational demands, most programs utilized online platforms to organize clinical discussions, journal clubs, and provide safety training modules. Several initiatives were introduced to support trainee well-being during the pandemic. Feelings of isolation and despair among trainees varied from 2 to 8 (on a scale of 1 to 10). Fellows all reported concerns that their clinical training had been adversely affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic because of decreased exposure to elective subspecialty cases and limited opportunities to complete workplace-based assessments and training portfolio requirements. Cancellation of examination preparation courses and delayed examinations were cited as common sources of stress. Programs accredited by the ICPNT reported that international networking and collaboration was beneficial to reduce feelings of isolation during the pandemic. Conclusion: Neuroanesthesia fellowship training program directors introduced innovative ways to maintain clinical training, educational activity and trainee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Breast cancer being major death-leading cancer demands utmost attention. Recently, the next-generation sequencing techniques capable of capturing gene expression data have been used successfully for the detection of breast cancer. The proposed work identifies a small set of biomarker genes for molecular stratification of breast cancer subtypes. In this work, we have proposed Triphasic DeepBRCA - a novel deep learning framework, for breast cancer subtype detection and biomarker discovery. In the first phase, an autoencoder is used for extracting a compact representation of the gene expression data which is provided as an input to a supervised feed-forward neural network for classification of breast cancer subtypes in the second phase. In the third phase, the proposed Biomarker Gene Discovery Algorithm (BGDA) leverages the neural network classifier of the second phase to estimate the relevance of various genes. Next, Wilcoxon rank-sum test with False Discovery Rate (FDR) Correction is applied to identify the most differentiating genes. Using the TCGA BRCA RNASeq data, the proposed framework enabled us to discover a set of 54 most-variant genes. Using 10-fold cross-validation, we obtained a mean accuracy of 0.899 +/- 0.04 at 95% confidence interval. We also validated our results on METABRIC dataset. Gene Set Analysis revealed statistically enriched pathways. Heatmap of the expression levels and t-SNE visualization reveals that these genes have an aggregated capability to distinguish amongst the different breast cancer subtypes. Further, the prognostic evaluation using 54 biomarkers revealed that over 30 genes out of 54 are significantly linked to the prognostic outcome.

AB  - Gallbladder cancer is the most common malignancy of the biliary tract. It is also the most aggressive biliary tumor with the shortest median survival duration. Complete surgical resection, the only potentially curative treatment, can be accomplished only in those patients who are diagnosed at an early stage of the disease. Majority (90%) of the patients present at an advanced stage and the management involves a multidisciplinary approach. The role of imaging in gallbladder cancer cannot be overemphasized. Imaging is crucial not only in detecting, staging, and planning management but also in guiding radiological interventions. This article discusses the role of a radiologist in the diagnosis and management of gallbladder cancer.

AB  - Background: All-trans retinoic acid (RA) plays a crucial role in promoting Foxp3(+) Treg generation while reciprocally inhibiting Th1/Th17 generation. Our previous research highlighted that in the face of inflammatory conditions, RA plays a contrary role where it aggravates intestinal inflammation by promoting interferon (IFN) gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 differentiation in vitro.
   Methods: In this study we translated our in vitro results into a clinical setting where we estimated mucosal and serum RA levels along with the immunophenotypic profile (IL-17, IFN gamma, Foxp3, IL-10) in adaptive (CD4, CD8) and innate-like T cells (mucosa] associated invariant T cells and gamma 8 T cells) in patients with ulcerative colitis in remission or with active inflammation.
   Results: This is the first study to estimate RA levels in the human gut and shows that patients with active disease had increased mucosal RA levels as compared with patients in remission (4.0 vs 2.5 ng/mL; P < 0.01) and control patients (3.4 vs 0.8 ng/mL; P < 0.0001). This effect was accompanied by significantly elevated IL-17 and IFN gamma in tissue CD4(+), CD8(+), mucosal associated invariant T+ cells, and gamma delta(+) T cells. Moreover, the raised RA levels in patients with active disease showed a positive correlation with proinflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IFN gamma) and a negative correlation with IL-10. We also found that RA negatively correlated with IL-9, thereby reinstating our previous finding that RA inhibits Th9 differentiation.
   Conclusions: These data confirm our previous in vitro results that in the presence of inflammation, RA plays a crucial role in maintaining gut inflammation by upregulating proinflammatory markers.

AB  - Background: Cognition is the ability of a person to think, remember, and interconnect ideas from various dimensions to strive for solutions. Cognitive defects accompany all forms of dementia and the decline in cognition is a most feared aspect. Mild cognitive impairment is considered as a transitional phase and the progressive loss in cognition can finally lead to Alzheimer's disease.
   New Method: In this study, we demonstrated a novel method based on nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) technique to directly correlate salivary exosomes concentration with the progression of cognitive impairment (CI) in Alzheimer's disease (AD).This could open up the possibility for an early and cost-effective screening of Alzheimer's disease.
   Results: Using our novel method, the total salivary exosomes concentration was measured by NTA technique, followed by validation of key exosomal cargo proteins through an automated western blot analyzer. We observed significant differences in salivary exosomes concentration among the groups of cognitively impaired and Alzheimer's disease patients (p = 0.0023) compared to the healthy control cohort. The method was validated through CD63 (exosomes surface marker) fluorescent antibody based quantification, which yielded a similar outcome (p = 0.0286). We further corroborated our findings with the expression level of oligomeric amyloid-beta, phosphorylated-tau protein from salivary exosomes. The A beta oligomer/fibril abundance (p = 0.0291), phospho-tau (p = 0.0325) and A beta protein abundance (p = 0.0198) was significantly higher in Alzheimer's and cognitively impaired patients in comparison to the healthy controls.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): There are few molecular biomarkers available to differentiate between various stages of cognitive impairment. Moreover, the current methodologies utilizing the few biomarkers available are either invasive or expensive; also, for a patient with mild cognitive complains, it is impractical to use these as a screening tool.
   Conclusion: Our initial results indicate that the salivary exosomes concentration based on the nano-tracking technique has the potential to be used as a cost-effective screening method for early disease detection.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) remains to be one of the biggest burdens on healthcare systems and serves as a leading cause of disability and death. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is among the most common of such disorders, followed by Parkinson's disease (PD). The basic molecular details of disease initiation and pathology are still under research. Only recently, the role of exosomes has been linked to the initiation and progression of these neurodegenerative diseases. Exosomes are small bilipid layer enclosed extracellular vesicles, which were once considered as a cellular waste and functionless. These nano-vesicles of 30-150 nm in diameter carry specific proteins, lipids, functional mRNAs, and high amounts of non-coding RNAs (miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs). As the exosomes content is known to vary as per their originating and recipient cells, these vesicles can be utilized as a diagnostic biomarker for early disease detection. Here we review exosomes, their biogenesis, composition, and role in neurodegenerative diseases. We have also provided details for their characterization through an array of available techniques. Their updated role in neurodegenerative disease pathology is also discussed. Finally, we have shed light on a novel field of salivary exosomes as a potential candidate for early diagnosis in neurodegenerative diseases and compared the biomarkers of salivary exosomes with other blood/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) based exosomes within these neurological ailments.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is an important factor in the development and progression of heart failure (HF). The prevalence of OSA is higher in patients with HF than in the general population. We sought to test the hypothesis that OSA severity was predictive of ventricular function and cardiac injury [as assessed by high-sensitivity cardiac troponin [(hs-cTnI)].
   Methods: A total of 60 patients were recruited after evaluation for sleep disturbances using the Jenkins Sleep Questionnaire (JSQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Subsequently, they underwent polysomnography thus confirming the diagnosis of OSA and were equally divided into three groups according to OSA severity grade. Following polysomnography, the next morning patients underwent venous blood sampling and echocardiography.
   Results: We observed a statistically significant association (P = 0.009) between diastolic dysfunction grades and severity grades of OSA. All the three diastolic dysfunction variables E/A ratio, deceleration time and E/e' ratio had a significant association(P < 0.05) with severity grades of OSA. There was a marginally significant positive correlation (p = 0.3244, p = 0.04) between AHI events per hour and mitral E/e' ratio. There was a statistically significant association(P < 0.001) between hs-cTnI value among different severity grades of OSA.
   Conclusions: Here in our study, we found OSA a potential risk factor for development of myocardial injury and diastolic dysfunction. Severe grades of OSA are associated with higher grades of diastolic dysfunction and circulating levels of hs-cTnI. These data are consistent with the notion of a vicious cycle of frequent apnoea's or hypoxemia and recurrent myocardial injury, which could increase the risk of heart failure especially diastolic dysfunction in OSA.

TI  - Utility of first order MRI-Texture analysis parameters in the prediction of histologic grade and muscle invasion in urinary bladder cancer: a preliminary study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
KW  - FEATURES
AB  - Objective: To explore the utility of first-order MRI-texture analysis (TA) parameters in predicting histologic grade and muscle invasion in urinary bladder cancer (UBC).
   Methods: After ethical clearance, 40 patients with UBC, who were imaged on a 3.0-Tesla scanner, were retrospectively included. Using the TexRAD (TM) platform, two readers placed freehand ROI on the sections demonstrating the largest dimension of the tumor, evaluating only one tumor per patient. Interobserver reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Mann-Whitney U test and ROC curve analysis were used to identify statistical significance and select parameters with high class separation capacity (AUC >0.8), respectively. Pearson's test was used to identify redundancy in the results.
   Results: All texture parameters showed excellent ICC. The best parameters in differentiating high and low-grade tumors were mean/mean of positive pixels (MPP) at SSF 0 (AUC: 0.897) and kurtosis at SSF 5 (AUC: 0.828) on the ADC images. In differentiating muscle invasive from non-muscle invasive tumors, mean/PP at SSF 0 on the ADC images showed AUC >0.8; however, this finding resulted from the confounding effect of high-grade histology on the ADC values of muscle invasive tumors.
   Conclusion: MRI-TA generated few parameters which were reproducible and useful in predicting histologic grade. No independent parameters predicted muscle invasion.
   Advances in knowledge: There is lacuna in the literature concerning the role of MRI-TA in the prediction of histologic grade and muscle invasion in UBC. Our study generated a few first-order parameters which were useful in predicting high-grade histology.

AB  - Background Existing scores to identify children at risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality lack broad external validation. Our objective was to externally validate three such risk scores.
   Methods We applied the Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) for HIV-negative children, the RISC-Malawi, and the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) scores to hospitalized children in the Pneumonia REsearch Partnerships to Assess WHO REcommendations (PREPARE) data set. The PREPARE data set includes pooled data from 41 studies on pediatric pneumonia from across the world. We calculated test characteristics and the area under the curve (AUC) for each of these clinical prediction rules.
   Results The RISC score for HIV-negative children was applied to 3574 children 0-24 months and demonstrated poor discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.58-0.73) in the identification of children at risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. The RISC-Malawi score had fair discriminatory value (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.74-0.77) among 17 864 children 2-59 months. The PERCH score was applied to 732 children 1-59 months and also demonstrated poor discriminatory value (AUC = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.37-0.73).
   Conclusions In a large external application of the RISC, RISC-Malawi, and PERCH scores, a substantial number of children were misclassified for their risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality. Although pneumonia risk scores have performed well among the cohorts in which they were derived, their performance diminished when externally applied. A generalizable risk assessment tool with higher sensitivity and specificity to identify children at risk of hospitalized pneumonia-related mortality may be needed. Such a generalizable risk assessment tool would need context-specific validation prior to implementation in that setting.

TI  - Outcome of Stock Total Joint Replacement With Fat Grafting in Adult Temporomandibular Joint Ankylosis Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
AB  - Purpose: Adult temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) lacks a uniform management protocol. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of stock total joint replacement (TJR) along with fat grafting around the joint in adult TMJA patients. Specific aim was to find out whether TJR can be a definitive management for adult TMJA.
   Methods: The investigators implemented a prospective study on adult TMJA patients treated with ostearthrectomy of ankylosis and stock temporomandibular joint (TMJ) TJR with fat grafting. Concomitant orthognathic correction of facial asymmetry was performed in some unilateral cases. Follow-up was carried out at regular intervals for assessing primary outcome variable of maximal incisal opening (MIO) and reankylosis. Secondary outcome variable included demographic data, etiology, duration of ankylosis (DOA), correlation between DOA and preoperative and postoperative MIO, occlusion and complications of hemorrhage, facial nerve paresis, periprosthetic joint infection, dislocation, and implant failure.
   Results: The study sample was composed of 41 patients (54 joints) (bilateral, n = 13; unilateral, n = 28 [right side, n = 12; left side, n = 16]). The number of recurrent cases was 15. Trauma as etiology of ankylosis was seen inn = 30 (73.2%), infection inn = 7 (17.1%), unknown in n = 3 (7.3%), and ankylosing spondylitis in n = 1 (2.4%) cases. Mean DOA was 11.95 years. Paired t test revealed a statistically significant difference between preoperative and follow-up MIO (P < .001). None of the cases showed reankylosis in the followup period. Pearson correlation revealed statistically negative correlation between DOA and postoperative MIO.
   Conclusions: The result of this study suggests that stock TMJ TJR along with fat grafting around the joints provides adequate mouth opening without any sign and symptoms of reankylosis. Stock TMJ TJR with fat grafting can be considered as a definitive treatment modality in adult TMJA with minimum comorbidity. (C) 2020 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Since its inception in 1905, keratoplasty techniques have continuously evolved. Shaped keratoplasty procedures have allowed corneal surgeons to use complex graft-host junctions and non-circular graft designs to optimise wound strength and healing, facilitate early suture removal and expedite visual rehabilitation. While this was initially limited to penetrating procedures, shaped lamellar keratoplasty techniques have since emerged. Furthermore, the arrival of femtosecond laser has dramatically increased the range of graft designs available to surgeons, due to the technology's ability to precisely cut complex wound edges. This review describes the broad range of shaped keratoplasty grafts currently available and elaborates on their respective advantages and disadvantages in relation to conventional keratoplasty.

AB  - Background and objectives: To assess the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) on different aspects of chest compression (CC) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we conducted this study.
   Methods: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science from inception to June-6, 2020, limiting to the studies that reported the comparison of the effectiveness of CC in terms of CC rate, CC depth, the proportion of adequate CC rate, the proportion of adequate CC depth or proportion of adequate recoil; in study arms with or without PPE. Risk of bias was assessed by the ROB-2 and ROBINS-I tool. Quantitative data synthesis was done using the generic inverse variance method and the fixed-effects model.
   Results: Five simulation-based studies were finally included. A Significant decrease in CC rate (SMD: -0.28, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.10) and CC depth (SMD: -0.26, 95%CI: -0.44 to -0.07) were observed in the PPE arm as compared to the no-PPE arm. The difference in CC rate was more prominently seen in adult CPR than in paediatric CPR. Without PPE, the proportion of adequate CC rate delivered was 0.74, which reduced significantly to 0.60 after use of PPE (p - 0.035). Similarly, the proportion of adequate CC depth was significantly lesser (p - 0.001) in PPE arm (0.55), as compared to that of the no-PPE arm (0.78).
   Conclusion: The use of PPE compromises the quality of CC during CPR significantly, and newer ways to deliver chest compression has to be investigated. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - NO (nitric oxide) is an important regulator of neutrophil functions and has a key role in diverse pathophysiological conditions. NO production by nitric oxide synthases (NOS) is under tight control at transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels including interactions with heterologous proteins owing to its potent chemical reactivity and high diffusibility; this limits toxicity to other cellular components and promotes signaling specificity. The protein-protein interactions govern the activity and spatial distribution of NOS isoform to regulatory proteins and to their intended targets. In comparison with the vast literature available for endothelial, macrophages, and neuronal cells, demonstrating neuronal NOS (nNOS) interaction with other proteins through the PDZ domain, neutrophil nNOS, however, remains unexplored. Neutrophil's key role in both physiological and pathological conditions necessitates the need for further studies in delineating the NOS mediated NO modulations in signaling pathways operational in them. nNOS has been linked to depression, schizophrenia, and Parkinson's disease, suggesting the importance of exploring nNOS/NO-mediated neutrophil physiology in relation to such neuronal disorders. The review thus presents the scenario of neutrophil nNOS from the genetics to the functional level, including protein-protein interactions governing its intracellular sequestration in diverse cell types, besides speculating possible regulation in neutrophils and also addressing their clinical implications.

AB  - Objectives:
   To evaluate the functional outcomes in critically ill children with severe sepsis using the Pediatric Overall Performance Category scale and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scale and to evaluate the risk factors for "worse outcomes."
   Design:
   Prospective observational cohort study.
   Setting:
   Tertiary care PICU from September 2017 to October 2019.
   Patients:
   One hundred twenty-one children with severe sepsis, 2 months to 17 years old, admitted to PICU.
   Interventions:
   None.
   Measurements and Main Results:
   Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores were recorded at admission, PICU discharge, at 3 months and 1 year after discharge. "New disability" was defined as Pediatric Overall Performance Category and Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score change "from baseline score" by greater than or equal to 1 category. Risk factors for "worse outcomes" (defined as "death" or "new disability") were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. At admission, 33% (n = 39) had mild to moderate "overall disability" (Pediatric Overall Performance Category) and 26% (n = 32) had mild to moderate "cognitive disability" (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category). At PICU discharge (n = 89 children), 50.5% (n = 45) had "new disability" in overall function (Pediatric Overall Performance Category scores) and 28% (n = 25) had "new disability" in cognitive function (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category scores). At 3 months follow-up (n = 85 children), "new disability" at PICU discharge improved in 65% (n = 28/43) and 50% (n = 12/24) of those with "overall disability" (Pediatric Overall Performance Category) and "cognitive disability" (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category), respectively. At 1-year follow-up (n = 84 children), only 5% (n = 2/43) had residual "new disability" in overall function (Pediatric Overall Performance Category) and 14% (n = 3/21) had residual "new disability" in cognitive function. PICU mortality was 26% (n = 32). The proportion with "worse outcomes" was 64% (n = 77). Risk factors for worse outcomes on univariate analysis included higher Pediatric Index of Mortality-3 scores, day 1 pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the ICU stay, and treatments received such as ventilation and Vasoactive-Inotrope Score. On multivariate analysis, only day 1 pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the ICU stay were found to be statistically significant.
   Conclusions:
   Children with severe sepsis had significant "new onset" mild to moderate functional disability at PICU discharge, and most of these children recovered within 1 year after PICU discharge. Day 1 pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and patient receiving cardiopulmonary resuscitation during the ICU stay were found to be the significant risk factors of "worse outcomes."

AB  - Background: Thermal-responsive self-assembled elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based nanoparticles are an emerging platform for controlled delivery of therapeutic peptides, proteins and small molecular drugs. The antitumor effect of bioengineered chimeric poly peptide AP1-ELP-KLAK containing an interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) targeting peptide and pro-apoptotic peptide (KLAKLAK) was evaluated in glioblastoma (GBM) in vitro and in vivo.
   Methods and Results: Herein, the therapeutic effect of AP1-ELP-KLAK was tested in advanced, and less curable glioblastoma cells with higher expression of IL-4R. Glioblastoma cell lines stably expressing different reporter systems i.e., caspase-3 sensor (surrogate marker for cellular apoptosis) or effluc/enhanced firefly luciferase (cellular viability) were established to measure cell death non-invasively. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of D54/effluc and U97MG/effluc treated with AP1-ELP-KLAK exhibited higher cell death up to 2-3-fold than the control. Treatment with AP1-ELP-KLAK resulted in time-dependent increase of caspase-3 sensor BLI activity in D54/C cells and D54/C tumor-bearing mice. Intravenous injection of AP1-ELP-KLAK dramatically reduced tumor growth by inducing cellular apoptosis in D54/effluc tumor-bearing mice. Further, the immuno-histological examination of the excised tumor tissue confirmed the presence of apoptotic cells as well as caspase-3 activation.
   Conclusion: Collectively, AP1-ELP-KLAK effectively induced cellular apoptosis of glioblastoma cells and non-invasive imaging provides a window for real-time monitoring of antitumor effect with the provision of improving therapeutic efficacy in a glioblastoma mice model.

AB  - Introduction: Circulating plasma proteins play an important role in various diseases, and analysis of the plasma proteome has led to the discovery of various disease biomarkers. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disease, mostly affecting people of older age. OA typically starts as a focal disease (in a single compartment, typically treated with unicompartmental knee replacement), and then progresses to the other compartments (if not treated in time, typically treated with total knee replacement). For this, identification of differential proteins was carried out in plasma samples of OA cases and compared with healthy controls. The aim of this study was to identify circulatory differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in knee-OA patients undergoing total knee replacement or unicompartmental knee replacement compared to healthy controls and assess their role, in order to have better understanding of the etiology behind OA pathophysiology.
   Methods: DEPs were identified with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Validation of DEPs was carried out using Western blot and ELISA. Posttranslational modifications were checked after running native gel using purified protein from patients, followed by detection of autoantibodies.
   Results: In total, 52 DEPs were identified, among which 45 were distinct DEPs. Haptoglobin (Hp) was identified as one of the most significantly upregulated proteins in OA (P=0.005) identified by both 2DE and iTRAQ. Decreased levels of Hp tetramers and increased levels of autoantibodies against Hp beta were observed in OA plasma.
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that poor clearance of free hemoglobin and low levels of Hp tetramers may be associated with OA pathogenesis and inflammation.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - RESIDENCY SELECTION
AB  - Medical education and assessment processes in India are expected to undergo a paradigm shift with the introduction of the National Medical Commission Act, 2019. The Government of India intends to introduce a national exit test (NEXT) which is supposed to act as a single examination for graduation from medical school, granting licence to practice modern medicine, and allocating postgraduate residencies. As the nature, scope and stakes of these are different, various options regarding the content and conduct of the examination require careful consideration. We explore the options for implementation of this examination on a national scale. These options include theoretical (multiple assessment methods) with clinical examinations, multiple-choice question (MCQ)-based examination with separate clinical examination, only an MCQ-based examination, and multistep examination including screening followed by mixed assessment methods and clinical evaluation. We discuss the possible strengths and challenges of different options of implementing NEXT, and the caveats of the options.

AB  - Background: Though a large number of pregnant females have been affected by COVID-19, there is a dearth of information on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on trophoblast function. We explored in silico, the potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and proteins involved in the key functions of placenta.
   Methods: Human proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins were identified by Gordon et al. (2020). Genes that are upregulated in trophoblast sub-types and stages were obtained by gene-expression data from NCBI-GEO and by text-mining. Genes altered in pathological states like pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus were also identified. Genes crucial in placental functions thus identified were compared to the SARS-CoV-2 inter-actome for overlaps. Proteins recurring across multiple study scenarios were analyzed using text mining and network analysis for their biological functions.
   Results: The entry receptors for SARS-CoV-2 - ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in placenta. Other proteins that interact with SARS-CoV-2 like LOX, Fibulins-2 and 5, NUP98, GDF15, RBX1, CUL3, HMOX1, PLAT, MFGE8, and MRPs are vital in placental functions like tmphoblast invasion and migration, syncytium formation, differentiation, and implantation. TLE3, expressed across first trimester placental tissues and cell lines, is involved in formation of placental vasculature, and is important in SARS-CoV (2003) budding and exit from the cells by COPI vesicles.
   Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 can potentially interact with proteins having crucial roles in the placental function. Whether these potential interactions identified in silico have effects on trophoblast functions in biological settings needs to be addressed by further in vitro and clinical studies.

AB  - Purpose of study Ultrasound (US) for lumbar puncture has seen the most success in obese patients and in patients with difficult to palpate landmarks. We aimed to elucidate the advantage of the use of routine US for performing lumbar punctures over the traditional landmark method.
   Study design This was a prospective study with consecutive sampling with a sample size of convenience. Three residents were chosen to perform the lumbar punctures after a training session. Patients were assigned to either the US group or the landmark group. The outcomes studied were number of attempts at needle insertion, patient and physician anxiety, pain experienced, time to procedure, number of traumatic attempts and the difficulties faced during the procedure.
   Results A total of 77 patients were included in this study, of which 36 patients (46.8%) underwent landmark-based lumbar puncture and 41 (53.2%) underwent US-guided lumbar puncture. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups among the following characteristics: number of attempts to a successful procedure, number of traumatic punctures, procedure time, preprocedure anxiety of the participants and physicians and pain score rating of the procedure.
   Conclusion There was no significant difference between the landmark method and US-guided method for performing lumbar puncture in the number of successful attempts, number of traumatic punctures, procedure time and pain during the procedure. Further studies are required to elucidate the advantage of the use of ultrasonography in subsets of the population such as the low body mass index population.

AB  - Psychosis is a state of altered behavior and mentation, and it is rarely reported in preschool children. Isoniazid is a commonly used drug in the treatment and prophylaxis of tuberculosis. It may cause psychosis in overdose but rarely with usual recommended doses. We report a case of drug-induced psychosis secondary to isoniazid intake in a 3-year-old child. She developed intermittent abnormal behavior for 2 weeks after intake of isoniazid. Drug-induced psychosis was a possibility, and the responsible drug was stopped. She improved following the withdrawal of isoniazid.

TI  - Low-dose radiation therapy for COVID-19 pneumonia: a pilot study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
KW  - ROENTGEN THERAPY
AB  - Objectives: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as pandemic in March 2020. Currently there is no specific effective treatment for COVID-19. The major cause of death in COVID-19 is severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure. Radiation in low doses (<100 cGy) has been known for its anti-inflammatory effect and therefore, low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) to lungs can potentially mitigate the severity of pneumonia and reduce mortality. We conducted a pilot trial to study the feasibility and clinical efficacy of LDRT to lungs in the management of patients with COVID-19.
   Methods: From June to Aug 2020, we enrolled 10 patients with COVID-19 having moderate to severe risk disease [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of >= 5]. Patients were treated as per the standard COVID-19 management guidelines along with LDRT to both lungs with a dose of 70cGy in single fraction. Response assessment was done based on the clinical parameters using the NEWS.
   Results: All patients completed the prescribed treatment. Nine patients had complete clinical recovery mostly within a period ranging from 3 to 7 days. One patient, who was a known hypertensive, showed clinical deterioration and died 24 days after LDRT. No patients showed the signs of acute radiation toxicity.
   Conclusion: The results of our pilot study suggest that LDRT is feasible in COVID-19 patients having moderate to severe disease. Its clinical efficacy may be tested by conducting randomized controlled trials.
   Advances in knowledge: LDRT has shown promising results in COVID-19 pneumonia and should be researched further through randomized controlled trials.

AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluate the role of microscope-integrated intraoperative optical coherence tomography (i-OCT) in pediatric keratoplasty.
   Design: Combined prospective and retrospective, comparative, interventional study conducted at the Dr Rajendra Prasad Center for Ophthalmic Sciences in New Dehli, India.
   Methods: Seventy-five children <= 16 years of age undergoing planned keratoplasty were divided into 2 groups and compared regarding intraoperative course and postoperative outcome. In group 1 (prospective group, n = 56), preoperative anterior segment visualization was performed clinically, with ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and iOCT and keratoplasty was commenced under i-OCT microscope. In group 2 (retrospective group, n = 19), a conventional microscope was used during keratoplasty.
   Results: In group 1, i-OCT, UBM, and clinical examination detected retrocorneal membrane in 10%, 7.5%, and 5% (P =.005), iris adhesions in 62.5%, 57.5%, and 20% (P =.02), iris stump in aniridia 15%, 10%, and 0% (P =.001), shallow central anterior chamber in 22.5%, 22.5%, and 7.5% (P =.003), and shallow peripheral anterior chamber in 65%, 60%, and 17.5% (P =.004) of children, respectively. The use of i-OCT affected intraoperative surgeon decision making in 45% and 33% of cases of anterior and posterior lamellar keratoplasty, respectively. During penetrating keratoplasty, concomitant intraoperative procedures were higher in group 1 than in group 2, namely synechiolysis (19/40 vs 2/15; P =.1), pupilloplasty (4/40 vs 0/15; P =.02), lens extraction (4/40 vs 1/15; P =.5), and anterior vitrectomy (2/40 vs 1/15; P =.4). Postoperative secondary interventions were lower (P =.04) in group 1 (48.21% vs 94.74%).
   Conclusions: Anterior segment imaging with i-OCT and UBMimmediately before surgery improves the surgi- cal planning of children with corneal opacities. In addition, the use of i-OCT refines intraoperative steps, thereby optimizing the postoperative outcome of pediatric keratoplasty. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In these times of despair when a nano-sized organism, the SARS-CoV-2, has rendered the human race helpless, made the global health status decline, and drowned the world economy, a ray of hope comes from another nano-sized particle, the exosome. The potential of mesenchymal stem cells has already been established in COVID-19; however, cell-based therapy has its risks. We thereby propose cell-free therapy using stem cells-derived exosomes to fight against COVID-19, as they can be a game-changer owing to their immunomodulatory nature, which combats the cytokine storm characterizing this disease, and their practical efficiency, which will realistically aid large access to therapy worldwide.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress plays a major role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, and thus, antioxidant glutathione (GSH) has been actively investigated in mitigating the oxidative load. Significant hippocampal GSH depletion has been correlated with cognitive impairment in AD. Furthermore, postmortem studies indicated alterations in cellular-energy metabolism and hippocampal pH change toward alkalinity in AD.
   Objective: Concurrent analysis of hippocampal GSH and pH interplay in vivo on the same individual is quite unclear and hence requires investigation to understand the pathological events in AD.
   Methods: Total 39 healthy old (HO), 22 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 37ADpatients were recruited for hippocampal GSH using H-1-MRS MEGA-PRESS and pH using 2D P-31-MRSI with dual tuned ((1)H(/3)1P) transmit/receive volume head coil on 3T-Philips scanner. All MRS data processing using KALPANA package and statistical analysis were performed MedCalc, respectively and NINS-STAT package.
   Results: Significant GSH depletion in the left and right hippocampus (LH and RH) among MCI and AD study groups as compared to HO was observed, whereas pH increased significantly in the LH region between HO and AD. Hippocampal GSH level negatively correlated with pH in both patient groups. The ROC analysis on the combined effect of GSH and pH in both hippocampal regions give accuracy for MCI (LH: 78.27%; RH: 86.96%) and AD (LH: 88%; RH: 78.26%) groups differentiating from HO.
   Conclusion: Outcomes from this study provide further insights to metabolic alterations in terms of concurrent assessment of hippocampal GSH and pH levels in AD pathogenesis, aiding in early diagnosis of MCI and AD.

AB  - Objective People with chronic conditions are known to be vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to describe patients' lived experiences, challenges faced by people with chronic conditions, their coping strategies, and the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, setting and participants We conducted a qualitative study using a syndemic framework to understand the patients' experiences of chronic disease care, challenges faced during the lockdown, their coping strategies and mitigators during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of socioecological and biological factors. A diverse sample of 41 participants with chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases) from four sites (Delhi, Haryana, Vizag and Chennai) in India participated in semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, anonymised and coded using MAXQDA software. We used the framework method to qualitatively analyse the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on health, social and economic well-being. Results Participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were categorised into four themes: challenges faced during the lockdown, experiences of the participants diagnosed with COVID-19, preventive measures taken and lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A subgroup of participants faced difficulties in accessing healthcare while a few reported using teleconsultations. Most participants reported adverse economic impact of the pandemic which led to higher reporting of anxiety and stress. Participants who tested COVID-19 positive reported experiencing discrimination and stigma from neighbours. All participants reported taking essential preventive measures. Conclusion People with chronic conditions experienced a confluence (reciprocal effect) of COVID-19 pandemic and chronic diseases in the context of difficulty in accessing healthcare, sedentary lifestyle and increased stress and anxiety. Patients' lived experiences during the pandemic provide important insights to inform effective transition to a mixed realm of online consultations and 'distanced' physical clinic visits.

AB  - Background and aims: Apolipoprotein B (apoB) integrates and extends the information from the conventional measures of atherogenic cholesterol and triglyceride. To illustrate how apoB could simplify and improve the management of dyslipoproteinemia, we compared conventional lipid markers and apoB in a sample of Americans and Asian Indians.
   Methods: Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (11,778 participants, 2009-2010, 2011-2012), and the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) cohort study in Delhi, India (4244 participants), 2011 were evaluated. We compared means and distributions of plasma lipids, and apo B using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: The plasma lipid profile differed between Asian Indians and Americans. Plasma triglycerides were greater, but HDL-C lower in Asian Indians than in Americans. By contrast, total cholesterol, non-HDL-C, and LDL-C were all significantly higher in Americans than Asian Indians. However, apoB was significantly higher in Asian Indians than Americans. The LDL-C/apoB ratio and the non-HDL-C/apoB ratio were both significantly lower in Asian Indians than Americans.
   Conclusion: Whether Americans or Asian Indians are at higher risk from apoB lipoproteins cannot be determined based on their lipid levels because the information from lipids cannot be integrated. ApoB, however, integrates and extends the information from triglycerides and cholesterol. Replacing the conventional lipid panel with apoB for routine follow ups could simultaneously simplify and improve clinical care.

AB  - Background Immune checkpoint blockade strategies have gained attention in the treatment/prognosis of cancers by targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway alone or in combination with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) blockade and are currently in clinical trials. The present study investigated the expression of the PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, CD4 and CD8 proteins and their prognostic value in the tumour microenvironment of sebaceous gland carcinoma (SGC).
   Methods The expression levels of PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, CD4 and CD8 proteins were assessed in 52 cases of SGC by immunohistochemistry and validated by western blotting. mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the correlation of protein expression with clinicopathological parameters and disease-free survival.
   Results The expression of PD-L1 was found to be higher in tumour cells than in stromal cells. In univariate analysis, the expression of PD-1 in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (tPD-1) and PD-L1 in tumour cells was associated with reduced disease-free survival, whereas PD-L1 expression in stromal lymphocyte infiltration (sPD-L1) was associated with the increased survival of patients (p<0.05). However, by multivariate analysis, the expression of tPD-1 was found to be an independent prognostic factor for poor survival.
   Conclusion Our study highlights the prognostic outcome of PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression in cells of tumour-stromal compartments. These results indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway mediates important interactions within the tumour microenvironment in SGC.

AB  - Objectives Evaluation of remdesivir, an RNA polymerase inhibitor, for effectiveness in adults with COVID-19. Data sources Electronic search for eligible articles of PubMed, Cochrane Central and clinicaltrials.gov was performed on 20 September 2020. Participants and study eligibility criteria Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy of remdesivir in COVID-19 were included for meta-analysis. Interventions Remdesivir was compared with standard of care. Primary and secondary outcomes Primary outcome was mortality and secondary outcomes were time to clinical improvement and safety outcomes like serious adverse events, respiratory failure. Study appraisal and synthesis methods Data synthesis was done with Cochrane review manager 5 (RevMan) V.5.3. Cochrane risk of bias V.2.0 tool was used for methodological quality assessment. The GRADE pro GDT was applied for overall quality of evidence. Results 52 RCTs were screened and 4 studies were included in analysis, with total of 7324 patients. No mortality benefit was observed with remdesivir versus control group (OR=0.92 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.07), p=0.30, moderate quality evidence). Significantly higher rates of clinical improvement (OR=1.52 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.87), p<0.0001, low quality) and faster time to clinical improvement (HR=1.28 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.46), p=0.0002, very low quality) was observed with remdesivir versus control group. Significant decrease was found in the risk of serious adverse events (RR=0.75 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.90), p=0.0003, low quality); however, no difference was found in the risk of respiratory failure (RR=0.85 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.77), p=0.67, very low quality evidence) with remdesivir. Conclusions As per the evidence from current review, remdesivir has shown no mortality benefit (moderate quality evidence) in the treatment of COVID-19. From a cost-benefit perspective, it is our personal opinion that it should not be recommended for use, especially in low and lower middle income countries.

AB  - Introduction
   The primary aim of the National Institute of Health Research-funded global health research group, Warwick-India-Canada (WIC), is to reduce the burden of psychotic disorders in India. India has a large pool of undetected and untreated patients with psychosis and a treatment gap exceeding 75%. Evidence-based packages of care have been piloted, but delivery of treatments still remains a challenge. Even when patients access treatment, there is minimal to no continuity of care. The overarching ambition of WIC programme is to improve patient outcomes through (1) developing culturally tailored clinical interventions, (2) early identification and timely treatment of individuals with mental illness and (3) improving access to care by exploiting the potential of digital technologies.
   Methods and analysis
   This multicentre, multicomponent research programme, comprising five work packages and two cross-cutting themes, is being conducted at two sites in India: Schizophrenia Research Foundation, Chennai (South India) and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi (North India). WIC will (1) develop and evaluate evidence-informed interventions for early and first-episode psychosis; (2) determine pathways of care for early psychosis; (3) investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of community care models, including digital and mobile technologies; (4) develop strategies to reduce the burden of mental illnesses among youth; (5) assess the economic burden of psychosis on patients and their carers; and (6) determine the feasibility of an early intervention in psychosis programme in India.
   Ethics and dissemination
   This study was approved by the University of Warwick's Biomedical and Scientific Research Ethics Committee (reference: REGO-2018-2208), Coventry, UK and research ethics committees of all participating organisations. Research findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed scientific publications, presentations at learnt societies and visual media.

AB  - Context: Vulvar carcinoma accounts for 3%-5% of gynecologic malignancies. The past three decades has observed changes in the trends of clinical characteristics and treatment modalities used in managing this disease. Aims: The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinic-pathological characteristics and survival of women with squamous cell carcinoma vulva who underwent primary surgical management. Settings and Design: This was a retrospective observational study. Subjects and Methods: Case records of 30 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of vulva during the period of 2010-2016 were retrospectively reviewed and their clinical profile, treatment details, complications, and survival were analyzed. Statistical Analysis Used: Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, followed by logrank test, was used for survival outcome, and Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess significant risk factors. Results: The mean age of patients was 58 +/- 12.9 years. The most common symptom was growth over vulva (73.3%), itching (63.3%), and nonhealing vulval ulcer (26.6%). The most common site for disease was labia majora. The surgical treatments ranged from wide local excision to radical vulvectomy. Postoperative adjuvant therapy was required for 16 patients. The median (95% confidence interval [CI]) overall survival was 27 (21.7-32.2) months. Five-year survival probability for early-stage disease (I + II) was 49% (95% CI: 12.9, 78.4) and for advanced disease (III + IV) was 24.8% (95% CI: 4.8, 42.6). Lymph node-positive status was found to have a significant impact on survival (hazard ratio of 4.9 [95% CI: 1.15-21.02, P = 0.02]). Conclusions: Despite advances in detection and management modalities, the survival for vulval malignancies has not improved.

AB  - Backgrounds objectives: Chloroquine (CQN) administered as nasal drops has the potential to achieve much greater local tissue levels than with oral/systemic administration. This trial was undertaken to study the efficacy and safety profile of topical nasal administration of CQN drops in reducing viral load and preventing clinical progression in early COVID-19 infection.
   Methods: This randomized clinical trial was done with a sample size of 60. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 illness [National Early Warning Score (NEWS) <= 4] were included. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner. Control arm (standard supportive treatment, n=30) was compared with intervention arm (n=30) of standard treatment plus CQN eye drops (0.03%) repurposed as nasal drops administered six times daily (0.5 ml/dose) for 10 days. Outcome measures were adverse events and adherence; clinical progression and outcomes were measured by NEWS; sequential RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values were also noted on days 0, 3, 7 and 10.
   Results: Nasal CQN was associated with local irritation in seven and non-compliance in one of 30 patients. Eleven patients were excluded due to enrolment error (2 - recovered; 9 - false-positive referral), and 49 patients were analyzed as per modified intention-to-treat analysis. Clinical recovery was noted as similar with 100 percent asymptomatic by day seven in both arms. Virological outcomes also indicated similarly improving Ct values in both arms, and similar proportion of patients transitioning to non-infectivity by day 10 (controls - 19/25; nasal CQN - 15/24). Nine false-positive patients with enrolment error and day 0 RT-PCR negative were initially uninfected but had continuing COVID-19 exposure and treatment as per randomization. Patients receiving nasal CQN (n=5) demonstrated stable Ct values from day 0 to 10, while patients with no nasal CQN (n=4) demonstrated significant dip in Ct value indicating to infection (Ct<35) and infectivity (Ct<33).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The present study suggests to the potential of topical nasal CQN in the prevention of COVID-19 infection if administered before the infection is established. No significant differences in clinical or virological outcome were however, demonstrated in patients with mild hut established illness.

AB  - Tripping is accompanied by reduced minimum toe clearance (mTC) during the swing phase of gait. The risk of fall due to tripping among transfemoral amputees is nearly 67% which is greater than the transtibial amputees. Therefore, intervention to improve mTC can potentially enhance the quality of life among transfemoral amputees. In this paper, we first develop a real-time visual feedback system with center of pressure (CoP) information. Next, we recruited six non-disabled and three transfemoral amputees to investigate the effect on mTC while participants were trained to shift the CoP anteriorly/posteriorly during heel strike. Finally, to assess the lasting effect of training on mTC, retention trials were conducted without feedback. During feedback, posterior shift in the CoP improved the mTC significantly from 4.68 +/- 0.40 cm to 6.12 +/- 0.68 cm (p < 0.025) in non-disabled participants. A similar significant improvement in mTC from 4.60 +/- 0.55 cm to 5.62 +/- 0.57 cm was observed in amputees during posterior shift of CoP. Besides mTC, maximal toe clearances, i.e., maxTC(1) and maxTC(2), also showed a significant increase (p < 0.025) during the posterior shift of CoP in both the participants. Moreover, during retention, mTC did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from feedback condition in amputee, suggesting a positive effect of feedback training. The foot-to-ground angle (FGA) at mTC increased significantly (p < 0.025) during posterior shift feedback in non-disabled suggests active ankle dorsiflexion in increasing mTC. However, in amputees, FGA at mTC did not differ significantly during both anterior and posterior CoP shift feedback. The present findings suggest CoP feedback as a potential strategy during gait rehabilitation of transfemoral amputees.

AB  - Morbidity, mortality and economic burden caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a significant global concern. Surprisingly, COPD is already the third leading cause of death worldwide, something that WHO had not predicted to occur until 2030. It is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airway limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles of gases. Neutrophil is one of the key infiltrated innate immune cells in the lung during the pathogenesis of COPD. Neutrophils during pathogenic attack or injury decide to undergo for a suicidal death by releasing decondensed chromatin entangled with antimicrobial peptides to trap and ensnare pathogens. Casting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been widely demonstrated to be an effective mechanism against invading microorganisms thus controlling overwhelming infections. However, aberrant and massive NETs formation has been reported in several pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Moreover, NETs can directly induce epithelial and endothelial cell death resulting in impairing pulmonary function and accelerating the progression of the disease. Therefore, understanding the regulatory mechanism of NET formation is the need of the hour in order to use NETs for beneficial purpose and controlling their involvement in disease exacerbation. For example, DNA neutralization of NET proteins using protease inhibitors and disintegration with recombinant human DNase would be helpful in controlling excess NETs. Targeting CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) would also reduce neutrophilic inflammation, mucus production and neutrophil-proteinase mediated tissue destruction in lung. In this review, we discuss the interplay of NETs in the development and pathophysiology of COPD and how these NETs associated therapies could be leveraged to disrupt NETopathic inflammation as observed in COPD, for better management of the disease.

AB  - Stenotic lesions of the pulmonary arteries can be congenital or acquired. Different etiologies may affect the pulmonary arteries, unilaterally or bilaterally, at different levels. The clinical scenario, age of presentation and the precipitating event may provide clues to the underlying etiology. Diagnosis is important as these lesions may have hemodynamic and clinical consequences. Multidetector computed tomography angiography allows for accurate depiction of these lesions along with a comprehensive assessment of the pulmonary arterial wall, intraor extraluminal involvement, associated cardiac or extracardiac anomalies, effects secondary to pulmonary stenosis on the cardiac chambers as well as associated causative or resultant lung parenchymal changes.

AB  - Background Nurses represent the major proportion of frontline health care professionals delivering 24/7 services to patients with an increased vulnerability towards COVID-19 infection. Mental health issues among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic are poorly reported across the globe. Henceforth, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to explore the prevalence and determinants of mental health outcomes (anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD, insomnia) among nurses across the globe due to the COVID-19.
   Methods A PRISMA compliant systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD 42020204120) was carried out to identify articles from multiple databases reporting the prevalence of mental health outcomes among nurses. Proportion random effect analysis, I-2 statistic, quality assessment, and sensitivity analysis were carried out.
   Results Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-44%, n (number of studies) = 21, N (sample size) = 13 641), 40.6% stress (95% CI = 25.4%-56.8%, n = 10, N = 4204), 32% depression (95% CI = 21%-44%, n = 17, N = 12 294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CI = 4.8%-38%, n = 3, N = 638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CI = 5.8%-78.6%, n = 2, N = 261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever).
   Conclusion The study results highlighted a higher proportion of poor mental health outcomes namely, anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD and insomnia among nurses from different parts of the world. Poor mental health outcomes among nurses warrants the need to implement proactive psychological interventions to deter the collapse of health care systems in responding to the pandemic and in particular all possible efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the risk factors. Health care organizations should provide support to nurses with sufficient flexibility. The disaster preparedness plan envisaged by nations should have provisions to address the mental health of nurses. Greater investment in addressing the global shortage of nurses should be given priority in national health policies. Attractive salary packages should be offered to nurses to prevent their emigration from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

AB  - Deviations from the normal process of embryogenesis can result in various developmental anomalies of the superior vena cava (SVC). While these anomalies are often asymptomatic, they assume clinical importance during interventions such as central venous catheterisations and pacemaker implantations and during cardiothoracic surgeries while instituting cardiopulmonary bypass and for creation of cavo-pulmonary connections. Role of imaging in identifying these anomalies is indispensable. Cross-sectional imaging techniques like CT venography and magnetic resonance (MR) venography allow direct visualisation and consequently increased detection of anomalies. CT venography plays an important role in detection of SVC anomalies as it is readily available, has excellent spatial resolution, short acquisition times and potential for reconstruction of images in multiple planes. This pictorial review focuses on the developmental anomalies of the SVC and its tributaries highlighting their embryological basis, imaging appearances on CT venography and potential clinical implications, where relevant.

AB  - Purpose: Critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients need hospitalization which increases their risk of acquiring secondary bacterial and fungal infections. The practice of empiric antimicrobial prescription, due to limited diagnostic capabilities of many hospitals, has the potential to escalate an already worrisome antimicrobial resistance (AMR) situation in India. This study reports the prevalence and profiles of secondary infections (SIs) and clinical outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in India.
   Patients and Methods: A retrospective study of secondary infections in patients admitted in intensive care units (ICUs) and wards of ten hospitals of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) AMR surveillance network, between June and August 2020, was undertaken. The demographic data, time of infection after admission, microbiological and antimicrobial resistance data of secondary infections, and clinical outcome data of the admitted COVID-19 patients were collated.
   Results: Out of 17,534 admitted patients, 3.6% of patients developed secondary bacterial or fungal infections. The mortality among patients who developed secondary infections was 56.7% against an overall mortality of 10.6% in total admitted COVID-19 patients. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 78% of patients. Klebsiella pneumoniae (29%) was the predominant pathogen, followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (21%). Thirty-five percent of patients reported polymicrobial infections, including fungal infections. High levels of carbapenem resistance was seen in A. baumannii (92.6%) followed by K. pneumoniae (72.8%).
   Conclusion: Predominance of Gram-negative pathogens in COVID-19 patients coupled with high rates of resistance to higher generation antimicrobials is an alarming finding. A high rate of mortality in patients with secondary infections warrants extra caution to improve the infection control practices and practice of antimicrobial stewardship interventions not only to save patient lives but also prevent selection of drug-resistant infections, to which the current situation is very conducive.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the role of normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in characterization of endometrial and subendometrial masses, measured as a ratio of the mean ADC of the pathology to mean ADC of two different internal controls, normal myometrium and gluteus maximus muscle, referred to as nADC(m) and nADC(g) respectively.
   Methods: 55 females with pathologically proven endometrial and subendometrial lesions, including 27 cases of endometrial carcinoma, and 28 cases of benign masses were enrolled in this prospective study and assessed with single-shot echoplanar diffusion-weighted imaging. The normalized and absolute ADC of the lesions, measured by two radiologists, were compared in different pathologies and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) performed to distinguish benign and malignant endometrial masses. In the endometrial carcinoma group, the ADC values were further compared with tumor grade and subtype.
   Results: There was good interobserver agreement (>0.800) for both internal controls, however it was higher for myometrium [intraclass correlation coefficient-0.92; confidence interval (0.86-0.95)] than gluteus maximus muscle [ICC-0.84; CI (0.72-0.90)]. There were statistically significant differences in absolute ADC (p-0.02), nADC(m) (p-0.02) and nADC(g) (p < 0.0001) of benign and malignant endometrial masses.
   Conclusion: Normalized ADC is useful to distinguish benign and malignant masses with comparable accuracy as absolute ADC.
   Advances In knowledge: Normalized ADC represents an easily measurable quantitative parameter which limits the influence of endogenous and exogenous factors that affect its reproducibility.

AB  - Background Human metapneumovirus is a common virus associated with acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) in children. No global burden estimates are available for ALRIs associated with human metapneumovirus in children, and no licensed vaccines or drugs exist for human metapneumovirus infections. We aimed to estimate the age-stratified human metapneumovints-associated ALRI global incidence, hospital admissions, and mortality burden in children younger than 5 years.
   Methods We estimated the global burden of human metapneumovirus-associated ALRIs in children younger than 5 years from a systematic review of 119 studies published between an 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2019, and a further 40 high quality unpublished studies. We assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We estimated incidence, hospital admission rates, and in-hospital case-fatality ratios (hCFRs) of human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI using a generalised linear mixed model. We applied incidence and hospital admission rates of human inetapneumovirus-associated ALRI to population estimates to yield the morbidity burden estimates by age bands and World Bank income levels. We also estimated human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI in-hospital deaths and overall human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI deaths (both in-hospital and non-hospital deaths). Additionally, we estimated human metapneumovinis-attributable ALRI cases, hospital admissions, and deaths by combining human metapneumovirus-associated burden estimates and attributable fractions of human metapneumovirus in laboratory-confirmed human metapneumovirus cases and deaths.
   Findings In 2018, among children younger than 5 years globally, there were an estimated 14.2 million human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI cases (uncertainty range [UR) 10.2 million to 20.1 million), 643 000 human metapneumovirus-associated hospital admissions (UR 425 000 to 977000), 7700 human metapneumovirus-associated in-hospital deaths (2600 to 48 800), and 16 100 overall (hospital and community) human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI deaths (5700 to 88000). An estimated 11.1 million ALRI cases (UR 8.0 million to 15.7 million), 502 000 ALRI hospital admissions (UR 332 000 to 762 000), and 11 300 ALRI deaths (4000 to 61600) could be causally attributed to human metapneumovirus in 2018. Around 58% of the hospital admissions were in infants under 12 months, and 64% of in-hospital deaths occurred in infants younger than 6 months, of which 79% occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.
   Interpretation Infants younger than 1 year have disproportionately high risks of severe human metapneumovirus infections across all World Bank income regions and all child mortality settings, similar to respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus. Infants younger than 6 months in low-income and lower-middle-income countries are at greater risk of death from human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI than older children and those in upper-middle-income and high-income countries. Our mortality estimates demonstrate the importance of intervention strategies for infants across all settings, and warrant continued efforts to improve the outcome of human metapneumovirus-associated ALRI among young infants in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum otolin-1 is an inner ear protein exclusively expressed in otoconia and cells of vestibule and cochlea. Serum otolin-1 is found to be quantifiable in patients with BPPV. Low Vitamin-D is associated with pathogenesis of BPPV. Since otoconia degeneration contributes to BPPV, lack of Vitamin-D may impact otoconia structure and integrity.
   OBJECTIVE: We aimed at studying the s.otolin-1 as biomarker and significance of vit-D in BPPV.
   MATERIAL AND METHOD: 23 patients in test and control groups respectively were chosen within the age of 20 to 65 years. All the patients were diagnosed using Dix Hallpike menouver and head roll test, patients were treated with appropriate Canal Reposition Menouver (CRM).
   RESULTS: Serum Otolin-1 levels among the test ranged from 366 to 882 pg/mL with mean of 585.17 pg/mL whereas in control group ranged from 223 to 462 pg/mL with mean of 335.26 pg/mL. Mean Vitamin-D levels among the test group was 22.67 ng/mL (Range = 6.3-68.4) and that of control 15.43 pg/mL (Range = 5.4-27.7) respectively. The relationship between the serum Otolin-1 and Vitamin-D was not statistically significant.
   CONCLUSION: Otolin-1 levels is increased in BPPV patients and is sensitive in BPPV, specificity needs to be validated. Role of vitamin-D with respect to inner ear proteins needs further investigation.

AB  - Tetrahydroquinoline and isoquinoline scaffolds are important class of heterocyclic compounds, which is implied for the development of new drugs and diagnostic for therapeutic function. Naturally occurring as well as synthetic tetrahydroquinolines/isoquinolines possess many different biological activities and have been testified as remarkable cytotoxic and potency in human cancer cell lines. Tetrahydroquinoline/isoquinoline based compounds displayed a key role in the development of anticancer drugs or lead molecules and acting through various mechanisms such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, inhibition of tubulin polymerization, induced cell cycle arrest, interruption of cell migration, and modulation. The number of tetrahydroquinoline/isoquinoline derivatives has been reported as potent anticancer agents. Due to promising anticancer activities and wideranging properties of these molecules, we have compiled the literature for the synthesis and anticancer properties of various tetrahydroquinolines and isoquinolines. We have reported the synthesis of potent tetrahydroquinoline/isoquinoline molecules of the last 10 years with their anticancer properties in various cancer cell lines and stated their half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). In addition, we also considered the discussion of molecular docking and structural activity relationship wherever provided to understand the possible mode of activity a target involved and structural feature responsible for the better activity, so the reader can directly find the detail for designing new anticancer agents.

AB  - Objective Peripartum is a period of profound hormonal changes in the body and COVID-19 seems to have an additional impact on these women's psychosocial functioning. This calls for a need to address the psychosocial and behavioural impact of COVID-19 on peripartum women's lives.
   Methods Three focus group discussions and ten in-depth interviews were conducted. A format to guide discussions and interviews was made to bring uniformity across groups and participants. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling. In verbatim transcription was done, followed by thematic analysis to extract key conceptual themes.
   Results Fourteen pregnant and eleven postpartum women were included. The mean age was 28.5 years. Two major domains were identified: 1) the psychological domain including the categories of thoughts, emotions, and behaviour, and 2) the social domain comprising categories of relationships with family members and friends, perceived loss of social support, doctor-patient relationship, and social determinants of health.
   Conclusion The pandemic has indeed affected the psychosocial functioning of peripartum women. The study results might prove to be helpful for clinicians and mental health specialists who can suggest and develop different coping strategies for peripartum women during this pandemic.

AB  - The burden and impact of secondary superadded infections in critically ill coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is widely acknowledged. However, there is a dearth of information regarding the impact of COVID-19 in patients with tuberculosis, HIV, chronic hepatitis, and other concurrent infections. This review was conducted to evaluate the consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in patients with concurrent co-infections based on the publications reported to date. An extensive comprehensive screening was conducted using electronic databases up to 3rd September 2020 after obtaining registration with PROSPERO (CRD420202064800). The observational studies or interventional studies in English, evaluating the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with concurrent infections are included for the meta-analyses. Our search retrieved 20 studies, with a total of 205,702 patients. Patients with tuberculosis (RR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.75-2.51; I-2 = 0%), influenza (RR = 2.04; 95% CI, 0.15-28.25, I-2 = 99%) have an increased risk of mortality during a co-infection with SARS-CoV-2. No significant impact is found in people living with HIV (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.82-1.19; I-2 = 30%), Chronic hepatitis (RR = 1.15; 95% CI, 0.73-1.81; I-2 = 10%). Several countries (Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Singapore) are on the verge of a dengue co epidemic (cumulative 878,496 and 5,028,380 cases of dengue and COVID-19 respectively). The impact of COVID-19 in patients of concurrent infections with either tuberculosis or influenza is detrimental. The clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in HIV or chronic hepatitis patients are comparable to COVID-19 patients without these concurrent infections.

AB  - The India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) is a multi-partner initiative, implementing and scaling up a public health hypertension control program across India. A cohort of 21,895 adult hypertension patients in 24 IHCI sentinel site facilities in four Indian states (Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Telangana), registered from January 2018 until June 2019 were assessed at baseline and then followed up for blood pressure (BP) control and antihypertensive medication use. Among all registrations, 11 274 (51%) of the patients returned for a follow-up visit between July 2019 and September 2019. Among patients returning for follow-up, 26.3% had BP controlled at registration, and 59.8% had BP controlled at follow-up (p < .001). The absolute improvement in BP control was more than two times greater in primary care (48.1 percentage point increase) than secondary care facilities (22.9 percentage point increase). Most IHCI patients received prescriptions according to state-specific treatment protocols. This study demonstrates that a scalable public health hypertension control program can yield substantial BP control improvements, especially in primary care settings. However, high loss to follow-up limits population health impact; future efforts should focus on improving systems to increase the likelihood that patients will return to the clinic for routine hypertension care.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors and is exploited for its imaging and treatment. SSTRs expression is also demonstrated in diverse benign and malignant tumor cell types and proliferating peri-tumoral vessels. Similarly, Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma (JNA) expresses different SSTRs and may be utilized for its imaging and treatment using DOTA, 1-Nal3-octreotide (DOTANOC)-PET/CT scan.
   Study Design Prospective cohort.
   Methods Nineteen clinico-radiologically diagnosed primary JNA patients underwent a Ga-68-DOTANOC PET-CT scan. Using a dedicated PET/CT scanner, a low-dose head and neck spot CT scan was performed after 45 to 60 minutes of intravenous injection of 2 to 3 mCi(74-111 MBq) of DOTANOC. The primary objective was to assess the intensity and pattern of DOTANOC uptake in these patients.
   Results DOTANOC expression was noted in all cases (n = 19) of primary JNA (100%). The mean (SD) DOTANOC SUVmax ratio of tumor and background was 6.9+/-1.4(range, 3.8-9.5). Intra-cranial extension in all 13/19 patients was prominently visualized due to the absence of DOTANOC uptake in the brain. Compared to the background all stages of JNA showed significant DOTANOC uptake (P < .0001). No difference in uptake between advanced-stage tumors and early tumors was noted (P = .47). A statistically non-significant negative trend was noted for decreasing uptake with increasing age (Spearman correlation coefficient, r = -0.19).
   Conclusions This first study of Ga-68-DOTANOC-PET/CT scan in JNA demonstrates consistent and reliable uptake activity in all patients irrespective of age and stage. This opens up possibilities to physiological diagnostic imaging with a promise of greater specificity and sensitivity and may have applications in ambivalent diagnostic situations such as the detection of recurrence.

AB  - Pesticides are globally used to eliminate pests from crops and plants. The increased use of pesticides has posed a serious threat to human health. This study evaluates the effects of pesticide exposure on pregnancy outcomes in tea garden workers (TGW). The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was measured in the maternal blood, placenta, and cord blood of TGW and housewives (HWs). The placental structure and expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 alpha were also analyzed in TGW and HW groups delivering low birth weight (LBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) babies. A significantly decreased AChE activity was observed in maternal blood and cord blood in TGW as compared with HW in the LBW group. However, it did not change significantly in the NBW group (p < .05). The adjusted regression analysis of birth outcomes (birth weight, head circumference, infant's length, and ponderal index) revealed a significant and positive association with the levels of AChE activity in maternal blood, placenta, and cord blood in TGW (p < .05). The histological analysis showed significantly higher placental syncytial knots, chorangiosis, fibrinoid deposition, necrosis, and stromal fibrosis in the LBW group of TGW. Microinfarction, increased fibrinoid deposition, and atypical villi characteristics, such as mushroom-like structures, were observed during scanning electron microscopy along with increased HIF-1 alpha expression in placental tissues of TGW exposed to pesticides. Results suggest that occupational pesticide exposure during pregnancy may decrease AChE activity and cause in utero pathological changes accompanied by an increased HIF-1 alpha expression, which also contributes to placental insufficiency and fetal growth restriction.

AB  - Objective To predict intrapartum fetal compromise (FC) and admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) in term pregnancies.
   Methods A prospective observational study recruited women with singleton, term pregnancies. Ultrasound (US) was done for fetal biometry, umbilical and middle cerebral artery (UA, MCA) Doppler parameters, and CPR calculated. Intrapartum variables and neonatal data were recorded.
   Results Mean interval from US to delivery was 2.21 +/- 2.71 days. Rate of operative delivery for FC was 17.47%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that UA pulsatility index (PI) multiples of median (MoM) (P = 0.001), MCA PI MoM (P = 0.001), and CPR MoM (P = 0.001) were significantly and independently associated with operative delivery for FC. Similarly, UA PI MoM (P = 0.004), MCA PI MoM (P = 0.009), and CPR MoM (P = 0.003) were also significantly and independently associated with admission to the NICU. Rate of operative delivery for presumed FC was higher in approprate-for-gestational-age fetuses with low CPR than in small-for-gestational-age fetuses with normal CPR (43.1% and 37.5%, respectively).
   Conclusion Lower mean CPR and CPR MoM were independently associated with the need for operative delivery for presumed FC and NICU admission at term. CPR is more likely to be associated with FC due to placental insufficiency than birth weight.

AB  - Importance There is an unmet need for safe and efficacious treatments for upper-extremity dystonic tremor (DT). To date, only uncontrolled retrospective case series have reported the effect of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injections on upper-extremity DT. Objective To assess the effect of BoNT injections on tremor in patients with upper-extremity DT. Design, Setting, and Participants In this placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical trial, 30 adult patients with upper-extremity DT treated at a movement disorder clinic in a tertiary care university hospital were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to BoNT or saline injection, 0.9%, using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Randomization was masked using opaque envelopes. The participant, injector, outcome assessor, and statistician were blinded to the randomization. Participants were recruited between November 20, 2018, and December 12, 2019, and the last follow-up was completed in March 2020. Interventions Participants received electromyographically guided intramuscular injections of BoNT or placebo into the tremulous muscles of the upper extremity. Injection patterns and doses were individualized according to tremor phenomenologic findings. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the total score on the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale 6 weeks after the intervention. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. All patients were offered open-label BoNT injections after 12 weeks and reassessed 6 weeks later. Results A total of 48 adult patients with a diagnosis of brachial dystonia with DT were screened. Fifteen were ineligible and 3 refused consent; therefore, 30 patients (mean [SD] age, 46.0 [18.6] years; 26 [86.7%] male) were recruited, with 15 randomized to receive BoNT and 15 to receive placebo. In the intention-to-treat group, the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale total score was significantly lower in the BoNT group at 6 weeks (adjusted mean difference, -10.9; 95% CI, -15.4 to -6.5; P < .001) and 12 weeks (adjusted mean difference, -5.7; 95% CI, -11.0 to -0.5; P = .03). More participants in the BoNT group reported global improvement on the Global Impression of Change (PGIC) assessment (PGIC 1, 2, and 3: BoNT: 4 [26.7%], 6 [40.0%], and 5 [33.3%]; placebo: 5 [33.3%], 10 [66.7%], and 0, respectively; P = .047). Subjective hand weakness (BoNT: 6 [40.0%]; placebo: 4 [28.6%], P = .52) and dynamometer-assessed grip strength (mean difference, -0.2 log(10)[kgf/m(2)](2)/Hz-Hz; 95% CI, -0.9 to 0.4 log(10)[kgf/m(2)](2)/Hz-Hz; P = .45) were similar in both groups. Conclusions and Relevance In this randomized clinical trial, botulinum neurotoxin injections were superior to placebo in reducing tremor severity in upper-extremity DT. An individualized approach to muscle selection and dosing was beneficial without unacceptable adverse effects.

AB  - Sustained release nanoformulations of second line antitubercular drugs levofloxacin and ethionamide had shown promise in pharmacokinetics and acute and sub-acute toxicity studies. The present study evaluated the clastogenicity potential of the nanoformulations of these antitubercular agents. Clastogenicity was evaluated by (a) in vitro micronucleus assay (b) in vivo micronucleus assay in Swiss albino mice and (c) sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in CHO cell lines. Ethionamide and levofloxacin loaded nanoparticles were 312 +/- 64 nm and 245 +/- 24 nm in size respectively and drug encapsulation was 35.2 +/- 3.1% w/w and 45.6 +/- 9.4% w/w, respectively. The frequency of MN-NCE/1000 NCE and MN-PCE/1000 PCE were significantly reduced in mice treated with ethionamide nanoparticle (3.5 +/- 0.9, 13.8 +/- 16.68) and levofloxacin nanoparticles (5.6 +/- 2.7, 16.7 +/- 12.7) compared to the mice treated with free ethionamide (11.5 +/- 4.1, p = 0.23 and 45.19 +/- 19.21, p = 0.38) and free levofloxacin (14.7 +/- 1.88, p < 0.0001 and 54.6 +/- 18.1, p = 0.0017), respectively. For in vitro, micronucleus assay frequencies of micronuclei per thousand bi-nucleated cells (MN-BN/1000 BN) was 188.3 +/- 20.20 and 148 +/- 20.42 for ethionamide and levofloxacin nanoparticles as compared to 232.6 +/- 16.04 (p = 0.52) and 175 +/- 5.56 (p = 0.45) for free ethionamide and levofloxacin, respectively. The average number of SCE per cell for nanoformulation of ethionamide were not different from that of free drug (4.9 +/- 0.51 vs 4.1 +/- 0.55, p = 0.86). The SCE per cells were not significant difference for nanoformulation of levofloxacin (2.33 +/- 1.36 vs 5.46 +/- 0.25, p = 0.88). In vitro and in vivo assays have shown relatively less clastogenic potential of equivalent dose of ethionamide nanoparticles as compared to the conventional formulation.

AB  - A 44-year-old lady, a follow-up case of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator device implantation with epicardial left ventricular (LV) lead, underwent a transvenous LV lead revision in view of epicardial lead malfunction. A chest X-ray after this, done for worsening dyspnea, revealed pneumopericardium along with left pneumothorax. The computed tomography (CT) revealed a communication between the left pleural and pericardial cavities, around the old epicardial lead. Drainage of the left pleural cavity resolved both the pneumothorax and pneumopericardium and the patient remained well on follow up.

AB  - Background and Aim The FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score was developed for identifying patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, who also have an elevated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) activity score (NAS) >= 4 and significant fibrosis (F >= 2). We aimed to validate it in our NAFLD cohort and assess if it correlates with the histological changes after bariatric surgery.
   Methods Patients with NAFLD, including those undergoing bariatric surgery, were included. The FAST score was calculated using liver stiffness measure, controlled attenuation parameter, and aspartate aminotransferase. Calibration and discrimination of the model were assessed by calibration plots and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed at the rule-out and rule-in cutoffs (<= 0.35 and >= 0.67), respectively. Changes in the NAS and FAST scores were compared in the bariatric cohort 1 year after surgery.
   Results The cohort composed of 309 patients, of which 48 patients underwent repeat liver biopsy at 1 year. The model showed good discrimination with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (0.74-0.84); however, it was not satisfactorily calibrated (Hosmer-Lemeshow test, P = 0.008). The sensitivity and specificity at the rule-out and rule-in cutoffs were 0.90 and 0.84, respectively. A significant correlation was seen between the 1-year reduction in the NAS and FAST scores (r = 0.38, P = 0.009). A significant reduction in the median FAST score was seen in patients who had >= 2-point reduction in NAS after bariatric surgery.
   Conclusion FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase score demonstrated good discrimination for fibrotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in our cohort. However, a miscalibration resulted in overprediction. The score correlated well with the histological response to interventions for NAFLD.

AB  - We present 13 years old with history of cyanosis and diagnosis of congenitally corrected transposition of great arteries with ventricle septal defect and pulmonary stenosis with dextrocardia. He underwent modified Senning procedure with pulmonary root translocation. Postoperative recovery was uneventful and was extubated on postoperative day 1. Patient remained in sinus rhythm. Postoperative echocardiography showed good biventricular function with no baffle obstruction and mild pulmonary regurgitation with no significant left and right outflow tract obstruction. Patient was discharged on postoperative day 6 and remained asymptomatic on follow up at 3 months.

AB  - The safe, highly effective measles vaccine has been recommended globally since 1974, yet in 2017 there were more than 17 million cases of measles and 83,400 deaths in children under 5 years old, and more than 99% of both occurred in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)(1-4). Globally comparable, annual, local estimates of routine first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) coverage are critical for understanding geographically precise immunity patterns, progress towards the targets of the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP), and high-risk areas amid disruptions to vaccination programmes caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)(5-8). Here we generated annual estimates of routine childhood MCV1 coverage at 5 x 5-km(2) pixel and second administrative levels from 2000 to 2019 in 101 LMICs, quantified geographical inequality and assessed vaccination status by geographical remoteness. After widespread MCV1 gains from 2000 to 2010, coverage regressed in more than half of the districts between 2010 and 2019, leaving many LMICs far from the GVAP goal of 80% coverage in all districts by 2019. MCV1 coverage was lower in rural than in urban locations, although a larger proportion of unvaccinated children overall lived in urban locations; strategies to provide essential vaccination services should address both geographical contexts. These results provide a tool for decision-makers to strengthen routine MCV1 immunization programmes and provide equitable disease protection for all children.

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is a network-level neurological disorder characterized by unprovoked recurrent seizures and associated comorbidities. Aberrant activity and localization of histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been reported in epilepsy and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been used for therapeutic purposes. Several non-histone targets of HDACs have been recognized whose reversible acetylation can modulate protein functions and can contribute to disease pathology.
   Areas covered: This review provides an overview of HDACs in epilepsy and reflects its action on non-histone substrates involved in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and explores the effectiveness of HDACi as anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). It also covers the efforts undertaken to target the interaction of HDACs with their substrates. We have further discussed non-deacetylase activity possessed by specific HDACs that might be essential in unraveling the molecular mechanism underlying the disease. For this purpose, relevant literature from 1996 to 2020 was derived from PubMed.
   Expert opinion: The interaction of HDACs and their non-histone substrates can serve as a promising therapeutic target for epilepsy. Pan-HDACi offers limited benefits to the epileptic patients. Thus, identification of novel targets of HDACs contributing to the disease and designing inhibitors targeting these complexes would be more effective and holds a greater potential as an anti-epileptogenic therapy.

AB  - Vitreous or vitreous humor is a complex transparent gel that fills the space between the lens and retina of an eye and acts as a transparent medium that allows light to pass through it to reach the photoreceptor layer (retina) of the eye. The vitreous humor is removed in ocular surgery (vitrectomy) for pathologies like retinal detachment, macular hole, diabetes-related vitreous hemorrhage detachment, and ocular trauma. Since the vitreous is not actively regenerated or replenished, there is a need for a vitreous substitute to fill the vitreous cavity to provide a temporary or permanent tamponade to the retina following some vitreoretinal surgeries. An ideal vitreous substitute could probably be left inside the eye forever. The vitreous humor is transparent, biocompatible, viscoelastic and highly hydrophilic; polymeric hydrogels with these properties can be a potential candidate to be used as vitreous substitutes. To meet the tremendous demand for the vitreous substitute, many scientists all over the world have developed various kinds of vitreous substitutes or tamponade agent. Vitreous substitutes, whatsoever developed till date, are associated with several advantages and disadvantages, and there is no ideal vitreous substitute available till date. This review highlights the polymer-based vitreous substitutes developed so far, along with their advantages and limitations. The gas-based and oil-based substitutes have also been discussed but very briefly.

AB  - Aim To investigate the correlation between the concentration of active-matrix metalloproteinases-9 (aMMP-9) in pulpal blood and the outcome of pulpotomy in mature permanent teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis (SIP).
   Methodology Forty permanent molar teeth with a clinical diagnosis of SIP and normal apical tissues with periapical index (PAI) score <= 2 and ten permanent teeth (8 molars and two premolars) with a diagnosis of normal pulp that required root canal treatment for prosthetic reasons from patients between the ages of 15-35 years were recruited. All clinical procedures were performed under local anaesthesia and rubber dam isolation. After access opening, the coronal pulp tissue was amputated up to the canal orifice. A 100 mu L volume of the pulpal blood was collected using a micropipette and transported to the laboratory. Sodium hypochlorite (2.5 %) was used as a haemostatic agent, and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) was used as the pulp capping material. The tooth was restored with composite at the same visit. Teeth with normal pulps were treated with single-visit root canal treatment. Patients with pulpotomy were recalled at 6 and 12 months. Outcome assessment of teeth with pulpotomy was carried out at 12 months and was categorized as success (asymptomatic patients with PAI score <= 2) or failure (symptomatic patients or PAI score >= 3). Quantification of aMMP-9 in pulpal blood was achieved using a fluorometric assay. The following statistical analyses were performed to assess the data: t-test, Fisher's exact test, kappa coefficient, non-parametric test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, Spearman rank correlation test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).
   Result The success rate of pulpotomy was 88 % at 12-months. There was a significant difference between the median concentrations of aMMP-9 in pulpal blood of teeth with normal pulps (52 (12-96) ng mL(-1):) and SIP (193.3 (25.8-607.7) ng mL(-1):) (P = 0.0003) and successful (132.3 (25.8-548.3) ng mL(-1):) and failed cases (512.4 (334.8-607.7 ng mL(-1):) (P = 0.0015) of MTA pulpotomy. A significant association was established between aMMP-9 concentration and outcome of pulpotomy. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (0.9484, 95%CI) suggested excellent discriminatory power of aMMP-9 concentration in pulpal blood to predict the pulpotomy outcome.
   Conclusion The pulpal blood concentration of aMMP-9 was significantly associated with the outcome of pulpotomy in teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, where it may be used as a potential prognostic biomarker.

AB  - The call for elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem by the World Health Organization has led to intense focus on the burden of disease, available resources, and the possibility of introducing efficient systems for screening and treatment that allow effective cancer control in limited-resource settings. Presently, the focus is on the introduction of rapid, technologically less-demanding, affordable HPV testing. However, until such tests become widely available, the momentum that has been gained using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) should not be lost. Countries with limited resources and a heavy burden of cervical cancer, such as Bangladesh and India, introduced and scaled up VIA-based programs with varying degrees of programmatic organization and performance. Despite its limitations, VIA's simplicity and affordability has allowed these countries to build infrastructure, increase numbers of trained healthcare personnel, and develop a system of multilevel coordination within the health system. Such efforts will have long-term advantages provided that countries have access to an appropriate HPV test and build on their efforts to improve program organization through a strengthened health system, translating lessons learned in program implementation, logistics, and compliance with the new paradigm.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess details of therapy required to achieve an intraocular pressure (IOP) of <= 12 mmHg in patients with severe glaucoma of different etiologies. Methods: Patients with a follow-up of at least 1 year, who fulfilled inclusion criteria were selected, and data analyzed with respect to baseline IOP, number of medications, and/or surgeries required to achieve an IOP of <= 12 mmHg and > 6 mmHg. Final IOP, visual field status and medications/surgery required were noted. Results: About 127 eyes of 85 patients met all criteria. There were 48 eyes having primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), 16 eyes with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), 17 eyes of juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG), and 46 eyes of secondary glaucoma. The mean baseline IOP was 33.14 +/- 11.07 mmHg and final IOP 10.25 +/- 1.81 mmHg. In the age group >40 years, 29.63% of patients were controlled on medication as compared to 9.09% and 5.71% in the age group of <20 years and 20-40 years (p = 0.007). With a baseline IOP of <25 mmHg, 48.65% required a trabeculectomy, whereas for 25-30, and >30 mmHg, 62.5% and 97.29% respectively, required surgery (p < 0.001).66.67% of patients having mean deviation of -12 to -16 dB (decibels) on Humphrey field analyzer (HFA) underwent surgery to achieve target IOP in comparison to 83.52% who had mean deviation greater than -16 dB (p = 0.036). Conclusion: Only 21.26% of severe glaucoma eyes could be controlled on medications alone. A baseline IOP of >25 mmHg, age <40 years and mean deviation worse than -16 dB, had a higher frequency of trabeculectomies to achieve an IOP of <= 12 mmHg.

AB  - Amoebic liver abscess is the most common extra-intestinal manifestation of amoebiasis. It usually responds well to treatment with metronidazole together with drainage, if indicated. Uncommonly, the abscess may rupture into the pleura, peritoneum or pericardium, bile duct at its hilum, or produce septic emboli. We present a patient with two rare complications: venous thrombosis and jaundice secondary to bilhaemia.

AB  - Background/Aims Sports-related dental injuries can cause pain, disfigurement, and broken teeth which may affect the athlete's well-being and psychological status. Such injuries may also lead to the fear of re-injury and other problems. Since a delay in adequate emergency treatment can have adverse effects, it is imperative that athletes and coaches have sufficient awareness of emergency treatment options. Hence, the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the global status of knowledge among athletes and coaches regarding the prevention and emergency management of traumatic dental injuries.
   Methods The protocol was designed using the PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020184956). A broad-based search using text words and MeSH terms was performed in established databases according to a predefined strategy without any distinction of language and year of publication. Studies without details of the questionnaire, knowledge score, validity, and reliability were excluded. Data extraction was performed and risk-of-bias assessment was done by means of the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool.
   Results Nine studies published between 2005 and 2020 were included for qualitative synthesis. They were primarily from Asia with none from North America and Australia. Most of them were cross-sectional, used convenience sampling, and were interview-based. Less than 10% of the participants in two studies had adequate knowledge of the immediate emergency management of tooth avulsion, while only 2.4% of basketball players and coaches knew that it was necessary to collect the avulsed tooth or broken tooth fragments. The overall level of knowledge was reported as poor or insufficient in all studies, with moderate or high risk-of-bias in six studies.
   Conclusion The knowledge regarding emergency management of TDI was found to be low globally. Along with the choice of the sport, there was a high level of variability in the study design and sampling characteristics.

AB  - Background Dental professionals are the primary care providers for traumatic dental injuries (TDI). The dental traumatology literature has a number of studies evaluating the knowledge of dental professionals from different parts of the world but its global status is unknown. Hence, the aim of this systematic review was to assess the global status of knowledge for the prevention and emergency management of TDI in dental professionals and to provide recommendations for future research.
   Materials and Methods The protocol was designed as per the PRISMA guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020192381). A broad-based search using text words and MeSH terms was performed in established databases as per a pre-defined strategy without any distinction of language and year of publication. Studies without details of the questionnaire, knowledge score, validity and reliability were excluded. Data extraction was performed, risk of bias assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool, and a meta-analysis was performed.
   Results Sixteen studies, which had been published between 2008 and 2020, were included for qualitative synthesis. Most of them were cross-sectional, used convenience sampling and evaluated knowledge for avulsion. Previous dental trauma training was undertaken by <50% of the participants of five studies, 50% of the included studies. High risk of bias was found in three studies.
   Conclusion The knowledge level in several areas of the world was unknown. The studies lacked uniformity in methods and well-designed questionnaires and they revealed insufficient levels of knowledge among dental professionals.

AB  - Introduction: The cumulative incidence of radiation-induced second malignancy is 1-2% per decade after radiotherapy (RT). Radiation-induced malignant glioma (RIMG) is a rare complication of cranial RT. Case Presentation: We herein describe a case of left frontal glioblastoma arising 5 years after prophylactic cranial irradiation (12.6 Gy/7 fractions/1.5 weeks) as a part of INCTR-02-04 protocol in a 3-year-old boy with B-cell ALL. He underwent gross total excision (GTE) of the tumour followed by post-operative intensity modulated RT (59.4 Gy/33 fractions/6.5 weeks) and concurrent and adjuvant (3 cycles) temozolomide. Thereafter, he had rapid disease progression, which entailed re-excision of the recurrent tumour. Subsequently, there was widespread subependymal and leptomeningeal spread of tumour, leading to death 10.5 months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusion: RIMG is an aggressive malignancy with a dismal prognosis, and in spite of multimodality management, it exhibits relentless progression, occasionally characterized by subependymal and leptomeningeal dissemination, leading to eventual death within a year of diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction: Transcriptional regulation of autophagy depends on the transcription factors coordinated inflammatory feedback mechanism. Here, we provide a comprehensive functional characterization of periodontal ligament fibroblasts (PDLFs) treated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS), aiming to reveal previously unappreciated biological changes and to investigate how a transcription factor differentiated embryonic chondrocytes 2 (Dec2)-deficient environment influences the function of autophagy in nflamed human PDLFs.
   Methods: A Dec2-deficient (Dec2KO) experimental periodontal inflammation mouse model and treatment with P. gingivalis LPS were employed to examine the role of autophagy in PDLFs using hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry in vivo. A Dec2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to modulate autophagy, and the effect of autophagy on the Dec2 pathway was explored using real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis in vitro.
   Results: LPS-treated human PDLFs (HPDLFs) induced autophagy, as demonstrated by the enhanced levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) and the induction of ATG5, Beclin1, and Dec2. Compared with a scrambled siRNA, a Dec2 siRNA triggered the detrimental influences of LPS and markedly enhanced autophagy expression in inflamed HPDLFs. The expression of phosphorylated ERK was increased and levels of phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) were decreased after exposure to LPS in Dec2 siRNA transfected HPDLFs. The Dec2KO model exhibited that P. gingivalis in Dec2 deficient conditions increases the inflammation of PDLFs by regulating autophagy.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a Dec2 deficiency can alleviate LPS-induced inflammation via the ERK/mTOR signaling pathway by regulating autophagy, conceivably delivering a novel approach for the detection of periodontal treatments.

AB  - Question Does combination chemotherapy with capecitabine plus irinotecan (CAPIRI) improve overall survival (OS) compared with irinotecan monotherapy in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer who have received prior treatment with a gemcitabine-platinum regimen? Findings Use of a CAPIRI regimen did not improve OS compared with irinotecan; more patients in the CAPIRI arm required dose modification compared with those in the irinotecan arm. Meaning Combination chemotherapy did not improve OS compared with single-agent chemotherapy in previously treated patients with advanced gallbladder cancer.
   This randomized clinical trial compares the efficacy of capecitabine plus irinotecan vs irinotecan alone in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer who had disease progression after gemcitabine-based first-line treatment.
   Importance There is therapeutic uncertainty regarding use of combination or single-agent chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with gallbladder cancer who experience disease progression after first-line chemotherapy. Objective To compare the efficacy of capecitabine plus irinotecan (CAPIRI) vs irinotecan (IRI) alone in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer (GBC) who have disease progression after gemcitabine-based first-line treatment. Design, Setting, and Participants The GB-SELECT trial was a multicenter, open-label, phase 2, randomized clinical trial of CAPIRI vs IRI alone for treatment of gallbladder cancer in patients who had disease progression after prior gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.The study was carried out in 2 tertiary care institutions in India. Patients aged between 18 and 70 years with histopathologic diagnosis of adenocarcinoma gallbladder, advanced or metastatic disease, previous treatment with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, adequate hematologic, liver, and renal functions, and ECOG performance status of 1 or less were included in the study between August 2018 and January 2020. The data were analyzed for this report with cutoff on May 19, 2020. Interventions Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive capecitabine, 1700 mg/m(2) per day, on days 1 to 14 plus intravenous irinotecan, 200 mg/m(2), on day 1 or intravenous irinotecan, 240 mg/m(2), on day 1, in 21-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end point was overall survival (OS) at 6 months. The secondary end points were progression-free survival and quality of life. Results A total of 98 patients were randomized, 49 in each arm, with median (range) age of 51 (29-70) years, with 60 (61%) being women. In the CAPIRI vs IRI arms, the number of deaths at 6 months, 6-month OS, and median OS were 35, 34, 38.4% (95% CI, 24.2%-52.6%) and 5.16 (95% CI, 4.26-6.06) months vs 34, 29, 54.2% (95% CI, 39.4%-69.0%) and 6.28 (95% CI, 4.25-8.30) months, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.64-1.49, P = .93). There were no chemotherapy-related deaths but more patients required dose modification in CAPIRI compared with the IRI arm (13 [27%] vs 4 [9%], respectively, P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance There was no significant difference in OS between treatment with capecitabine plus irinotecan or irinotecan alone among previously treated patients with gallbladder cancer. Single-agent irinotecan should be the preferred treatment option for such patients.

AB  - Quarantine of health care workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19-confirmed cases is a well-known strategy for limiting the transmission of infection. However, during a pandemic situation in a resource-constraint setting, we require an evidence-based guideline for quarantining HCWs. We developed an algorithm for exposure-based risk stratification and quarantine of HCWs. We did contact tracing and risk stratification of 3853 HCWs, of whom 560 (14.5%) were categorized as high-risk contacts. High-risk contacts were quarantined for 14 days and underwent testing for COVID-19, while low-risk contacts continued their work with adherence to physical distancing, hand hygiene, appropriate use of personal protective equipment, and self-monitoring of symptoms. Overall, 118 (3.1%) contacts tested positive for COVID-19. The positivity rate among high-risk contacts was 7.1% (95% confidence interval = 5.2-9.6). Our strategy of risk stratification prevented 3215 HCWs from being quarantined and thus saved 45 010 person-days of health workforce in the institution.

AB  - Purpose [Ga-68]Ga-labeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors ([Ga-68]Ga-FAPi) have shown promising preclinical and clinical results in PET imaging. The present study aimed to evaluate the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi, another modified FAPi tracer, and performed a head-to-head comparison with [F-18]F-FDG PET/CT scans in patients with various cancers.
   Methods In this prospective study, patients underwent both [F-18]F-FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans 60 min post-injection (p.i.). Dosimetry studies were conducted in three patients using [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi serial time-point imaging. The absorbed dose was calculated using OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. Quantification of the uptake of the tracers was assessed using standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SUL).
   Results Fifty-four patients (mean age; 48.4 years) with 14 types of cancers involving 37% breast, 24% lung, 7.4% head and neck (H&N), and remaining 31.6% patients with other histologies were evaluated prospectively. Physiological uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi was observed in the liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart contents, and to a lesser extent in the lacrimals, oral mucosa, salivary glands, and thyroid glands. Uptake in the target lesions on [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi scan was initiated at 10 min, and no additional lesions were detected in the delayed acquisition time points. The pancreas was the organ with the highest absorbed dose (5.46E-02 mSv/MBq). While the patient-based comparison between the radiotracers revealed complete concordance in the detection of primary, pleural thickening, bone and liver metastases, and second primary malignancy, discordant findings were observed in the detection of lymph node (7.5%), lung nodules (5.6%), and brain metastases (2%). According to the site of primary disease, patients with H&N cancers demonstrated the highest SULpeak and average (avg) values on [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA-FAPi which was similar to the values of [F-18]F-FDG [(SULpeak: 15.4 vs. 14.2; P-0.680) (SULavg: 8.3 vs. 7.9; P-0.783)]. The lowest uptake was observed in lung cancers with both the radiotracers [(SULpeak: 5.8 vs. 7.4; P-0.238) (SULavg: 4.9 vs. 5.3; P-0.313)]. A significantly higher SULpeak and SULavg for brain metastases to normal brain parenchyma ratios were observed on [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi in contrast to the [F-18]F-FDG values {SULpeak: median: 59.3 (IQR: 33.5-130.8) versus 1.5 (1-2.3); P-0.028}. Except for brain metastases, comparable SULpeak and average values were noted between the radiotracers in all other regions of metastases with no significant difference.
   Conclusion [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi is a promising alternative among the FAPI class of molecules and performed well as compared to standard-of-care radiotracer [F-18]F-FDG in the diagnosis of various cancers.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the systemic associations of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) with help of clinical and biochemical investigations. Design: Case-control study. Participants: Eighty seven CSCR patients (case) and 82 Asian-Indian patients with primary non-traumatic rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (control) were recruited between July 2017 and December 2018 at a tertiary eye-care center in North India. Methods: The patients underwent ophthalmological examination and systemic evaluation based on history and biochemical investigations. Logistic regression was performed to identify the associations of CSCR. Results: The age was similar between cases and controls (36.9 +/- 7.8 years vs 35.7 +/- 10.8 years, p = 0.38). On univariate analysis, the significant factors with higher odds of CSCR were alcohol use (odds ratio, OR: 3.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.36-8.53), sleep disturbance (OR: 5.44; 1.76-16.8), gastroesophageal reflux (OR: 9.34; 1.15-75.50), psychological disorder (OR: 5.78; 1.24-26.97), tuberculosis history (OR: 8.2; 1.0-67.10), serum albumin: globulin ratio (AGR) > 2 (OR: 10.43; 2.33-46.57), and serum hemoglobin (per unit increase; OR: 1.35; 1.14-1.61). Although the mean blood pressure was significantly higher in cases, the distribution among various hypertension categories was not significantly different. Exogenous steroid use and morning 8 am serum cortisol levels were not significantly different between the groups. On multivariable analysis, alcohol use (OR: 4.72; 1.33-16.76), sleep disturbances (OR: 5.04; 1.36-18.70), dysthyroid state (OR: 3.02; 1.04-8.74), serum AGR > 2 (OR: 14.28; 2.33-87.28), and serum hemoglobin (per unit increase; OR: 1.43; 1.13-1.81) were significant independent associations. Conclusion: Other than the previously described associations of CSCR like alcohol use and sleep disturbances, this study reports possible association with deranged serum protein and thyroid hormone profile. Further large-scale prospective studies need to validate these results.

AB  - Monogenic defects in tubular sodium handling contribute a small proportion to hypertension in childhood. Presentation varies from severe hypertension manifesting at birth to asymptomatic hypertension and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis detected incidentally in adulthood. A 12-y-old girl presenting with polyuria, polydipsia, severe hypertension and seizures, was found to have hypokalemia, renal medullary cysts and nephrocalcinosis. Clinical exome revealed a homozygous variation of unknown significance in exon 5 of the HSD11B2 gene, indicating the diagnosis of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. Therapy with spironolactone was associated with resolution of hypokalemia and normal blood pressure during two-year follow up.

AB  - Introduction A multi-specialized research health center needs to implement a standard blood ordering schedule for elective surgeries and perform regular audits on blood ordering practices to ensure the judicial usage of resources. This retrospective study is a step towards implementing a maximum blood-ordering schedule in our Institute. Methodology Blood ordering and utilization of 10 surgical specialties (performing over 180 different surgical procedures) were analyzed for 1 year to formulate an institutional maximum blood-ordering schedule. Results Out of 7967 patients, the cross match- transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, and transfusion index were 2.5, 34.5%, and 0.7 respectively. There was a gross over-ordering of blood units pre-operatively (82.4%). Conclusion Sixty-seven percent of the elective surgeries can be performed safely with type and screen alone saving 77% of the total expenditure if we were to cross-match the exact number of units demanded. Hence, this study reiterates the importance of regular auditing of blood requisition patterns and the introduction of maximum blood-ordering schedule to prevent wastage of precious blood bank resources.

AB  - Introduction CNS embryonal tumors (CET) other than medulloblastomas (MB) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs), previously designated as 'central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumors' ('CNS PNETs'), are a heterogenous subset of tumors with poorly defined diagnostic criteria. Other than the subset of embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) defined by C19MC amplification, most CETs are diagnosed by exclusion of other molecularly defined entities and histological mimics including MB, AT/RTs, and high-grade gliomas, and termed as CET, not otherwise specified (NOS) in the 2016 WHO classification. Aim To reclassify 'CNS PNETs' as per WHO 2016, and estimate the true proportion of CET, NOS in a tertiary healthcare setting, and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of C19MC amplification, Lin28A and Olig2 expression in the subclassification of CETs. Methods Previously diagnosed cases of 'CNS PNETs' (2002-2016) were first evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MIC2, RelaA, L1CAM, IDH1R132H, H3K27M, H3G34R, H3G34V, INI1, and BRG1 proteins and by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) for EWSR1 translocation to exclude histological mimics. The selected CETs (case cohort) and 79 histological mimics (comparison cohort) comprising of MB, AT/RT, pineal parenchymal tumors, Ewing sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, intraocular medulloepithelioma, and H3G34R mutant high-grade glioma were subject to IHC for Olig2 and Lin28A, and FISH for C19MC amplification. Results Twenty-two cases of 'CNS PNETs' were retrieved, all of which were negative for the first panel of markers and showed retained INI-1/BRG1 expression. Three of them (3/22, 13.6%) showed C19MC amplification (ETMR, C19MC-altered) with ETMR histology, Lin28A positivity, and Olig2 negativity. Among the remaining 19 CETs, one showed medulloepithelioma histology (Medulloepithelioma, NOS) and remaining were non-descript small round cell tumors (CET, NOS), all negative for Lin28A. Olig2 was positive in only 3 CETs (13.6%), all being CET, NOS. All tumors in the comparison cohort were negative for C19MC amplification, Lin28A and Olig2 except for 27% of ATRTs that were Lin28A positive. Conclusion ETMR, C19MC-altered constitute less than 14% of CETs, with majority remaining uncharacterized as CET, NOS. Lin28A is 100% sensitive for the detection of C19MC amplification; however, its specificity is limited by its expression in ATRTs. Olig2 expression is seen only in a small subset of CET, NOS and is of limited diagnostic utility.

AB  - Caudal duplication syndrome is a rare and interesting entity with a reported prevalence of <1/100,000 births. Caudal duplication syndrome encompasses a diverse spectrum of anomalies primarily involving partial or complete duplication of organs comprising the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and distal neural tube systems. The term 'caudal duplication syndrome' was coined by Dominguez et al. in 1993, in a case series of six patients presenting with findings pertaining to duplication anomalies of genitourinary system, hindgut, lumbosacral spine and cord. We here report a unique case of caudal duplication presenting in late adolescence and briefly review the available literature on this rare abnormality.
