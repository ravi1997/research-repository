AB  - Objectives To evaluate the autonomic function in specific learning disorder (SLD) and comorbid SLD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (SLD-ADHD). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital with 20 adolescent subjects each of confirmed SLD, SLD-ADHD, and healthy control (mean age 15.32 y). Heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests were carried out using standard protocols. Results Heart-rate variability parameters, viz., mean RR interval, number of RR intervals which differ by >= 50 ms (NN50), percentage NN50, standard deviation of differences between adjacent RR intervals, root square of mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals, coefficient of variance and absolute power of high-frequency band (HF) recorded apparently lower levels in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control indicating lower parasympathetic tone. Whereas, higher absolute power of low- frequency band (LF) in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated enhanced sympathetic activity. Higher LF/HF and lower SD1/SD2 ratios in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated higher sympathetic tone over parasympathetic tone. Values of autonomic-function tests such as E:I ratio, change in heart rate during deep-breathing test, 30:15 ratio, and Valsalva ratio showed a decrease in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control implying reduction in parasympathetic reactivity. Increased values for rise in diastolic blood pressure in the isometric handgrip test and cold pressor test recorded in SLD as compared to healthy control, revealed the increased sympathetic reactivity. Conclusion Overall, results of heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests imply dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities with sympathetic dominance in SLD and SLD-ADHD.

AB  - Treatment guidelines for the COVID-19 treatment are still evolving, moreover, the changing variants of the virus with varying virulence, pose challenges for the healthcare professionals (HCP) not only in managing the primary infection but also a myriad of physical and neuropsychiatric complications. The neuropsychiatric adverse consequences associated with the COVID-19 are attributable to the direct effect of the virus, secondary complications, drug-drug interaction, and neuropsychiatric manifestations of drugs used in its treatment. These neuropsychiatric manifestations not only complicate the ongoing treatment but also adversely affect the prognosis. As the treatment guidelines for the management of the COVID are still evolving, the use of non-evidence based medications, including their off-label use, are rampant that often extend to their non-judicious or irrational use (more than the recommended dose, multiple medications, etc.). Despite the significance of the topic, literature is sparse. Knowing about the risk factors and the potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects with various anti-COVID-19 medications would help HCPs in effectively preventing, early identifying, and promptly managing these neuropsychiatric symptoms. Therefore, this narrative review is aimed to highlight the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with medications/interventions used in the management of COVID-19 and how to manage them, especially in view of the world facing the third wave of COVID-19.

AB  - Background The role of serum Procalcitonin (PCT) in adults in diagnosis of Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is well established, however, role in pediatric CAP remains controversial. Objectives The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of serum procalcitonin in differentiating bacterial community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection from non-bacterial respiratory infection in children; radiologically confirmed pneumonia was used as the reference. In addition, we assessed the utility of adding the PCT assay to the clinical criteria for diagnosis of pneumonia. Study design Subanalysis of a larger prospective,multicentriccohort study. Participants Children, 2 months to 59 months of age, attending paediatric OPD of 5 urban tertiary care hospitals, suffering from acute respiratory infection (ARI). Intervention Detailed clinical history and examination findings of enrolled children were recorded on predesigned case record form. Samples for PCT were obtained at admission and were measured centrally at the end of the study except for one site using VIDAS (R) B.R.A.H.M.S PCT kit (Biomerieux SA, France). Outcomes Sensitivity and specificity of procalcitonin for diagnosis of radiologically confirmed pneumonia. Results Serum Procalcitonin was measured in 370 patients; median (IQR) age of these children being 12 (7, 22) months, 235 (63.5%) were boys. The median (IQR) serum procalcitonin concentration was 0.1(0.05, 0.4) ng/mL.Sensitivity and specificity of raised PCT (> 0.5 ng/mL) for pneumonia as per any CXR abnormalities were 29.7% and87.5%,(P < 0.001) respectively. Raised PCT was also significantly associated with consolidation (34.5%,79.2%,P < 0.02)and pleural effusion(54.6%,79%,P < 001). Adding PCT to the existing clinical criteria of WHO did not improve the sensitivity for diagnosis of pneumonia. PCT was significantly higher in children with severe pneumonia. Conclusion Positive PCT (> 0.5 ng/mL) is significantly associated with radiographic pneumonia but not with pneumonia based on WHO criteria.However, it can act as a surrogate marker for severe pneumonia.

AB  - Increased CD44 antigen activity has been reported in recurrent cases of UBC. To date, no reliable biomarker is available with high significance and specificity for non-invasive detection of UBC. This study aimed to identify a CD44-linked microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-9, miR-34a, miR-203) for non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer from other urinary tract malignancies. The expression of CD44-linked miRNAs was examined in serum, urine, and tissue specimens of Indian UBC patients (N = 25). For this purpose, healthy subjects (N = 25) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (N = 10) patients were taken as controls. The relative expression of miRNAs was analyzed in serum, urine, and tissue samples using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was accessed by plotting ROC curve. Increased miR-9 expression was observed in serum of UBC patients than healthy and BPH controls. In UBC patients, miR-34a expression was lower than healthy controls but non-significant as compared to BPH. miR-203 expression was considerably higher in serum of UBC patients but non-significant as compared to BPH controls. miR-203 was found to be considerably higher in urine samples from UBC patients as compared to BPH and healthy controls. The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was evaluated using the ROC curve. Higher miR-203 levels in the urine of Indian UBC patients demonstrate its non-invasive diagnostic ability out of the three miRNAs studied. Our results characterize the non-invasive diagnostic potential of CD44-linked miR-203 in the urine of Indian UBC patients, which could be utilized in clinical settings in future after validation in larger patient cohort.

AB  - Femtosecond laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) is associated with the creation of cavitation gas bubbles in the stromal dissection plane. Intraoperative intracameral migration of these air bubbles is a rare complication observed during the procedure. At present, it is postulated that the air bubbles created during the photodisruptive process migrate into the anterior chamber via the Schlemm???s canal and trabecular meshwork. This theory; however, does not explain the extremely rare occurrence of this complication. Recently, the preDescemet???s layer (PDL) and the presence of fenestrations in its periphery have been described in literature. We present an alternative pathomechanism for intracameral air bubble migration during FS-LASIK based on the anatomical relationship of fenestrations in the peripheral PDL and the termination of Descemet membrane. We propose that the air bubbles migrate directly from the laser dissection plane into the anterior chamber via the fenestrations in the peripheral PDL in cases where the Descemet membrane terminates proximal to the fenestrations. The anatomical variability in the termination of the Descemet membrane in relation to the fenestrations in the peripheral PDL may explain why the complication is not observed in a significant proportion of cases where the LASIK flap border lies in close proximity to the limbus.

AB  - Introduction: Application of stereotaxy frame for gamma knife under local anesthesia creates anxiety and phobia in many patients. Vasovagal syncopal attacks and events of bradycardia are not infrequently seen. We tried to analyse the various factors affecting these events and set standards and safety recommendations for the procedure.Materials and methods: This prospective study was carried out in Gamma Knife Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi over a 6 month period between June, 2021-November, 2021. All patients coming to Gamma knife for various etiologies were asked to fill Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) before frame application. Baseline pulse rate was evaluated and with every pin application pulse rate was recorded. A VAS (visual analogue scale) for pain was also administered after the procedure. Twenty percent fall in pulse rate were considered as significant bradycardia. Intraprocedural syncopal events were also recorded.Results: A total of 141 patients were studied of which 6% patients had intraprocedural syncopal attacks requiring medical treatment while 32% patients had bradycardia. Having previous surgery, having breakfast before the procedure, duration of pin application, quantity of local anaesthetia, primary diagnosis, sex of patients were not found to alter the syncope or bradycardia events. Patients who were found anxious (score > 18 on HAM-A) had a significantly higher risk of having a procedural event. Previous history of syncope was also associated with 1.7 times more chances of developing Intraprocedural bradycardia.Conclusions: Frame application for gamma-knife is a relatively safe procedure however procedure rooms should be equipped with emergency drugs and fluids for management of syncope. A Simple anxiety questionnaire can predict 'at risk' patients' for procedural events

AB  - Purpose Primary objective of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the potential of a range of qualitative and quantitative multiparametric features assessed on T-2, post-contrast T-1, DWI, DCE-MRI, and susceptibility-weighted-imaging (SWI) in differentiating evenly sampled cohort of primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma (PCNSL) vs glioblastoma (GB) with pathological validation. Methods The study included MRI-data of histopathologically confirmed ninety-five GB and PCNSL patients scanned at 3.0 T MRI. A total of six qualitative features (three from T-2 and post-contrast T-1, three from SWI: thin-linear-uninterrupted-intra-tumoral-vasculature, broken-intra-tumoral-microvasculature, hemorrhage) were analyzed by three independent radiologists. Ten quantitative features from DWI and DCE-MRI were computed using in-house-developed algorithms. For qualitative features, Cohen's Kappa-interrater-variability-analysis was performed. Z-test and independent t-tests were performed to find significant qualitative and quantitative features respectively. Logistic-regression (LR) classifiers were implemented for evaluating performance of individual and various combinations of features in differentiating PCNSL vs GB. Performance evaluation was done via ROC-analysis. Pathological validation was performed to verify disintegration of vessel walls in GB and rim of viable neoplastic lymphoid cells with angiocentric-pattern in PCNSL. Results Three qualitative SWI features and four quantitative DCE-MRI features (rCBVcorr, K-ep, V-e, and necrosis-volume-percentage) were significantly different (p < 0.05) between PCNSL and GB. Best diagnostic performance was observed with LR classifier using SWI features (AUC-0.99). The inclusion of quantitative features with SWI feature did not improve the differentiation accuracy. Conclusions The combination of three qualitative SWI features using LR provided the highest accuracy in differentiating PCNSL and GB. Thin-linear-uninterrupted-intra-tumoral-vasculature in PCNSL and broken-intra-tumoral-microvasculature with hemorrhage in GB are the major contributors to the differentiation.

AB  - Background Differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) in the paediatric population differ from that of their adult counterparts in terms of clinicopathological characteristics and treatment outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence of various genetic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of sporadic paediatric DTCs. Methods This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Systematic searches were made on the PubMed and Embase databases using relevant keywords, and articles published until October 15, 2021 were selected. Data on the prevalence of various genetic alterations were extracted from the individual articles. Random-effects model was employed for meta-analysis to generate pooled estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results Thirty-three articles comprising 1,380 paediatric patients were included. RET rearrangement (pooled prevalence: 24.4%, 95% CI: 19.1-30.1) was observed to be the most common genetic alteration in sporadic paediatric DTCs, closely followed by BRAF point mutation (pooled prevalence: 21.2%, 95% CI: 17.2-25.5). Other common alterations included: NTRK rearrangement (pooled prevalence: 13.5%, 95% CI: 9.5-17.9) and DICER1 mutation (pooled prevalence: 12.5%, 95% CI: 3.6-25.7). RAS and TERT mutations were observed to be relatively uncommon (pooled prevalence: 5.7%, 95% CI: 2.9-9.3, and 2.2%, 95% CI: 0.4-5.5, respectively). There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusions Fusion oncogenes are noted to be the major oncogenic drivers in sporadic paediatric DTCs and underlie their unique behaviour. However, despite the relatively lower frequency of BRAF point mutation compared to adults, it remains a major player in childhood DTCs.

AB  - A 6-year-old girl presented with a difficult to control epilepsy syndrome. On evaluation, additional presyncope episodes associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia were also noted. A diagnosis of early repolarization syndrome (ERS) was made with an early repolarization pattern on electrocardiogram, documented VT episodes, and clinical presyncope (proposed Shanghai score 7). Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) was also noted on 24-h Holter recordings. The child was stabilized with isoprenaline infusion and was later discharged with arrhythmia control on quinidine and cilostazol. The genetic evaluation revealed a potassium channel KCND3 gene missense mutation. The case highlights the association of epilepsy syndrome and AF with ERS; the possible association of KCND3 gene mutation with a malignant phenotype; and management issues in a small child.

AB  - Objectives: The genetic basis for the spread of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium is largely unexplored in India. The present study aimed to investigate the plasmid diversity and variation of Tn 1546 associated with van A harbouring VREfm isolates. Methods: A total of 122 VREfm isolates collected from blood cultures were included in this study. MLST analysis was performed on all isolates, and they were also screened for the presence of van A and van B genes. Whole genome sequencing was performed for a subset of fifteen VREfm isolates belonging to ST1643. Results: All of the 122 VREfm isolates carried the van A gene. Twenty-four different sequence types were seen; of these, ST1643, ST80 and ST17 were predominant. Whole genome sequencing was performed on 15 VREfm isolates belonging to ST1643. For eight isolates the van A gene was found on pRUM-like circular plasmids, and for the remaining seven isolates, the van A gene was found on the linear plasmids. Novel Tn 1546 variants carrying van A were found on both circular and linear plasmids. Interestingly, co-presence of van A and optr A were seen in the backbone of three linear plasmids. Conclusion: Multiple van A-carrying plasmids and Tn 1546 -like elements were involved in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance in VREfm. The co-occurrence of Tn 1546 carrying van A and Tn 554 family transposon carrying optr A on the backbone of plasmids is worrisome. The dissemination of such plasmids may pose treatment and infection control challenges. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - A novel pyranopyrazole-based Schiff base PPS has been synthesized via a condensation reaction between aldehyde and hydrazide derivatives of pyranopyrazole. The probe acted as a selective and sensitive chemosensor for the colorimetric detection of arginine under aqueous conditions with a detection limit of 1.8 x 10(-5) M. The 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry was established using various UV-vis spectroscopic methods. A plausible binding mechanism of PPS towards arginine was established via H-1 NMR titration techniques and the results were further validated using DFT studies. Moreover, PPS provided a reasonable response for arginine in dietary supplements and human blood plasma which demonstrates its potential application in real sample analysis as well.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is increasingly recognised as being responsible for a substantial proportion of the global burden of disease. Neurosurgical interventions are an important aspect of care for patients with TBI, but there is little epidemiological data available on this patient population. We aimed to characterise differences in casemix, management, and mortality of patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI across different levels of human development.
   Methods We did a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive patients with TBI undergoing emergency neurosurgery, in a convenience sample of hospitals identified by open invitation, through international and regional scientific societies and meetings, individual contacts, and social media. Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI in each hospital's 30-day study period were all eligible for inclusion, with the exception of patients undergoing insertion of an intracranial pressure monitor only, ventriculostomy placement only, or a procedure for drainage of a chronic subdural haeinatoma. The primary outcome was mortality at 14 days postoperatively (or last point of observation if the patient was discharged before this time point). Countries were stratified according to their Human Development Index (HDI)-a composite of life expectancy, education, and income measures-into very high HDI, high HDI, medium HDI, and low HDI tiers. Mixed effects logistic regression was used to examine the effect of HDI on mortality while accounting for and quantifying between-hospital and between-country variation.
   Findings Our study included 1635 records from 159 hospitals in 57 countries, collected between Nov 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. 328 (20%) records were from countries in the very high HDI tier, 539 (33%) from countries in the high HDI tier, 614 (38%) from countries in the medium HDI tier, and 154 (9%) from countries in the low HDI tier. The median age was 35 years (IQR 24-51), with the oldest patients in the very high HDI tier (median 54 years, IQR 34-69) and the youngest in the low HDI tier (median 28 years, IQR 20-38). The most common procedures were elevation of a depressed skull fracture in the low HDI tier (69 [45%]), evacuation of a supratentorial extradural haematoma in the medium HDI tier (189 [31%]) and high HDI tier (173 [32%]), and evacuation of a supratentorial acute subdural haematoma in the very high HDI tier (155 [47%]). Median time from injury to surgery was 13 h (IQR 6-32). Overall mortality was 18% (299 of 1635). After adjustment for casernix, the odds of mortality were greater in the medium HDI tier (odds ratio [OR] 2.84, 95% CI 1.55-5.2) and high HDI tier (2.26, 1.23-4.15), but not the low HDI tier (1.66, 0.61-4.46), relative to the very high HDI tier. There was significant between-hospital variation in mortality (median OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.17-2.49).
   Interpretation Patients receiving emergency neurosurgery for TBI differed considerably in their admission characteristics and management across human development settings. Level of human development was associated with mortality. Substantial opportunities to improve care globally were identified, including reducing delays to surgery. Between-hospital variation in mortality suggests changes at an institutional level could influence outcome and comparative effectiveness research could identify best practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND:During the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of surveys have analyzed the impact virus spreading on the everyday medical practice, including neurosurgery. However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time.METHODS:From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed.RESULTS:Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities.CONLCUSION:Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved. Financial concerns overshadow mental health.

KW  - OUTCOMES
AB  - IMPORTANCE Cumulative exposure to high blood pressure (BP) is an adverse prognostic marker. Assessments of BP control over time, such as time at target, have been developed but assessments of the effects of BP-lowering interventions on such measures are lacking.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether low-dose triple combination antihypertensive therapy was associated with greater rates of time at target compared with usual care.
   Design, Setting, and Participants The Triple Pill vs Usual Care Management for Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial was a open-label randomized clinical trial of low-dose triple BP therapy vs usual care conducted in urban hospital clinics in Sri Lanka from February 2016 to May 2017. Adults with hypertension (systolic BP >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg or in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, systolic BP >130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg) requiring initiation (untreated patients) or escalation (patients receiving monotherapy) of antihypertensive therapy were included. Patients were excluded if they were currently taking 2 or more blood pressure-lowering drugs or had severe or uncontrolled blood pressure, accelerated hypertension or physician-determined need for slower titration of treatment, a contraindication to the triple combination pill therapy, an unstable medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory values deemed by researchers to be unsuitable for the study. All 700 individuals in the original trial were included in the secondary analysis. This post hoc analysis was conducted from December 2020 to December 2021.
   INTERVENTION Once-daily fixed-dose triple combination pill (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and chlorthalidone 12.5 mg) therapy vs usual care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Between-group differences in time at target were compared over 24 weeks of follow-up, with time at target defined as percentage of time at target BP.
   Results There were a total of 700 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 56 [11] years; 403 [57.6%] women). Patients allocated to the triple pill group (n = 349) had higher time at target compared with those in the usual care group (n = 351) over 24 weeks' follow-up (64% vs 43%; risk difference, 21%; 95% CI, 16-26; P < .001). Almost twice as many patients receiving triple pill therapy achieved more than 50% time at target during follow-up (64% vs 37%; P < .001). The association of the triple pill with an increase in time at target was seen early, with most patients achieving more than 50% time at target by 12 weeks. Those receiving the triple pill achieved a consistently higher time at target at all follow-up periods compared with those receiving usual care (mean [SD]: 0-6 weeks, 36.3% [30.9%] vs 21.7% [28.9%]; P < .001; 6-12 weeks, 5.2% [31.9%] vs 33.7% [33.0%]; P < .001; 12-24 weeks, 66.0% [31.1%] vs 43.5% [34.3%]; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this analysis provides the first estimate of time at target as an outcome assessing longitudinal BP control in a randomized clinical trial. Among patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with a low-dose triple combination pill was associated with substantially higher time at target compared with usual care.

AB  - Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using biomarkers in order to identify the risk of progressing to active TB and therefore predicting a preventive therapy has been the main bottleneck in eradication of tuberculosis. We compared two assays for the diagnosis of LTBI: transcript signatures and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), among household contacts (HHCs) in a high tuberculosis-burden population. HHCs of active TB cases were recruited for our study; these were confirmed to be clinically negative for active TB disease. Eighty HHCs were screened by IGRA using QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) to identify LTBI and uninfected cohorts; further, quantitative levels of transcript for selected six genes (TNERSF10C, ASUN, NEMF, FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5) were determined. Machine learning (ML) was used to construct models of different gene combinations, with a view to identify hidden but significant underlying patterns of their transcript levels. Forty-three HHCs were found to be IGRA positive (LTBI) and thirty-seven were IGRA negative (uninfected). FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5 transcripts differentiated LTBI from uninfected among HHCs using Livak method. ML and ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) analysis validated this transcript signature to have a specificity of 72.7%. In this study, we compared a quantitative transcript signature with IGRA to assess the diagnostic ability of the two, for detection of LTBI cases among HHCs of a high-TB burden population; we concluded that a three gene (FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5) transcript signature can be used as a biomarker for rapid screening.
   IMPORTANCE The study compares potential of transcript signature and IGRA to diagnose LTBI. It is first of its kind study to screen household contacts (HHCs) in high TB burden area of India. A transcript signature (FCGR1B, GBP1, & GBP5) is identified as potential biomarker for LTBI. These results can lead to development of point-of-care (POC) like device for LTBI screening in a high TB burdened area.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia with normal cytogenetics (CN-AML) is the largest group of AML patients which is associated with a variegated patient outcome. Multiple molecular markers have been used to risk-stratify these patients. Estimation of expression of BAALC gene (Brain and Acute Leukemia, Cytoplasmic) mRNA level is one of the predictive markers which has been identified in multiple studies. In this study, we examined the clinical and prognostic value of BAALC gene expression in 149 adult CN-AML patients. We also utilized multi-omics databases to ascertain the association of BAALC gene expression with comprehensive molecular and clinicopathologic features in AML. BAALC overexpression was associated with CD34 positivity on leukemic blasts (p = 0.0026) and the absence of NPM1 gene mutation (p < 0.0001), presence of RUNX1 gene mutation (p < 0.001) and poor patient outcomes, particularly in NPM1-wild type/FLT3-ITD negative adult CN-AML patients. Additionally, BAALC expression was associated with the alteration of methylation of its promoter. Further, pathway analysis revealed that BAALC expression is correlated with MYC targets and Ras signalling. We conclude that high BAALC expression associates with poor patient outcome in NPM1-wild type/FLT3-ITD negative adult CN-AML patients.

AB  - Purpose: The key element in managing postoperative facial nerve (FN) injuries is timely diagnosis and intervention as indicated. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare evoked electromyography (EEMG) and clinical assessment in terms of the recovery of the injured FN in operated temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) cases.
   Methods: The investigators designed a prospective cohort study in the primary operated TMJA patients. The primary predictor variable was the technique used to assess FN function, House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System (HBFNGS) or EEMG. The primary outcome variable was time to FN recovery. The FN recovery was assessed in different time points (1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). Age, gender, side (unilateral/bilateral), type of ankylosis (Sawhney's classification), and operating time were kept as covariates. Categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Multilevel survival analysis was performed considering the subject as cluster to perform Kaplan-Meier analysis and compute the hazards ratio using the Cox-regression method with adjustment for covariates. P<0.05 was set as statistically significant.
   Results: The study sample composed of 43 (69 sides) TMJA cases who underwent surgery developed iatrogenic FN injury in 10 cases (14 sides [9 right; 5 left]). The incidence of FN injury was 20.3% (14/69). Sawhey's type III/type IV ankylosis and the operating time for more than 2 hours showed a statistically significant (p<0.05) increase in FN injury. The mean duration to detect FN recovery by EEMG was 9 days (95% confidence interval, 5 to 12 days), but the HBFNGS took 161 days (95% confidence interval, 141 to 181 days). The chance of early detection by EEMG was 18.6 times more than the chance by the HBFNGS (Cox-hazard ratio, 18.6).
   Conclusions: To conclude, EEMG is a noninvasive and reliable tool that detects FN recovery much earlier than the HBFNGS in the postoperative TMJA cases. (C) 2021 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant, opportunistic, nosocomial pathogen for which a new line of treatments is desperately needed. We have targeted the enzyme of the first step of the histidine biosynthesis pathway, viz., ATP-phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT). The three-dimensional structure of ATP-PRT was predicted on the template of the known three-dimensional structure of ATP-PRT from Psychrobacter arcticus (PaATPPRT) using a homology modeling approach. High-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) of the antibacterial library of Life Chemicals Inc., Ontario, Canada was carried out followed by molecular dynamics simulations of the top hit compounds. In silico results were then biochemically validated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. We found that two compounds, namely, F0843-0019 and F0608-0626, were binding with micromolar affinities to the ATPphosphoribosyltransferase from Acinetobacter baumannii (AbATPPRT). Both of these compounds were binding in the same way as AMP in PaATPPRT, and the important residues of the active site, viz., Val4, Ser72, Thr76, Tyr77, Glu95, Lys134, Val136, and Tyr156, were also interacting via hydrogen bonds. The calculated binding energies of these compounds were -10.5 kcal/mol and -11.1 kcal/mol, respectively. These two compounds can be used as the potential lead molecules for designing antibacterial compounds in the future, and this information will help in drug discovery programs against Acinetobacter worldwide.

AB  - The Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein kinase K regulates growth adaptation by facilitating mycobacterial survival in response to a variety of in vitro and in vivo stress conditions. Here, we further add that pknK transcription is responsive to carbon and nitrogen starvation signals. The increased survival of an M. tuberculosis Delta pknK mutant strain under carbon- and nitrogen-limiting growth conditions compared to the wild-type (WT) H37Rv suggests an integral role of PknK in regulating growth during metabolic stress. To identify the downstream targets of PknK-mediated signaling, we compared phosphoproteomic and transcription profiles of mycobacterial strains overexpressing WT and phosphorylation-defective PknK. Results implicate PknK as a signaling protein that can regulate several enzymes involved in central metabolism, transcription regulation, and signal transduction. A key finding of this study was the identification of two essential two-component response regulator (RR) proteins, PrrA and MtrA, and Rho transcription terminator, as unique targets for PknK. We confirm that PknK interacts with and phosphorylates PrrA, MtrA, and Rho in vivo. PknK-mediated phosphorylation of MtrA appears to increase binding of the RR to the cognate probe DNA. However, dual phosphorylation of MtrA and PrrA response regulators by PknK and their respective cognate sensor kinases in vitro showed nominal additive effect on the mobility of the protein-DNA complex, suggesting the presence of a potential fine-tuning of the signal transduction pathway which might respond to multiple cues.
   IMPORTANCE Networks of gene regulation and signaling cascades are fundamental to the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in adapting to the continuously changing intracellular environment in the host. M. tuberculosis protein kinase K is a transcription regulator that responds to diverse environmental signals and facilitates stress-induced growth adaptation in culture and during infection. This study identifies multiple signaling interactions of PknK and provides evidence that PknK can change the transcriptional landscape during growth transitions by connecting distinctly different signal transduction and regulatory pathways essential for mycobacterial survival.

AB  - Background Data of neurocognitive deficits in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is scarce from low middle-income countries (LMICs), and is influenced by biological and cultural variations. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence and spectrum of neurocognitive deficits in a cohort of survivors from India. Procedure Seventy survivors of childhood ALL were evaluated for neurocognitive deficits by the Indian adaptation of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Fourth Edition (WISC-IVINDIA). The prevalence of neurocognitive deficits was calculated based on the full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), and scores in discrete domains like verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed were calculated and compared to demographics, treatment, and sociocultural factors. Results The mean (SD) current age and time since diagnosis was 10.5 (+/- 3.2) years and 5 (+/- 2.8) years, respectively. The mean FSIQ was 86.1 +/- 20.5, with significant neurocognitive deficit (FSIQ <90) being prevalent in 50% (95% CI: 38%-62%) of the cohort. The proportion of survivors with deficits in individual domains of verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed were 49%, 50%, 47%, and 44%, respectively. The odds of having neurocognitive deficits were higher when a child belonged to lower socioeconomic strata (OR 5.7, p = .004), parents with lower education attainment (OR 4.3, p = .041), and whose birth order was higher (OR 20.1, p = .005). Age at diagnosis/assessment, chemotherapy received, or dose of radiotherapy did not have a direct impact on neurocognition. Conclusions and relevance Rates of neurocognitive deficits are higher in survivors in LMICs, with socioeconomic variables contributing more than the direct neurotoxic effects of treatment.

AB  - The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is yet to be controlled worldwide, especially in India. The second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) led to panic and confusion in India, owing to the overwhelming number of the population that fell prey to this highly infectious virus of recent times. In the second wave of COVID-19, the patients had to fight both the virus and opportunistic infections triggered by fungi and bacteria. Repeated use of steroids, antibiotics, and oxygen masks during the management of severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients nurtured opportunistic infections such as mucormycosis. Despite mucormycosis being a decades-old disease, it has gained notice of its widespread occurrence in COVID-19 patients throughout India. Instances of mucormycosis are usually unearthed in immunocompromised individuals and are caused by the inhalation of filamentous fungi, either from the natural environment or through supportive care units. In the recent outbreak during the second wave of COVID-19 in India, it has been seen to cause secondary infection as it grows along with the treatment of COVID-19. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as diabetes were more likely to have the mucormycosis co-infection because of their challenged immune systems' inability to fight it. Despite the hype, mucormycosis still remains neglected and least studied, which is predominantly due to all focus on diagnostics, vaccine, and therapeutic research. In this review, we emphasize mainly on the association of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. We also present the molecular mechanism of mucormycosis for a better understanding of the fungal infections in patients who have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Better understanding of fungal pathogens, immediate diagnosis, and management of the infections are crucial in COVID19 patients, as high mortalities have been recorded in co-infected patients despite recovery from COVID-19.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT). DESIGN: Parallel arm, single masked, randomized con -trolled trial. METHODS: Sixty patients with ocular hypertension and IOP > 21 and < 30 mmHg were recruited at a tertiary eye care centre in India. Thirty patients (group 1) under-went six weeks of one hour daily MBSR sessions, while the other 30 patients (group 2) were waitlisted and kept on follow-up. The primary outcome was change in IOP (delta IOP) after six weeks of MBSR. Secondary outcomes were effect on serum cortisol level, diurnal variation of IOP, vessel perfusion and vessel density on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: At six weeks, a significant decrease in IOP was noted in group 1 (23.05 +/- 1.17 to 19.15 +/- 1.45 mmHg; P = .001) compared with group 2 (22.55 +/- 0.98 mmHg to 22.37 +/- 1.07 mmHg; P = .107). The AIOP was significantly greater in group 1 (3.93 +/- 1.47) than group 2 (0.17 +/- 0.58; P = .001). The diurnal fluctuaion of IOP decreased in group 1 (4.87 +/- 1.13 mmHg to 2.73 +/- 0.98 mmHg; P = .001) as compared with group 2 (4.50 +/- 0.86 mmHg to 4.30 +/- 0.83 mmHg; P = .227). Significant improvement in vessel perfusion, vessel den-sity, and flux index was noted on OCTA in group 1 com-pared with group 2. Group 1 showed a significant de-crease ( P <= .001) in serum cortisol level and an improved QOL ( P = .001). CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based stress reduction was associated with a significant decrease in IOP and serum cortisol, along with an improvement in optic nerve head perfusion and QOL. Mindfulness-based stress reduction can be considered as a potential treatment option in the management of OHT. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

   Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with CP to assess the prevalence of malnutrition as per the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Multivariable-adjusted regression was used to identify independent predictors of both malnutrition and global QoL.
   Results: A total of 297 patients were included and the most common etiology of CP was idiopathic (75%) and alcohol (25%). The prevalence of malnutrition was 46.4% as per GLIM criteria. On univariate analysis, the risk of malnutrition was significantly higher in alcoholic etiology (p = 0.001), current alcohol consumption (p = 0.001), smokers (p < 0.001), those having higher cumulative days of pain in last 6 months (p < 0.001) and lower daily calorie intake (p = 0.019). On multivariate analysis, malnutrition was independently associated with current alcohol consumption (Odds ratio: 3.22, p = 0.017), current smokers (OR: 2.23, p = 0.042) and those having higher cumulative days of abdominal pain (OR: 1.01, p < 0.001), while higher daily calorie intake (per 100 kcal) (OR:0.94, p = 0.023) has reduced risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition (p = 0.015) and higher cumulative days of abdominal pain (p < 0.001) were independently associated with lower global QoL in patients with CP.
   Conclusion: Malnutrition is frequent in patients with CP; and current alcohol consumption, smoking and higher cumulative days of abdominal pain independently predicts risk of developing malnutrition. Patients with malnutrition and higher cumulative days of pain has poorer quality of life. (C) 2022 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 can cause acute pancreatitis (AP) and SARS-CoV-2 superinfection can occur in patients with AP during prolonged hospitalisation. Our objective was to characterize SARS-CoV-2 related AP and study the impact of SARS-CoV-2 superinfection on outcomes in AP.
   Methods: In this multicentre prospective study, all patients with AP and SARS-CoV-2 infection between August 2020 and February 2021 were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-related AP and superadded SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with AP. The two groups were compared with each other and the whole cohort was compared with a non-COVID AP cohort.
   Results: A total of 85 patients with SARS-CoV-2 and AP (SARS-CoV-2-related AP; n = 18 and AP with SARS-CoV-2 superadded infection; n = 67) were included during the study period. They had a higher mortality [28 (32.9%) vs. 44 (19.1%), aOR 2.8 (95% CI, 1.5-5.3)] than 230 propensity matched non-COVID AP patients. Mortality in SARS-CoV-2 and AP patients was due to critical COVID. SARS-CoV-2-related-AP (n = 18) had a higher but statistically insignificant mortality than SARS-CoV-2 superinfection in AP [8/18 (44.4%) vs 20/67 (29.8%), p = 0.24]. On multivariable analysis, infection with SARS-CoV-2 (aHR 2.3; 95% CI, 1.43.7) was a predictor of in-hospital mortality in addition to organ failure (OF) in patients with AP.
   Conclusion: Patients with AP and SARS-CoV-2 infection had a higher mortality than matched non-COVID AP patients which was largely attributable to the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 related AP had higher OF and in-hospital mortality. (C) 2022 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Heterogeneous Ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD) is an RNA binding protein involved in post-transcriptional regulation of multiple mediators of carcinogenesis. We previously demonstrated a strong association of hnRNPD over expression with poor outcome in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). However, hitherto the precise molecular mechanism of its overexpression in oral cancer was not clear. Therefore, in an attempt to elucidate the transcriptional regulation of hnRNPD expression, we cloned 1406 bp of 5' flanking region of human hnRNPD gene along with 257 bp of its first exon upstream to promoterless luciferase reporter gene in pGL3-Basic. Transfection of the resulting construct in SCC-4 cells yielded 1271 fold higher luciferase activity over parent vector. By promoter deletion analysis, we identified a canonical TATA box containing 126 bp core promoter region that retained - 58% activity of the full length promoter. In silico analysis revealed the presence of four putative NF kappa B binding motifs in the promoter. Sequential deletion of these motifs from the full-length promoter reporter construct coupled with luciferase assays revealed an 82% decrease in promoter activity after deletion of the first (-1358/-1347) motif and 99% reduction after the deletion of second motif (-1052/-1041). In-vivo binding of NF kappa B (ReIA) to these two motifs in SCC-4 cells was confirmed by ChIP assays. Site directed mutagenesis of even one of these two motifs completely abolished promoter activity, while mutagenesis of the remaining two motifs had marginal effect on the same. Consistent with these findings, treatment of SCC-4 cells with PDTC, a known inhibitor of NF kappa B dramatically reduced the levels hnRNPD mRNA and protein. Finally, the expression of hnRNPD and NF kappa B in clinical specimen from 37 oral cancer patients was assessed and subjected to Spearmen's Correlation analysis which revealed a strong positive correlation between the two. Thus, results of the present study for the first time convincingly demonstrate NF kappa B (ReIA) mediated transcriptional upregulation of hnRNPD expression in oral cancer.

AB  - Background Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children below 5 years of age. Methods This multisite prospective observational study was carried out in the Pediatrics' out-patient departments of 5 medical colleges across India with an objective to assess the feasibility of establishing Acute Respiratory Infection Treatment Unit (ATU) in urban medical college hospitals. ATU (staffed with a nurse and a medical officer) was established in the out-patient areas at study sites. Children, aged 2-59 months, with cough and/ breathing difficulty for < 14 days were screened by study nurse in the ATU for pneumonia, severe pneumonia or no pneumonia. Diagnosis was verified by study doctor. Children were managed as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The key outcomes were successful establishment of ATUs, antibiotic usage, treatment outcomes. Results ATUs were successfully established at the 5 study sites. Of 18,159 under-five children screened, 7026 (39%) children were assessed to have ARI. Using the WHO criteria, 938 were diagnosed as pneumonia (13.4%) and of these, 347 (36.9%) had severe pneumonia. Ambulatory home-based management was done in 6341 (90%) children with ARI; of these, 16 (0.25%) required admission because of non-response or deterioration on follow-up. Case-fatality rate in severe pneumonia was 2%. Nearly 12% of children with 'no pneumonia' received antibiotics. Conclusions Setting up of ATUs dedicated to management of ARI in children was feasible in urban medical colleges. The observed case fatality, and rate of unnecessary use of antibiotics were lower than that reported in literature.

AB  - Peripheral microcystoid retinal degeneration (PMD) is an age-related, benign condition in which the peripheral retina develops small holes and undergoes cystic degeneration. This paper demonstrates neuronal alterations in PMD, as studied by immunohistochemistry in postmortem donor eyes (age: 76-89 years; N = 6 donors). In all cases, the degeneration was located in the inferior temporal quadrant, creating holes in the far peripheral retina. There was thinning of the inner retinal layers and the outer plexiform layer (OPL) was patchy or inconspicuous. As a response, Muller cell processes showed increased vimentin immunoreactivity. None of the retinas examined expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein. Cone photoreceptor cells were significantly altered: compared to the adjoining cones that were short, those located in the cystoid retina underwent significant elongation of their inner segments, evident from calbindin immunolabeling, to maintain synaptic contacts with the remnant OPL. The latter consisted of small photoreceptor terminals and scanty processes from shrunken bipolar cells. Besides, cones and ganglion cells undergo oxidative stress, they showed immunoreactivity to 4-hydroxy 2-nonenal and nitrotyrosine. The level of superoxide dismutase-2 was relatively low in the PMD region than in adjacent area, suggesting that the former suffers from oxidative stress.

AB  - Objective: We estimated the prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors among young adults with type 1 diabetes and compared them with the general population without diabetes.
   Methods: Participants were young adults (aged 20 years and above) with type 1 diabetes, from the Delhi and Chennai sites of the ICMR -Young Diabetes Registry (YDR) and their age, gender and location matched controls, without diabetes from the CARRS (Cardio metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia) cohort. YDR and CARRS used similar standard methodologies to quantify the CVD risk factors. Linear and logistic regression models were used to compare the adjusted means and proportions of risk factors.
   Results: Individuals with type 1 diabetes had lower levels of mean BMI (21.9 kg/m2 vs 24.3 kg/m2), waist circumference (76.8 cm vs 82.1 cm), favourable lipid profile (lower LDL and higher HDL), higher mean systolic blood pressure (122.1 mmHg vs 118.7 mmHg) and hypertension (29.2% vs 21.0%), compared to controls. The extent of clustering of two or more traditional CVD risk factors was higher among general population compared to people with type 1 diabetes.
   Conclusion: We found that young adults with type 1 diabetes have relatively low prevalence and clustering of traditional CVD risk factors compared to general population.

AB  - Aim The present study sought to study the imaging associations of left atrioventricular valve (mitral) atresia and patent aortic root in patients with isomerism of atrial appendages as detected on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography Materials and Methods The CT angiography studies performed at a tertiary medical center from January 2014 to December 2021 were retrospectively evaluated to identify patients with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with isometric atrial chambers. The morphology of the atrial appendage and extent of pectinate muscles was used to identify the type of isomeric atrial chambers. A comprehensive assessment of discordant arrangement of organs and the variations in venoatrial connections was done. Results Left atrioventricular valve atresia in the presence of patent aortic root and isomeric atrial appendages was identified in eight patients (four males). The mean age at diagnosis was 7 years. Right isomerism of the atrial appendages was seen in five patients while three patients had left isomerism. Disharmonious patterns of abdominal visceral arrangement were seen in two patients. Atrial and ventricular septal defects were seen in all patients. The most common pattern of ventricular arterial connection was DORV (double outlet right ventricle) (n = 4). While five patients had normally related great arteries, three had aorta anterior to the pulmonary trunk. Right ventricular outflow obstruction was seen in seven patients. Right aortic arch with mirror image branching was seen in four patients. Coronary artery anomalies were seen in four patients. Conclusions The presence of left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with isomeric atrial appendages is a rare congenital anomaly frequently associated with anomalous systemic and pulmonary drainage, conotruncal anomalies, and right ventricular outflow obstruction. Hence, comprehensive CT-based evaluation is indispensable in providing detailed anatomy and aids in presurgical planning.

AB  - Hyperthermia inhibits DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair that utilizes homologous recombination (HR) pathway by a poorly defined mechanism(s); however, themechanisms for this inhibition remain unclear. Here we report that hyperthermia decreases H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac), an epigenetic modification essential for genome stability and transcription. Heat-induced reduction in H4K16ac was detected in humans, Drosophila, and yeast, indicating that this is a highly conserved response. The examination of histone deacetylase recruitment to chromatin after heat-shock identified SIRT1 as the major deacetylase subsequently enriched at gene-rich regions. Heat-induced SIRT1 recruitment was antagonized by chromatin remodeler SMARCAD1 depletion and, like hyperthermia, the depletion of the SMARCAD1 or combination of the two impaired DNA end resection and increased replication stress. Altered repair protein recruitment was associated with heat-shock-induced gamma-H2AX chromatin changes and DSB repair processing. These results support a novel mechanismwhereby hyperthermia impacts chromatin organization owing to H4K16ac deacetylation, negatively affecting the HR-dependent DSB repair.

AB  - Background Immunophenotypic profile and post-therapy alteration in antigenic expression were evaluated in normal, reactive, and aberrant plasma cells (NPC, RPC, and APC) for impact on measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment in multiple myeloma (MM). Methods Samples from non-MM staging marrow (n = 30), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 30) and MM (n = 724) were prospectively evaluated for expression profiles of NPC, RPC, and APC using antigens recommended in consensus guidelines. Results Polyclonal NPC-RPC demonstrated aberrations for all antigens evaluated with a higher frequency of aberrancies in post-therapy samples compared to treatment naive samples (p < 0.001%). Immunomodulation in APC was observed in 79% of post-therapy samples with a change in expression of 1, 2, and >= 3 antigens in 19.9%, 15.6%, and 43.5% samples, respectively. In 13.4% of samples, APC showed no aberrancy and aberrant status was assigned based on cytoplasmic light chain restriction (cyLCR) alone. 9% samples with an admixture of NPC and APC displayed normal cytoplasmic kappa to lambda ratio (cyKLR) when the percentage of APC of total PC (neoplastic plasma cell index, NPCI), was below 25% and 50% for kappa and lambda restricted cases, respectively. Conclusion The panorama and high frequency of antigenic aberrations on polyclonal PC signify the importance of MRD assay validation on a large cohort under normal and reactive conditions. Frequent Immunophenotypic shifts in APC re-confirm the redundancy of baseline immunophenotype for MRD evaluation. Small clones of APC may be missed by assessment of cyKLR alone and therefore, surface marker aberrancy supported by cyLCR is required for definitive assignment of residual APC.

AB  - A novel third order nonlinear organic single crystal (E)-2-(4-dimethylamino) benzylidine-3, 4dihyronapthalen-1(2H)-one (DMBH) which adapts to triclinic space group P2(1)/n is crystallized by slow evaporation technique. Comprehensive investigations on linear optical properties have been performed. The thermal stability without any loss of weight has been performed. The molecular structure of DMBH was confirmed by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR analysis. DMBH exhibits minimal activation energy value which makes it suitable for device fabrication. Further B3LYP/6-31G ++ level has been used theoretically to obtain optimized geometry, vibrational frequency, static first-order hyperpolarizability parameter. The functional groups of FT-IR and FT-Raman were compared with experimental and theoretical results and it was found to be in good concordance. Electron Localization Function (ELF) and Localized Orbital Locator (LOL) were attained from Multiwfn software to study the reactive sites of DMBH. Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) levels help to understand the delocalization of the charges in DMBH. LDT (Laser Damage Threshold) studies proclaim the suitability of the title compound for nonlinear optical applications. The experimental and theoretical reports suggest that DMBH is 406 times better than urea and other chalcone derivatives. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Surgeons, when dividing bypass tracts adjacent to the His bundle, considered them to be 'anteroseptal'. The area was subsequently recognized to be superior and paraseptal, although this description is not entirely accurate anatomically, and conveys little about the potential risk during catheter interventions. We now describe the area as being para-Hisian, and it harbours two types of accessory pathways. The first variant crosses the membranous septum to insert into the muscular ventricular septum without exiting the heart, and hence being truly septal. The second variant inserts distally in the paraseptal components of the supraventricular crest, and consequently is crestal. The site of ventricular insertion determines the electrocardiographic expression of pre-excitation during sinus rhythm, with the two types producing distinct patterns. In both instances, the QRS and the delta wave are positive in leads I, II, and aVF. In crestal pathways, however, the QRS is >= 140 ms, and exhibits an rS configuration in V1-2. The delta wave in V1-2 precedes by 20-50 ms the apparent onset of the QRS in I, II, III, and aVF. In the true septal pathways, the QRS complex occupies similar to 120 ms, presenting a QS, W-shaped, morphology in V1-2. The delta wave has a simultaneous onset in all leads. Our proposed terminology facilitates the understanding of the electrocardiographic manifestations of both types of para-Hisian pathways during pre-excitation and orthodromic tachycardia, and informs on the level of risk during catheter ablation.

TI  - A Case of Neonatal Severe Hyperparathyroidism: Challenges in Management
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
KW  - Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR)
KW  - Hypercalcemia
KW  - Total parathyroidectomy
AB  - Neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism is a rare disorder arising from inherited defects in the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) that presents early in life with severe hypercalcemia, failure to thrive, and developmental retardation. The authors describe an infant with neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism due to homozygous CaSR gene mutation presenting with recurrent episodes of severe hypercalcemia, growth retardation, and developmental delay. Medical management served as an effective bridge therapy to surgery. Total parathyroidectomy with right hemithyroidectomy was performed at 7 mo of age and resulted in successful cure and normalization of growth and developmental milestones. Timely medical and surgical management can help prevent mortality and morbidity in the form of neurodevelopmental sequelae. Life-long monitoring and treatment is mandatory for the resultant hypoparathyroidism.

AB  - Development of computer-aided cancer diagnostic tools is an active research area owing to the advancements in deep-learning domain. Such technological solutions provide affordable and easily deployable diagnostic tools. Leukaemia, or blood cancer, is one of the leading cancers causing more than 0.3 million deaths every year. In order to aid the development of such an AI-enabled tool, we collected and curated a microscopic image dataset, namely C-NMC, of more than 15000 cancer cell images at a very high resolution of B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL). The dataset is prepared at the subject-level and contains images of both healthy and cancer patients. So far, this is the largest (as well as curated) dataset on B-ALL cancer in the public domain. CNMC is available at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), USA and can be helpful for the research community worldwide for the development of B-ALL cancer diagnostic tools. This dataset was utilized in an international medical imaging challenge held at ISBI 2019 conference in Venice, Italy. In this paper, we present a detailed description and challenges of this dataset. We also present benchmarking results of all the methods applied so far on this dataset.

TI  - Impact of Taping The Upper Mask Edge On Ocular Surface Stability and Dry Eye Symptoms
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - FACE MASK
KW  - DISEASE
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of taping the upper mask edge on ocular surface stability, dry eye symptomology, and tear osmolarity in N95 mask users.
   DESIGN: Prospective interventional before-and-after study.
   METHODS: Fifty eyes of 50 health care workers regularly using N95 masks were included. Preintervention, ocular surface parameters, subjective dry eye score, and visual acuity were assessed at the end of an 8-hour shift when the subjects used an N95 face mask without taping the upper edge. Next day, the upper edge of the N95 mask was taped to the nasal bridge in all subjects at the beginning of the 8-hour shift, and postintervention assessment was performed after the shift. The primary outcome measure was change in noninvasive tear break-up time (NIBUT). Secondary outcome measures were change in the symptom score, tear lipid layer thickness (LLT), tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I test, tear meniscus height (TMH), osmolarity, and visual acuity.
   RESULTS: Mean age of the cohort was 26.7 +/- 3.67 years. Post-taping, significantly better ocular surface stability was observed in terms of NIBUT (P <.001), TBUT (P <.001), LLT (P <.001), TMH (P =.01), corneal staining score (P =.001), and tear osmolarity (P =.04). There was no significant change in visual acuity, Schirmer I, and Ocular Surface Disease Index score (P >.05). Symptom improvement was reported by 68% patients (SANDE version 2), which correlated well with change in NIBUT (r = 0.38; P =.005), TMH (r = 0.37; P =.007), LLT (r = 0.35; P =.01), and TBUT (r = 0.28; P =.04).
   CONCLUSION: Taping of the upper mask edge resulted in significantly better ocular surface stability, which correlated well with decrease in dry eye symptoms. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pain is a common and highly distressing symptom in children with advanced malignancies and it is often multifactorial at the end-of-life. The prognosis of cancer pain is reported to be worse in those with mixed pain type, high pain severity, daily opioid use, and poor emotional well-being. We describe a case of 13-year-old boy, known case of metastatic Ewing sarcoma right iliac bone, who presented to our palliative care ward with intractable pain and was finally discharged home for terminal care with high doses of morphine, ketamine, and midazolam infusion through elastomeric pump attached to a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC line). The suffering of imminently dying children should be reduced, and judicious dose escalation of opioids along with adjuvants is appropriate and often necessary.

AB  - Aim: This study evaluates the role of low-level laser emission/photobiomodulation (LE/P) in quantitative measurements of root resorption (QRR). The application of LE/P performed after each orthodontic activation with four types of treatment intervention (TI) on the root resorption (RR) after fixed orthodontic treatment (FOT) of the upper arch with ectopic eye tooth/teeth [EET] was investigated. Materials and Methods: Thirty-two orthodontic patients scheduled for FOT were selected and assigned to the four groups. These were LE/P + Self ligating bracket (SLB), LE/P + Conventional bracket (CB), non-photobiomodulation (non-LE/P) + SLB and non-LE/P + CB. Standard management stages of FOT were followed in the maxilla. Each patient received a single application of LE/P labially/buccally and palatally, a total of five different points were used during each activation or appointment. The main outcome measure was QRR in maxillary anteriors before and after FOT, assessed via cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) using 3D OnDemand software. Results: Insignificant QRR was found between before and after FOT in SLB, CLB, and LE/P, non-LE/P groups (p > 0.05). QRR in the SLB vs. CB and LE/P vs. non-LE/P group was significantly different in 11, 13, and 23 (p < 0.05). QRR in the LE/P + SLB group (p < 0.05) was significantly different in 11, 13, and 23 than that in the other groups. The most severe QRR was found on 13 (0.88 +/- 0.28 mm and 0.87 +/- 0.27 mm) and 23 (1.19 +/- 0.14 mm and 1.16 +/- 0.13 mm) in the CB and non-LE/P group (p < 0.001). LE/P + SLB showed a highly significant superior outcome (p < 0.001) in relation to non-LE/P + CB, the QRR of 23 were 0.813 +/- 0.114 mm and 1.156 +/- 0.166 mm, respectively. Conclusion: Significantly higher amounts of QRR were found in EET patients after FOT treated with the CB, non-LE/P, and non-LE/P + CB system and warrant further investigation to explore potential specific causes.

AB  - Background: Despite great advances in medicine, numerous available laboratory markers, and radiological imaging, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis (AA) in some cases still remains controversial and challenging for clinicians. Because of that, clinicians are still looking for an ideal marker that would be specific to AA. The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been recently investigated in several studies as a potential biomarker for AA. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to systematically summarize and compare all relevant data on RDW as a diagnostic biomarker for AA. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Excerpta Medica database-EMBASE) were systematically searched for relevant comparative studies by two independent researches using keywords ((red cell distribution width) OR rdw) AND (appendicitis). An independent assessment of the methodological quality was performed by two authors using the Downs and Black scale. RevMan 5.4 software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results: Fifteen studies were included in the final meta-analysis; the majority of the studies was retrospective. Nine studies compared the RDW values between AA and non-AA; four studies compared the same between AA and healthy controls, while two studies compared the RDW values among all three groups. The estimated heterogeneity among the studies for all outcome was statistically significant (I-2 = 92-99%, p < 0.00001). The pooling the data demonstrated no statistically significant difference in the RDW values (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.03, 95% CI = (-0.46, 0.52), p = 0.91) between AA and healthy controls as well as between AA and non-AA cases (WMD = 0.23, 95%CI = (-0.19, 0.65), p = 0.28). A separate subanalysis was performed to evaluate the utility of this biomarker for the pediatric age group. Pooling the data demonstrated no significant difference among the AA and non-AA groups in terms of the RDW values (WMD = 0.99, 95% CI = (-0.35, 2.33), p = 0.15). Conclusion: The RDW value difference demonstrated no statistically significant difference in AA versus healthy individuals and AA versus non-AA individuals. At the moment, there is no evidence of RDW utility in diagnostic testing of AA. Further research with prospective, multicenter studies and studies targeting special patient groups with a large sample size are needed in this field.

TI  - Direct Molecular Detection of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis from Transported Bio-Safe Dried Sputum on Filter-Paper

AB  - In 2019, amongst half a million new rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (TB) cases, 78% were multi drug-resistant TB (MDRTB). Access to rapid and Universal-Drug susceptibility testing (DST) to patients in remote areas is a major challenge to combat drug-resistant TB. To overcome this challenge, we had recently reported the development of 'TB Concentration & Transport kit' for bio-safe ambient temperature transport of dried sputum on filter-paper (Trans-Filter). The present study was conducted to evaluate the utility of DNA extracted from sputum on Trans-Filter in a Multiplex PCR-based sequencing assay (Mol-DSTseq) for diagnosing drug-resistant TB. The developed Mol-DSTseq assays were standardized on Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates (n=98) and further validated on DNA extracted from sputum on Trans-Filter (n= 100). Using phenotypic DST as gold standard, the Mol-DSTseq assay showed 100% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 79.4-100%) and 73.3% (95% CI 54.1-87.7%) sensitivity for detecting rifampicin and isoniazid resistance with a specificity of 85.1% (95% CI 66.2-95.8%) and 100% (95% CI:82.3-100%), respectively. For fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, the Mol-DSTseq assay showed a sensitivity of 78.5% (95% CI 49.2-95.3%) and 66.6% (95% CI 9.4-99.1%) with a specificity of 88.2% (95% CI 72.5-96.7%) and 100% (95% CI 93.1-100%), respectively. The Mol-DSTseq assays exhibited a high concordance of-83-96% (lc value: 0.65-0.81) with phenotypic DST for all drugs. In conclusion, the 'TB Concentration and Transport kit' was compatible with Mol-DSTseq assays and has the potential to provide 'Universal-DST' to patients residing in distant areas in high burden countries, like India for early initiation of anti-tubercular treatment.

AB  - Background: The introduction of chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) in blood donor screening has led to a gradual replacement of enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as the former offers automation, higher sensitivity and lower turn-around-time. However, only a few CLIA platforms are used for blood donor screening in India. The present study evaluated one such newer platform viz., Adiva Centaur XP CLIA for screening of HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis.
   Material and methods: Prospective comparative study wherein 4843 whole blood donors were screened for HBsAg, Anti-HCV, HIV Ag-Ab and Anti-treponemal antibodies in both Advia Centaur XP and Architect i2000SR platforms. Additional tests were performed in samples which were reactive in only one of the platforms. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate of both the platforms were compared. Kappa coefficient was calculated to determine the agreement between the testing platforms.
   Results: The sensitivity of Advia Centaur platform for HBV, HCV, HIV and syphilis detection were 94.9 %, 100 %, 100 % and 100 % respectively as compared to 96.6 %, 100 %, 100 % and 100 % in Architect i2000SR platform. The specificity of both the platforms were 99.8-99.9 % for all the four tests. The agreement between the two platforms was almost perfect for HBV, HCV and syphilis testing; and fair for HIV testing.
   Conclusion: The Advia Centaur CLIA platform was found to be comparable with the Architect CLIA platform for blood donor screening. Unexpected finding was the occurrence of HBV false negatives in both the platforms, possibly due to HBsAg mutations.

AB  - Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease caused by newly discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Since the inception of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, the virus has traveled more than 200 countries globally. The role of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 has been thoroughly investigated and reviewed in the last 22 months or so; however, a comprehensive outline of miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection is still missing.
   The genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA molecule nearly 29 kb in size. RNA is composed of numerous sub- constituents RNA is found in the cells in a number of forms. including microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs play an essential role in biological processes like apoptosis, cellular metabolism, cell death, cell movement, oncogenesis, intracellular signaling, immunity, and infection. Lately, miRNAs have been involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection, though the clear demonstration of miRNAs in the SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully elucidated. The present review article summarizes recent findings of miRNAs associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We presented various facets of miRNAs. miRNAs as the protagonists in viral infection, the occurrence of miRNA in cellular receptors, expression of miRNAs in multiple diseases, miRNA as a biomarker, and miRNA as a therapeutic tool have been discussed in detail. We also presented the vaccine status available in various countries.

Functional parameters (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, mean deviation, VER, and MfERG) and structural parameters (RNFL, GCL-IPL, and optic disc height) were measured at baseline and every 6 weeks for 6 months.Results:At baseline, average RNFL had a moderate negative correlation with mean deviation (r = -0.45; P = 0.0007) and a positive correlation with logMAR visual acuity (r = 0.18; P = 0.17). On the contrary, baseline GCL and logMAR visual acuity had a negative correlation (r = -0.4, P = 0.02). Optic disc height (ODH) had a negative correlation with visual field mean deviation (r = -0.046; P = 0.0005). At 6 months, ODH and GCL-IPL complex had a statistically significant correlation with functional parameters. However, RNFL values did not show any significant correlation with any of the functional parameters. Baseline GCL-IPL and optic disc height values had a moderate and significant correlation with final functional parameters. However, RNFL did not show any correlation with final functional parameters. Correlation between GCL-IPL thickness at 6 weeks and final functional parameters were stronger than that with baseline GCL valuesConclusion:In the setting of severe papilledema, RNFL can misguide the prognosis. GCL-IPL can be a valuable tool for an objective evaluation of the integrity of the optic nerve in IIH and ODH may be used as an alternative or in combination with GCL-IPL in these cases.

AB  - Biofilm formation by Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the major cause of its persistence in hospital environment. Biofilm phenotypes are more resistant to physical as well as chemical stresses than their planktonic counterparts. The present study was carried in quest of biofilm-associated protein markers and their association with various biological pathways of A. baumannii. The study was designed with an aim to highlight the crucial common factor present in the majority of the A. baumannii strains irrespective of its resistance nature. A label-free proteome comparison of biofilm and planktonic phenotypes of A. baumannii was done using QExactive tandem mass spectrometry. Our investigation suggests key elevation of adhesion factors, acetate metabolism, nutrient transporters, and secretion system proteins are required for biofilm formation in A. baumannii. Elevation of biofilm-associated proteins revealed that biofilm is the unique phenotype with the potential to form robust matrix-embedded colonies and defeat stress condition. Further, core protein markers of biofilm phenotypes could be used as targets for new clinical interventions to combat biofilm-associated infections.

AB  - Background: Direct measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) is an invasive technique with potential complications, which has prompted the development of alternative, noninvasive, methods of ICP assessment. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between noninvasive ultrasound-based measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), transcranial Doppler-derived pulsatility index (PI), and invasive ICP measurements in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: Children aged 1 to 18 years undergoing invasive ICP monitoring following TBI were included in the study. Noninvasive ONSD and PI measurements were compared with simultaneous invasive ICP. Results: In all, 406 measurements of ONSD and PI were obtained in 18 patients. ONSD and PI correlated with ICP (r=0.76 and 0.79, respectively), combining ONSD and PI resulted in an even stronger correlation with ICP (r=0.99). Formulas were derived from mixed-effect models that best fitted the data for noninvasive ICP estimation. A combination of ONSD and PI had the highest ability to detect ICP >20 mm Hg (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.99, 95% confidence interval: 0.99-1.00). Optimal cutoff values for the prediction of intracranial hypertension were 5.95 mm for ONSD (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 76%) and 1.065 for PI (sensitivity, 92%; specificity, 87%). Conclusions: In children with TBI, a combination of ONSD and PI strongly correlates with invasive ICP and has potential to screen for intracranial hypertension noninvasively. ONSD and PI may be useful tools for assessing ICP where invasive monitoring is unavailable or contraindicated.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To compare dual energy CT (DECT) quantitative metrics and radiomics for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions on contrast enhanced abdomen CT.
   Materials and Methods: Our study included 103 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced DECT for assessing focal pancreatic lesions at one of the two hospitals (Site A: age 68 +/- 12 yrs; malignant = 41, benign = 18; Site B: age 46 +/- 2 yrs; malignant = 23, benign = 21). All malignant lesions had histologic confirmation, and benign lesions were stable on follow up CT (>12 months) or had characteristic benign features on MRI. Arterial-phase, low- and high-kV DICOM images were processed with the DECT Tumor Analysis (DETA) to obtain DECT quantitative metrics such as HU, iodine and water content from a region of interest (ROI) over focal pancreatic lesions. Separately, we obtained DECT radiomics from the same ROI. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics to generate area under the curve (AUC) for best predictive variables.
   Results: DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics had AUCs of 0.98-0.99 at site A and 0.89-0.94 at site B data for classifying benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. There was no significant difference in the AUCs and accuracies of DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics from lesion rims and volumes among patients at both sites (p > 0.05). Supervised learning-based model with data from the two sites demonstrated best AUCs of 0.94 (DECT radiomics) and 0.90 (DECT quantitative metrics) for characterizing pancreatic lesions as benign or malignant.
   Conclusion: Compared to complex DECT radiomics, quantitative DECT information provide a simpler but accurate method of differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.

AB  - Introduction: Oligometastatic represents a distinctive subset of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Incidence has been reported, in 1-5% of all newly diagnosed MBC. Literature is very sparse, especially from India.
   Material and Methods: We have ambispectively screened 500 patients of upfront female MBC between the period of January 2013 and August 2018 at Institute Rotary Cancer Hospital, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and 120 patients of oligometastatic breast cancer (OMBC) were included for analysis. Clinical, pathological, receptor status (ER estrogen receptor, PR progesterone receptor, and HER2/neu human epidermal growth factor), radiological, treatment, and survival details were recorded.
   Results: The median age of presentation was 50 (range 22-78) years. One organ was involved in 96 (80%) patients, and two organs were involved in 36 (20%) patients. ER and/or PR was positive in 48 (40.0%), ER/PR, and HER2/neu were positive in 28 (23.3%) cases. Only HER2/neu was positive in 21 (17.5%), and triple negativity was seen in 23 (19.2%) patients. Ninety-four (78.3%) patients received neoadjuvant therapy, and 12 (10%) patients underwent conservative breast surgery. The overall response rate at the metastatic site was 74.1%, and a complete response was seen in 42.5% of patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for the cohort was 25.43 months. The estimated PFS at 2 years and, at 5 years, was 54.6% and 21.6%, respectively. The hormone receptor positivity, bone metastasis, and patients with surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) had a statistically significant better PFS on multivariate analysis. In a subset analysis of HER2/neu receptor-positive patients, who received targeted therapy showed better PFS compared to those who did not receive.
   Conclusion: The incidence of OMBC is 24% of the total MBC. The patients with OMBC who have hormone receptor-positive, bone-only metastasis, and surgery after NACT show a better outcome.

KW  - quality of life
KW  - teaching and training
AB  - Background: Access to pain management has been recognized as a fundamental human right. Inadequate pain relief hampers the quality of life and has a physiological and psychosocial impact on the patient and caregivers. Inadequate pain relief remains the leading cause of suffering in hospitalized patients worldwide. Objective: The objective of this article is to provide adequate pain relief to hospitalized patients through proper assessment, treatment, and monitoring of pain by the trained health-care workers through a sustainable and effective institutional pain management policy. Methods: The formulation of pain management policy at a tertiary care teaching institute was conducted in three phases - Phase 1: need assessment by an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective observational study over 1 month period, Phase 2: teaching, training, and awareness of health-care workers, and Phase 3: constitution of the committee at the institute level with the formation of pain resource teams. Results: An open-label, prospective observational study conducted over 1 month revealed that among 814 hospitalized patients, 108 out of 235 (46%) patients in medical and 385 out of 579 (66.5%) patients in the surgical cohort had NRS score of >= 3, implying an inadequate pain relief even at 24 h following medical or surgical intervention, respectively. Conclusion: The provision of effective and adequate pain relief to hospitalized patients requires trained health-care workers and a uniform and structured pain management policy at the institutional level. Recognition and addressal of the barriers and challenges while framing an institutional pain policy is of utmost importance.

AB  - Pythium insidiosum is an oomycete and is also called "parafungus" as it closely mimics fungal keratitis. The last decade saw an unprecedented surge in Pythium keratitis cases, especially from Asia and India, probably due to growing research on the microorganism and improved diagnostic and treatment modalities. The clinical features such as subepithelial infiltrate, cotton wool-like fluffy stromal infiltrate, satellite lesions, corneal perforation, endoexudates, and anterior chamber hypopyon closely resemble fungus. The classical clinical features of Pythium that distinguish it from other microorganisms are reticular dots, tentacular projections, peripheral furrowing, and early limbal spread, which require a high index of clinical suspicion. Pythium also exhibits morphological and microbiological resemblance to fungus on routine smearing, revealing perpendicular or obtuse septate or aseptate branching hyphae. Culture on blood agar or any other nutritional agar is the gold standard for diagnosis. It grows as cream-colored white colonies with zoospores formation, further confirmed using the leaf incarnation method. Due to limited laboratory diagnostic modalities and delayed growth on culture, there was a recent shift toward various molecular diagnostic modalities such as polymerase chain reaction, confocal microscopy, ELISA, and immunodiffusion. As corneal scraping (10% KOH, Gram) reveals fungal hyphae, antifungals are started before the culture results are available. Recent in vitro molecular studies have suggested antibacterials as the first-line drugs in the form of 0.2% linezolid and 1% azithromycin. Early therapeutic keratoplasty is warranted in nonresolving cases. This review aims to describe the epidemiology, clinical features, laboratory and molecular diagnosis, and treatment of Pythium insidiosum keratitis.

AB  - Prothymosin-alpha (PTMA), a nuclear protein, is strikingly associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in many cancers. However, no information about its clinical relevance in glioma was available. Therefore in the present study, we evaluated the prognostic utility of this protein in a cohort of 81 glioma patients. The PTMA expression was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. Furthermore, the association of PTMA with clinicopathological features and molecular alterations were assessed in the patient cohort and validated in multiomics datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; n=667) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA; n=1013). We observed an increase in PTMA expression with increasing histological grades of this malignancy. PTMA immunostaining also displayed a strong positive association with the MIB-1 index. Univariate analysis revealed a superior prognostic value of PTMA to predict overall survival (OS) as compared with the routinely used markers (p53, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 (IDH1), alpha-thalassemia/intellectual disability syndrome X-linked (ATRX), and Ki-67). Interestingly, in Cox regression analysis it emerged as an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 13.71, 95% CI = 5.96-31.52, P<0.0001). Thus, our results demonstrate the potential prognostic utility of PTMA in glioma which may prove useful in the management of this deadly malignancy.

AB  - Background: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted many facets of critical care delivery. Methods: An electronic survey was distributed to explore the pandemic's perceived impact on neurocritical care delivery between June 2020 and March 2021. Variables were stratified by World Bank country income level, presence of a dedicated neurocritical care unit (NCCU) and experiencing a COVID-19 patient surge. Results: Respondents from 253 hospitals (78.3% response rate) from 47 countries (45.5% low/middle income countries; 54.5% with a dedicated NCCU; 78.6% experienced a first surge) participated in the study. Independent of country income level, NCCU and surge status, participants reported reductions in NCCU admissions (67%), critical care drug shortages (69%), reduction in ancillary services (43%) and routine diagnostic testing (61%), and temporary cancellation of didactic teaching (44%) and clinical/basic science research (70%). Respondents from low/middle income countries were more likely to report lack of surge preparedness (odds ratio [OR], 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-5.8) and struggling to return to prepandemic standards of care (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 4.4-34) compared with respondents from high-income countries. Respondents experiencing a surge were more likely to report conversion of NCCUs and general-mixed intensive care units (ICUs) to a COVID-ICU (OR 3.7; 95% CI, 1.9-7.3), conversion of non-ICU beds to ICU beds (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8-6.5), and deviations in critical care and pharmaceutical practices (OR, 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.2). Respondents from hospitals with a dedicated NCCU were less likely to report conversion to a COVID-ICU (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) or conversion of non-ICU to ICU beds (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9). Conclusion: This study reports the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global neurocritical care delivery, and highlights shortcomings of health care infrastructures and the importance of pandemic preparedness.

AB  - Background: Meta-analysis has shown the effectiveness of various training methods for the acquisition of laparoscopic skills in surgical training. However, there is very limited literature focusing on the translation of skill acquisition on training models into improved operating room (OR) performance. This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the Tuebingen trainer with integrated Porcine tissue in improving OR the performance of surgical trainees using standard assessment tools. Materials and Methods: The study was a single-blinded double-armed randomized control study conducted between July 2016 and March 2018. Eighteen, fourth, and fifth semesters of surgery residents were included in the study. The baseline performance was assessed in OR by performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy using validated scores, that is, Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS), Additional Five Criteria, Task-specific Checklist, Error Checklist, Visual Analogue Scale. The residents were then randomized into trainee and nontrainee groups. The training group received 5 days of short-term-focused training on the Tuebingen trainer, and the improvement was reassessed in OR. Results: The demographic profile of residents was similar. The baseline scores were comparable. The training group showed statistically significant improvement in GOALS (9.88 +/- 1.76 to 12 +/- 0.66, P=0.05 vs. 10.33 +/- 1.5 to 11.4 +/- 2.24, P=0.28), task-specific checklist (42.22 +/- 10.92 to 53.33 +/- 14.14, P=0.027 vs. 45.55 +/- 10.13 to 50 +/- 17.32, P=0.51), and error checklist. The operating time significantly reduced (36.0 +/- 4.03 vs. 50.44 +/- 11.39, P=0.0025) following training. Conclusions: Our study concludes that the training on the Tuebingen trainer with integrated porcine organs results in a statistically significant improvement in the OR performance of surgical residents as compared with the nontrained residents, thereby indicating a transfer of skills from training to OR.

TI  - Short Course of Daily Prednisolone During Upper Respiratory Tract Infection for Children With Relapsing Steroid Sensitive Nephrotic Syndrome
T2  - INDIAN PEDIATRICS
KW  - CORTICOSTEROIDS
KW  - MANAGEMENT
KW  - RISK
AB  - PREDNOS 2 was a double blind placebo controlled trial done to investigate the use of daily low-dose prednisolone for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection-related relapses. It evaluated 365 children with relapsing steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome with and without background immunosuppressive treatment at 122 pediatric departments in the UK from February 1, 2013, to January 31, 2020. At the beginning of an upper respiratory tract infection, children received 6 days of prednisolone, 15 mg/m(2) daily, or matching placebo preparation. Those already taking alternate-day prednisolone rounded their daily dose using trial medication to the equivalent of 15 mg/m(2) daily or their alternate-day dose, whichever was greater. The primary outcome was the incidence of first upper respi-ratory tract infection-related relapse. The modified intention-to-treat analysis population comprised 271 children (mean (SD) age, 7.6 (3.5) years; 64.2% male), with 134 in the prednisolone arm and 137 in the placebo arm. The number of patients experiencing an upper respiratory tract infection-related relapse was 56 (42.7%) in the predniso-lone arm and 58 (44.3%) in the placebo arm (adjusted risk difference, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.10; P=0.70). No evidence was found that the treatment effect differed according to background immuno-suppressive treatment. A post hoc subgroup analysis assessing the primary outcome in 54 children of South Asian ethnicity (risk ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.40-1.10) vs 208 children of other ethnicity (risk ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.81-1.54) found no difference in efficacy of intervention in those of South Asian ethnicity (test for interaction P=0.09). The authors concluded that, results of PREDNOS 2 suggest that administering 6 days of daily low-dose prednisolone at the time of an upper respiratory tract infection does not reduce the risk of relapse of nephrotic syndrome in children in the UK and further work is needed to study the inter-ethnic differences in the study response.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the functional, neurological, and radiological outcomes after anterior surgery in thoracolumbar burst fractures. Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Tertiary care hospital. Patients: Thirty-six patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures (T11-L2). Intervention: Anterior decompression, anterior column reconstruction with mesh cage, and instrumented stabilization. Outcome: Functional (Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure), neurological (ASIA Impairment Scale), and radiological (kyphosis, anterior vertebral height loss, canal encroachment %) parameters. Results: Patients were prospectively followed for a mean duration of 5.9 +/- 3.2 years (2.4-10 years). Statistically significant improvement was noted in functional outcomes from preop values (P-value < 0.001). 29 patients (80.5%) had improvement in neurology after surgery at the final follow-up with a positive correlation with % change in canal encroachment (r = 0.64, P -0.018). The mean preoperative kyphosis of 29.1 +/- 11.9 degrees got corrected to 9.4 +/- 3.8 degrees in immediate postop and 15.7 +/- 11.8 at the final follow-up(P < 0.001). Preoperative mean canal encroachment of 58.5 +/- 15.7% was reduced to 6.5 +/- 3.2% postoperatively (P < 0.001). Two patients developed neurological complications (subacute progressive ascending myelopathy), and 5 patients developed pulmonary complications. No pseudarthrosis, implant loosening, or cage migration was noted in any patient. Conclusion: Anterior surgery performed in 36 patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures in our study showed good outcomes. 80.5% of patients improved in neurology after surgery by at least one ASIA Impairment Scale grade. There was statistically significant improvement noted in radiological outcome (Kyphosis and Canal encroachment %) and functional outcome (Visual Analog Score, Oswestry Disability Index, and Spinal Cord Independence Measure score) after surgery in immediate postop and at the final follow-up. Only 13.8% of patients developed pulmonary complications that were managed successfully with chest drain.

AB  - A 15-month-old child was brought to the ophthalmology outpatient department with his parents complaining of a large mass located on the nasal side of his right eye since birth. On examination, an irregular mass was seen to be located on the nasal side of his right orbit, obscuring the visual axis. On a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan, a heterogenous lesion was seen to be located on the bridge of the nose and the medial aspect of the right orbit without any bony defect or communication with the brain or sinuses. In view of the possibility of developing amblyopia, the lesion was surgically removed. On histopathological examination, a diagnosis of extranasal glial heterotopia was made. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest extranasal glial heterotopia in the orbit to be ever reported.

KW  - testicular tumor
AB  - Metastases to the testis are uncommon. Signet-ring cell carcinomas from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) can rarely disseminate to the testicles, mimicking primary testicular malignancies with signet-ring cells. We hereby describe a case of a 26-year-old male who presented with left testicular swelling, multiple lymphadenopathies, and normal serum tumor markers. Lymph node biopsy revealed clusters and singly lying signet-ring cells. Judicious use of immunohistochemistry confirmed the tumor to be GIT primary. Further investigations confirmed a gastric tumor extending to the duodenum. Although rare, metastatic tumors to the testis should be considered in differential diagnoses of testicular masses in a young patient, particularly when serum germ cell tumor markers are normal or mildly deranged.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
KW  - QUALITY
KW  - CARE
AB  - Objective
   To evaluate whether the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a prolonged duration of symptoms, a delayed presentation to the medical facility, and consequently more orchiectomy procedures among children with testicular torsion compared to the pre-COVID-19 period.
   Methods
   Systematic search of four scientific databases was performed. The search terms used were (coronavirus OR novel coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19) AND (testicular torsion OR orchidectomy OR orchiectomy OR orchidopexy OR orchiopexy). The inclusion criteria were all boys presenting with testicular torsion during the COVID-19 and preCOVID-19 periods. A comparison of the average duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with delayed presentation (>24 h), and the proportion of children requiring orchiectomy was made among the two groups. The Downs and Black scale was used for methodological quality assessment.
   Results
   The present meta-analysis included six comparative studies (five retrospective studies). A total of 711 patients (473 during the COVID-19 period) were included. No significant differences in the average duration of symptoms (WMD: 2.6, 95% CI -6.78 to 11.99, P = 0.59), the proportion of children with delayed presentation (RR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.52-2.02, p = 0.94), and orchiectomy rate (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 0.82-1.84, p = 0.31) were observed among the two patient groups. All studies had a moderate risk of bias.
   Conclusion
   The duration of symptoms, the proportion of children with delayed presentation, and orchiectomy rate did not significantly differ among the children with testicular torsion presenting during the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. However, due to the moderate risk of bias, the level of evidence of the available comparative studies is limited.

AB  - Full-thickness deficiency of eyelid tissues can result in coloboma or retraction or both. Here we report our initial experience on the use of auricular skin-cartilage sandwich graft technique for full-thickness eyelid deformities. Five patients (4-32 years) underwent the procedure. Patients with full-thickness eyelid deformity were included. Three patients were operated for large-sized coloboma and two for eyelid retraction. One patient had congenital, and four patients had acquired etiology. The following parameters were specifically assessed: correction of deformity, ocular surface problems, graft status, and epithelization of skin-cartilage graft. All the patients had a good correction of eyelid position, except one patient who had severe eyelid retraction (8 mm) at presentation. None of our patients had corneal erosion/defect, persistent ocular surface redness, or graft loss. The auricular skin-cartilage sandwich graft technique produces optimal results with no graft loss. Advancement of orbicularis muscle in between the auricular skin and cartilage grafts (sandwich technique) is an imperative step that leads to the survival of both grafts.

None of our patients had corneal erosion/defect, persistent ocular surface redness, or graft loss. The auricular skin-cartilage sandwich graft technique produces optimal results with no graft loss. Advancement of orbicularis muscle in between the auricular skin and cartilage grafts (sandwich technique) is an imperative step that leads to the survival of both grafts.

AB  - Background There is a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in exclusively breast-fed infants in the absence of appropriate vitamin D supplementation. Objective To evaluate the efficacy of two doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D levels of mother-infant pairs and to assess its effect on growth parameters (weight, length and head circumference) and bone mass of infants. Study design Randomized controlled trial. Participants Lactating mother-infant pairs (n=220). Intervention Maternal oral vitamin D supplementation in two doses (group 1: 1,20,000 IU/month and group 2: 12,000 IU/month) for 12 months. Main outcomes Maternal and infant serum 25OHD levels, and infants' growth and bone mass. Results There was high prevalence of VDD at baseline in mothers (94%) as well as infants (98.5%), which was reduced to 43.1% in (mothers) and 46.5% in infants after 12 months. Significantly higher median (IQR) serum 25OHD levels (ng/mL) were observed among mothers in group 1 compared to group 2 [46 (17-159) vs 18 (6-64); P<0.01] and in infants [36.5 (15-160) vs 17 (7-32); P<0.01]. No significant association was observed between growth parameters or bone mass and serum 25OHD levels of mother or infant between the two groups. Four mothers (3.6%) and two infants (1.8%) in group I had serum 25OHD>100 ng/mL, but without hypercalciuria or hypercalcemia. Conclusion Bolus vitamin D supplementation in the dose of 1,20,000 IU/month was more efficacious in improving maternal and infant vitamin D status at 12 months, as compared to 12,000 IU/month.

AB  - Background: The diagnosis of CPA relies on the detection of the IgG Aspergillus antibody, which is not freely available, especially in resource-poor settings. Point-of-care tests like LDBio Aspergillus ICT lateral flow assay, evaluated in only a few studies, have shown promising results for the diagnosis of CPA. However, no study has compared the diagnostic performances of LDBio LFA in setting of tuberculosis endemic countries and have compared it with that of IgG Aspergillus. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performances of LDBio LFA in CPA and compare it with existing the diagnostic algorithm utilising ImmunoCAP IgG Aspergillus. Methods: Serial patients presenting with respiratory symptoms (cough, haemoptysis, fever, etc.) for >4 weeks were screened for eligibility. Relevant investigations, including direct microscopy and culture of respiratory secretions, IgG Aspergillus, chest imaging, etc., were done according to existing algorithm. Serums of all patients were tested by LDBio LFA and IgG Aspergillus (ImmunoCAP Asp IgG) and their diagnostic performances were compared. Results: A total of 174 patients were included in the study with similar to 66.7% patients having past history of tuberculosis. A diagnosis of CPA was made in 74 (42.5%) of patients. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of LDBio LFA was 67.6% (95% CI: 55.7-78%) and 81% (95% CI: 71.9-88.2%), respectively, which increased to 73.3% (95% CI: 60.3-83.9%) and 83.9% (95% CI: 71.7-92.4%), respectively, in patients with a past history of tuberculosis. The sensitivity and specificity of IgG Aspergillus was 82.4% (95% CI: 71.8-90.3%) and 82% (95% CI: 73.1-89%); 86.7% (95% CI: 75.4-94.1%) and 80.4% (95% CI: 67.6-89.8%), in the whole group and those with past history of tuberculosis, respectively. Conclusions: LDBio LFA is a point-of-care test with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. However, further tests may have to be done to rule-in or rule-out the diagnosis of CPA in the appropriate setting.

AB  - Introduction Existing risk assessment tools to identify children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality have shown suboptimal discriminatory value during external validation. Our objective was to derive and validate a novel risk assessment tool to identify children aged 2-59 months at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality across various settings. Methods We used primary, baseline, patient-level data from 11 studies, including children evaluated for pneumonia in 20 low-income and middle-income countries. Patients with complete data were included in a logistic regression model to assess the association of candidate variables with the outcome hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality. Adjusted log coefficients were calculated for each candidate variable and assigned weighted points to derive the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) risk assessment tool. We used bootstrapped selection with 200 repetitions to internally validate the PREPARE risk assessment tool. Results A total of 27 388 children were included in the analysis (mean age 14.0 months, pneumonia-related case fatality ratio 3.1%). The PREPARE risk assessment tool included patient age, sex, weight-for-age z-score, body temperature, respiratory rate, unconsciousness or decreased level of consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis and hypoxaemia at baseline. The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory value when internally validated (area under the curve 0.83, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.84). Conclusions The PREPARE risk assessment tool had good discriminatory ability for identifying children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality in a large, geographically diverse dataset. After external validation, this tool may be implemented in various settings to identify children at risk of hospitalised pneumonia-related mortality.

AB  - Objective: ICD-11 clinical guidelines for mental and behavioral disorders must be tested in clinical settings to guarantee their usefulness worldwide. The purpose of this study was to evaluate interrater reliability and clinical utility of the ICD-11 guidelines for children and adolescents in assessing and diagnosing mood, anxiety, and fear related disorders; attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and disruptive behavioral disorder (DBD). Methods: Children and adolescents ages 6-17 from two specialized settings in Mexico City were interviewed. Each was interviewed by a pair of psychiatrists (interviewer and observer), who independently codified established diagnoses and evaluated the clinical utility of the guidelines with each participant. Kappa values were calculated to determine the level of general diagnostic correlation between the two clinicians. Results: A total of 25 psychiatrists evaluated 52 children and adolescents. Kappa values between clinicians ranged from 0.46 to 0.53 for mood, anxiety, and fear-related disorders and for ADHD; the kappa value was 0.81 for DBD guidelines. Over 80% of psychiatrists reported that the guidelines, qualifiers, and descriptions of developmental presentations were quite useful. Conclusions: ICD-11 guidelines for mental and behavioral disorders of children and adolescents demonstrated mostly moderate interrater reliability and strong interrater reliability in the case of DBD. A large proportion of clinicians regarded the guidelines as quite useful clinical tools. Psychiatric Services 2022; 73:396-402; doi: 10.1176/appi.ps.202000830

AB  - Aim Persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is a rare but life-threatening disease of infancy and childhood. F-18-DOPA PET/CT has been shown to be a useful modality in the localization of focal pancreatic lesions in these patients. We aimed to assess the role of F-18-DOPA PET/CT in such patients at our institution. Materials and methods In this prospective study, F-18-DOPA PET/CT scans and clinical details of 20 children with clinical diagnosis of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia were reviewed. Scans were acquired at 5 min postinjection of 2-3 mCi of F-18-DOPA on dedicated PET/CT scanners (Biograph mCT, Siemens Inc and Discovery PET/CT, GE). Abdominal spot images over 1-2 bed positions were acquired. Additionally, genetic mutation status, where available, was correlated to the scan findings. Results Out of 20 children (7 female and 13 male), 13 were infants. The age of the children ranged from 3 months to 8 years. Fifteen children had undergone gene analysis, 12 were positive for mutation in ABCC8, 1 for GLUD-1, 1 for GCK mutations and 1 had not shown any mutation. F-18-DOPA PET/CT scan showed 5 focal pancreatic lesions in 5 children (1 in each), two focal lesions in 1 child and diffuse pancreatic uptake in 14 children. Conclusion F-18-DOPA PET/CT is a useful modality for localizing focal pancreatic lesions in children with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. The detection rate is significantly higher in patients with ABCC8 paternal monoallelic recessive gene mutation. F-18-DOPA PET/CT scan consequent to findings on genetic analysis appears to be useful in planning the management of children with hyperinsulinism.

AB  - The first law of thermodynamics reveals that all fluids are compressible, and the second law of thermodynamics entails all fluids to have positive viscosity. These established laws reaffirm the possibilities of the occurrence of Sanal flow choking in yocto to yotta scale systems and beyond [Kumar et al., "Discovery of nanoscale Sanal flow choking in cardiovascular system: Exact prediction of the 3D boundary-layer-blockage factor in nanotubes, " Sci. Rep. 11, 15429 (2021); "Sanal flow choking: A paradigm shift in computational fluid dynamics code verification and diagnosing detonation and hemorrhage in real-world fluid-flow systems, " Global Challenges 4, 2000012 (2020)]. The Sanal flow choking occurs in the real-world flows at a critical total-to-static pressure ratio [Kumar et al., "Abstract P422: Sanal flow choking leads to hemorrhagic stroke and other neurological disorders in earth and human spaceflight, " Circul. Res. 129(1), AP422 (2021)]. At the Sanal flow choking condition, the Rayleigh-flow-effect (thermal choking) and the Fanno-flow-effect (choking due to frictional effects) unite at a unique site of the sonic-fluid-throat. In this article, the two-dimensional (2D) and the three-dimensional (3D) boundary-layer-blockage factors and average friction coefficient are generated for different working fluids passing through a cylindrical port, at the Sanal flow choking condition, as universal benchmark data for a credible verification of in silico codes for both adiabatic and diabatic flows. The outlook, advancement, and significance of the analytical methodology, invoked for developing Sanal flow choking model using well-posed initial conditions, for generating the universal benchmark data for computational fluid dynamics code verification are critically reviewed herein. The closed-form analytical models presented herein for predicting the 2D and the 3D boundary-layer-blockage factors at the sonic-fluid-throat of adiabatic and diabatic flows and average friction coefficient in a circular duct at the Sanal flow choking condition are fabulously unaffected with any errors due to discretization and fully freed from empiricism for a credible decision making on various high fidelity numerical simulations. The Sanal flow choking model offers the luxury to the scientific community for solving numerous unresolved problems in boundary layer theory. It provides universal benchmark data for various applications irrespective of the laminar/turbulence flow features in wall-bounded compressible viscous flow systems. The 2D and 3D in silico simulation results are presented for demonstrating conclusively the possibilities of the occurrence of the Sanal flow choking and streamtube flow choking [Kumar et al., "The theoretical prediction of the boundary layer blockage and external flow choking at moving aircraft in ground effects, " Phys. Fluids 33(3), 036108 (2021).] in internal and external flows.

AB  - Smartphones are becoming one of the most indispensable gadgets for everyone in today's digital world, with the continued incorporation of computer technology. For the past few years, the interaction between human and smartphone content has been improved significantly with innovative technologies using gestures, haptic, and sound instead of visual-based interaction. Such technologies are in the form of built-in features and accessible apps. Such an advanced way of interface design helps to access not only the content in phones but also assist to perform daily living activities. Evidence shows that such smartphones technology help in executing a wide range of functioning among people with visual impairment. Today, the COVID-19 pandemic causes a challenge to everyone, including one living with a vision loss, in maintaining the daily supplies and civic life. Unfortunately, the majority of such people cannot access smartphones, so they depend on a simple basic phone. It is the time to promote the benefits of such evolving smartphones technology in all the corners of the health-care sectors, practitioners, special educators, and even family members. Meanwhile, the relevant ministerial divisions of the Government of India need to develop a clear policy to augment access to smartphones, particularly among people with visual disabilities.

AB  - Objective Tc-99m methyl diphosphonate (MDP) bone scintigraphy is used to assess disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression in RA has been reported previously. SSTR-based PET/computed tomography (CT) may be superior to bone scintigraphy to know disease extent and in locating inflammatory joints that can be further targeted with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy thereby opening up new theranostic avenues. Based on these facts, the present study was designed to compare Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy and Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT in patients with RA. Materials and methods Patients with a clinical diagnosis of RA were injected with 111-185 MBq of Ga-68 DOTANOC and 740 MBq of Tc-99m MDP intravenously. Images were acquired 30-45 min postinjection for Ga-68 DOTANOC on dedicated PET/CT scanners. Triple-phase bone scans were acquired on a dual-head gamma camera. PET/CT and MDP scan images were visually assessed by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians. Results Nineteen patients (16 women and 3 men) with a clinical diagnosis of RA were included in the study. Clinically, 196 joints in these 19 patients were diagnosed positive for RA. Of these 196 joints, Tc-99m MDP uptake was seen in 157 joints (80%). On Ga-68 DOTANOC scan, tracer uptake was seen in 151 of 196 joints (77%) with a lesion to background ratio of at least 2 in most of the joints. Conclusion Ga-68 DOTANOC is equally good as an MDP scan for detection of RA with the added advantage of being used as a theranostic modality. However, further evaluation with a larger sample size and joint-to-joint comparison is warranted.

AB  - Infectious keratitis is a significant cause of corneal blindness worldwide. Although less prevalent in the developed world, cases of fungal keratitis account for almost half of all keratitis cases, occurring in the developing countries. These cases are one of the most refractory types of infectious keratitis and present various challenges to the treating physician such as delayed presentation, long waiting time for culture positivity, limited availability effective antifungal drugs, prolonged duration for response to therapy, a highly variable spectrum of antifungal drug sensitivity and a high recurrence rate following keratoplasty. The advent of rapid diagnostic tools, molecular methods, in vitro anti-fungal drug sensitivity testing, alternatives to natamycin, targeted drug delivery and most importantly the results of large randomized controlled trials have significantly improved our understanding and approach towards the diagnosis and management of cases with fungal keratitis.
   Overall, Aspergillus and Fusarium species are the most common causes ones of fungal keratitis. History of antecedent trauma is a significant predisposing factor. Corneal scrapings for microscopic evaluation and culture preparation, is the standard of care for establishing the diagnosis of fungal keratitis. Molecular identification of cultures offers accurate identification of fungal pathogens, especially the rare species. Natamycin is an approved first-line drug. Voriconazole is the best alternative, especially for non-fusarium cases. Management involves administration of drugs usually by a combination of various routes, the treatment regimen being individualized depending upon the response to therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a newer treatment modality, being tried for non-responsive cases, before resorting to a therapeutic graft.

AB  - Objective: This study was conducted to assess the feasibility of extended use of N95 masks in our hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We also studied the use pattern, user satisfaction, and issues faced during extended use of the mask. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among health-care providers in a large tertiary care teaching hospital in northern India from April 1 to May 31, 2020. A list was prepared from the institute's register, and participants were chosen by random sampling. The data collected from the physical forms were transferred to excel sheets. Results: A total of 1121 responses were received. The most common problem stated with reuse of N95 masks was loss of fit followed by damage to the slings, highlighted by 44.6% and 44.4% of the participants, respectively. A total of 476 (42.5%) participants responded that they would prefer "cup-shaped N95 mask with respirator". The median scores regarding the satisfaction with the quality of masks and their fit was also 4 each. Conclusions: It was concluded that the extended use of N95 masks was acceptable, with more than 96% of the participants using these masks.

AB  - A common malignancy that affects women is breast cancer. It is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women. Metabolic reprogramming occurs during cancer growth, invasion, and metastases. Functional magnetic resonance (MR) methods comprising an array of techniques have shown potential for illustrating physiological and molecular processes changes before anatomical manifestations on conventional MR imaging. Among these, in vivo proton (H-1) MR spectroscopy (MRS) is widely used for differentiating breast malignancy from benign diseases by measuring elevated choline-containing compounds. Further, the use of hyperpolarized C-13 and P-31 MRS enhanced the understanding of glucose and phospholipid metabolism. The metabolic profiling of an array of biological specimens (intact tissues, tissue extracts, and various biofluids such as blood, urine, nipple aspirates, and fine needle aspirates) can also be investigated through in vitro high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution magic angle spectroscopy (HRMAS). Such studies can provide information on more metabolites than what is seen by in vivo MRS, thus providing a deeper insight into cancer biology and metabolism. The analysis of a large number of NMR spectral data sets through multivariate statistical methods classified the tumor sub-types. It showed enormous potential in the development of new therapeutic approaches. Recently, multiparametric MRI approaches were found to be helpful in elucidating the pathophysiology of cancer by quantifying structural, vasculature, diffusion, perfusion, and metabolic abnormalities in vivo. This review focuses on the applications of NMR, MRS, and MRI methods in understanding breast cancer biology and in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of breast cancer.

AB  - Objective The objective of this subanalysis of data from centres across urban areas in India of the Global Asthma Network (GAN) was to study 1) the prevalence of symptoms of asthma in children and adults, 2) the change in prevalence of asthma and its trigger factors since the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), and 3) current asthma treatment practice.
   Methods In this cross-sectional, multicentre, school-based and self-administered questionnaire, responses from children aged 6-7 years and 13-14 years, and their respective parents, were analysed.
   Results The GAN Phase I study included 20084 children in the 6-7-year age group, 25887 children in the 13-14-year age group and 81 296 parents. The prevalence of wheeze in the previous 12 months was 3.16%, 3.63% and 3.30% in the three groups, respectively. In comparison to the ISAAC studies, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of current wheeze (p<0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in the prevalence of trigger factors. Almost 82% of current wheezers and 70% of subjects with symptoms of severe asthma were not clinically diagnosed as having asthma. The daily use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was less than 2.5% in subjects with current wheeze and those with symptoms of severe asthma but less than 1% used daily ICS when asthma remained undiagnosed.
   Conclusion The prevalence of current wheeze and its causal factors showed a significant reduction compared to previous ISAAC studies. Among subjects with current wheeze and symptoms of severe asthma, the problem of under-diagnosis and under-treatment was widespread.

AB  - Purpose To identify the factors predicting the visual and anatomical outcomes in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) through 12 months. Methods Patients with diagnosis of CSCR, either acute or chronic, were included in this multicentric, retrospective study. Demographic factors; systemic risk factors; central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), linear extent of ellipsoid zone (EZ) and interdigitation zone damage on optical coherence tomography; details of leak on fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography were included as predictors of anatomical and visual outcomes. Regression analysis was performed to correlate the changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and resolution of disease activity. Results A total of 231 eyes of 201 patients with a mean age (49.7 +/- 11.8 years) were analysed. A total of 97 and 134 eyes were classified as acute and chronic CSCR. BCVA (0.35 +/- 0.31 to 0.24 +/- 0.34; p<0.001), baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters including CMT (p<0.001), subretinal fluid (SRF) height (p<0.001) and SFCT (p=0.05) showed a significant change through 12 months. Multivariate regression analysis showed change in CMT (p <= 0.01) and SRF height at baseline (p=0.05) as factors predictive of good visual outcome. Logistic regression analysis revealed changes in both CMT (p=0.009) and SFCT (p=0.01) through 12 months to correlate with the resolution of disease. Conclusion OCT parameters such as changes in both CMT and SFCT along with subfoveal EZ damage can be predictive of disease resolution whereas changes in CMT and baseline SRF height correlate well with changes in BCVA through 12 months.

AB  - Background: The technology in the field of laparoscopy is rapidly evolving and is primarily focussed on increasing the quality of image and depth perception in the form of 4K and three-dimensional (3D) technology. There has been no conclusion yet regarding the better technology.
   Methods: A systematic search was performed independently by two authors across MEDLINE, Google Scholar and Embase using the PRISMA guidelines. All randomised control trials comparing 3D and 4K technologies were included. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects statistics for time taken for different tasks across the studies.
   Results: The search strategy revealed a total of 1835 articles, out of which nine studies were included. Three studies showed no superiority of 3D over 4K, while the remaining six did. Meta-analysis for the time taken for peg transfer favoured 3D over 4K (overall effect: Z = 2.12; P = 0.03). Forest plots for time taken for suturing (Z = 1.3; P = 0.19) and knot tying (Z = 1.7; P = 0.09) also favoured 3D over 4K; the results however were statistically insignificant. Path length was reported by two studies and was found to be lesser in the 3D group. Two studies measured the workload by NASA/Surg-TLX score, which was lower in the 3D group. Visual side effects were found to be higher in the 3D group.
   Conclusion: 3D technology is likely to result in a shorter operative time and better efficiency of movement as compared to the 4K technology by the virtue of its better depth perception.

TI  - Incidence of lab-confirmed dengue fever in a pediatric cohort in Delhi, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
KW  - DISEASE
KW  - BURDEN
AB  - BackgroundOur aim was to estimate the overall and age-specific incidence of lab-confirmed dengue fever using ELISA based assays among children 6 months to 15 years in Delhi. MethodsWe enrolled a cohort of 984 children aged 6 months to <14 years in South Delhi and followed-up weekly for fever for 24 months or till 15 completed years of child-age. Households of the enrolled children were geo-tagged. NS1, IgM and IgG assays were conducted using ELISA method to confirm dengue fever in children with >= 3 consecutive days of fever. Molecular typing was done in a subset of NS1 positive cases to identify the circulating serotypes. Principal findingsWe had a total of 1953 person-years (PY) of follow up. Overall, there were 4208 episodes of fever with peaks during June to November. The overall incidence (95%CI) of fever was 215/100 PY (209 to 222). A total of 74/1250 3-day fever episodes were positive for acute dengue fever (NS1 and/or IgM positive). The overall incidence (95%CI) of acute dengue fever was 37.9 (29.8 to 47.6) per 1000 PY; highest among children aged 5 to 10 years (50.4 per 1000 PY, 95% CI 36.5 to 67.8). Spatial autocorrelation analysis suggested a clustering pattern for the dengue fever cases (Moran's Index 0.35, z-score 1.8, p = 0.06). Dengue PCR was positive in 16 of the 24 specimens tested; DEN 3 was the predominant serotype identified in 15/24 specimens. ConclusionsWe found a high incidence of dengue fever among under 15-year children with clustering of cases in the community. DEN 3 was the most commonly circulating strain encountered. The findings underscore the need for development of affordable pre-vaccination screening strategy as well as newer dengue vaccines for young children while continuing efforts in vector control.
   Author summarySouth Asian countries especially the Indian subcontinent contributes the highest to the global burden of dengue. The number of dengue cases reported in India is likely an underestimate of the actual disease burden and there is a clear lack in the availability of population-based data on incidence of dengue in India. In our pediatric cohort of 984 children aged 6 months to 15 years from Delhi, India, we found a high incidence of lab-confirmed dengue fever, with the highest burden among 5 to 10 year old children. Dengue fever was observed to be highest in the post-monsoon months with significant clustering of cases in the community. DEN 3 was the most commonly circulating strain encountered. Given the high burden in children, the findings highlight the need for strengthening efforts to developing newer dengue vaccines for younger children.

AB  - Purpose The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is dismal. Despite best treatment and care, the patients with this malignancy only showed 2.7-4 months of overall survival. It is debatable whether liver transplantation helps PVTT sufferers. The effectiveness of radiation therapy in treating HCC patients with PVTT should not be undervalued. By limiting the high dosage region to a small planning target volume, stereotactic radiation delivery has shifted toward hypofractionation, limiting the radiation exposure to healthy organs and tissues. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has a local control rate of 75-100%, depending on the treatment. The major limitation in SBRT for hepatocellular carcinoma with PVTT is the paucity of prospective evidence for longer periods beyond the first two years after treatment. More prospective studies/randomized clinical trials with a longer follow-up, larger sample size, and adequate statistical power are the dire need of the present situation to ascertain the curative effect of SBRT as primary therapy for advanced HCC with PVTT. Conclusion SBRT can improve survival, particularly for patients receiving multidisciplinary treatment. This review sums up our most current understanding of how radiation therapy, notably SBRT, can be used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma when combined with PVTT. Recent research has led us to believe that irradiation in the form of SBRT may cure hepatocellular carcinoma complicated by PVTT.

KW  - MALIGNANCIES
AB  - Cancer male breast is not very common. It comprises <1% of all breast cancers. Primary sites of metastasis are bone, brain, lung, and liver. Endobronchial and tracheal metastasis is very rare. To the best of our information, this is the first case of male breast carcinoma with upfront tracheal and endobronchial metastasis which presented as Superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO), initially evaluated on the lines of metastatic nonsmall-cell lung cancer. A 60-year-old gentleman presented with shortness of breath and features of SVCO. On primary evaluation, he was thought to be a case of nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Later on, it was confirmed to be carcinoma male breast with endobronchial and tracheal metastasis, which was reconfirmed with biopsy. The case we came across had symptoms associated with endobronchial metastases from primary extrapulmonary tumor and which was later found out to be breast. Treatment options are very different from lung primary and thus, we should be aware of the unusual disease presentation.

AB  - Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) refers to numbness, tingling, and burning sensation caused by chemotherapy that can cause impairment in Quality of Life (QoL) of the patients. Study assesses severity, risk factors, and quality of life of patients associated with CIPN. A cross sectional descriptive study was conducted at day care ward, tertiary care hospital India. Total of 98 patients receiving paclitaxel for >= 4 months were enrolled by convenient sampling. Data regarding demographics and clinical characteristics, CIPN severity, risk factors, and QoL were collected by structured questionnaires. Study revealed that median score of autonomic symptoms was higher than sensory and motor symptoms. Mean score of FACT/GOG-Ntx sub-domain was 99.05 +/- 20.87on a scale of 0 to 152. ECOG Performance status, current exercise behavior, and fruit and vegetable intake was found to be significantly (at p < .05) associated with sensory, motor, and autonomic symptom score. Therefore, CIPN was found to have debilitating effect on QoL.

AB  - Unselected multigene testing for all women with breast cancer (BC) identifies more cancer susceptibility gene (CSG) carriers who can benefit from precision prevention compared with family history (FH)/clinical-criteria-based guidelines. Very little CSG testing is undertaken in middle-income countries such as China, and its cost-effectiveness remains unaddressed. We aimed to estimate costeffectiveness and population impact of multigene testing for all Chinese BC patients. Data from 8085 unselected BC patients recruited to a Peking University Cancer Hospital study were used for microsimulation modeling, comparing three strategies in the Chinese setting: all BC women undergo BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 genetic testing, only BC women fulfilling FH/clinical criteria undergo BRCA testing, and no genetic testing. Prophylactic mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy would be adopted where appropriate. Societal and payer perspectives with a lifetime horizon along with sensitivity analyses were presented. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is compared to the USD 10,260/QALY (one-times GDP per capita) willingness-to-pay threshold. BC incidence, ovarian cancer (OC) incidence, and related deaths were also estimated. FH/clinical-criteria-based BRCA testing was ruled out on the principle of extensive dominance. Compared with no genetic testing, multigene testing for all BC patients had an ICER = USD 4506/QALY (societal perspective) and USD 7266/QALY (payer perspective), well below our threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed unselected multigene testing remained cost-effective for 94.2%/86.6% of simulations from the societal and payer perspectives. One year's unselected multigene testing could prevent 7868 BC/OC cases and 5164 BC/OC deaths in China. Therefore, unselected multigene testing is extremely cost-effective and should be offered to all Chinese women with BC.

AB  - Major head and neck surgery is a known factor for postoperative delirium; however, Cotard's syndrome (CS) has been rarely reported following head and neck surgery. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who underwent surgery for carcinoma right buccal mucosa and developed agitation and nihilistic delusion after extubation. The patient had a preexisting psychiatric history which is often reported as a risk factor for CS. Of interest, though is that this condition subsided as quickly as it emerged with only supportive counselling and brief pharmacotherapy.

AB  - Aim: Levels of Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a proangiogenic growth factor is elevated and dopamine downregulated in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). This study aims to investigate whether IGF-1 with dopamine can together modulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to prevent proliferative diabetic retinopathy while also attenuating angiogenic effects of IGF-1.& nbsp;Methods: Effect of combination of levodopa L-Dopa with IGF-1 was tested on normal retinal pigment epithelium cells (ARPE-19) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), followed by tube formation. Invivo analysis of anti-angiogenic potential assessed by chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Diabetes induction in wistar rats at two time points, 12 and 16 weeks, treated with L-Dopa+IGF-1 and analysed for morphological variations, serum and tissue dopamine levels, gene expression by real-time PCR and western blot assay.& nbsp;Results: L-Dopa+IGF-1 on ARPE-19 cells caused no toxicity and worked synergistically. Reduced number of vessels observed. Significant improvement in inner retina thickness (*p < 0.05) was observed when L-Dopa was given alone and/or with IGF-1. Dopamine levels improved significantly in both serum and tissue (*p < 0.05). Levels of VEGF and IGF-1 receptors reduced significantly in 12 weeks. Western studies suggest that L-Dopa+IGF-1 modulates its effects via Akt/ERK dependent pathway.& nbsp;Conclusion: First ever report on synergistic effect of L-Dopa+IGF-1 in a rat model of diabetic retinopathy. Even though the effect of L-Dopa in combination with IGF-1 is comparable to levels of L-Dopa alone, this study presents an interesting finding of neuroprotective function of IGF-1, which has been studied in disease models of Parkinson's but not diabetes.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has left the health-care workers exhausted and the system dwindling. The challenges have been immense everywhere and even worse in developing countries. Despite the Indian Government's forethought and active investment in various national programs, the pandemic has brought unconceivable repercussions on the management and notification of several other lethal infectious diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis. Although the phenomenal capacity building for COVID-19 testing and diagnosis over a short time is admirable, the journey has been arduous. From convincing the hospital managements to create the recommended infrastructure, to the procurement of necessary equipment and consumables on an urgent basis, and providing services round the clock with limited workforce, the laboratory personnel throughout the country have done a remarkable job in their quest to combat the pandemic. However, the work needs to be pursued further in apprehension and preparedness for any emerging agents.

AB  - Introduction Trauma accounts for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease. Several trauma life support programmes aim to improve trauma outcomes. There is no evidence from controlled trials to show the effect of these programmes on patient outcomes. We describe the protocol of a pilot study that aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing advanced trauma life support (ATLS) and primary trauma care (PTC) with standard care. Methods and analysis We will pilot a pragmatic three-armed parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial in India, where neither of these programmes are routinely taught. We will recruit tertiary hospitals and include trauma patients and residents managing these patients. Two hospitals will be randomised to ATLS, two to PTC and two to standard care. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 30 days from the time of arrival to the emergency department. Our secondary outcomes will include patient, provider and process measures. All outcomes except time-to-event outcomes will be measured both as final values as well as change from baseline. We will compare outcomes in three combinations of trial arms: ATLS versus PTC, ATLS versus standard care and PTC versus standard care using absolute and relative differences along with associated CIs. We will conduct subgroup analyses across the clinical subgroups men, women, blunt multisystem trauma, penetrating trauma, shock, severe traumatic brain injury and elderly. In parallel to the pilot study, we will conduct community consultations to inform the planning of the full-scale trial.

AB  - Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) remains an important cause of urinary tract infection during pregnancy. Multiple molecular virulence determinants and antibiotic resistant genes facilitate its pathogenesis and virulence phenotype. Hence it is hypothesized that there will be considerable variation in genes among the isolates from symptomatic as well as asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to decipher the genetic variation among the two phenotypes. Six different UPEC isolates collected from urine specimens of consecutive pregnant females (five, symptomatic bacteriuria and one, ABU) were tested for their growth kinetics, and biofilm formation. A total of 87 virulence determinants and 56 antibiotic resistance genes were investigated using whole-genome sequencing, to identify putative drives of virulence phenotype. In this analysis, we identified eight different types of fully functional toxin antitoxin (TA) systems [HipAB, YefM-YoeB, YeeU-YeeV (CbtA), YhaV-PrlF, ChpBS, HigAB, YgiUT and HicAB] in the isolates from symptomatic bacteriuria; whereas partially functional TA system with mutations were observed in the asymptomatic one. Isolates of both the groups showed equivalent growth characteristics and biofilm-formation ability. Genes for an iron transport system (Efe UOB system, Fhu system except FhuA) were observed functional among all symptomatic and asymptomatic isolates, however functional mutations were observed in the latter group. Gene YidE was observed predominantly associated with the biofilm formation along with few other genes (BssR, BssS, YjgK, etc.). This study outlines putative critical relevance of specific variations in the genes for the TA system, biofilm formation, cell adhesion and colonization among UPEC isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic bacteriuria among pregnant women. Further functional genomic study in the same cohort is warranted to establish the pathogenic role of these genes.

AB  - Background: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are prevalent and difficult to treat worldwide. Most HAIs can be prevented by effective implementation of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. A survey was conducted to assess the existing IPC practices across a network of Indian Hospitals using the World Health Organization designed self-assessment IPC Assessment Framework (IPCAF) tool.Methods: This was a cross sectional observation study. Thirty-two tertiary care public and private facilities, part of the existing Indian HAI surveillance network was included. Data collected was analyzed by a central team at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, a tertiary care hospital of India. The WHO question-naire tool was used to understand the capacity and efforts to implement IPC practices across the network.Results: The overall median score of IPCAF across the network was 620. Based on the final IPCAF score of the facilities; 13% hospitals had basic IPC practices, 28% hospitals had intermediate and 59% hospitals had advanced IPC practices. The component multimodal strategies had the broadest range of score while the component IPC guidelines had the narrowest one.Conclusions: Quality improvement training for IPC nurses and healthcare professionals are needed to be pro-vided to health facilities.(c) 2021 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of leflunomide as a steroid-sparing agent among Indian patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and to assess the changes of "halo sign" within affected arteries, detected ultrasonographically, after remission. Methods In this prospective observational study, patients fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA and having halo sign in temporal artery ultrasound were treated with leflunomide and predefined tapering dose of prednisolone. Ultrasounds of temporal and axillary arteries were done at baseline and after remission were achieved. Results Twenty-two GCA patients were followed up for a median duration of 24 months (interquartile range, IQR: 18-33). All patients showed clinical improvement and steroids could be stopped in 17 out of 22 patients. Median time to achieve remission (symptom-free with normal inflammatory markers) was 3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.6) months. Median time to achieve reduction to prednisolone dose <5 mg/d was 9 months (95% CI: 7-11). Prednisolone dose could be reduced in all patients while on leflunomide, suggesting steroid-sparing effect and a steroid-free remission could be achieved after a median of 14 months (95% CI: 9.4-18.6). Ultrasonographically, all patients showed improvement of halo signs, after 8 weeks (IQR 7.25-12). Seven patients experienced a clinical relapse after 12 months (IQR: 5-21) of initial remission. The predictors of relapse were duration of symptoms before initiation of immunosuppression therapy and delayed achievement remission by strict criteria. Conclusion This study showed efficacy and safety of leflunomide as a steroid-sparing agent in Indian GCA patients.

KW  - ACID
AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is often considered as a disease of developing countries and India is the home of about 40% of RHD patients. Environment seems to play a major role in its causation. Since gene environment interactions can lead to alterations of various metabolic pathways, identification of altered metabolites can help in understanding the various pathways leading to RHD. Blood plasma samples from 51 RHD and 49 healthy controls were collected for the study. Untargeted metabolomics approach was used to identify the metabolites that are altered in RHD patients. Data showed 25 altered metabolites among RHD patients. These altered metabolites were those involved in Purine, Glutamine, Glutamate, Pyrimidine, Arginine, Proline and Linoleic metabolism. Thus, the present study illuminates metabolic alterations among RHD patients which can help in determining the potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is raising great concern all over the world. The recent introduction of vaccines has offered reason for optimism, however, new issues have arisen, such as vaccine reluctance. The safety of vaccines for pregnant women is one of the most serious of these concerns. The purpose of this review article is to provide updated international vaccine recommendations, results of ongoing studies and clinical trials, and the role of gynecologists in counseling the women to understand the risks versus benefits as well as form an informed decision towards vaccine acceptance for COVID-19. Although COVID-19 infection increases the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in pregnant women, pregnant women were not included in the initial vaccine trials. As a result, safety information is scarce. Nations have differing recommendations, though many have recently approved the COVID-19 immuni-zation in pregnancy following a risk-benefit analysis. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immu-nization (JCVI) of the United Kingdom recently approved an mRNA vaccination for pregnant women. Vaccination is recommended by the CDC, ACOG, ARFM, and WHO. India recently took a stand, with the ICMR and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare recommending vaccination during pregnancy and lactation.(c) 2022 Taiwan Association of Obstetrics & Gynecology.

AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive hematopoietic stem cell malignancy with poor outcomes despite the available treatment options including standard chemotherapy, selective targeted therapy and stem cell transplantation. Approximately similar to 30-40% of AML patients are refractory to initial therapy or succumb to relapse. Induction failure result from inherent resistance to chemotherapy, which is primarily driven by the chemo-resistant residual leukemic stem cells (LSC) that lead to disease progression and recurrence. The rarity and lack of universal surface markers for the identification and isolation of AML LSC renders a major challenge. Therefore, a perpetual quest for novel markers to characterize LSC and design anti-LSC therapies is ongoing. The evolving technologies from high-throughput bulk cell sequencing to high-dimensional single cell analysis has begun to decode the cellular hierarchies and dysregulated transcriptional networks in AML. These inherent properties of LSC as well as cross-talk with the extrinsic bone marrow microenvironmental milieu induce a conducive environment for leukemogenesis by secretion of various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors that shield LSC against conventional chemotherapy. To overcome these barriers, novel approaches of intratumoural delivery that focus on immune-mediated eradication by inducing microenvironmental changes within the tumour as well as avoid systemic toxicity seem encouraging. Selective targeting of LSC and their protective bone marrow niche holds immense potential as a promising therapeutic strategy for AML. Novel multimodal anti-LSC therapies are being explored that can overcome chemo-resistance and immune escape combined with reduced toxicity and sustained delivery may improve remission and survival rates in AML patients and decrease relapse.

AB  - Tumor heterogeneity, marked by the presence of divergent clonal subpopulations of tumor cells, impedes the treatment response in cancer patients. Single-cell sequencing technology provides substantial prospects to gain an in-depth understanding of the cellular phenotypic variability driving tumor progression. A comprehensive insight into the intra-tumor heterogeneity may further assist in dealing with the treatment-resistant clones in cancer patients, thereby improving their overall survival. However, this task is hampered due to the challenges associated with the single-cell data, such as false positives, false negatives and missing bases, and the increase in their size. As a result, the computational cost of the existing methods increases, thereby limiting their usage. In this work, we propose a robust graph learning-based method, ARCANE-ROG (Algorithm for Reconstruction of CANcer Evolution via RObust Graph learning), for inferring clonal evolution from single-cell datasets. The first step of the proposed method is a joint framework of denoising with data imputation for the noisy and incomplete matrix while simultaneously learning an adjacency graph. Both the operations in the joint framework boost each other such that the overall performance of the denoising algorithm is improved. In the second step, an optimal number of clusters are identified via the Leiden method. In the last step, clonal evolution trees are inferred via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The method has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, RobustClone, using simulated datasets of varying sizes and five real datasets. The performance of our proposed method is found to be significantly superior (p-value < 0.05) in terms of reconstruction error, False Positive to False Negative (FPFN) ratio, tree distance error and V-measure compared to the other method. Overall, the proposed method is an improvement over the existing methods as it enhances cluster assignment and inference on clonal hierarchies.

AB  - Since the introduction of Cetuximab as a biological molecule against Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), its use in the cancers of head and neck region is widely explored. With the recognition that EGFR expression is associated with radioresistance and poor prognosis, incorporation of an anti-EGFR agent along with Radiotherapy (RT) is a logical and attractive option. Cetuximab in combination with RT as Bio-Radiotherapy (BRT) is considered one of the standard treatment modalities in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancers (LA-HNSCC). Many important phase-III clinical trials were undertaken simultaneously, where the use of Cetuximab BRT was tested in various clinical scenarios with different hypothesis. With the studies still ongoing and the results awaited, its use was continued in clinical practice. Today the results are out and definitely not encouraging. After the initial success, Cetuximab has miserably failed to win over cisplatin based chemoradiation which is the current standard of care in LA-HNSCC. Hence, it is the need of the hour to re-evaluate and define the present role of Cetuximab in the definitive management of LA-HNSCC in the light of the latest clinical evidence..

AB  - Mesenchymal tumors of the stomach are uncommon, with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) being the most common among them. Majority of the tumors may arise from cells of Cajal, smooth muscle cells, neural cells, totipotent stem cells, adipocytes or fibroblasts. Imaging plays an important role not only in staging but also in characterizing these tumors. Many of these tumors have characteristic imaging features. GISTs usually present as large cavitating and necrotic tumors with exophytic component. Presence of fat tissue within the tumor suggests a lipoma or a teratoma, early phase hyperenhancement indicates glomus tumor and hemangioma, and delayed contrast enhancement is seen in schwannoma. Their differentiation from epithelial tumors like carcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors is often possible based on the location (mesenchymal tumors are intramural), spread, morphological appearance and enhancement patterns. However, overlapping features exist between these tumors with imaging often being only suggestive. A biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis in many cases.

AB  - Stimuli responsive polymer based on Polyaspartic acid, 2-Acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid and sodium alginate (NaAlg) were synthesized using two cross-linkers Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and TMPTA (Trimethylolpropane triacrylate). The polymers were standardized and optimized to obtain a polymer with maximum swelling in distilled water, saline, glucose and solutions of varying pH. The synthesized polymer swelled well in distilled water, glucose solution and acidic- alkaline medium. The biocompatibility of the polymer was evaluated for blood compatibility and protein adsorption. The polymer with maximum swelling property was used for peptide release studies. The polymer was further used to study the peptide encapsulation and release efficiency of the polymeric material which was confirmed by FTIR, Scanning Emission Microscope and EDX. The encapsulation efficiency of the polymer for encapsulating (glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine-copper) GHK-Cu was observed to be 55.26% and peptide release of 51.84% was observed for Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate based polymer after 24 h whereas for Trimethylolpropane triacrylate based polymer the encapsulation efficiency was observed to be 49.6% and release was 39.01%. The EGDMA based polymer was further examined under in vivo studies in order to evaluate the efficiency of the synthesized polymer. The in vivo studies include wound closure, histopathological analysis, biochemical and toxicity assay. The material has shown promising results for both in vivo and in vitro studies.

AB  - Earlier research from our laboratory demonstrated the presence of stimulatory activity of different growth factors in the fetal liver (FL) extracts when collected in a medium known as fetal liver conditioned medium (FLCM) using Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). In the present study, we have assessed two other cytokines viz. IL-6 and FMS like tyrosine kinase-3 (Flt-3) with the help of bioneutralization assay. FLCM was prepared by incubating fetal liver cells with Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% Phytohemagglutinin and collected after 24hrs, 48hrs, 72 hrs. and on the 7th day of incubation. Clonal cultures were established for 1 X 105 normal bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (NBM MNC) per plate with methylcellulose medium containing cytokines SCF and EPO. Mean Colony forming units-granulocytes, erythrocytes, macrophages, megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM) were assessed with and without the addition of FLCM. It was found that FLCM enhanced the number of colonies made by NBM MNCs. Further, cytokines IL-6 and Flt-3, present in FLCM, were bioneutralized with respective anti-cytokine antibodies. Neutralized FLCM was evaluated for the colony-forming potential of CFU-GEMM colonies. The maximum reduction of 42% was seen with 20 ng/ml of anti-IL-6 antibody. Maximum suppression up to 20% was observed with 0.7 ng/ml of anti Flt-3 antibody for CFU-GEMM colonies. Presence of cytokines IL-6 and Flt-3 in FL extracts and their colony stimulatory activity suggests that fetal liver infusion (FLI) may be a valuable alternative for managing BM recovery in certain clinical conditions such as AA.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has globally jeopardized food security, with heightened threats for the most vulnerable including smallholder farmers as well as rural, indigenous populations. A serial cross-sectional study was conducted to document effect of COVID-19 pandemic on food environment, agricultural practices, diets and food security, along with potential determinants of food systems resilience, among vulnerable smallholder farmer households in indigenous communities of Santhal, Munda, and Sauria Paharia of Jharkhand state, India. Telephonic household surveys were conducted in two phases i.e., lockdown and unlock phase to assess the impact of the pandemic on their food systems and agricultural practices. Market surveys were conducted during the unlock phase, to understand the impact on local informal markets. Secondary data on state and district level food production and Government food security programs were also reviewed. For data analysis purpose, a conceptual framework was developed which delineated possible pathways of impact of COVID-19 pandemic on food environment, food security and food consumption patterns along with factors that may offer resilience. Our findings revealed adverse effects on food production and access among all three communities, due to restrictions in movement of farm labor and supplies, along with disruptions in food supply chains and other food-related logistics and services associated with the pandemic and mitigation measures. The pandemic significantly impacted the livelihoods and incomes among all three indigenous communities during both lockdown and unlock phases, which were attributed to a reduction in sale of agricultural produce, distress selling at lower prices and reduced opportunity for daily wage laboring. A significant proportion of respondents also experienced changes in dietary intake patterns. Key determinants of resilience were identified; these included accessibility to agricultural inputs like indigenous seeds, labor available at household level due to back migration and access to diverse food environments, specifically the wild food environment. There is a need for programs and interventions to conserve and revitalize the bio-cultural resources available within these vulnerable indigenous communities and build resilient food systems that depend on shorter food supply chains and utilize indigenous knowledge systems and associated resources, thereby supporting healthy, equitable and sustainable food systems for all.

AB  - Objectives Existing research on erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery is limited. Methods In this prospective, randomized study, 60 patients aged between 18 and 60 years were randomized into two groups (erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine). In the erector spinae plane block group, ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block was performed, following which a mixture of 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine and 0.5 mcg/kg of clonidine was injected. In the intrathecal morphine group, 150 mcg preservative-free morphine with 2 mL of normal saline was administered intrathecally. The primary outcome was to evaluate the perioperative opioid consumption in the first 24 h. The secondary outcomes were to evaluate hemodynamic response to surgical stimulus, visual analogue scale score, time to first analgesic requirement, postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative opioid consumption, urethral irritation, and incidence of drug-related adverse effects. Results Total perioperative opioid consumption in the erector spinae plane block group was 355.0 (265.0, 485.0) mu g and 240.0 (145.0, 370.0) mu g in the intrathecal morphine group (P = 0.09). However, the patients in the erector spinae plane block group had significantly greater postoperative fentanyl consumption (235.0 [120.0, 345.0] mu g) compared with those in the intrathecal morphine group (105.0 [30.0, 225.0] mu g). There were no statistically significant differences noted for intraoperative opioid consumption, postoperative visual analogue scale score, time to first analgesic request, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and catheter irritation between the two groups. Conclusions Although no statistically significant difference in intraoperative opioid consumption was seen between the erector spinae plane block and intrathecal morphine groups, postoperative opioid consumption was significantly higher in the erector spinae plane block group than in the intrathecal morphine group in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy surgery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In order to mitigate the challenges in microsurgical skill acquisition and training, especially in the COVID-19 era, we devised a novel microsurgical telementoring protocol for imparting microsurgical skill training in a socially distanced setting. We objectively analyzed its feasibility among neurosurgical trainees.
   METHODS: In a controlled experimental design, 8 residents at different stages of their tenure participated in a lazy glass microsurgical simulator-based telementoring exercise. Microsuturing with 4-0 silk, 10-0 nylon on silastic sheets, and eggshell peeling tasks were performed by the residents prior to and after a telementoring session by a panel of 4 neurosurgical experts. Impact of telementoring was assessed in terms of surgical accuracy, efficiency, and dexterity by providing objective (Performance score [PS]), subjective (Neurosurgery Education and Training School [NETS] score), and cumulative scores (CS). Subgroup analysis was performed to assess the impact at different stages of residency.
   RESULTS: PS, NETS score, and CS were significantly improved by telementoring sessions for 10-0 nylon microsuturing (P < 0.001), and egg-hell peeling tasks (P < 0.01). PS and CS improved significantly (P = 0.01) after telementoring sessions for 4-0 silk microsuturing. Both pre- and post-training CS were similar across the 2 subgroups PGY 1-4 and PGY 5-6 (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Telementoring is a viable alternative for neurosurgical resident training in the COVID-19 era, where reduction in elective surgeries and social distancing norms preclude conventional teaching. Lazy glass microsurgical simulator-based structured telementoring protocol is a cost-effective tool to augment surgical proficiency and finesse, irrespective of stage of residency.

AB  - Lithium tetraborate is one of the tissue equivalent material that has been modified with numerous dopant/ codopant to improve its Thermoluminescence and Optical stimulated Luminescence properties. Lithium tetraborate doped with Aluminum is being investigated for Optical stimulated Luminescence dosimetry in this paper. Polycrystalline nano-phosphor samples were synthesized using two step solid state reaction method with optimized concentration of Aluminum equals to 2% (by wt.). Formation of the same and its morphology was confirmed using X-ray Diffractometry and Transmission Electron Microscopy. The various dosimetric properties of the obtained phosphor along with related Optical stimulated Luminescence kinetic parameters have been studied. The phosphor exhibits good linearity for gamma radiation in the range of 0.1-500 Gy with other properties such as low fading, satisfactory reusability & reproducibility and minimum detectable dose of 0.05 Gy. In this paper we have also explored the Temperature-Assisted Optical stimulated Luminescence properties of the obtained phosphor in the range of 25 'C to 200 'C and the optimized temperature corresponding to the maximum Optical stimulated Luminescence intensity was found to be 125 'C with activation energy equals to 0.108 +/- 0.02 eV. The studied nanophosphor has also shown linear response with dose gamma (1-200 Gy) and beta (0.05-3 Gy) at 125 'C.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - SP17 is a mammalian protein found in the testis and spermatozoa that have been identified as a tumor-associated antigen in a range of human cancers. A unique method for fabricating the first ultrasensitive, selective, and labelfree immunosensor for the detection of SP17, a new cancer biomarker in complicated serum samples, is presented in this paper. This immunosensor was also the first biosensor built using a disposable ITO sheet modified with an aminosilane known as APTMS as an immobilization platform for fabricating the SP17 biosensor. The immobilization of chemical and biological species onto the electrode surface was cross-verified by various analytical and morphological techniques. Stepwise modifications done on the immunoelectrodes were also studied using electrochemical techniques. Selective interaction between anti-SP17 and SP17 with varying concentrations (100-5000 pg mL-1) was measured with the DPV technique. The immunosensor exhibited low LOD and LOQ of 70.07 and 233.57 pg mL-1, respectively, with a sensitivity of 0.013 mu A mL pg-1 cm-2. The fabricated immunosensor performance was analyzed by quantifying the SP17 concentrations in patient serum samples. The data obtained from the developed immunosensor demonstrated excellent reproducibility, repeatability, and selectivity among various interferants, including cancer biomarkers. Further, the observed results have been validated via ELISA, which showed good agreement with the electrochemical results. This could establish a new platform for detecting other cancer biomarkers and can be employed for clinical diagnostics applications.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are emerging as an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine. It is known that the culture conditions impact the cellular properties of MSCs and their therapeutic behavior. Moreover, maintenance of MSCs in low oxygen tension for a short duration has shown to be beneficial for MSCs as it is similar to that of their physiological niche. However, the precise mechanism through which hypoxia pre-conditioning affects MSCs is not clear yet. Thus, in this study, we have investigated the effect of hypoxia exposure (1% O-2) on tissue-specific MSCs over a period of time under serum-free culture conditions and evaluated the changes in expression of immuno-modulatory molecules and exosome biogenesis and secretion markers. It was observed that all MSCs responded differentially towards hypoxia exposure as indicated by the expression of HIF-1 alpha. Moreover, this short-term exposure did not induce any changes in MSCs cellular morphology, proliferation rate, and surface marker profiling. In addition, we observed an enhancement in the expression of immunomodulatory factors (HLA-G, PGE-2, and IDO) after hypoxia exposure of 12 to 24 h in all tissue-specific MSCs. Interestingly, we have also observed the upregulation in exosome secretion that was further corelated to the upregulation of expression of exosome biogenesis and secretion markers (ALIX, TSG101, RAB27a, RAB27b). Though there was a differential response of MSCs where WJ-MSCs and BM-MSCs showed upregulation of these markers at 6-12 h of hypoxia pre-conditioning, while AD-MSCs showed similar changes beyond 24 h of hypoxia exposure.

AB  - The immune system is a well-known vital regulator of tumor growth, and one of the main hallmarks of cancer is evading the immune system. Immune system deregulation can lead to immune surveillance evasion, sustained cancer growth, proliferation, and metastasis. Tumor-mediated disruption of the immune system is accomplished by different mechanisms that involve extensive crosstalk with the immediate microenvironment, which includes endothelial cells, immune cells, and stromal cells, to create a favorable tumor niche that facilitates the development of cancer. The essential role of non-coding RNAs such as microRNAs (miRNAs) in the mechanism of cancer cell immune evasion has been highlighted in recent studies. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate a wide range of post-transcriptional gene expression in a cell. Recent studies have focused on the function that miRNAs play in controlling the expression of target proteins linked to immune modulation. Studies show that miRNAs modulate the immune response in cancers by regulating the expression of different immune modulatory molecules associated with immune effector cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, B-cells, and natural killer cells, as well as those present in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. This review explores the relationship between miRNAs, their altered patterns of expression in tumors, immune modulation, and the functional control of a wide range of immune cells, thereby offering detailed insights on the crosstalk of tumor immune cells and their use as prognostic markers or therapeutic agents.

AB  - Malignancies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are rapidly spreading and commonly fatal. Like most cancers, the gene expression patterns in HCC vary significantly from patient to patient. Moreover, the expression networks during HCC progression are largely controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating multiple oncogenes and tumor supressors. Therefore, miRNA-based therapeutic strategies altering these networks may significantly influence the cellular behavior enough for them to cure HCC. However, the most substantial challenges in developing such therapies are the stability of the oligos themselves and that of their delivery systems. Here we provide a comprehensive update describing various miRNA delivery systems, including virus-based delivery and non-viral delivery. The latter may be achieved using inorganic nanoparticles, polymer based nano-carriers, lipidbased vesicles, exosomes, and liposomes. Leaky vasculature in HCC-afflicted livers helps untargeted nanocarriers to accumulate in the tumor tissue but may result in side effects during higher dose of treatment. On the other hand, the strategies for actively targeting miRNA therepeutics to cancerous cells through nano-conjugates or vesicles by decorating their surface with antibodies against or ligands for HCC-specific antigens or receptors are more efficient in preventing damage to healthy tissue and cancer recurrence.

AB  - Background Recommendations regarding the timing of cholecystectomy for acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) require a systematic summary of current evidence to guide clinical practice. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing early cholecystectomy (EC) versus delayed cholecystectomy (DC) in patients with ABP. Methods We searched databases Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials addressing this question. Pairs of reviewers abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was done to study the effect of the timing of cholecystectomy on outcomes of interest in patients with ABP. GRADE methodology was used to rate the quality in the body of evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low. Results 11 randomized trials (1176 participants) were included. High-quality evidence from seven RCTs (867 participants) showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk for recurrent biliary events in favour of early cholecystectomy (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.19, I-2 = 0%). High-quality evidence from five trials was in favour of early cholecystectomy with a significant reduction in the risk 7of recurrent pancreatitis (RAP) in comparison to delayed cholecystectomy (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.51, I-2 = 0%). Conclusion This review showed that EC has definite advantages over DC in terms of reducing recurrent pancreaticobiliary events and LOS following mild ABP. However, more RCTs are required to study the role of EC in patients with moderately-severe and severe ABP. Trial Registration Protocol registered on Prospero (CRD42020192823).

AB  - Over 20 million burn injuries are reported every year, with severe cases requiring skin grafting. Traditionally, split thickness skin grafts are prepared by excising a small portion of healthy skin and its incision patterning using a suitable meshing device, which allows the graft to be expanded beyond its capacity. To date, the maximum expansion achieved through skin grafting has been reported to be less than three times, which is not sufficient for covering large burn sites with limited donor site skin. In this work, we have attempted to study skin graft expansion potential with novel auxetic patterns, which are known to exhibit negative Poisson's effect. Two-layer skin graft models were developed using eight different auxetic incision patterns, and subjected to uniaxial and biaxial tensile strains. The Poisson's ratio, meshing ratio, and induced stresses were characterized for all graft models. The numerical results indicated expansion potentials greater than that of traditional skin grafts across all loads. Extremely high expansions (i.e., >30 times) were estimated for the I-Shaped Re-entrant and Rotating Triangles shaped auxetic models without rupture. Such pioneering findings are anticipated to initiate ground-breaking advances towards skin graft research and improved outcomes in burn surgeries.

AB  - Over the past decade, invasive techniques for diagnosing and monitoring cancers are slowly being replaced by non-invasive methods such as liquid biopsy. Liquid biopsies have drastically revolutionized the field of clinical oncology, offering ease in tumor sampling, continuous monitoring by repeated sampling, devising personalized therapeutic regimens, and screening for therapeutic resistance. Liquid biopsies consist of isolating tumor-derived entities like circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, tumor extracellular vesicles, etc., present in the body fluids of patients with cancer, followed by an analysis of genomic and proteomic data contained within them. Methods for isolation and analysis of liquid biopsies have rapidly evolved over the past few years as described in the review, thus providing greater details about tumor characteristics such as tumor progression, tumor staging, heterogeneity, gene mutations, and clonal evolution, etc. Liquid biopsies from cancer patients have opened up newer avenues in detection and continuous monitoring, treatment based on precision medicine, and screening of markers for therapeutic resistance. Though the technology of liquid biopsies is still evolving, its non-invasive nature promises to open new eras in clinical oncology. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the current methodologies involved in liquid biopsies and their application in isolating tumor markers for detection, prognosis, and monitoring cancer treatment outcomes.

AB  - Study design Methodological study design: translation and test-retest reliability testing. Objectives To translate International Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Basic Data Set (ISCIQoLBDS) Version 1.0 into Hindi language and conduct reliability testing of Hindi ISCIQoLBDS (hISCIQoLBDS). Setting The study was conducted at Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, New Delhi, India. Methods The study was done in two phases-translation of ISCIQoLBDS Version 1.0 into Hindi language and reliability testing of hISCIQoLBDS. In the translation phase, the data set was forward translated by two independent professional translators. Then backward translation was done by another pair of professional translators to ensure the essence of the data set. For their feedback, field testing of hISCIQoLBDS was done on ten individuals with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). After this, an expert panel reviewed their recommendations, and the final hISCIQoLBDS was administered on 50 participants with SCI for test-retest reliability of the data set. Results hISCIQoLBDS was found to be equivalent to ISCIQoLBDS Version 1.0 on back-translation. It showed high test-retest reliability for each item in the data set. Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (95% CI) for items of hISCIQoLBDS was within the range of (0.91-0.98). Conclusion The hISCIQoLBDS is a stepwise systematic Hindi translation of the ISCIQoLBDS Version 1.0 for the Hindi literate population with high test-retest reliability. It can facilitate international data exchange on the quality of life (QoL) of Hindi literate individuals with SCI.

KW  - emergency department
KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Acute pain management in the emergency department (ED) is a challenging task, more so in pain due to malignancy. Opioids have life-threatening side effects in ED patients, along with the risk of dependency. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a recently described plane block technique with ease of performance and minimal side effects, making it suitable for emergency settings. Case Report: A 62-year-old male patient recently diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma presented to the ED with severe right upper abdominal pain. There was no pain relief with high doses of analgesics. ESPB was administered at T7 vertebrae level. The patient's Defense and Veteran Pain Rating Scale score reduced from 8/10 pre-procedure to 3/10 within 15 min, and 2/10 1 h after the procedure. He reported that he had an uninterrupted pain-free sleep after 4 days. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This?: ESPB is a novel regional analgesia that may help in management of uncontrolled severe pain not relieved with analgesics in patients with cholangiocarcinoma in the ED.

AB  - Aim To study the imaging characteristics and the associations of left atrioventricular valve atresia with patent aortic root and lateralized atrial chambers on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods We retrospectively evaluated all the CT angiography studies performed for the evaluation of various congenital heart diseases at our center from January 2014 to December 2021. Cases with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with lateralized atrial chambers were identified. The types of cardiovascular involvement as identifiable on CT angiography were studied and compiled. Results A total of 38 patients with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root were included (median age: 5 months, males: 31). A total of 89.5% had usual atrial arrangement and 10.5% had mirror imagery of atria. Normal drainage of right and left superior caval veins and inferior caval vein into systemic venous atrium was seen in 77.8%, 61.5%, and 86.6%, respectively. Anomalous pulmonary venous drainage was seen in 3 (7.9%) patients. Atrial and ventricular septal defects were the most common associations. Imperforate left atrioventricular membrane was seen in 9 (23.7%) patients and absent left atrioventricular connection in 27 (71.1%). Discordant right atrioventricular connection was seen in 5 (13.1%) patients. While a double outlet right ventricle (76.3%) was the most common ventriculoarterial connection, discordant ventriculo-arterial connection (transposition) in 4 (10.5%). Most patients had good sized pulmonary arteries. Patent arterial duct and right aortic arch were seen in 29% and 21%, respectively. Aberrant right subclavian artery was the most common arch vessel anomaly. Coronary anomalies were seen in 7 patients (19%); single coronary artery being the most common. Conclusions Majority of the patients with left atrioventricular valve atresia and patent aortic root with lateralized atrial chambers have usual atrial arrangement, normal right atrioventricular connections and a double outlet configuration of the right ventricle. Absent left atrioventricular connection is a more common than imperforate left atrioventricular valve membrane. Atrial and ventricular septal defects are the most common associations. Comprehensive CT based evaluation of vascular and nonvascular thoracic structures is imperative before surgery or interventions in patients with mitral atresia.

AB  - Most cells store metabolic energy in lipid droplets (LDs). LDs are composed of a hydrophobic core, covered by a phospholipid monolayer, and functionalized by a specific set of proteins. Formation of LDs takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where neutral lipid biosynthetic enzymes are located. Recent evidence indicate that this process is confined to specific ER subdomains, where proteins meet to initiate LD assembly. The lipodystrophy protein Seipin, is emerging as a major coordinator of LD biogenesis. Seipin forms a large oligomeric toroidal structure, which traps neutral lipids to promote LD nucleation. Here, we discuss the role of LD biogenesis factors that associate with Seipin to assemble functional LDs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To study the effect of 3 antioxidants viz. selenium, carnitine and coenzyme Q10, alone or in combination, on both semen parameters and pregnancy rates in couples with male factor infertility.
   METHODS Using PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search was performed of the PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases for randomized studies comparing selenium, carnitine or coenzyme Q10 with placebo in the treatment of male infertility and reporting semen and pregnancy outcomes.
   RESULTS A total of 3304 studies were screened of which 20 were included. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020210284). Pregnancy rate in the treatment group (69/426, 16.2%) was not different from the placebo (45/401, 11.2%) (P =.05). Treatment group showed higher motility [mean difference 5.05, 95% CI (2.77, 7.34), P =<.0001], progressive motility [mean difference 5.72, 95% CI (2.77, 8.66), P =.0001], sperm concentration [mean difference 6.58, 95% CI (3.22, 9.93), P =.0001] than placebo.
   CONCLUSION Although antioxidants and their combinations are associated with improvement in sperm concentration, motility, and semen volume, the differences are small. There is no difference in pregnancy rates between patients receiving selenium, carnitine, and coenzyme Q10, or placebo. The quality of studies is poor, limiting the level of evidence.

AB  - Introduction Factors such as compliance, cost and safety play a major role in achieving the long-term goal in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Dapagliflozin carries a great potential of becoming an alternate-day therapy because of its favorable pharmacological properties. Areas covered In this review, we have discussed and hypothesized the potential of dapagliflozin as an alternate-day add-on drug in T2DM patients. We have discussed the properties by virtue of which it carries a potential to become an alternate-day therapy. We have also explained the potential benefits and concerns of using this approach. Expert opinion Alternate-day add-on therapy with dapagliflozin could be a promising approach in reducing the cost, improving the treatment satisfaction and reducing the adverse effects. However, this propsed indication demands an in-depth investigation among T2DM subjects who are not able to achieve glycemic control with standard monotherapy or combination therapy. Pilot studies or some small-scale investigator-initiated trials or academic clinical trials may be carried out to explore this concept. At the same time, large industry sponsored multicenter clinical trials including pharmacoeconomic analyses may be planned to have a more detailed investigation.

AB  - With an increased number of questionnaire-based knowledge, attitude, practice and other types of studies, there is a need to perform evidence-based research in such designs as well. The systematic reviews (SR) and meta-analyses (MA) of the questionnaire-based studies are difficult to conduct and summarise due to the wide variations in the questions included in each of them. The presentation of these reviews often leads to ambiguous conclusions, and meta-analysis is not possible due to wide heterogeneity. This paper aims to highlight a method known as the 'Knowledge-Attitude-Practice' or 'KAP' Heat Map, which was developed and validated for the effective presentation of the outcomes of varied questionnaires in systematic reviews.

AB  - Aim: Most of the available data on the prevalence and impact of psychotic symptoms on the course of bipolar disorder (BD) is from Western countries. We aimed to study the prevalence of at least one psychotic episode in the lifetime in patients with BD and its association with the long-term course and outcome.
   Methodology: 773 patients recruited as part of the Bipolar Disorder Course and Outcome study from India (BiDCoIN study) were divided into 2 groups, based on the presence or absence of at least one psychotic episode in the lifetime.
   Results: 326 (42.2%) patients had at least one psychotic episode in their lifetime. At least one psychotic episode in the lifetime was associated with overall more severe illness in terms of lower age of onset, a higher number of episodes in the first 5 years of illness; higher rates of BD-II, a higher rate of lifetime history of at least 1 suicide attempt, lifetime history of hospitalization, history of receiving Electroconvulsive Therapy, and a higher prescription rates of antipsychotics. However, presence of psychotics symptoms was associated with better cognitive functioning.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the presence of psychotic symptoms during episodes in patients with BD is associated with poorer course of BD.

AB  - Background: Strict adherence to pharmacological dosage regimens is a prerequisite to the success of most treatments, particularly for patients in drug abuse programs. The compliance of tramadol, an atypical nonscheduled narcotic analgesic, using objective method has not been adequately studied in an Indian setting.
   Aim: To evaluate the compliance and pattern of drug use among opioid-dependent subjects prescribed tramadol based on urinalysis.
   Method: Fifty male opioid-dependent patients (ICD 10), seeking treatment at a tertiary de-addiction treatment centre of North India on tramadol prescription for atleast past four weeks were included. Self-reported substance use was recorded using semi-structured proforma. Ten ml of urine was collected for the assessment of compliance of tramadol of other substance use (morphine, buprenorphine, dextropropoxyphene, pentazocine, cannabis, benzodiazepines, pheniramine). All these drugs were analyzed using the immunoassay-based Cassette test and Gas Chromatography in human urine.
   Result: Mean age of the participants was 42.8 years and the mean duration of opioid use was 15.9years. The urine specimen of all subjects tested positive for tramadol. Urinalysis revealed benzodiazepines, cannabis, and pheniramine to be the most common substances of use in this population. It was seen that agreement of self-reporting and urine test results was good for morphine (kappa = 0.558) and cannabis (kappa = 0.312) and was poor for buprenorphine, pentazocine, and pheniramine.
   Conclusion: The study demonstrates the continued use of several illicit or non-prescribed medications in a medication-assisted opioid treatment population. The results affirm the reliability of urinalysis as an adjunct for testing compliance in such a population.

AB  - Nucleic acids, both DNA and small RNAs, have emerged as potential therapeutics for the treatment of various lungdisorders. However, delivery of nucleic acids to the lungs ischallenging due to the barrier property imposed by mucus, which isfurther reinforced in disease conditions such as chronic obstructivepulmonary disease and asthma. The presence of negatively chargedmucins imparts the electrostatic barrier property, and the meshnetwork structure of mucus provides steric hindrance to thedelivery system. To overcome this, the delivery system either needsto be muco-inert with a low positive charge such that theinteractions with mucus are minimized or should have the ability totransiently dismantle the mucus structure for effective penetration.We have developed a mucus penetrating system for the delivery ofboth small RNA and plasmid DNA independently. The nucleic acid core consists of a nucleic acid (pDNA/siRNA) and a cationic/amphipathic cell penetrating peptide. The mucus penetrating coating consists of the hydrophilic biopolymer chondroitin sulfate A(CS-A) conjugated with a mucolytic agent, mannitol. We hypothesize that the hydrophilic coating of CS-A would reduce the surfacecharge and decrease the interaction with negatively charged mucins, while the conjugated mannitol residues would disrupt themucin-mucin interaction or decrease the viscosity of mucus by increasing the influx of water into the mucus. Our results indicatethat CS-A-mannitol-coated nanocomplexes possess reduced surface charge, reduced viscosity of artificial mucus, and increaseddiffusion in mucin suspension as well as increased penetration through the artificial mucus layer as compared to the non-coated ones.Further, the coated nanocomplexes showed low cytotoxicity as well as higher transfection in A-549 and BEAS-2B cells as compared to the non-coated ones

AB  - Detection of microalbuminuria is a vital factor to prevent the progression of cardiovascular and renal disease. Several clinical studies on large population has shown the significance of dipstick in detection of micro-albuminuria. Although poor-quality of visual assessment has hindered its clinical utility. Automatic detection of trace and higher proteinuria is critical for detection of asymptomatic individuals. In this work, an automated, accessory free analytical system using smartphone for quantification of albuminuria has been investigated. A customised convolutional neural network (CNN) model along with different color spaces has been used to classify albumin concentration in urine dipstick. To mitigate ambient light conditions, smartphone camera was used in "Flash ON " mode. Performance of CNN model in different lighting conditions and with different smartphone models was studied and an accuracy of 88% was achieved on test data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In participants with concomitant chronic coronary disease and advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), the effect of treatment strategies on the timing of dialysis initiation is not well characterized.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: In ISCHEMIA-CKD (International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical and Invasive Approaches-Chronic Kidney Disease), 777 participants with advanced CKD and moderate or severe ischemia were randomized to either an initial invasive or conservative management strategy. Herein, we compare the proportion of randomized participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD at baseline (n=362) who initiated dialysis and compare the time to dialysis initiation between invasive versus conservative management arms. Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, we also sought to identify the effect of invasive versus conservative chronic coronary disease management strategies on dialysis initiation. At a median follow-up of 23 months (25th-75th interquartile range, 14-32 months), dialysis was initiated in 18.9% of participants (36/190) in the invasive strategy and 16.9% of participants (29/172) in the conservative strategy (P=0.22). The median time to dialysis initiation was 6.0 months (interquartile range, 3.0-16.0 months) in the invasive group and 18.2 months (interquartile range, 12.2-25.0 months) in the conservative group (P=0.004), with no difference in procedural acute kidney injury rates between the groups (7.8% versus 5.4%; P=0.26). Baseline clinical factors associated with earlier dialysis initiation were lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio [HR] associated with 5-unit decrease, 2.08 [95% CI, 1.72-2.56]; P<0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.30 [95% CI, 1.28-4.13]; P=0.005), hypertension (HR, 7.97 [95% CI, 1.09-58.21]; P=0.041), and Hispanic ethnicity (HR, 2.34 [95% CI, 1.22-4.47]; P=0.010).
   CONCLUSIONS: In participants with non-dialysis-requiring CKD in ISCHEMIA-CKD, randomization to an invasive chronic coronary disease management strategy (relative to a conservative chronic coronary disease management strategy) is associated with an accelerated time to initiation of maintenance dialysis for kidney failure.

AB  - Wireless Capsule Endoscopy is a non-invasive and painless procedure to examine the gastrointestinal tract of human body. An experienced clinician takes 2-3 h for a complete examination of approximately 57,000-1,00,000 images received during the procedure. To reduce this time, deep neural networks/models/architectures are being explored for developing computer aided diagnosis systems for abnormality detection in wireless capsule endoscopy images, which are taken in poor illuminated environment. Though colour and texture plays an important role in highlighting the features that help in abnormality detection; existing deep neural network models consider all the images in default RGB format. Existing deep learning models for this task are highly complex and computationally extensive due to having millions of training parameters. Thus, the presented work proposes a CNN based framework, TICT-CNN (Transforming Input Color Space in Tandem with Convolutional Neural Network) for binary classification of WCE images. The proposed TICT-CNN framework initially performs data augmentation and color space conversion on-the-fly before the CNN is trained for binary classification of images. The performance of different colour spaces has been thoroughly analyzed for classification of WCE images through objective parameters and feature maps. All the experimental analysis and ablation study has been done on a real dataset obtained from All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS Delhi). A crossdataset analysis has also been performed on a standard KID dataset. Analysis performed on real data obtained from AIIMS Delhi depicts that the performance of HSV colour space outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The performed analysis also reflects that a simple yet efficient step of choosing the right color space can reduce the trainable parameters by 2 to 6 times and can lead to diagnosis time of only 0.02 s/frame.

AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is a subset of sepsis with underlying circulatory cellular and metabolic abnormalities associated with higher mortality rates. However, a detailed understanding of sepsis is still limited. The present study reports the dif-ferences in the metabolic profile of serum samples of patients with sepsis compared to healthy controls using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The study also compares the NMR metabolomics on day zero of admission among sepsis survivors (those who survived till day seven) and sepsis non-survivors (those who succumbed on day zero). Furthermore, the different metabolites in serum were analysed by univariate and multivariate analysis, ROC analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) methods. Metabolites with VIP score (>1.0) were considered as potential biomarker/s to discriminate sepsis survivors from non-survivors at day zero. Data showed that phenylalanine was significantly higher in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls, whereas isoleucine, valine and histidine were significantly lower in sepsis patients compared to healthy controls. Also, non-survivors had higher serum levels of creatine, phosphocreatine, choline, betaine, tyrosine, histidine and phenylalanine concentrations than survivors. These findings suggest that the metabolic alterations at day zero may predict the survival of patients with sepsis. The significant differences seen in me-tabolites concentration of amino acids, phospholipids and creatine may be used as early prognostic markers to discriminate non-survivors from survivors of sepsis patients at day zero. Our findings indicate that the metabolite alterations are associated with the progression of the disease.

AB  - Purpose Brain tumours have an incidence of 1.15 to 5.14 cases per 100,000 children and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Radiosurgery has become a promising approach to manage these paediatric CNS tumours. The aim of the present study was to analyse the efficacy of radiosurgery in the treatment of a variety of paediatric tumours of CNS. Methods This retrospective study was conducted from 1997 to 2012 at a single Neurosurgery centre. All paediatric patients (<= 18 years of age) with CNS tumours who were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and had a minimum follow up of 6 months were included in the study. Patients with lesions other than tumours were excluded. Clinical, radiological and GKRS planning data was collected and analysed in all patients. Results A total of 76 children with brain tumours had GKRS during the study period. Of these, 40 children (with 61 neoplasms) had follow-up available and were included in the study. The mean age was 16 years (6-18 years). Seventeen patients received primary GKRS, 20 patients received secondary, and 3 patients received both. The median tumour volume was 3.3 cm(3) (0.14-38.9 cm3). The mean dose was 12.56 Gy at 50% isodose line. The majority of the tumours were meningioma (n = 20) followed by acoustic schwannoma (n = 17). The mean treatment time was 67.04 min. Thirty-three tumours responded favourably to GKRS, 24 showed a stable size, 3 had no response while 1 progressed, requiring surgery. Conclusion GKRS has the potential to become an indispensable tool in the management of paediatric brain neoplasms.

AB  - Background and objective: The limited literature available on quality of online health information about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), reported mixed findings and was more than five years old. This study aimed to assess the content quality, readability, aesthetics, and interactivity of current web-based information on ADHD.
   Methods: We screened first 50 links obtained on searching for ADHD using two popular search engines (Google and Bing), out of which 44 websites were selected for quality assessment. They were analysed using pre-decided study Performa, which included previously validated DISCERN instrument for content quality. Flesch-Kincaid grade level score and Flesch-Kincaid readability index were calculated for assessing readability.
   Results: About 61.4% of websites had DISCERN score >= 40, suggestive of good content quality. However, only 38.6% and 13.6% of websites were written at recommended reading level of eighth and sixth grade respectively. The DISCERN score had significant positive correlation with aesthetics and interactivity scores. Websites with the Health On Net (HON) label had better content quality. No significant difference in the readability, aesthetics, and interactivity of websites with and without the HON label.
   Conclusion: This study underscores the need for improving readability of web-based information on ADHD, and highlight important areas for improving the overall quality of websites. The use of HONCode label might guide general public in gauging the content quality of online health information, but not its readability or presentation.

AB  - Objectives Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage occurs during epileptogenesis and several pieces of evidence suggest that this might contribute to the progression of epilepsy. Seizures trigger a pathway involving glutamate signalling through cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This pathway leads to BBB leakage and induces the expression of drug efflux transporters, leading to drug resistance. Therefore, this study aims to determine the mRNA and protein levels of cPLA2, along with its functional activity, in the hippocampus of pilocarpine model of TLE as well as in the surgically resected hippocampal samples of patients with TLE. Methods mRNA levels and protein levels of cPLA2 were evaluated by real-time PCR and western blot analysis respectively in animal model of TLE as well as surgically resected hippocampal tissue specimens of TLE. cPLA2 functional activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Results Significant up-regulation of cPLA2 mRNA was observed in the hippocampal samples obtained from TLE rats (p < 0.05) and-TLE patients (p < 0.01). Increased protein expression of cPLA2 was also demonstrated in the hippocampal samples of TLE rats (p < 0.01) as well as TLE patients (p < 0.01). Similarly, functional activity of cPLA2 was found to be up-regulated in the hippocampus of pilocarpine model of TLE rats (p < 0.01) as well as in the TLE patients (p < 0.01). Discussion These findings suggest that alterations in cPLA2 expression and activity level in the hippocampus could potentially be a part of dynamic changes associated with TLE.

AB  - High prevalence of anaemia is a severe public health problem in India. In 2018, India launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy that focuses on six beneficiary groups for coverage, six institutional mechanisms for health system strengthening and six programmatic interventions to accelerate reductions in anaemia prevalence. This paper uses the Health Management Information System data (2017-18 to 2019-20) to examine gains in IFA coverage across Indian states. A coverage-based AMB index is computed to review performance across states. After the launch of AMB strategy, the Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation coverage between 2017-18 and 2019-20 has increased for all beneficiary groups [pregnant women from 78% to 90%; lactating mothers from 34% to 49%; school going adolescent girls (boys) from 23% to 40% (21% to 42%); out-of-school adolescent girls from 6% to 23%; children 5-9 years from 8% to 3% and children 6-59 months from 7% to 15%]. Coverage was relatively low for target groups being served through a multi-departmental convergence mechanism (health and other departments such as education department for schools or women and child development department for Anganwadi centres) than compared to those served by health department alone. However, no major gender disparities are noted in the coverage of IFA supplementation among school-going girls and boys. Bulk of the variations in coverage is attributable to state-specific differences. Training and sensitization workshops for state and district officials are found to be associated with increased coverage across beneficiary groups. The paper argues that despite following international best practices in the field, it is important to harness synergy in programme implementation across line departments to eliminate coverage inefficiencies.

AB  - Background Rituximab and tacrolimus are therapies reserved for patients with frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who have failed conventional steroid-sparing agents. Given their toxicities, demonstrating non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus may enable choice between these medications.
   Methods This investigator-initiated, single-center, open-label, pilot randomized controlled trial examined the non-inferiority of two doses of intravenous (IV) rituximab given one-week apart to oral therapy with tacrolimus (1:1 allocation), in maintaining sustained remission over 12 months follow-up, in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome, defined as frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent disease that had failed >= 2 steroid-sparing strategies. Secondary outcomes included frequency of relapses, proportion with frequent relapses, time to relapse and frequent relapses, and adverse events (CTRI/2018/11/016342).
   Results Baseline characteristics were comparable for 41 patients randomized to receive rituximab (n = 21) or tacrolimus (n = 20). While 55% of patients in each limb were in sustained remission at 1 year, non-inferiority of rituximab to tacrolimus was not demonstrated (mean difference 0%; 95% CI - 30.8%, 30.8%; non-inferiority limit - 20%; P = 0.50). Frequent relapses were more common in patients administered rituximab compared to tacrolimus (risk difference 30%, 95% CI 7.0, 53.0, P = 0.023). Both groups showed similar reductions in relapse rates and prednisolone use. Common adverse events were infusion-related with rituximab and gastrointestinal symptoms with tacrolimus.
   Conclusions Therapy with rituximab was not shown to be non-inferior to 12-months treatment with tacrolimus in maintaining remission in patients with difficult-to-treat steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. Frequent relapses were more common with rituximab. While effective, both agents require close monitoring for adverse events.

AB  - Background This consensus statement was developed because there are concerns about the appropriate use of opioids for acute pain management, with opposing views in the literature. Consensus statement on policies for system-level interventions may help inform organisations such as management structures, government agencies and funding bodies. Methods We conducted a multi-stakeholder survey using a modified Delphi methodology focusing on policies, at the system level, rather than at the prescriber or patient level. We aimed to provide consensus statements for current developments and priorities for future developments. Results Twenty-five experts from a variety of fields with experience in acute pain management were invited to join a review panel, of whom 23 completed a modified Delphi survey of policies designed to improve the safety and quality of opioids prescribing for acute pain in the secondary care setting. Strong agreement, defined as consistent among> 75% of panellists, was observed for ten statements. Conclusions Using a modified Delphi study, we found agreement among a multidisciplinary panel, including patient representation, on prioritisation of policies for system-level interventions, to improve governance, pain management, patient/consumers care, safety and engagement.

AB  - Background/Aim A crown-root fracture is a fracture of both the crown and the root of a tooth. The International Association of Dental Traumatology (2020) guidelines recommended fragment reattachment and stabilization of loose fragments as an immediate management protocol for uncomplicated crown-root fractures. However, the lack of evidence and unpredictability make it a less popular treatment option. The aim of this study was to compare three protocols of fragment reattachment for the management of teeth with crown-root fractures. Methodology Eighty mandibular bovine incisors with similar dimensions and no structural deformities were selected and randomized into four groups: Group I (Control/sound teeth); Group II (no rehydration); Group III (rehydration in distilled water for 15 min) and Group IV (rehydration in a humidification chamber for 15 min). A fracture was simulated to extend from the labial side of the middle-third of the crown to the palatal side of the cervical-third of the root. Fragments were exposed to the environment under normal temperature and pressure. Fragments were later reattached as per the standard protocol following the rehydration as specified for each group. Samples were subjected to thermocycling, and the force required to fracture them was evaluated by using a universal testing machine. Results The highest mean force required to fracture was seen in Group IV (208.27 +/- 75.99 N) followed by Group III (182.01 +/- 90.13 N) and Group II (158.85 +/- 68.04 N). These differences were statistically significant. Comparison of the mean difference of force required to fracture between pairs of groups revealed statistically significant mean differences only between the controls and each experimental group. Conclusion The force required to fracture the reattached fragments in teeth with crown-root fractures was affected by rehydration of the fragments. The force was higher in fragments reattached after rehydration, and the highest force was required in the teeth that had been rehydrated in a humidification chamber.

AB  - Context. Few efforts have attempted to quantify how well countries deliver end-of-life (EOL) care.
   Objectives. To score, grade, and rank countries (and Hong Kong and Taiwan) on the quality of EOL care based on assessments from country experts using a novel preference-based scoring algorithm.
   Methods. We fielded a survey to country experts around the world, asking them to assess the performance of their country on 13 key indicators of EOL care.
   Results were combined with preference weights from caregiver-proxies of recently deceased patients to generate a preference-weighted summary score. The scores were then converted to grades (from A-F) and a ranking was created for all included countries. Results. The final sample included responses from 181 experts representing 81 countries with 2 or more experts reporting. The 6 countries who received the highest assessment scores and a grade of A were United Kingdom, Ireland, Taiwan, Australia, Republic of Korea, and Costa Rica. Only Costa Rica (upper middle) is not a high income country. Not until Uganda (ranked 31st) does a low-income country appear on the ranking. Based on the assessment scores, twenty-one countries received a failing grade, with only two - Czech Republic (66th), and Portugal (75th) - being high income countries.
   Conclusion. This study provides an example of how a preference-based scoring algorithm and input from key stakeholders can be used to assess EOL health system performance. Results highlight the large disparities in assessments of the quality of EOL care across countries, and especially between the highest income countries and others. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Human cadaveric donors are essential for research in the anatomical sciences. However, many research papers in the anatomical sciences often omit a statement regarding the ethical use of the donor cadavers or, as no current standardized versions exist, use language that is extremely varied. To rectify this issue, 22 editors-in-chief of anatomical journals, representing 17 different countries, developed standardized and simplified language that can be used by authors of studies that use human cadaveric tissues. The goal of these editor recommendations is to standardize the writing approach by which the ethical use of cadaveric donors is acknowledged in anatomical studies that use donor human cadavers. Such sections in anatomical papers will help elevate our discipline and promote standardized language use in others non anatomy journals and also other media outlets that use cadaveric tissues.

AB  - Background There are no randomized controlled trials comparing the eTEP with IPOM repair and this randomized study was designed to compare the two techniques in terms of early pain, cost effectiveness, and quality of life. Method This was a prospective randomized trial with intention to treat analysis. The primary outcome was immediate post-operative pain scores. Operative time, conversions, peri operative morbidity, hospital stay, return to daily activities, incremental cost effectiveness ratio and quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF) were secondary outcomes. Results Sixty patients were randomized equally. Early post-operative pain scores and seroma rates were significantly lower and with a significantly earlier return to activity in eTEP group (p value < 0.05). With negative costs and positive effects, eTEP group was 2.4 times more cost effective. Conclusion eTEP repair is better in terms of lesser early post-operative pain, earlier return to activities and cost effectiveness in small and medium size defects.

AB  - Extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules play an important role in regulating molecular signaling associated with proliferation, migration, differentiation, and tissue repair. The identification of new kinds of ECM mimic biomaterials to recapitulate critical functions of biological systems are important for various applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The use of human elastin derived materials with controlled biological properties and other functionalities to improve their cell-response was proposed. Herein, we reported genetic encoded synthesis of ELP (elastin-like polypeptide) containing ECM domains like RGD (integrin binding ligand) and YIGSR (laminin-selective receptor binding ligand) to regulate cell behaviour in more complex ways, and also better model natural matrices. Thermal responsiveness of the ELPs and structural conformation were determined to confirm its phase transition behaviour. The fusion ELPs derivatives were analysed for mechanical involvement of growth mechanism, regenerative, and healing processes. The designed fusion ELPs promoted fast and strong attachment of fibroblast cells. The fusion ELP derivatives enhanced the migration of keratinocyte cells which of crucial for wound healing. Together it provides a profound matrix for endothelial cells and significantly enhanced tube formation of HUVEC cells. Thus, strategy of using cell adhesive ELP biopolymer emphasizing the role of bioactive ELPs as next generation skin substitutes for regenerative medicine.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Hyperosmolar agents are cornerstone therapies for pediatric severe traumatic brain injury. Guideline recommendations for 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) are based on limited numbers of patients, and no study to date has supported a recommendation for mannitol.
   OBJECTIVES To characterize current use of hyperosmolar agents in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury and assess whether HTS or mannitol is associated with greater decreases in intracranial pressure (ICP) and/or increases in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP).
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this comparative effectiveness research study, 1018 children were screened and 18 were excluded; 787 children received some form of hyperosmolar therapy during the ICP-directed phase of care, with 521 receiving a bolus. Three of these children were excluded because they had received only bolus administration of both HTS and mannitol in the same hour, leaving 518 children (at 44 clinical sites in 8 countries) for analysis. The study was conducted from February 1, 2014, to September 31, 2017, with follow-up for 1 week after injury. Final analysis was performed July 20, 2021.
   INTERVENTIONS Boluses of HTS and mannitol were administered.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Data on ICP and CPP were collected before and after medication administration. Statistical methods included linear mixed models and corrections for potential confounding variables to compare the 2 treatments.
   RESULTS A total of 518 children (mean [SD] age, 7.6 [5.4] years; 336 [64.9%] male; 274 [52.9%] White) were included. Participants' mean (SD) Glasgow Coma Scale score was 5.2 (1.8). Bolus HTS was observed to decrease ICP and increase CPP (mean [SD] ICP, 1.03 [6.77] mm Hg; P < .001; mean [SD] CPP, 1.25 [12.47] mm Hg; P < .001), whereas mannitol was observed to increase CPP (mean [SD] CPP, 1.20 [11.43] mm Hg; P = .009). In the primary outcome, HTS was associated with a greater reduction in ICP compared with mannitol (unadjusted beta, -0.85; 95% CI, -1.53 to -0.19), but no association was seen after adjustments (adjusted beta, -0.53; 95% CI, -1.32 to 0.25; P = .18). No differences in CPP were observed. When ICP was greater than 20 mm Hg, greater than 25 mm Hg, or greater than 30 mm Hg, HTS outperformed mannitol for each threshold in observed ICP reduction (>20 mm Hg: unadjusted beta, -2.51; 95% CI, -3.86 to -1.15, P < .001; >25 mm Hg: unadjusted beta, -3.88; 95% CI, -5.69 to -2.06, P < .001; >30 mm Hg: unadjusted beta, -4.07; 95% CI, -6.35 to -1.79, P < .001), with results remaining significant for ICP greater than 25 mm Hg in adjusted analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this comparative effectiveness research study, bolus HTS was associated with lower ICP and higher CPP, whereas mannitol was associated only with higher CPP. After adjustment for confounders, both therapies showed no association with ICP and CPP. During ICP crises, HTS was associated with better performance than mannitol.

TI  - Comparison of Abbott ID NOW, a novel isothermal amplification based COVID-19 diagnostic method with RTPCR
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS
KW  - SARS-CoV-2
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Abbott ID NOW
AB  - Background: The emergent crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous challenges for clinical laboratories to speed up diagnostics. The current reference standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is real time reverse transcriptase PCR on various platforms. However, even with automation, the turnaround time is huge enough to keep up with ever increasing numbers of patients. With increasing surge of COVID cases we need rapid diagnostic tests with good sensitivity and specificity.Objectives: Comparison between Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 and real time reverse transcriptase PCR as a reference method.Materials and methods: Specimens from seventy-two individuals were obtained over a period of two months which were processed for ID NOW and RTPCR at a dedicated COVID-19 centre of AIIMS. Dry nasal swabs were used for ID NOW while nasopharyngeal swabs along with throat swab were used for RTPCR. Among the participants, 15 were healthcare workers. Mild COVID was seen in 36 participants, moderate in 19 and severe in 9. Eight participants had non COVID illness.Results: From the given samples, we observed that ID NOW has a sensitivity of 93.22% (55/59) specificity 100% (13/13), PPV 100% (55/55) and NPV 76.47% (13/17).Conclusion: ID NOW is a convenient, rapid molecular test which makes it suitable for both in laboratory use and as a point of care test. It can be a rapid rule-in test for COVID-19. Negative results, however, have to be interpreted as per the context.

AB  - OBJECTIVES To use data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019) to estimate mortality and disability trends for the population aged a70 and evaluate patterns in causes of death, disability, and risk factors. DESIGN Systematic analysis. SETTING Participants were aged a70 from 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Years of life lost, years lived with disability, disability adjusted life years, life expectancy at age 70 (LE 70), healthy life expectancy at age 70 (HALE-70), proportion of years in ill health at age 70 (PYIH-70), risk factors, and data coverage index were estimated based on standardised GBD methods. RESULTS Globally the population of older adults has increased since 1990 and all cause death rates have decreased for men and women. However, mortality rates due to falls increased between 1990 and 2019. The probability of death among people aged 70-90 decreased, mainly because of reductions in non communicable diseases. Globally disability burden was largely driven by functional decline, vision and hearing loss, and symptoms of pain. LE-70 and HALE 70 showed continuous increases since 1990 globally, with certain regional disparities. Globally higher LE-70 resulted in higher HALE-70 and slightly increased PYIH-70. Sociodemographic and healthcare access and quality indices were positively correlated with HALE-70 and LE-70. For high exposure risk factors, data coverage was moderate, while limited data were available for various dietary, environmental or occupational, and metabolic risks. CONCLUSIONS Life expectancy at age 70 has continued to rise globally, mostly because of decreases in chronic diseases. Adults aged a70 living in high income countries and regions with better healthcare access and quality were found to experience the highest life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. Disability burden, however, remained constant, suggesting the need to enhance public health and intervention programmes to improve wellbeing among older adults.

AB  - Disseminated cysticercosis is defined by the presence of multiple vesicular cystic lesions in the brain with cysts demonstrable in at least two other body parts. The exact course of disseminated cysticercosis is not known and the individual cysts either become inflamed or calcify. A patient's quality of life is often poor and disseminated cysticercosis treatment is far from satisfactory. Anecdotal reports have suggested dual antiparasitic therapy to be beneficial for treating diffuse parenchymal neurocysticerci and might be worth trying in patients with massively infiltrating disseminated cysticercosis with concomitant corticosteroids.

AB  - Context Excess hepatic and pancreatic fat may contribute to hyperglycemia. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) on anthropometric profile, liver, and pancreatic fat in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods This is an observational interventional paired study design without a control group. Patients (n = 30) were given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (on top of stable dose of metformin and/or sulfonylureas) for 120 days. Changes in anthropometry (circumferences and skinfold thickness), surrogate markers of insulin resistance, body composition, liver, and pancreatic fat (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived proton density fat fraction [FF]) were evaluated. Results After 120 days of treatment with dapagliflozin, a statistically significant reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat, circumferences, and all skinfold thickness was seen. A statistically significant reduction in blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin A(1c), hepatic transaminases, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and postprandial C-peptide was noted, while HOMA-beta, postprandial insulin sensitivity, and fasting adiponectin were statistically significantly increased. There was no change in lean body mass. Compared to baseline there was a statistically significant decrease in mean liver FF (from 15.2% to 10.1%, P < .0001) and mean pancreatic FF (from 7.5% to 5.99%, P < .0083). Reduction in liver fat was statistically significant after adjustment for change in body weight. Conclusion Dapagliflozin, after 120 days of use, reduced pancreatic and liver fat and increased insulin sensitivity in Asian Indian patients with T2DM.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to present the procedural details and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings of perioperative chest-wall collateral embolization (PCCE) and compare intraoperative blood loss in patients of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) undergoing lung resection with and without PCCE. Materials and Methods Since November 2017, we have performed PCCE in 17 patients (14 males, three females, age 34.41 +/- 12.85 years) before surgery for PA (embolization group). Retrospective evaluation of these patients was done, DSA findings were noted, and perioperative parameters (surgical approach, extent of resection, operative time, blood loss, blood transfusion, morbidity grade, and length of post-operative stay) were compared with a comparative cohort of 24 patients of PA (21 males, three females, mean age 36.13 +/- 12.58 years) who underwent thoracic surgery without PCCE (May 2013-November 2017) (control group) using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results A total of 55 arteries were embolized in 17 patients (mean 3.23 arteries per patient). Technical success could be achieved in all patients without any procedure-related complications. The most common arteries embolized were posterior intercostal arteries (29) followed by costocervical trunk (10), superior thoracic (8), lateral thoracic (5), and internal thoracic arteries (3). The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the embolization group compared with the control group (676.47 vs. 1,264.58 mL, p = 0.015). Within the embolization group, patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery had even lower blood loss compared with open surgery cases (466 vs. 887.50 mL, p -value = 0.046). Conclusion PCCE is a simple and safe procedure, useful in reducing intra-operative blood loss in patients undergoing surgery for peripherally located PA.

AB  - Background and Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted blood systems worldwide. Challenges included maintaining blood supplies and initiating the collection and use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP). Sharing information on the challenges can help improve blood collection and utilization. Materials and Methods A survey questionnaire was distributed to International Society of Blood Transfusion members in 95 countries. We recorded respondents' demographic information, impacts on the blood supply, CCP collection and use, transfusion demands and operational challenges. Results Eighty-two responses from 42 countries, including 24 low- and middle-income countries, were analysed. Participants worked in national (26.8%) and regional (26.8%) blood establishments and hospital-based (42.7%) institutions. CCP collection and transfusion were reported by 63% and 36.6% of respondents, respectively. Decreases in blood donations occurred in 70.6% of collecting facilities. Despite safety measures and recruitment strategies, donor fear and refusal of institutions to host blood drives were major contributing factors. Almost half of respondents working at transfusion medicine services were from large hospitals with over 10,000 red cell transfusions per year, and 76.8% of those hospitals experienced blood shortages. Practices varied in accepting donors for blood or CCP donations after a history of COVID-19 infection, CCP transfusion, or vaccination. Operational challenges included loss of staff, increased workloads and delays in reagent supplies. Almost half of the institutions modified their disaster plans during the pandemic. Conclusion The challenges faced by blood systems during the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the need for guidance, harmonization, and strengthening of the preparedness and the capacity of blood systems against future infectious threats.

AB  - Objective To compare the efficacy and tolerability of combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block to topiramate monotherapy in adult chronic migraine patients. Background Options for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine are limited and costly. Combination treatments do not have an evidence base yet. Methods This was a parallel group, 3 arms with 1:1:1 allocation ratio randomized controlled study in consecutive adult chronic migraine patients attending Headache Clinic in a tertiary care hospital. Patients received either topiramate monotherapy 100 mg/day (group A), or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) and 80mg (2 ml) methylprednisolone as the first injection followed by monthly injections of lidocaine for the next 2 months (group B) or topiramate plus greater occipital nerve block with 40 mg lidocaine (2%) injections monthly for 3 months (group C). The primary endpoint was the mean change in monthly migraine days at Month 3. Multiple secondary endpoints were assessed that included among others, achievement of >= 50% reduction in mean monthly headache days compared to baseline at Month 3 and assessment for any adverse events. Results One hundred and twenty-five patients were randomized; 41 to group A, 44 to group B, and 40 to group C. Efficacy assessments were done for 121 patients. Patients receiving combination treatment of topiramate and greater occipital nerve block with steroids and lidocaine and greater occipital nerve block with only lidocaine compared to topiramate monotherapy showed greater reductions in monthly migraine days at Month 3 (-9.6 vs -7.3 days; p = 0.003) and (-10.1 vs -7.3 days; p < 0.001) respectively. Greater proportion of patients in both the combination treatment groups (added greater occipital nerve block with and without steroid) achieved >= 50% reduction in mean monthly headache days [71.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 3.9(1.6-9.8); p = 0.004] and [62.4% vs 39%; OR (95% CI) 2.7(1.1-6.7); p = 0.034] respectively, compared to those receiving topiramate monotherapy. Adverse effects between the groups were comparable although patients receiving combination treatment with added greater occipital nerve block reported transient adverse effects like post-injection dizziness, local site swelling, and pain. No serious adverse event was reported. Conclusion Combination treatments of topiramate with monthly injections of greater occipital nerve block were more effective in reducing monthly migraine days in chronic migraine than topiramate monotherapy at Month 3. Combination treatments were well tolerated.

TI  - ACE2 protein expression in lung tissues of severe COVID-19 infection
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - RECEPTOR ACE2
KW  - SARS-COV-2
AB  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key host protein by which severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters and multiplies within cells. The level of ACE2 expression in the lung is hypothesised to correlate with an increased risk of severe infection and complications in COrona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To test this hypothesis, we compared the protein expression status of ACE2 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in post-mortem lung samples of patients who died of severe COVID-19 and lung samples obtained from non-COVID-19 patients for other indications. IHC for CD61 and CD163 was performed for the assessment of platelet-rich microthrombi and macrophages, respectively. IHC for SARS-CoV-2 viral antigen was also performed. In a total of 55, 44 COVID-19 post-mortem lung samples were tested for ACE2, 36 for CD163, and 26 for CD61, compared to 15 non-covid 19 control lung sections. Quantification of immunostaining, random sampling, and correlation analysis were used to substantiate the morphologic findings. Our results show that ACE2 protein expression was significantly higher in COVID-19 post-mortem lung tissues than in controls, regardless of sample size. Histomorphology in COVID-19 lungs showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), acute bronchopneumonia, and acute lung injury with SARS-CoV-2 viral protein detected in a subset of cases. ACE2 expression levels were positively correlated with increased expression levels of CD61 and CD163. In conclusion, our results show significantly higher ACE2 protein expression in severe COVID-19 disease, correlating with increased macrophage infiltration and microthrombi, suggesting a pathobiological role in disease severity.

AB  - BackgroundPediatric sepsis is an important cause of mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where there is a huge burden of infectious diseases. Despite shortage of resources, adapting protocol-based care has reduced sepsis-related deaths but survivors of pediatric sepsis are at risk of poor functional outcomes. ObjectivesTo perform a scoping review of the literature on functional outcomes of pediatric sepsis survivors after discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU) and discuss the implications for patients in LMICs. The outcomes include prevalence of survival with reduced functional outcomes or quality of life (QoL) and changes over time during follow-up or recovery, and these outcomes were compared with other groups of children. MethodsWe searched major medical electronic databases for relevant literature from January 2005 until November 2021, including Medline (via PubMed), Embase, CINAHL, and Google Scholar databases. We included observational studies and follow-up data from clinical trials involving children/adolescents (<= 18 years) who were admitted to pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and got discharged finally. Major focus was on survivors of sepsis in LMIC. We followed PRISMA guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISM-ScR). ResultsWe included eight papers reporting data of functional outcomes in 2,915 children (males = 53%, and comorbidity present in 56.6%). All included studies were either a prospective or retrospective cohort study. Studies were classified as Level II evidence. Disabilities affecting physical, cognitive, psychological, and social function were reported in children following discharge. Overall disability reported ranged between 23 and 50% at hospital discharge or 28 days. Residual disability was reported at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up with an overall improving trend. Failure to recover from a baseline HRQL on follow-up was seen in one-third of survivors. Organ dysfunction scores such as pSOFA, PeLOD, vasoactive inotrope score, neurological events, immunocompromised status, need for CPR, and ECMO were associated with poor functional outcome. ConclusionsThe research on functional outcomes in pediatric sepsis survivors is scarce in LMIC. Measuring baseline and follow-up functional status, low-cost interventions to improve management of sepsis, and multidisciplinary teams to identify and treat disabilities may improve functional outcomes.

AB  - 4-Hydroxy isoleucine is one of the potent hypoglycemic active constituents of fenugreek seeds. A method capable of reducing biological interferences is required for bioavailability studies. An isocratic separation of 4-hydroxy isoleucine from endogenous interferences was achieved in ZIC-cHILIC column using 0.1% formic acid in water and acetonitrile (20:80, % v/v) pumped at 0.5 ml/min. Quantification was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode using the transitions of m/z 148.1 -> 102.1 and m/z 276.1 -> 142.2 for 4-hydroxy isoleucine and homatropine (as internal standard), respectively. After full method validation, 4-hydroxy isoleucine levels in human plasma and commercial fenugreek formulations were determined. This method showed good linearity in the range of 50-2000 ng/mL. Intra- and interday accuracies were in the range of 90.64-109.0% and precision was <4.82% CV. The mean (SD) plasma concentration of 4-hydroxy isoleucine in healthy individuals at 2 h after oral administration of fenugreek tablet was found to be 1590 (260) ng/mL. Half of marketed formulations were found to contain <0.05% of 4-hydroxy isoleucine content. We developed a rapid hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for analysis of 4-hydroxy isoleucine in human plasma. This method can be applied directly to conduct the clinical pharmacokinetics studies of 4-hydroxy isoleucine in human population.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 supplementation on absorption and utilization of protein in resistance-trained males. Methods In this double blind, placebo-control trial, resistance-trained males (21.08 +/- 2.84 years) were randomized to consume, either 20 g of whey protein powder {80% whey protein concentrate (WPC80), amounting to 15.4 g protein} with 2 billion CFU Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 (supplemental group) or 20 g of whey protein powder and lactose instead of Bacillus coagulans (placebo group) once daily for 60 days with a controlled resistance exercise protocol. The whey protein concentrate (WPC-80) given to both groups had a lactose content of 6.8%. Plasma-free amino acids (PFAAs) were determined at baseline, at 30 and 60 days of supplementation. Muscle strength, hypertrophy, VO2 max, and body composition, and other biochemical parameters were assessed at baseline and end line. Results A positive effect of probiotic Bacillus coagulans Unique IS-2 supplementation was observed on protein absorption as evidenced by an increase in total PFAA by + 16.1% (p = 0.004). Branched chain amino acids (BCAA) comprising isoleucine (p = 0.016), leucine (p = 0.001), and valine (p = 0.002) were increased by + 33.1% in ITT analysis as compared to placebo after 60 days. At 30 days an increase in isoleucine by + 35% (p = 0.113), leucine by + 43% (p = 0.032), and valine by + 32% (p = 0.017) was observed in ITT analysis. Probiotic effect was shown on exercise performance as evidenced by an increase in one RM of leg press and vertical jump power by + 16.61% (p = 0.024) and + 7.86% (p = 0.007), respectively. Conclusion Significantly increased absorption of BCAA with supplementation of B. coagulans Unique IS-2 along with whey protein and improvement in leg press and vertical jump power was noted indicating the positive effect of the probiotic on muscle power in the lower body.

AB  - Synthesis of a structurally complex hitherto unexplored novel class of pyrene fused pyrroloquinolinone was achieved in excellent yield via an environmental friendly solid-state melt reaction condition employ-ing multicomponent cascade protocol which involves 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and subsequent double an-nulation process. The 1,3-dipole component was derived in situ from diketone and alpha-amino acid, whereas the Baylis-Hillman adduct synthesized from pyrene-1-carbaldehyde was utilized as a dipolarophile. Struc-ture of the compound was elucidated by (1) H and C-13  NMR spectroscopic analysis and further confirmed through single crystal X-ray diffraction and the molecular packing was described by using Hirshfeld sur -face analysis. The structure-reactivity descriptors of the synthesized compound were examined through DFT calculations. The pyrroloquinoline was evaluated for its antibacterial activity against three multi drug resistant bacterial and two fungal pathogens. The MIC value of the tested microbial pathogens were ex-hibited with minimum (0.156 mg/mL) and maximum (1.250 mg/mL). The antimicrobial results disclosed that compound 6 is considered as a potent candidate for effective therapeutic applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a World Health Organization grade 1 neoplasm, which, due to its dubious morphologic features, may be misdiagnosed as a high-grade tumor at times. This tumor shows binary immunoexpression including both glial and neural markers, leading to a state of diagnostic quandary. Recent evidences have surmised the diagnostic utility of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), spurring us to study the practicality of this marker in distinguishing SEGAs from its mimics.
   METHODS: In this study, TTF-1 immunohistochemistry using clone 8G7G3/1 (1:50) was performed in 38 cases of SEGA, 30 cases of central neurocytoma, 10 cases each of intraventricular glioblastoma and ependymoma, and 5 cases of cortical tubers. Additionally, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAFV600E) mutation, a common genetic alteration in pediatric low-grade-glial tumors with neuronal-differentiation, was analyzed using Ventana immunohistochemistry platform.
   RESULTS: TTF-1 immunopositivity was seen in all 38 cases (100%) of SEGAs, with 20 cases (52.6%) showing diffuse (>50% of tumor area) expression while focal (<50%) immunopositivity was seen in 18 cases (47.3%). None of the cases demonstrated serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf immunolabeling. Barring 2 cases of neurocytoma (6.6%), all other cases including ependymoma, glioblastoma, and cortical tubers were immunonegative for TTF-1.
   CONCLUSIONS: The congruous finding of TTF-1 expression in SEGA and cells of the developing neuroepithelium in the medial ganglionic eminence hint toward a primogenitor cell with neoplastic potential in the presence of impelling factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to examine neurosurgical scientific publications and change in the trends in major neurosurgical journals during the last 10 years.
   METHODS: The peer-reviewed articles published in 12 prominent neurosurgical journals over the last 10 years were analyzed. The journals were grouped into 2 groups based on the number of articles published in a journal in a year (>= 500 or <500).
   RESULTS: The total number of peer-reviewed articles published in 10 years in these 12 journals was 48,957. The number of peer-reviewed articles published in a year increased from 3441 to 7316 over this time. The maximum number of peer-reviewed articles were published in 2019 in Group A (n = 7170) and in 2018 in Group B journals (n = 615). The commonest article types were Original Articles and Case Reports in both the groups, but the proportion of Original Articles published was greater in Group A journals (54.0%) as compared with Group B journals (44.5%). Review Articles were more commonly published in Group B journals. The proportion of articles published in Group A and B journals from the United States was 48.0% and 31.7%, respectively, whereas the proportion of articles from Europe was 21.4% and 36.2%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgical publications are continuously increasing, with a parallel growth in the number of authors and citations all over the world. There are significant differences in the scientometric indices of major neurosurgical journals based on their yearly articles published.

AB  - Objectives: The frequency, risk factors, and impact on survival of hemorrhage into (peri)pancreatic collections in patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) has not been well studied. The study was designed to evaluate the risk factors for hemorrhage, successful hemostasis and its effect on in-hospital mortality. Methods: In a prospective cohort study for prediction of severity of AP, the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of pancreatic hemorrhage were analyzed. Patients with significant hemorrhage were managed according to a predefined protocol including endovascular intervention. Results: Out of 363 patients hospitalized during the study-period, 33(9%) patients developed hemorrhage. Median time from onset of AP to hemorrhage was 59(45-68) days. The cause of hemorrhage was arterial in 19(57.5%) patients and unlocalized in 14(42.5%) patients. Hemorrhage was managed by conservative approach in 7 (21.2%), radiographic angioembolisation in 16 (48.5%), radiographic angioembolisation followed by surgery in 3 (9.1%), and surgery in 7 (21.2%) patients. Persistent organ failure [aHR 2.3 (1.1-5.1), p = 0.03], use of large bore ( 20 Fr) catheter for initial drainage [aHR 3.9 (1.7-9.1), p = 0.001] and extensive (>50%) necrosis [aHR 3.1 (1.4-6.9), p = 0.005] were significant risk factors for hemorrhage. Hemorrhage was an independent predictor of mortality [aHR 2.0 (1.2-3.4), p = 0.008] in addition to persistent organ failure (aHR 12.1 (5.7-25.8), p < 0.001). In-hospital mortality in patients with hemorrhage was 22/33 (66.7%) vs. 81/330 (25%) in no hemorrhage group [p <0.001].

AB  - Background: Forkhead box "O" one which is member of Forkhead box family of transcription factors is known to play key role in different physiological processes including cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and apoptosis. FOXO1 is defined to play tumor suppressive role in various malignancies including breast cancer and its Dysregulation is frequently reported. However, the evaluation of FOXO1 promoter methylation and its expression at mRNA and protein level in different stages of breast cancer and its association with different clinical parameters is still not studied. Therefore, for better understanding the role of FOXO1 in breast cancer, in our study we examined the FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression in Breast cancer samples of Indian breast cancer patients.Results: Total 127 breast cancer samples along with adjacent normal tissue (n = 127) were analyzed through methylation specific PCR (MS-PCR), mRNA expression (Real-time PCR) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC). We detected 69.29% cases to be downregulated at the mRNA level, and 77.95% of cases exhibited no or low protein expression. In our data we report a significant association (p = 0.0001) between the downregulated protein expression and promoter hypermethylation of FOXO1 gene. We also found a significant correlation of FOXO1 mRNA level with Age (p = 0.008), age at first live birth (p = 0,003), tumor size (p = 0.05) and lymph node status (p = 0.01).Conclusion: we in our study report the tumor suppressive role of FOXO1 in case of Indian breast cancer patients and our data suggest it to exhibit prognostic importance. However, further research is needed to evaluate FOXO1 significance in diagnostic and therapeutic targeting in breast cancer cases.

AB  - Background: The epidemiology of the Coronavirus-disease associated mucormycosis (CAM) syndemic is poorly elucidated. We aimed to identify risk factors that may explain the burden of cases and help develop preventive strategies.
   Methods: We performed a case-control study comparing cases diagnosed with CAM and taking controls as recovered COVID 19 patients who did not develop mucormycosis. Information on comorbidities, glycemic control, and practices related to COVID-19 prevention and treatment was recorded. Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors.
   Results: A total of 352 patients (152 cases and 200 controls) diagnosed with COVID-19 during April-May 2021 were included. In the CAM group, symptoms of mucormycosis began a mean of 18.9 (SD 9.1) days after onset of COVID-19, and predominantly rhino-sinus and orbital involvement was present. All, but one, CAM cases had conventional risk factors of diabetes and steroid use. On multivariable regression, increased odds of CAM were associated with the presence of diabetes (adjusted OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-11), use of systemic steroids (aOR 7.7, 95% CI 2.4-24.7), prolonged use of cloth and surgical masks (vs. no mask, aOR 6.9, 95%CI 1.5-33.1), and repeated nasopharyngeal swab testing during the COVID-19 illness (aOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.2). Zinc therapy was found to be protective (aOR 0.05, 95%CI 0.01-0.19). Notably, the requirement of oxygen supplementation or hospitalization did not affect the risk of CAM.
   Conclusion: Judicious use of steroids and stringent glycemic control are vital to preventing mucormycosis. Use of clean masks, preference for N95 masks if available, and minimizing swab testing after the diagnosis of COVID-19 may further reduce the incidence of CAM.

AB  - Purpose To describe a novel modification of tuck-in Tenon's patch graft (TPG) using temporary horizontal mattress sutures and fibrin glue to hitch the graft in the management of corneal perforations. Design Ambispective interventional case series. Methods Modified technique of autologous TPG was used to seal corneal perforations measuring 3-5 mm, using horizontal mattress sutures to hitch the graft in a lamellar pocket, followed by application of fibrin glue. The horizontal mattress sutures were removed after the reformation of the anterior chamber. The primary outcome measure was a well formed anterior chamber in the post-operative period and the secondary outcome was epithelization time. Results The surgery was performed in 22 eyes. The mean age was 43.86 +/- 16.02 (26-66) years, with 14 males and eight females. The etiologies of corneal perforation included dry eye (n = 10), neurotrophic keratitis (n = 6), trauma (n = 2), chemical injury (n = 2) and exposure (n = 2). The mean size of the perforation with the thinned-out area was 4.3 mm (range 3-5 mm). The mean duration of epithelialization was 14.31 +/- 2.63 days (7-21 days). No intraoperative complications were observed. All eyes had a well-formed anterior chamber in the immediate postoperative period. Postoperatively, two eyes had graft pseudoectasia due to a thick graft and supra tenon haemorrhage each; one eye each had graft thinning with the formation of pseudopterygium and graft melting. Conclusion Tenon's patch graft, along with the use of temporary horizontal mattress sutures and fibrin glue, is an effective modification of the technique for managing corneal perforations measuring 3-5 mm.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The most severe combinations of cardiac malformations exist in individuals having jumbled-up thoracic and abdominal organs. These patients make up 2 distinct syndromes. As yet, the consensus is lacking on how best to describe the subsets. The subsets are frequently grouped together in terms of 'heterotaxy'. The surgical approaches to the subsets, however, are markedly different. We reviewed our experiences with regard to the anatomy as observed in the autopsy room, by the analysis of computed tomographic studies, and in the operating room, to assess whether the lesions might be segregated on the basis of isomerism of the atrial appendages.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: A review of our findings from the examination of specimens from several archives, along with investigation of a large cohort of patients being prepared for surgical treatment, showed that individuals can uniformly be segregated into subgroups on the basis of isomeric arrangement of the atrial appendages. In all instances, this was made possible by using the criterion of the extent of the pectinate muscles within the appendages as judged relative to the atrial vestibules. Segregation on this basis, which correlated excellently with the bronchial arrangement, sets the scene for an appropriate description of the remainder of the heart, providing the cardiac surgeon with all the inferences required for appropriate surgical intervention.
   CONCLUSIONS: When assessing individuals having the features of so-called 'heterotaxy', it is possible to segregate the groups into subsets of individuals having either isomeric right or left atrial appendages. This approach provides the framework for the assessment of appropriate surgical management.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Women with recent gestational diabetes (GDM) have increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a resource-appropriate and context-appropriate lifestyle intervention could prevent glycemic deterioration among women with recent GDM in South Asia.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, participant-unblinded controlled trial investigated a 12-month lifestyle intervention vs usual care at 19 urban hospitals in India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Participants included women with recent diagnosis of GDM who did not have type 2 diabetes at an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 3 to 18 months postpartum. They were enrolled from November 2017 to January 2020, and follow-up ended in January 2021. Data were analyzed from April to July 2021.
   INTERVENTIONS A 12-month lifestyle intervention focused on diet and physical activity involving group and individual sessions, as well as remote engagement, adapted to local context and resources. This was compared with usual care.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was worsening category of glycemia based on OGTT using American Diabetes Association criteria: (1) normal glucose tolerance to prediabetes (ie, impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance) or type 2 diabetes or (2) prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. The primary analysis consisted of a survival analysis of time to change in glycemic status at or prior to the final patient visit, which occurred at varying times after 12 months for each patient. Secondary outcomes included new-onset type 2 diabetes and change in body weight.
   RESULTS A total of 1823 women (baseline mean [SD] age, 30.9 [4.9] years and mean [SD] body mass index, 26.6 [4.6]) underwent OGTT at a median (IQR) 6.5 (4.8-8.2) months postpartum. After excluding 160 women (8.8%) with type 2 diabetes, 2 women (0.1%) who met other exclusion criteria, and 49 women (2.7%) who did not consent or were uncontactable, 1612 women were randomized. Subsequently, 11 randomized participants were identified as ineligible and excluded from the primary analysis, leaving 1601 women randomized (800 women randomized to the intervention group and 801 women randomized to usual care). These included 600 women (37.5%) with prediabetes and 1001 women (62.5%) with normoglycemia. Among participants randomized to the intervention, 644 women (80.5%) received all program content, although COVID-19 lockdowns impacted the delivery model (ie, among 644 participants who engaged in all group sessions, 476 women [73.9%] received some or all content through individual engagement, and 315 women [48.9%] received some or all content remotely). After a median (IQR) 14.1 (11.4-20.1) months of follow-up, 1308 participants (81.2%) had primary outcome data. The intervention, compared with usual care, did not reduce worsening glycemic status (204 women [25.5%] vs 217 women [27.1%] hazard ratio, 0.92; [95% CI, 0.76-1.12]; P = .42) or improve any secondary outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that a large proportion of women in South Asian urban settings developed dysglycemia soon after a GDM-affected pregnancy and that a lifestyle intervention, modified owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, did not prevent subsequent glycemic deterioration. These findings suggest that alternate or additional approaches are needed, especially among high-risk individuals.

AB  - Background Cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in host defence against fungal pathogens, regulated by differentiation of lymphocytes towards T-helper 1 or 2 cells. This study reports intracellular cytokine variation in terms of invasive fungal sinusitis type and outcome. Methods The mononuclear leukocytes of 15 patients with invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis in 8, aspergillus in 7) were stained with antibodies against intracellular cytokines, after fungal antigen stimulation and culture, and immunophenotyped. Patients were followed up for six months, with clinical course categorised as improvement, worsening or death. Results The mean percentages of mononuclear cells producing interleukins 4, 5, 10 and 12, and interferon-gamma, in the mucormycosis group were 0.575, 0.284, 8.661, 4.460 and 1.134, respectively, while percentages in the aspergillosis group were 0.233, 0.492, 4.196, 4.466 and 1.533. Cells producing interleukin 4 and 10 were higher in the mucormycosis group, while those producing interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma were lower. Cells producing interleukins 4 and 12 were higher in patients with a poor outcome (p-values of 0.0662 and 0.0373, respectively), while those producing interferon-gamma were lower (p = 0.0864). Conclusion Adaptive cell-mediated immunity is expressed differently in two categories of invasive fungal sinusitis, and the cytokine expression pattern is related to prognosis.

AB  - Alopecia or baldness is a common diagnosis in clinical practice. Alopecia can be scarring or non-scarring, diffuse or patchy. The most prevalent type of alopecia is non-scarring alopecia, with the majority of cases being androgenetic alopecia (AGA) or alopecia areata (AA). AGA is traditionally treated with minoxidil and finasteride, while AA is treated with immune modulators; however, both treatments have significant downsides. These drawbacks compel us to explore regenerative therapies that are relatively devoid of adverse effects. A thorough literature review was conducted to explore the existing proven and experimental regenerative treatment modalities in non-scarring alopecia. Multiple treatment options compelled us to classify them into growth factor-rich and stem cell-rich. The growth factor-rich group included platelet-rich plasma, stem cell-conditioned medium, exosomes and placental extract whereas adult stem cells (adipose-derived stem cell-nano fat and stromal vascular fraction; bone marrow stem cell and hair follicle stem cells) and perinatal stem cells (umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs), Wharton jelly-derived MSCs (WJ-MSCs), amniotic fluid-derived MSCs (AF-MSCs), and placental MSCs) were grouped into the stem cell-rich group. Because of its regenerative and proliferative capabilities, MSC lies at the heart of regenerative cellular treatment for hair restoration. A literature review revealed that both adult and perinatal MSCs are successful as a mesotherapy for hair regrowth. However, there is a lack of standardization in terms of preparation, dose, and route of administration. To better understand the source and mode of action of regenerative cellular therapies in hair restoration, we have proposed the "A La Mode Classification". In addition, available evidence-based cellular treatments for hair regrowth have been thoroughly described.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the real-world prognostic significance of lymph node ratio (LNR) and log odds of positive lymph nodes (LOPLN) in patients with non-metastatic small bowel adenocarcinoma. Methods: Patients diagnosed with early-stage small bowel adenocarcinoma between January 2007 and December 2018 from a large Canadian province were identified. We calculated the LNR by dividing positive over total lymph nodes examined and the LOPLN as log ([positive lymph nodes + 0.5]/[negative lymph nodes + 0.5]). The LNR and LOPLN were categorized at cut-offs of 0.4 and -1.1, respectively. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for each nodal stage, LNR and LOPLN, adjusting for measured confounding factors. Harrell's C-index and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) were used to calculate the prognostic discriminatory abilities of the different models. Results: We identified 141 patients. The median age was 67 years and 54.6% were men. The 5-year overall survival rates for patients with stage I, II and III small bowel adenocarcinoma were 50.0%, 56.6% and 47.5%, respectively. The discriminatory ability was generally comparable for LOPLN, LNR and nodal stage in the prognostication of all patients. However, LOPLN had higher discriminatory ability among patients with at least one lymph node involvement (Harrell's C-index, 0.75, 0.77 and 0.82, and AIC, 122.91, 119.68 and 110.69 for nodal stage, LNR and LOPLN, respectively). Conclusion: The LOPLN may provide better prognostic information when compared to LNR and nodal stage in specific patients.

AB  - Background: Medial pivot total knee arthroplasty aims to restore native knee kinematics through highly conforming medial tibiofemoral articulation with survival comparable to contemporary knee designs. The aim of this study was to report preliminary clinical results of medial pivot total knee arthroplasty in an Indian population. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 45 patients (average age, 62 years; 40 women and 5 men) with end-stage arthritis (KellgrenLawrence grade 4) operated with a medial pivot prosthesis was done. All patients were assessed using Knee Society Score (satisfaction, expectation, and functional scores) and Oxford Knee Score, and range of motion was recorded at the end of 5-year postoperative follow-up. In addition, all patients underwent standardized radiological assessment. Results: At the final follow-up, patients reported significant improvement in mean Knee Society Score (satisfaction, expectation, and functional scores) and Oxford Knee Score (p < 0.05). The mean range of motion achieved at the end of 5 years ranged from 0 degrees (extension) to 118.4 degrees (further flexion). There was no evidence of loosening or osteolysis at a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Conclusions: These results demonstrated satisfactory clinical and radiological outcomes at 5 years after total knee arthroplasty with a medial pivot design, which may be related to better replication of natural knee kinematics with the medial pivot knee and inherent advantages of this design.

AB  - Purpose:To evaluate the causes of jet stream injury (JSI)-related iatrogenic retinal breaks (IRBs) during vitreoretinal surgery (VRS).Methods:The precise surgical environment, which includes the indication and type of surgical procedure, retina status, details of instrumentation and fluidic parameters, and characteristics of the jet responsible for the IRB, was noted from case records. The nature of IRB and its healing and impact on anatomical and visual outcomes were analyzed.Results:Five eyes of five patients with complete documentation of both the JSI and the IRB were included. Two cases were operated for macular hole, and one each for vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and endophthalmitis. One case had infusion-fluid-related JSI, while four developed it because of injection of surgical adjuncts (drugs, PFCL, and dye). JSI developed in two cases when the vitreous cavity was filled with fluid, while it was air-filled in three cases. In four cases, the fluid migrated into subretinal space, necessitating further maneuvers following which the breaks healed, but were directly responsible for vision loss in two cases.Conclusion:JSI related IRBs are rare but may be directly responsible for vision loss if they impact the macula. The balance between jet stream velocity, its distance from the retinal surface, the intervening media (vitreous cavity), and retinal health play an important role. It can occur because of both infusion as well as injection jets. Precautions must be taken in cases vulnerable to complications with suggested modifications in the surgical technique.

AB  - Ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) can recur, metastasize, and even cause death. Cyclins regulate the cell cycle progression at different phases and its dysregulation is associated with uncontrollable cell growth and malignant transformation of the cell. Overexpression of cyclin has been reported in various malignancies and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the role of cyclins in OSSN remains unexplored. This study has been designed to assess the prognostic significance of cyclin (cyclin B1, E1, and D1) immunoexpression in 100 OSSN patients. The targeted proteins demonstrated overexpression of cyclin B1, cyclin E1, and cyclin D1 in 55%, 37%, and 56% OSSN cases prospectively. A gradual and significant increase in the cyclin B1 (P=0.01) and cyclin D1 (P=0.005) expression was seen from Tis to the T4 category. Overexpression of cyclin B1 was associated with poor disease-free survival and worst prognosis in both early (P=0.03) as well as advanced T staged (P=0.038) OSSN patients. Overexpression of cyclin E1 was associated with worst disease-free survival (P=0.01) and poor prognosis in advanced stage OSSN patients. Our findings suggest that cyclin B1 and cyclin E1 have prognostic relevance in OSSN patients, and therefore are recommended for detecting high-risk category cases. A significant increase in the expression of cyclins from early to advanced stage indicates that cyclins play an important role in the pathogenesis of OSSN patients.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the surgical efficacy of reinforced plication of the medial rectus muscle to resection as an effective muscle strengthening procedure in exotropia. Methods: This is a prospective randomized trial in patients with exotropia who underwent complete orthoptic evaluation followed by random assignment into two groups by using a computer-drawn random number table. Group 1 patients underwent standard resection with recession procedure, and group 2 patients underwent reinforced plication with recession procedure. Follow-up was performed at day 1, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to assess the surgical efficacy. Results: A total of 80 patients were included in the study of which 39 were in group 1 and 41 in group 2. The mean age in group 1 was 23.48 +/- 11.94 years and 23.29 +/- 10.02 years in group 2. The mean preoperative deviation in group 1 for distance was 50.13 +/- 11.95 PD and 50.12 +/- 9.79 PD in group 2 (P = 0.499). In group 1 with a mean surgical dose of 5.27 mm medial rectus resection and 8.04 mm lateral rectus recession, a 7.11 +/- 3.95 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Similarly, in group 2 with a mean surgical dose of 5.16 mm medial rectus plication and 8.16 mm lateral rectus recession, a 6.00 +/- 2.46 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Between groups, ocular surface changes, inter-surgeon comparison, and exotropia subtypes did not reveal any significant differences. Conclusion: In our observation, the reinforced medial rectus muscle plication showed clinically comparable results as compared to the standard resection procedure at the end of 6 months. Therefore, this innovative modification can be considered as an alternative to standard resection.

AB  - Fungal endophthalmitis is a potentially blinding condition. It is more often reported from Asia, including India. The incidence is lower than bacterial endophthalmitis. But it is relatively more challenging to treat than bacterial endophthalmitis. Many eyes may need therapeutic keratoplasty and/or evisceration. The current mainstays of treatment are vitrectomy irrespective of the presenting vision, intravitreal antifungal agents, and systemic therapy; additionally, the patients could require prolonged treatment with repeat vitreous surgeries and intravitreal injections. Difficulty in clinical diagnosis, delay in microbiological culture, and limited options of antifungal drugs make the treatment more difficult and less rewarding. Three common fungi causing endophthalmitis are Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Candida. The former two are molds, often identified in exogenous endophthalmitis, postoperative and traumatic; the latter is yeast and is more often identified in endogenous endophthalmitis. A faster diagnosis with newer molecular microbiological technologies might help institute treatment earlier than it is currently possible. A target trial using big data from different regions of the world might emulate a randomized clinical trial to design a definite treatment strategy. Given fewer antifungal drugs, one must be mindful of antifungal stewardship to prevent resistance to the existing drugs.

AB  - The rapid growth of oral cancer is a significant concern, especially in developing countries due to the advanced lifestyle and 5-year survival despite advanced multimodality of cancer care. The poor modality might be due to the detection of disease in the advanced stage. Early detection and development of novel therapies can improve oral cancer patient survival. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK are very extensively exploited pathways in oral cancer. These pathways are very critical in the progression of tumorigenesis in oral cancer. This review focuses on the association of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways in terms of protein expression level, genetic mutation, and therapeutic intervention in oral cancer.

AB  - Background: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy are subjected to standard temporal lobectomy wherever indicated. This is performed using a reverse question mark flap and a standard frontotemporal craniotomy. We describe the technique of minitemporal craniotomy (3 x 3cms) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and analyze the clinical outcomes of patients operated using this approach.
   Objectives: To describe the technique of minitemporal craniotomy for TLE without navigation guidance and to analyze the clinical outcomes of patients operated using this approach.
   Materials and Method: This was a retrospective analysis of all consecutive TLE cases operated at our institute from 2014 to 2019, via minitemporal craniotomy, using surface landmarks only without navigation guidance. The surgical technique, indications for surgery, and their clinical outcomes were analyzed.
   Results: A total number of 48 patients underwent surgery for TLE. There were no complications except three patients who had transient hemiparesis. The average duration of hospital stay was 4 days following surgery. Out of 28 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, 22 (82%) had international league against epilepsy, Class I seizure outcome, 4 (12.5%) had Class II outcome and 2 (5.5%) had Class 111 outcome. 9 patients with dysembryoplastic neurectodermal tumor (DNET), 4 gangliogliomas, 2 neurocystecercosis (NCC), all had Class I outcome. Out of the five patients with MTS and associated anterior temporal focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), four (80%) had a Class I outcome, whereas one (20%) had Class II outcome.
   Conclusion: Utilizing surface anatomical landmarks, minitemporal craniotomy can be performed in even peripheral centers without neuronavigation, with good cosmesis, seizure outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND. Image-guided interventions for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) reduce hepatic congestion, thereby reducing liver stiffness. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by means of ultrasound may provide a noninvasive marker for assessing treatment response.
   OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess, with attention to changes in LSMs in patients with disease recurrence, the utility of 2D shear-wave elastography (SWE) for monitoring response to image-guided intervention in children with BCS.
   METHODS. This prospective study included children with chronic BCS and planned image-guided intervention. Color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) and 2D SWE were performed at baseline; 24 hours, 1 month, and 3 months after intervention; and every 3 months thereafter or when recurrence was clinically suspected. Eighteen children underwent liver biopsy at intervention for fibrosis staging according to the Metavir criteria. Disease recurrence was diagnosed with CDUS. Statistical evaluation was performed by means of nonparametric tests.
   RESULTS. A total of 32 children (28 boys, four girls; mean age, 9 years; range, 3-14 years) were included. The median LSM at baseline was 43.7 (interquartile range [IQR], 33.0-65.4) kPa, at 24 hours was 22.5 (IQR, 16.8-32.0) kPa, at 1 month was 18.7 (IQR, 14.2-32.0) kPa, and at 3 months was 16.7 (IQR, 11.5-22.5) kPa (p = .001 for all postintervention time points vs baseline). Nine (28.1%) patients had a recurrence at a mean of 4 months after intervention. In one patient with recurrence, LSM was higher at 24 hours (52.3 kPa) than at baseline (44.2 kPa). In the other eight patients with recurrence, LSM was increased at recurrence compared with the prior postintervention LSM (median absolute increase, 11.0 [IQR, 6.1-24.4] kPa). Fibrosis stage was not significantly correlated with baseline LSM (r = 0.11 [95% CI, -0.37 to 0.54];p = .51) or LSM 24 hours after intervention (r = 0.39 [95% CI, -0.11, 0.73]; p = .11).
   CONCLUSION. LSMs decreased significantly after image-guided intervention for chronic BCS in children, exhibiting a maximal decrease 24 hours after intervention. Disease recurrence was typically associated with an increase in LSM compared with the patient's prior measurement.
   CLINICAL IMPACT. LSM obtained with 2D SWE may serve as a useful quantitative adjunct to CDUS in monitoring children with chronic BCS for disease recurrence after percutaneous interventional treatment.

KW  - vaccine immunogenicity
AB  - The COVID-19 vaccination campaign is going on in Nepal through different phases of immunisation. It has been observed that people are misusing antipyretics and analgesics with the fear of adverse events following immunisation. The possibility of antipyretics and analgesics blunting the antibody response of the human body can be a potential cause for lower immune response and thus a reason for lower efficacy of the vaccine. Prophylactic use of over-the-counter analgesics and antipyretics is to be discouraged until the data for or against its use is available.

AB  - Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is a rare disorder of the adrenal gland due to mutations in the nuclear receptor superfamily 0, group B, member 1 (NR0B1) gene. It commonly presents with adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but there is a wide variability in the age as well as the clinical phenotype at presentation. Also, the mechanism of pubertal abnormalities in this condition, which include not just delayed or absent pubertal development, but also precocious puberty in a small proportion of cases, is not clear. In this paper, three unrelated patients with 3 different mutations are described, who presented with variable age of onset of adrenal insufficiency, gonadal development, and puberty, highlighting the need for high index of suspicion of this condition in children presenting with atypical features of adrenal insufficiency.

AB  - India has been witnessing an epidemic of diabetes for several years now. A large proportion of patients with undiagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes are at great risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) and irreversible blindness. The goal of DR screening is to identify people with sight-threatening DR early so that prompt treatment can be initiated, and blindness can be prevented. Systematic DR screening is essential to identify disease early, and a national effort for the same is required. We adopt a health system approach to outline the actions that need to take place for effective DR screening in the public sector in India. We discuss the role of national leadership, needs assessment, finalization of DR screening and referral pathway, trainings, strategies to improve the uptake, allocation of roles and responsibilities, public-private partnerships, quality control, and financing.

AB  - Purpose:To describe the variables that may be utilized in the optimization of three-dimensional heads-up surgeries (3D-HUS) for achieving better ergonomics among ophthalmic surgeons.Methods:A cross-sectional study was conducted at the operating room of a tertiary eye care center, equipped with an ARTEVO 800 3D surgical microscope and display monitor. The parameters noted were monitor height (MH), surgeon eye-to-floor distance (ETFD), surgeon eye-to-monitor distance (ETMD) and viewing tilt (VT) angle. The neck and eye strain of the surgeon and assistant were scored as per Borg's CR-10 scale, before and after surgeries.Results:Thirty (13 right, 17 left) eye surgeries were analyzed. The minimum ETMD was 51 inches (in) and the eye strain reduced with shorter ETMD (within the range 51 inches to 83 inches). The VT and ETFD were higher for right eye surgeries. The optimum MH was between 50 and 55 in. Overall, the neck strain and eye strain were in the range of 0-3 and 0-1, respectively.Conclusion:The various parameters affecting the 3D image quality, neck and eye strain are chair height, VT angle, eye centration, monitor distance, laterality of the eye, and room illumination.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence suggests distinct abnormal activity patterns during resting state in intrinsic functional brain networks in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study aimed to identify the changes in the resting-state intracortical lagged phase synchronization derived from dense array electroencephalography (EEG) in AD and MCI.
   Methods: Resting-state current source density (CSD) and lagged phase synchronization between 84 regions of interest defined by Brodmann areas (BAs) for seven EEG frequency bands were investigated between the study groups (AD, MCI, and age-matched controls) using 128-channel EEG.
   Results: Reduced CSD and connectivity (large effect size, Cohen's d> 0.8) were found in AD and MCI compared with controls at alpha frequency. However, a positive correlation (r= 0.433; p = 0.044) of mini-mental state examination scores was found with BA 32-33 connectivity values in AD only.
   Conclusion: Reduced resting-state alpha 1 source connectivity in patient groups and correlation between attenuation of resting-state alpha 1 connectivity with cognitive decline in AD could indicate the disruption of inhibitory function of alpha rhythm leading to tonic unselective cortical excitation that affects attention and controlled access to stored information.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an understudied pathogen that causes infection through fecal contaminated drinking water and is prominently found in South Asian countries. The virus affects ~20 million people annually, leading to ~60,000 infections per year. The positive-stranded RNA genome of the HEV genotype 1 has four conserved open reading frames (ORFs), of which ORF1 encodes a polyprotein of 180 kDa in size, which is processed into four non-structural enzymes: methyltransferase (MTase), papain-like cysteine protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and RNA helicase. MTase is known to methylate guanosine triphosphate at the 5 '-end of viral RNA, thereby preventing its degradation by host nucleases. In the present study, we cloned, expressed, and purified MTase spanning 33-353 amino acids of HEV genotype 1. The activity of the purified enzyme and the conformational changes were established through biochemical and biophysical studies. The binding affinity of MTase with magnesium ions (Mg2+) was studied by isothermal calorimetry (ITC), microscale thermophoresis (MST), far-UV CD analysis and, fluorescence quenching. In summary, a short stretch of nucleotides has been cloned, coding for the HEV MTase of 37 kDa, which binds Mg2+ and modulate its activity. The chelation of magnesium reversed the changes, confirming its role in enzyme activity.

TI  - Comparative Evaluation of Load-Bearing Capacity and Fracture Analysis of PEEK and Zirconia Three-Unit Fixed Dental Prostheses: An In Vitro Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS
KW  - PARTIAL DENTURES
KW  - STRENGTH
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory in vitro study was to compare and evaluate the load-bearing capacity (LBC) of ceramic-veneered zirconia and composite-veneered polyetheretherketone (PEEK) threeunit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with and without thermocycling (TC). Materials and Methods: The study included 40 samples of three-unit FDPs replacing mandibular first molars. The four groups included were: ceZIR (feldspathic ceramic???layered zirconia), ceZIR TC (feldspathic ceramic???layered thermocycled zirconia), cPEEK (composite-layered PEEK), and cPEEK TC (composite-layered thermocycled PEEK) (n = 10 per group). All frameworks were CAD/CAM milled. Ten PEEK and 10 zirconia samples were subjected to TC (6,000 cycles). All 40 FDP specimens were loaded by applying static load, using a universal testing machine. The maximum load required to fracture the specimens denoted the LBC. The comparison of LBC between the four groups was done by using two-way ANOVA with Tukey???s post-hoc analysis (?? = .05). Results: There was no statistically significant difference between LBC of cPEEK and ceZIR (P .001) without thermal aging. LBC values decreased considerably for thermally aged specimens. Statistically significant differences were observed between LBC of cPEEK TC and ceZIR TC (P < .001), cPEEK TC and cPEEK (P < .001), and ceZIR TC and ceZIR (P = .001). On fracture analysis, cPEEK showed delamination failures whereas ceZIR displayed catastrophic connector fractures. Conclusion: This comparative evaluation offers preliminary data highlighting substantial depreciation in the LBC of layered PEEK under simulated intraoral conditions, thus raising a question regarding the clinical longevity of layered PEEK multi-unit restorations. In contrast, feldspathic-layered zirconia can be suitable for use in posterior FDPs. Int J Prosthodont 2022;35:225???232. doi: 10.11607/ijp.7469.

AB  - Background & objectives: Obesity is a rising pandemic in childhood. There is scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese children. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of family-based comprehensive yoga intervention in the reduction of body mass index (BMI) in overweight/obese children, in comparison to standard dietary and lifestyle counselling and control group.
   Methods: This was an open-label randomized controlled study. Children aged 8-15 yr who were overweight or had obesity were randomized to one of the three arms for 18 wk; standard weight management (group 1), yoga with dietary modification (group 2) and control (no intervention; group 3). Reduction in BMI and improvement in physiological, biochemical and psychological parameters from baseline to 18 wk was compared between the three arms. Late follow up was also done at 6-12 months.
   Results: A total of 165 children with mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 11.6 +/- 1.8 yr and mean BMI 26.3 +/- 4.2 kg/m(2) were enrolled. Outcome analysis at 18 wk was performed for 109 children. Improved diet quality and reduced intake were observed in both intervention arms. The median (IQR) reduction in BMI in standard and yoga arms was similar [-1.4 (-3.1, -0.5) kg/m(2) and -1.2 (-2.3, -0.6) kg/m(2), respectively], while it increased by +0.3 (-0.3, 0.1) in the control arm. In the yoga arm, mean systolic BP reduced from 118 (10) to 114 (8) mmHg, (P=0.019). In the standard arm, significant improvement in psychological scores was noted. In group 3, the mean fasting glucose increased from 93 +/- 10 to 102 +/- 12 mg/dl (P<0.001).
   Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of the present study suggest that yoga in conjunction with dietary modification is equally effective as the standard weight management for BMI reduction in the paediatric age group.

AB  - Imaging plays a pivotal role in the management of various childhood arthritis. Conventional radiography is the most commonly ordered imaging modality for the evaluation of arthritis. Owing to their higher sensitivity for detecting synovitis, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography are increasingly being used to guide clinical management of various forms of arthritis, especially juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Magnetic resonance imaging is a preferred modality for evaluating more complex sites such as the sacroiliac joint. In this review, we have discussed the rational use and the characteristic imaging features of common childhood arthritis.

AB  - Purpose:Mutations in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are associated with increased telomerase activity in cutaneous melanomas. Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma, also referred to as ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma, is cancer on the surface of the eye. Recent studies have identified UV signature mutations in TERT promoters in ocular melanoma and ocular surface squamous neoplasia. However, its immunohistochemical status has not been reported in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to explore the immunohistochemical and mutational status of TERT in ocular surface SCC.Methods:The immunohistochemical expression of TERT and mutational status of TERT promoter was evaluated in 19 ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma cases. Conjunctival melanoma tissue was used as a positive control.Results:The cytoplasmic overexpression of TERT was detected in 11/19 (57%), and TERT promoter mutations were identified in 6/19 (31%) of ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. Out of these, 66% had a C228T mutation, and 33% had a C250T mutation. The TERT expression was found to be associated with a high (>= T3) AJCC category (P = 0.023), and TERT immunoexpression was significantly correlated with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0.024, log-rank analysis) in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma patients.Conclusion:The present study demonstrates that TERT promoter mutations with UV signatures are frequent in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. The increased expression of TERT could be of biological significance in aggressive ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sinonasal mucormycosis is a serious fungal infection. Early diagnosis and prompt antifungal therapy along with surgical intervention is the key to its management. Liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) given intravenously is the antifungal agent of choice. However, the current literature is not clear on its optimum dosage. We did a retrospective study to find the optimum dose of LAmB in cases with sinonasal mucormycosis.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with mucormycosis involving sinonasal, rhino-orbital, or rhino-orbito-cerebral regions and receiving only LAmB as pharmacotherapy were included in our retrospective study from 2017 to 2020. A multiple logistic regression model was developed to correlate the total dose of LAmB and other parameters with the final outcome which was defined clinico-radiologically as improved, worsened, or death. The dose of LAmB which led to the first significant change in urea, creatinine, and potassium levels was also determined.
   RESULTS: The model showed a good fit in goodness-to-fit analysis (Pearson = 0.999, deviance = 0.995), while the likelihood ratio was statistically significant (0.001). The overall model prediction was 83.3%. However, the correlation of outcome with any of the variables, including mean LAmB dose per kilogram (82.2 +/- 13.02 mg/kg), was statistically not significant.
   CONCLUSION: Many patient-related factors (such as age, comorbidities, extent of the disease, and side effects from LAmB therapy), which vary on a case-to-case basis, contribute to the outcome in a mucormycosis patient. The optimum dose of LAmB for improved outcome still requires individualization guided by experience, till well-designed studies address the question.

AB  - Though allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is standard for relapsed pediatric acute myeloid leukemia, often it may not be accessible due to donor unavailability and resource limitations. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of 26 children (mean age: 10.9 +/- 4.5 y) who underwent autologous HSCT in complete remission 2. Three-year event-free survival and overall survival were 50.1 +/- 10.7% and 63.3 +/- 9%, respectively; with 1 treatment-related death and 46% relapse rate. Notwithstanding the retrospective study design and somewhat favorable patient characteristics, the outcomes are comparable with those of other series and our own allogeneic HSCT data. Autologous HSCT is a potential alternative to allogeneic HSCT, especially in countries with poorly maintained donor registries.

An ageing population, advances in prevention and management, as well as increasing impact of non-communicable diseases have led to the need for a novel definition of health. We suggest health to be "a sustainable state of optimized physical, social and mental well-being, and not merely the absence of acute disease or infirmity".

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant threat to human health due to the lack of drugs that can potentially act against SARS-CoV-2. Also, even after the emergency approval of WHO, the vaccines' efficacy is still a question, and people are getting reinfections. Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of traditional medicinal plants against influenza and SARS coronavirus. The present article aims to review potential phytochemicals from Indian medicinal plants that may be used against SARS-CoV-2. Articles published in the English language between 1992 and 2021 were retrieved from Embase, PubMed, and Google scholar using relevant keywords, and the scientific literature on efficacies of Indian medicinal plants against SARS-CoV and influenza virus were analyzed. The initial search revealed 1304 studies, but, on subsequent screening, 115 eligible studies were reported. Twenty research articles investigating traditional medicinal plant extracts and metabolites against SARS-CoV and influenza A virus in in vitro and in vivo systems satisfied the search criteria. The studies reported that plant extracts and active compounds such as glycyrrhizin, 14-alpha-lipoyl andrographolide, and curcumin from medicinal plants such as Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra), Bhunimba (Andrographis paniculata), and Haridra (Curcuma longa) are effective against the various phases of the virus life cycle, viz., virus-host cell attachment, viral replication, 3CL protease activity, neuraminidase activity, adsorption and penetration of the virus. As per ancient Indian literature, plants in Ayurveda possess Rasayana (revitalizing) and Jwara hara (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory) properties. This evidence may be used to conduct experimental and clinical trials to study the underlying mechanisms and efficacy of antiviral properties of Indian medicinal plants against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Background Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) leads to an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation despite latent tuberculosis (LTB) screening, especially in TB endemic regions. Aim We evaluated the effect of stringent screening strategy and LTB prophylaxis on TB reactivation. Methods We performed an ambispective comparison between patients who received anti-TNF therapy after January 2019 (late cohort) and between Jan 2005 and Jan 2019 (early cohort). Late cohort patients were subjected to stringent screening criteria which included all: history of past TB/recent contact with active TB, chest X-ray, CT (computed tomography) chest, IGRA (interferon-gamma release assay), TST (tuberculin skin test), and if any positive were given chemoprophylaxis. A cohort comparison was done to evaluate for risk reduction of TB following the stringent screening strategy. Results One hundred seventy-one patients (63: ulcerative colitis/108: Crohn's disease, mean age diagnosis: 28.5 +/- 13.4 years, 60% males, median follow-up duration after anti-TNF: 33 months [interquartile range: 23-57 months]) were included. Among the 112 in the early cohort, 29 (26%) underwent complete TB screening, 22 (19.6%) had LTB, 10 (9%) received chemoprophylaxis, and 19 (17%) developed TB. In comparison, in the late cohort, 100% of patients underwent complete TB screening, 26 (44%) had LTB, 23 (39%) received chemoprophylaxis, and only 1(1.7%) developed TB (p < 0.01). On survival analysis, patients in early cohort had a higher probability of TB reactivation compared with the late cohort (HR: 14.52 (95% CI: 1.90-110.61 [p = 0.01]) after adjusting for gender, age at anti-TNF initiation, concomitant immunosuppression, anti-TNF doses, and therapy escalation. Conclusion The high risk of TB reactivation with anti-TNF therapy in TB endemic regions can be significantly mitigated with stringent LTB screening and chemoprophylaxis.

AB  - Background: Young age in osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) demands bone-preserving, short-stem arthroplasty. Several designs including neck-preserving stems and neck-resecting, shortened, standard stems are classified as short stems. There is a paucity of literature investigating risk factors and outcomes of intraoperative complications of neck preserving, short-stem arthroplasty in ONFH. Methods: A total of 107 hips operated with METHA short-stem arthroplasty for ONFH were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age of patients was 43.7 years (range, 27-60 years). Nine patients had an intraoperative fracture. Seven hips received prophylactic cerclage wiring for poor bone quality. Patients were invited for clinical and radiological evaluation at the latest follow-up. Results: The mean follow-up of patients was 47.2 months. Significant association with intraoperative fractures and the need for prophylactic cerclage wiring were found in steroids-, alcohol-, and chronic renal failure-induced ONFH. However, patient sex, body mass index, traumatic/idiopathic ONFH, previous implant in situ, prosthesis size, and single-sitting bilateral total hip replacement (THA) were not the risk factors. All hips showed signs of osteointegration at final follow-up. No revision was done during the study period for any cause. Conclusions: METHA short-stem THA offers excellent functional and radiological outcomes in ONFH. However, precaution must be exercised in patients with steroids-, alcohol-, and renal disorders-induced ONFN due to poor bone quality and higher chances of intraoperative fractures. Also, additional measures such as the use of a high-speed burr and prophylactic cerclage wiring in ONFH may allow predictable and safe use of short stems.

AB  - Background: A Phase IV, single-arm study was conducted to assess the safety of osimertinib in Indian patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation-positive stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Methods: Enrolled patients received 80 mg osimertinib for six cycles or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal. Primary safety variables included treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation/interruption/change (D/I/C) of drug dose, and AEs of special interest (AESIs). AEs were summarized by the percentage of patients experiencing at least one occurrence of each event.
   Results: Of the 60 enrolled patients (median age 58 [range: 34-81] years; 51.7% women) at eight sites, nine patients were discontinued prematurely due to disease progression (n = 7) and death (n = 2); median (range) duration of treatment was 126 (1-134) days. Median age of patients was 58 (34-81) years; 51.7% (n = 31) were women; 86.7% (n = 52) were nonsmokers; and most of them (98.3%) had adenocarcinoma. About 75% (n = 45) of patients experienced any of the TEAEs, with the most frequent being fatigue and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) increase (n = 6, 10% each). TEAEs in 11 (18.3%) patients were judged as study treatment related, with CPK increase being the most common (n = 4, 6.7%). TEAEs led to D/I/C of drug dose in eight (13.3%) patients, with one being study treatment related. Nine (15%) patients had AESIs of dyspnea (n = 6), chest pain (n = 2), and cardiorespiratory arrest (n = 1); two of them had a fatal outcome. One AESI (mild dyspnea) was considered study drug related. TEAEs of grade >= 3 were reported in seven (11.7%) patients, including dyspnea in two (3.3%), followed by diarrhea, mucosal inflammation, cardiorespiratory arrest, and others (n = 1, 1.7% each). None of the SAEs and fatal events were considered as study treatment related. Seven (11.7%) patients had abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG; not clinically significant) at the end of the study.
   Conclusion: Our study confirms the favorable safety profile of osimertinib without any new safety concerns in Indian patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive stage IV NSCLC.

AB  - Background: Attune (DePuy Synthes) prosthesis was designed to overcome patellofemoral complications associated with PFC Sigma (DePuy Synthes) prosthesis. The aim of our study was to compare the incidence of anterior knee pain (AKP), patellofemoral crepitus (PCr), and functional outcome between them. Methods: This prospective matched-pair study was conducted between January 2014 and June 2015, during which 75 consecutive Attune total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were matched with 75 PFC Sigma TKAs based on age, sex, body mass index, pathology, and deformity. A single surgeon performed all the operations with aid of computer navigation, using a posterior-stabilized prosthesis with patellar resurfacing. Outcome was assessed by new Knee Society Score (NKSS) and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score. AKP and PCr were assessed by a patient-administered questionnaire till 2 years of follow-up. Three pairs were lost to follow-up and finally 72 pairs were analyzed. Results: One patient in each group reported AKP and 1 patient from each group had PCr at 2 years postoperatively. None of these patients required additional surgery. The incidence of lateral retinacular release was higher with PFC Sigma (5/72) than Attune (2/72); however, this was statistically not significant (p = 0.4). The Attune group had a significantly greater range of motion (ROM) at 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.049). At final follow-up, ROM was comparable between two prosthesis designs. NKSS and WOMAC scores were also comparable between the groups. Conclusions: We observed that both Attune and PFC Sigma had a low and comparable incidence of AKP and PCr up to 2 years of follow-up. The Attune group achieved a significantly greater ROM at 3 months postoperatively. At 2 years of follow-up, both prostheses had excellent and comparable clinical and functional results.

AB  - Background: Intraoperative trans-esophageal migration of pulled-out screws, especially while using the zero-profile implant system, has been rarely reported in the literature. Objective: In this technical note, we are describing a simple technique to retrieve a trans-esophageally migrated pulled-out screw using a suction catheter. Material and Methods: A 32-year-old female presented with spastic quadriparesis. She underwent C5-C6 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). Nine months following the surgery, X-ray cervical spine showed implant loosening and failure of fusion across the instrumented disc space. However, during revision surgery, the loosened screw could not be located visually in the initial attempts, though it could be felt by probing the prevertebral space with the index finger. Intraoperative X-rays showed that the screw migrated curiously in the cranial direction as the surgical field was probed further manually. The screw was then finally retrieved using Magill's forceps assisted by video laryngoscopy assisted by intermittent negative pressure application via a blunt-tipped suction catheter. Results: She was discharged home on a Philadelphia collar, and at 1 year of follow-up, she was completely asymptomatic. Conclusion: Perforation of the aerodigestive tract by a displaced cervical spine implant is an uncommon complication. Manipulation during surgery may cause the implants embedded into the wall of the aerodigestive tract to become dislodged and then migrate into the pharyngeal lumen. In resource-constrained situations or when intraoperative endoscopy is not available, a trial of screw retrieval using a suction catheter may be attempted.

AB  - Stem cells can be defined as the cells that have the capacity to both self-renew and give rise to differentiated cells. Under the right conditions and signals, depending on their origin and bio-plasticity, stem cells can differentiate into multiple cell lineages and develop into various mature cells. Stem cell therapy is a fast-developing branch of medicine that includes the most innovative regenerative therapies for the restoration of cell and tissue function in individuals with severe diseases. Stem cell research has resulted in the emergence of cell-based therapies for disorders that are resistant to conventional drugs and therapies, and they are considered under the category of an Advanced Therapeutic Medicinal Product (ATMP). The FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) devised a new strategy in 2017 with the aim of unifying the standards for development of ATMPs such that it is easy to exchange information at the international level. In this review, we discuss the evolution of mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy as an ATMP in the global and Indian scenarios, along with the guidelines governing their usage and clinical application of these therapeutics.

AB  - The Mn(II) complexes are emerging as alternative T1-MRI contrast agents (CAs) to the currently available Gdbased CAs. The complexes [Mn(L1)] 1 and [Mn(L2)] 2 of o-phenylenediamine based macrocyclic ligands are reported as T1-CAs for MRI applications. The high spin state of the Mn(II) complexes (S = 5/2) is confirmed by EPR spectra. The complexes showed an irreversible Mn(II)/Mn(III) redox potential at pH 7.28, which became more and less positive at the acidic and alkaline pHs, respectively. The species [MnL], [Mn(LH-1), and [Mn (LH-2) are persisted in solution. Complex 1 is inert towards Ca(II), Mg(II), and Zn(II), whereas complex 2 is inert for Ca(II) and Mg(II) and labile under Zn(II) and Cu(II) ions. Complex 1 showed an r(1)-relaxivity of 3.27 and 2.32 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.41 T, 25, and 37 & nbsp;C respectively via inner-sphere water relaxation, which is lower than that of 2 (r(1), 5.56, and 4.19 mM(-1) s(-1)) at pH 7.28 and 1.41 T. The Mn(II) complexes showed a 2-8% enhancement of r(1)- relaxivity while lowering the pH to acidic, which corresponds to the release of free Mn(II) ions. In contrast, the r(1)-relaxivity is dropped to 52% and 20% for 1 and 2 respectively under alkaline pH due to the deprotonation of inner-sphere water. Phantom images obtained on Bruker 'BIOSPEC' 47/40 animal research MRI/MRS scanner showed concentration-dependent brightness. The interaction of human serum albumin (HSA) with 1 and 2 exhibited five times higher r1-relaxivities (11.3 and 22.0 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.41 T, respectively).

AB  - Purpose: To compare osteocalcin and crestal bone loss in implants placed under an immediate loading (IL) compared to a delayed loading (DL) protocol. Materials and Methods: This preliminary, split-mouth, randomized controlled trial included 14 participants who required replacement of both mandibular first molars opposing a completely dentate maxillary arch. Two implants were placed in each participant. According to the split-mouth randomization method, a temporary crown was used for the IL protocol and a healing abutment was used for the DL protocol in each participant. Definitive crowns were cemented 3 months after implant placement. Osteocalcin levels were determined using ELISA, and crestal bone loss was evaluated using radiographs at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months after implant placement. Results: The mean osteocalcin level was significantly higher with IL than DL at each point (P < .001), with 95% CI of ???262.89 to ???439.10 (2 weeks); ???238.02 to ???375.98 (3 months); and ???83.24 to ???211.61 (12 months). Higher crestal bone loss was observed in IL when compared to DL implants at 2 weeks (P = .458, 95% CI: ???0.10 to 0.21). Less crestal bone loss was observed with IL than DL at 3 months (P = .935) and 12 months (P = .42). Conclusion: Osteocalcin levels increased in both IL and DL implants, but higher levels were observed with IL. Higher crestal bone loss was observed with IL during the initial stages of treatment only. Int l Prosthodont 2022;35:174???180. doi: 10.11607/ijp.7489

AB  - Objective: Neurological emergencies saw a paradigm shift in approach during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with the challenge to manage patients with and without COVID-19. We aimed to compare the various neurological disorders and 3 months outcome in patients with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: In an ambispective cohort study design, we enrolled patients with and without SARS CoV-2 infection coming to a medical emergency with neurological disorders between April 2020 and September 2020. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, and treatment details of these patients were collected and compared. Their outcomes, both in-hospital and at 3 months were assessed by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results: Two thirty-five patients (235) were enrolled from emergency services with neurological disorders. Of them, 81 (34.5%) were COVID-19 positive. The mean (SD) age was 49.5 (17.3) years, and the majority of the patients were male (63.0%). The commonest neurological diagnosis was acute ischemic stroke (AIS) (43.0%). The in-hospital mortality was higher in the patients who were COVID-19 positive (COVID-19 positive: 29 (35.8%) versus COVID-19 negative: 12 (7.8%), P value: <0.001). The 3 months telephonic follow-up could be completed in 73.2% of the patients (142/194). Four (12.1%) deaths occurred on follow-up in the COVID-19 positive versus fifteen (13.8%) in the COVID-19 negative patients (P value: 1.00). The 3-month mRS was worse in the COVID-19 positive group (P value <0.001). However, this was driven by higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 positive patients. Conclusion: Patients with neurological disorders presenting with COVID-19 infection had worse outcomes, including in-hospital and 3 months disability.

AB  - Background: Molecular tissue testing in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is done for the assessment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. EGFR mutation status is the basis for deciding the targeted treatment option for patients with metastatic NSCLC. The nonavailability of tissue samples and contraindications for biopsy pose a significant challenge. Hence, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by liquid biopsy can be a viable alternative for NSCLC patients.
   Methods: This study was conducted at 15 sites across India. EGFR mutation testing from plasma was done as part of the study at the central laboratory by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) method, and EGFR mutation test results from tissue samples (done as part of routine practice) were recorded for all the patients.
   Results: Out of the total patients enrolled (N = 245), the majority (64.5%, n = 158) were men. The median age of patients was 58.0 (range: 26-84) years. The concordance between plasma and tissue testing was found to be 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 77.55, 87.45). The sensitivity and specificity of NGS were 68.4% (95% CI: 56.92, 78.37) and 90.1% [95% CI: 84.36, 94.21), respectively. Plasma testing detected 1.2% (n = 3) and tissue sample testing detected 2.4% (n = 6) positive status of exon 20 T790M EGFR mutation. Out of the total number of patients enrolled, 25 were tissue positive and plasma negative, while 16 were plasma positive and tissue negative.
   Conclusions: This real-world study in Indian patients suggests that plasma testing for EGFR mutation analysis is a viable diagnostic option in newly diagnosed advanced/metastatic NSCLC patients. The noninvasive plasma procedure in patients without available/evaluable tumor sample may enable more patients to receive appropriate targeted therapies by providing clinicians with valuable insights into the patient's tumor mutation status.

AB  - Background and Introduction: The interhemispheric transcallosal approach provides an elegant pathway to access the lesions of the third ventricle. However, every step of this approach is fraught with hazards which must be negotiated delicately. A comprehensive knowledge of surgical anatomy coupled with technical skill is necessary for optimum surgical results. Objective: This video aims to address the surgical nuances of the suprachoroidal transcallosal approach while accessing the lesions around the foramen of Monro in the anterior and middle part of the third ventricle. Surgical Technique: A 16-year-old boy presented with worsening headaches with episodes of speech arrest and blank stare for 6 years, which had become more frequent over the past 4-5 months. Radiology showed a subcentimeteric colloid cyst at the foramen of monro. A transcallosal corridor was used to reach the foramen of monro, and the suprachoroidal access was adopted to uncover the colloid cyst and excise it completely preserving the deep veins. Results: The patient had uneventful recovery and radiology showed complete excision of the cyst. Conclusion: Transcallosal approach, being minimally invasive, exploits the natural extra-axial corridor (interhemispheric) obviating the need for a cortical incision. The suprachoroidal approach mitigates the risks of thalamostriate vein injury, basal ganglia stroke, and hemiparesis.

KW  - TECHNICAL SKILLS
AB  - Background: The surgical skill practice in neurosurgery is being compromised in the recent past owing to the duty time constraint, patient safety concerns, and medico-legal issues. Surgical practice outside the operating room is essential to enhance a resident's operative skills and to gain confidence.
   Objective: To discuss the experience of establishing an 'in-house neurosurgery skills laboratory' and various training sessions conducted with cadaveric and non-cadaveric simulation modules.
   Methods: A skills laboratory was set up in the existing resident teaching hall with nine workstations. Each station has been equipped with an operating table, surgeon's chair, basic microscope, endoscope, high-speed drill system, and a suction machine. Vascular anastomosis, high-speed drilling, and basic neuroendoscopy were planned on low-cost non-cadaveric modules. Craniotomy and various surgical approaches were designed on cadaveric modules obtained from the anatomy department.
   Result: A total of 18 residents in divided groups during their initial three semesters had participated in the non-cadaveric simulation courses. Twenty-six residents had participated and 12 sessions were conducted on the cadaveric modules. Three workshops were conducted and 20 residents and faculty members from five other institutions had participated in the cadaveric hands-on training session.
   Conclusion: A well-equipped skills laboratory provides an opportunity for the residents to acquire operative expertise in a similar atmosphere to that of the operating theater. A structured program comprising various operative practice sessions should be incorporated into the resident training program.

AB  - Spindle cell squamous cell carcinomas (SpSCC) are aggressive neoplasms constituting 1% of oral cavity tumors. A proportion of SpSCC do not stain with epithelial markers, and frequently express mesenchymal markers, viz. Vimentin, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, S100 and desmin, confounding the diagnosis. Immunoexpression of SATB2, a transcription factor indicating osteoblastic lineage, has not been evaluated in SpSCC previously. We therefore performed SATB2 immunohistochemistry in 15 cases of SpSCCs and scored them with respect to intensity and percentage of tumor cells stained. SATB2 immunopositivity was identified in 9/15 (60%) SpSCCs, with varying intensity and distribution. Eight cases (53.3%) showed nonfocal staining of moderate to strong intensity, and 1 case (6.7%) showed focal weak staining. Of these, 3 cases (3/9; 33.33%) did not stain with epithelial/squamous markers. Thus, a subset of SpSCC demonstrate SATB2 immunopositivity. In oral tumors with bone involvement, SATB2 positivity may lead away from the diagnosis of SpSCC. Knowledge of this aberrant immunostaining is, therefore, extremely relevant to guard against misdiagnosis as osteosarcoma, particularly on biopsies which lack adjacent dysplastic epithelium, in cases which are monophasic spindle cell, and in those that do not show immunopositivity for epithelial/ squamous markers. Our results emphasize that an appropriate panel and not a single immunomarker is required to distinguish SpSCC from mesenchymal tumors including osteosarcoma.

AB  - We describe a case of a patient with multiple myeloma with initial presentation simulating a bleeding disorder. Detailed coagulation work-up showed hypodysfibrinogenaemia along with a platelet function defect consistent with acquired Bernard -Soulier syndrome (BSS). Multiple plasma exchanges led to significant improvement in his bleeding symptoms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first described case of simultaneous presentation of hypodysfibrinogenaemia and BSS secondary to multiple myeloma.

AB  - Background: Care of COVID-19 patients has been shown to affect the mental health of healthcare personnel (HCP), however, there is little data reflecting psychological health of HCP in India. Aims: The present study was undertaken to assess the prevalence of psychological outcomes and its association with various sociodemographic and occupational factors among the HCP in India. Methodology: A cross-sectional, online survey, using snowball sampling method was conducted between June 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020. The HCP working in COVID-19 designated hospitals across India were invited to participate. Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and 19-item stress-related questionnaire were used to evaluate symptoms of overall anxiety, depression, COVID-19 infection specific anxiety, exhaustion, and workload. Results: In this cross-sectional study with 2334 HCP from 27 states and 7 union territories of India; 17.9% of participants had depression, 18.7% had overall anxiety, 26.5% had exhaustion, 30.3% reported heavy workload, and 25.4% had COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety, respectively. The HCP working in states with higher caseload was a common risk factor for overall anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 1.7; P < 0.001), depression (OR, 1.6; P < 0.001), COVID-19 infection-specific anxiety (OR, 2.5; P < 0.001), exhaustion (OR, 3.1; P < 0.001), and heavy workload (OR, 2.6; P < 0.001). Nurses were more at risk for depression (OR, 2.2; P < 0.001), anxiety specific to COVID-19 infection (OR, 1.3; P = 0.034), and heavy workload (OR, 2.9; P < 0.001); while doctors were more at risk for overall anxiety (OR, 2.0; P = 0.001) and exhaustion (OR, 3.1; P < 0.001). Conclusions: Frontline workers, specifically nurses and doctors, and those working in states with high COVID-19 caseload are more at risk for adverse psychological outcomes. The relatively less prevalence compared with other countries, is perhaps a reflection of measures undertaken, including early lockdown, ensuring better all-round preparedness and social norms.

AB  - Phytotherapy for breast cancer, the second most common cancer diagnosed among women and a leading cause of their death globally, may serve as an adjuvant therapy to combat adverse chemo-and radiotherapy challenges. IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway, governing breast cancer progression, remains a favourite therapeutic target in developing phytotherapy. Therefore, identifying phytocompounds with novel targets influencing the IL-6/STAT3 pathway would help to develop phytotherapy for breast cancer. In this study, we demonstrate the novel binding site, i.e., the interface of IL-6 and IL-6R alpha of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway of cancer progression. Ten potent anticancer phytocompounds were analyzed for their binding with IL-6/IL-6R alpha complex using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Among all, genistein showed excellent binding energy (-10.59 kcal/mol) with the IL-6/IL-6R alpha interface of the STAT3 pathway. In cytotoxicity experiment, Genistein showed IC50 of 38 mu M and 18 mu M for 24 and 48 h, respectively, whereas quercetin showed IC50 of more than 50 mu M and 35 mu M at 24 h and 48 h, respectively on MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell line. Based on bioinformatic analyses and cellular toxicity assay, we propose genistein as a potential therapeutic phytocompound to inhibit the IL-6/STAT3 pathway by blocking the interaction of IL-6 with the IL-6 receptor.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background & objectives: Haemoptysis in children is potentially life-threatening. In most cases, the bleeding arises from the systemic circulation, and in 5-10 per cent of cases, it arises from the pulmonary circulation. The role of computed tomography angiography (CTA) in this setting is important. This study was undertaken (i) to study the role of single-phase split-bolus dual energy contrast-enhanced multidetector row CTA (DECTA) in the evaluation of haemoptysis in children; (ii) to analyze the patterns of abnormal vascular supply in the various aetiologies encountered.
   Methods: A retrospective study of 86 patients who underwent split bolus DECTA for the evaluation of haemoptysis was performed. Final diagnoses were categorized as normal computed tomography, active tuberculosis (TB), post-infectious sequelae, non-TB active infection, cystic fibrosis (CF), non-CF bronchiectasis, congenital heart disease (CHD), interstitial lung disease, vasculitis, pulmonary thromboembolism and idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis. Abnormal bronchial arteries (BAs) and non-bronchial systemic collateral arteries (NBSCs) were assessed for number and site and their correlation with underlying aetiologies.
   Results: A total of 86 patients (45 males, age from 0.3 to 18 yr, mean 13.88 yr) were included in the study; among these only two patients were less than five years of age. The most common cause of haemoptysis was active infection (n=30), followed by bronchiectasis (n=18), post-infectious sequelae (n=17) and CHD (n=7). One hundred and sixty five abnormal arteries were identified (108 BA and 57 NBSC), and were more marked in bronchiectasis group.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Active infections and bronchiectasis are the most common causes of haemoptysis in children. While post-infectious sequelae are less common, in patients with haemoptysis, the presence of any abnormal arteries correlates with a more frequent diagnosis of bronchiectasis. NBSCs are more common in post-infectious sequelae and CHD.

AB  - Hypoxic ischemic injury to the fetal and neonatal brain is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Although animal and culture studies suggest that glutamate excitotoxicity is a primary contributor to neuronal death following hypoxia, the molecular mechanisms, and roles of various neural cells in the development of glutamate excitotoxicity in humans, is not fully understood. In this study, we developed a culture model of human fetal neural stem cell (FNSC)-derived astrocytes and examined their glutamate uptake in response to hypoxia. We isolated, established, and characterized cultures of FNSCs from aborted fetal brains and differentiated them into astrocytes, characterized by increased expression of the astrocyte markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1) and EAAT2, and decreased expression of neural stem cell marker Nestin. Differentiated astrocytes were exposed to various oxygen concentrations mimicking normoxia (20% and 6%), moderate and severe hypoxia (2% and 0.2%, respectively). Interestingly, no change was observed in the expression of the glutamate transporter EAAT2 or glutamate uptake by astrocytes, even after exposure to severe hypoxia for 48 h. These results together suggest that human FNSC-derived astrocytes can maintain glutamate uptake after hypoxic injury and thus provide evidence for the possible neuroprotective role of astrocytes in hypoxic conditions.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive functions at a higher level than normal aging. Although the apolipoprotein (APOE) gene is a major risk factor in developing AD, other genes have also been reported to be linked with complex phenotypes. Therefore, this genome-wide expression study explored differentially expressed genes as possible novel biomarkers involved in AD. The mRNA expression dataset, GSE28146, containing 15 sample data composed of 7 AD cases from the hippocampus region with age-matched control (n = 8, >80 years), was analyzed. Using "affy" R-package, mRNA expression was calculated, while pathway enrichment analysis was performed to determine related biological processes. Of 58 differentially expressed genes, 44 downregulated and 14 upregulated genes were found to be significantly (p < 0.001) altered. The pathway enrichment analysis revealed two altered genes, i.e., dynein light chain 1 (DYNLL1) and kalirin (KLRN), associated with AD in the elderly population. The majority of genes were associated with retrograde endocannabinoid as well as vascular endothelial growth factors affecting the complex phenotypes. The DYNLL1 and KLRN genes may be involved with AD and Huntington's disease (HD) phenotypes and represent a common genetic basis of these diseases. However, the hallmark of AD is dementia, while the classic motor sign of HD includes chorea. Our data warrant further investigation to identify the role of these genes in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Background & objectives: Several studies have been conducted globally to assess the impact of usage of mobile phones on quality and duration of sleep as also on day time sleepiness. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of mobile phone usage on the quality and composition of sleep in a sample from Indian population.
   Methods: The study was conducted at two tertiary care hospitals in north India from July 2014 to September 2019. A total of 566 participants were recruited in this study from both the centres. Sleep quality was assessed with the help of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaire. Subsequently, actigraphy was done in 96 participants and polysomnography in 95 participants.
   Results: Of the 566 participants, 128 (22.61%) had PSQI >= 5, reflecting poor sleep quality. A higher use of mobile phone was significantly associated with a poor sleep quality as a component of PSQI questionnaire (P=0.01) and higher overall PSQI score (P=0.01). The latency from sleep onset to N2 and N3 sleep stages was significantly shorter in participants having a higher mobile phone usage as compared to those with a lower usage [Median (range): 13.5 min (1.5-109) vs. 6.5 min (0-89); P=0.02] and [Median (range): 49 min (8.5-220.5) vs. 28.75 min (0-141); P=0.03], respectively.
   Interpretation & conclusions: This study focused on the maladaptive changes brought on by mobile phone usage on sleep. More studies with larger sample sizes need to be done that may serve to confirm the hypothesis generating findings of our study.

AB  - Background: Cyclic neutropenia is a rare genetic disorder causing the arrest of neutrophil function and is characterized by periodic neutropenia and recurrent infections. Patients with cyclic neutropenia with autosomal dominant, sporadic, and X-linked may have mutations in the ELANE gene, and autosomal recessive cases have homozygous/compound heterozygous variants in the HAX1 gene primarily. Observation: The authors describe a novel variant in the HAX1 gene, which was detected by next-generation sequencing in an 8-year-old male child who presented with recurrent infections and neutropenia. Conclusion: The patient extends the clinical variability associated with HAX1 variants and highlights the importance of genetic investigations in patients with suspected cyclic neutropenia.

AB  - Simple Summary Incisional tissue biopsy is highly invasive, but it remains the current practice for oral cancer diagnosis through histopathological interpretation. To reduce biopsy invasiveness without compromising diagnosis, we pioneered a multigene RT-qPCR method for cancer detection using only a tiny 1 mm(3) minimally invasive biopsy. Here we presented international multicohort validation of our second-generation method which involved new genes from matrix/stroma and immune regulations enabling sensitive, quantitative and precise oral cancer detection in otherwise ambiguous oral lesions. Background: Heterogeneity in oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD) poses a problem for accurate prognosis that impacts on treatment strategy and patient outcome. A holistic assessment based on gene expression signatures from both the tumour cells and their microenvironment is necessary to provide a more precise prognostic assessment than just tumour cell signatures alone. Methods: We reformulated our previously established multigene qPCR test, quantitative Malignancy Index Diagnostic System (qMIDS) with new genes involved in matrix/stroma and immune modulation of the tumour microenvironment. An algorithm calculates and converts a panel of 16 gene mRNA expression levels into a qMIDS index to quantify risk of malignancy for each sample. Results: The new qMIDS(V2) assay was validated in a UK oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cohort (n = 282) of margin and tumour core samples demonstrating significantly better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.945) compared to previous qMIDS(V1) (AUC = 0.759). Performance of qMIDS(V2) were independently validated in Chinese (n = 35; AUC = 0.928) and Indian (n = 95; AUC = 0.932) OSCC cohorts. Further, 5-year retrospective analysis on an Indian dysplastic lesion cohort (n = 30) showed that qMIDS(V2) was able to significantly differentiate between lesions without transformation and those with malignant transformation. Conclusions: This study validated a novel multi-gene qPCR test on a total of 535 tissue specimens from UK, China and India, demonstrating a rapid minimally invasive method that has a potential application for dysplasia risk stratification. Further study is required to establish if qMIDS(V2) could be used to improve OPMD patient management, guide treatment strategy and reduce oral cancer burden.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - LIPODYSTROPHY
KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Lipodystrophy syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by selective deficiency of adipose tissue and severe insulin resistance resulting in metabolic complications. Its presentation as polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) is even rarer. We present a 23-year-old woman who came with complaints of oligomenorrhoea and hirsutism. When specifically asked, she accepted noticing loss of fat from some areas of her body. Examination showed loss of fat from the face, buttocks and thighs. Her investigations revealed deranged blood sugars, transaminitis, dyslipidaemia and elevated serum testosterone; ultrasonography showed fatty liver and polycystic ovary. Fat composition measurement revealed loss of fat from lower limbs and increased ratio of trunk-to-leg fat. Based on these findings, a diagnosis of lipodystrophy was made. She was started on metformin, statins and ursodeoxycholic acid. Blood sugars, lipid profile and dyslipidaemia improved over a period of 6 months. We suggest that in lean patients with PCOD, lipodystrophy becomes a differential diagnosis, so attention should be paid to body fat distribution in them. Despite normal body mass index (BMI), these patients tend to develop metabolic complications as in our patient (BMI 21.5). This diagnosis has long-term implications in view of its association with metabolic complications.

AB  - Background: The data regarding patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). especially in the developing world is lacking.
   Objective: To determine the proportion of patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who are eligible for EVT in the 0-24-h time window.
   Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected AIS data between July 2017 and September 2019. Demographic, clinical, and management information were analyzed. EVT eligibility was explored using the following criteria: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score >= 6, presence of anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion (ACLVO), Alberta stroke program early Computerized Tomography score (ASPECTS) >= 6. baseline modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2, and within 24 h of time last seen well (TLSW). EVT-eligible patients were further evaluated for in-hospital course and outcomes.
   Results: In the study period of 27 months, there were 221 patients with AIS who presented within 24 h. The mean age of the patients was 54.4 (16.0) years and 66.1% (146) were males. A majority (61.5% [136/221]) arrived within 6 h of TLSW. Of these, 81.6% (111/136) presented in the time window for thrombolysis (0-4.5 h). The patients with NIHSS >= 6 and ACLVO constituted 41.2% (91/221) of the patients. AIS eligible for EVT constituted 19.5% (43/221) of the patients.
   Conclusion: In our study, the proportion of AIS eligible for endovascular thrombectomy was comparable to the developed world. These data predict a large potential for the late-window EVT in India.

AB  - Purpose: To develop a new age-appropriate visual function questionnaire for visually impaired children. Methods: The study was conducted in north India in 20,955 (97.3%) children <= 15 years who underwent visual acuity examination. Of these 20,955 children, a total of 722 children were referred with unaided visual acuity less than 6/12 in any eye. Among these referred children, parents in the age group of 5-9 years and children between 10 and 15 years underwent interviews using LV Prasad Functional Visual Questionnaire-20 (LVP FVQ 20) and Indian Visual Functioning Questionnaire-33 (IND VFQ-33). Following this, multiple steps were undertaken that involved expert opinion for the removal of items on basis of zero variance and factor analysis along with calculation of Cronbach's alpha. Results: A Cronbach' alpha of 0.834 was calculated for the younger age group and 0.931 for the higher age group of children. Conclusion: A new robust age-appropriate questionnaire was developed and it was observed that there was a significant change in median score (that was derived for various domains after calculating the median for the items in various domains asked pre- and post-intervention in the form of glasses or surgery) for quality of visual function in the visually impaired children. A significant change in functional vision of visually impaired children (P < 0.005) was observed in both age groups.

AB  - Purpose:The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of myopia at the community level. Methods:A population-based, cross-sectional study was planned in 40 clusters among children identified with subnormal vision in the urban community of Delhi. House-to-house visits were conducted for visual acuity screening of 20,000 children aged 0-15 years using age appropriate visual acuity charts. All the children with visual acuity of < 6/12 in any eye in the age group between 3 and 15 years and inability to follow light in age group 0-3 years were referred for detailed ophthalmic examination. Results:A total of 13,572 (64.7%) children belonged to the age group of 6-15 years. Of these, a total of 507 (3.7%) were found to be having myopia (spherical equivalent of -0.50 DS or worse in one or both eyes) with positive association with higher age groups. Conclusion:The estimated prevalence of myopia is 3.7%; the proportion of uncorrected myopia was 45%, which reflects that refractive error services need to be improved further.

AB  - Purpose:To develop a new age-appropriate visual function questionnaire for visually impaired children. Methods:The study was conducted in north India in 20,955 (97.3%) children <= 15 years who underwent visual acuity examination. Of these 20,955 children, a total of 722 children were referred with unaided visual acuity less than 6/12 in any eye. Among these referred children, parents in the age group of 5-9 years and children between 10 and 15 years underwent interviews using LV Prasad Functional Visual Questionnaire-20 (LVP FVQ 20) and Indian Visual Functioning Questionnaire-33 (IND VFQ-33). Following this, multiple steps were undertaken that involved expert opinion for the removal of items on basis of zero variance and factor analysis along with calculation of Cronbach's alpha. Results:A Cronbach' alpha of 0.834 was calculated for the younger age group and 0.931 for the higher age group of children.

AB  - Soluble HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) immunogens are a prime constituent of candidate vaccines designed to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies. Several lines of evidence suggest that enhancing Env immunogen thermostability can improve neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Here, we generated BG505 SOSIP.v9 trimers, which displayed virtually no reactivity with non-neutralizing antibodies and showed increased global and epitope thermostability, compared to previous BG505 SOSIP versions. Chemical crosslinking of BG505 SOSIP.v9 further increased the melting temperature to 91.3 degrees C, which is almost 25 degrees C higher than that of the prototype SOSIP.664 trimer. Next, we compared the immunogenicity of a palette of BG505-based SOSIP trimers with a gradient of thermostabilities in rabbits. We also included SOSIP.v9 proteins in which a strain-specific immunodominant epitope was masked by glycans to redirect the NAb response to other subdominant epitopes. We found that increased trimer thermostability correlated with increased potency and consistency of the autologous NAb response. Furthermore, glycan masking steered the NAb response to subdominant epitopes without decreasing the potency of the autologous NAb response. In summary, SOSIP.v9 trimers and their glycan masked versions represent an improved platform for HIV-1 Env based vaccination strategies.

AB  - Background/Aim Tooth avulsion (TA) is a severe form of traumatic dental injury. The tooth's prognosis depends on the immediate measures taken. First responders are often laypeople, and the Internet is a favored platform to access health-related information. The aim of this descriptive study was to evaluate the accuracy, quality, readability, and popularity of patient-oriented web information regarding the emergency management of TA. Methods Three search engines (Google, Bing, and Yahoo.com) were browsed with six VPNs using "knocked out tooth," "fallen out tooth," and "tooth avulsion" as keywords. The top 20 results for each were evaluated. Webpages were included if they had information oriented to caregivers. They were analyzed for accuracy (cutoff >= 95%). Quality of web pages was assessed using DISCERN and the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark. Readability was evaluated using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog (FOG), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG). Popularity was assessed by Alexa Popularity Rank (APR). Accurate and inaccurate webpages were compared using chi-square analysis and the Mann-Whitney U test. Spearman's correlation between the studied metrics was established. A p Seventy-two webpages were included, of which 23 (32%) were accurate. The median DISCERN ratings for accurate and inaccurate webpages were 3.0 [2.5-3.0] and 3.0 [2.0-3.0], respectively (p = .331). Ten (44%) accurate and 12 (24.5%) inaccurate webpages had high-quality JAMA (p = .089). The median readability scores for accurate webpages were FKGL (8 [6.75-9.2]), FOG (10.6 [9.55-12.3]), CLI (7 [6-7]), SMOG (6.7 [6.15-7.5]), while scores for the inaccurate webpages were FKGL (7.85 [6.275-8.525]), FOG (10.55 [8.875-11.425]), CLI (7 [7-8.25]), and SMOG (7 [6.2-7.925]), with a higher CLI score for inaccurate webpages (p = .0035). The median APRs for accurate and inaccurate webpages were 1,02,538 [26,852-14,43,755] and 7,63,190 [2,19,799-29,92,067], respectively (p = .163). Accuracy had a positive correlation with quality (DISCERN: rho = .293, p = .013; JAMA: rho = .249, p = .036), while popularity (APR) was negatively correlated with quality (DISCERN: rho = -.330, p = .013; JAMA: rho = -.287, p = .032). Conclusion Relevant webpages were limited and had low accuracy. This can impact the emergency management by laypeople and adversely affect the prognosis following avulsion.

AB  - Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is constitutively active in almost every cell of our body at basal level. This self-eating process primarily serves to remove superfluous constituents of the cells and recycle the degraded products. Autophagy plays an essential role in cell homeostasis and can be enhanced in response to stressful conditions. Impairment in the regulation of the autophagic pathway is implicated in pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration, cardiac disorders, and cancer. However, the role of autophagy in cancer initiation and development is controversial and context-dependent. Evidence from various studies has shown that autophagy serves dual purpose and may assist in cancer progression or suppression. In the early stages of cancer initiation, autophagy acts as a quality control mechanism and prevents cancer development. When cancer is established and progresses to a later stage, autophagy helps in the survival of these cells through adaptation to stresses, including exposure to anti-cancer drugs. In this review, we highlight various studies on autophagic pathways and describe the role of autophagy in cancer, specifically acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We also discuss the prognostic significance of autophagy genes involved in AML leukemogenesis and implications in conferring resistance to chemotherapy.

AB  - p73 belongs to p53 family transcription factor activating more than 50% of cell fate p53 target genes involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response alongside neuronal system development and differentiation by binding to 20-bp response elements (REs) having sequence motif (PPPC-A/T-T/A-GYYY) where P-purines and Ypyrimidines with each 10-bp separated by minimum 0 to 13-bp spacer. The promiscuous nature of recognizing both cell fate and development genes and the underlying RE selectivity mechanism by p73 is not well understood. Here, we report the molecular details of p73 recognizing the REs using the crystal structure of p73 DNA binding domain (DBD) in complex with 12 base pair DNA sequence 5'-cAGGCATGCCTg-3 ' and molecular dynamics simulations with six different p53 natural promoter sequences. Each 20-base pair natural promoter forms a different major/minor groove due to the presence of nucleotides A/T, A/C, G/G, T/T and G/T at positions 3, 8, 13, 18 uniquely recognized by p73 key residues Lys138 and Arg268. The loops L1 and L3 bearing these residues influence inter-and intra-dimer interfaces interactions and hence p73 forms a unique tetramer with each natural promoter sequence. Structural features of the DNA and the spacing between half-sites influence p73 tetramerization and its transactivation function.

AB  - Purpose: Increase in the antimicrobial resistance causes a concern globally. To mitigate the rapidly rising antimicrobial resistance in the health system globally antimicrobial stewardship programs (AMSP) have been advocated. Therefore, we aim to measure aggregate antibiotic consumption by both Defined Daily Dosage (DDD) and Days of Therapy (DOT) methods.
   Methods: As a part of Indian Council of Medical Research initiative to develop local AMSP, this prospective study of six months was conducted at a level -1 Trauma Centre of AIIMS, New Delhi. In this, we have included all the patients of polytrauma and neurosurgical Intensive care units between April to October 2019. Consumption of antibiotics data were collected manually daily by infection control practitioners. Data were presented as Days of Therapy (DOT) and Defined Daily Dose (DDD).
   Results: During the six months of study, antimicrobial consumption of ICU was compared with empirical therapy v/s culture-based therapy. Overall average antimicrobial consumption for the six months for both empirical therapy and culture-based therapy DDD/1000 patient days was 531.8 and 460.7 whereas DOT/1000 patient days 489.9 and 426.04 respectively.
   Conclusions: Antimicrobial Stewardship activities aim to ensure judicious consumption of antimicrobials. Such data will be of value in establishing, evaluating and monitoring the function of the AMSP in the healthcare settings.

AB  - Background The expression pattern of common antigens including cytoplasmic kappa/lambda ratio (cyKLR) was evaluated by flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCMI) to explore their relevance in discriminating normal and aberrant plasma cells (NPC and APC, respectively) across spectrum of plasma cell proliferative disorders (PCPD). Methods In this prospective analysis, 791 samples from PCPD (treatment naive = 455; partially treated = 336) were evaluated for expression of CD38, CD138, CD45, CD19, CD56, CD27, CD81, CD117, Cy-kappa, and Cy-lambda using FCMI. Results Amongst the entire cohort, 20.7% (n = 164) samples displayed only APC, 21% (n = 165) only NPC and 58% (n = 462) showed coexistence of NPC and APC. Using pattern-based recognition (PBR) for three common patterns (CD19 vs. CD56; CD27 vs. CD56 and CD19 vs. CD27), APC was separable from NPC in 93% samples. In 6.5% samples, the gating markers contributed in APC-NPC differentiation and in the remaining 0.5% CD117 and CD81 proved useful. Clonality assessment was found to be crucial to label plasma cell compartment as completely normal or aberrant in 42% cases with either all NPC or all APC. Sixty one out of 462 cases (13%) revealed cyKLR within normal reference range and in these cases; abnormal cyKLR was demonstrable only after gating APC separately based on PBR. Conclusion Fair discrimination between NPC and APC is achievable in all PCPD samples using eight markers (Gating: CD38, CD138, CD45; PBR:CD19, CD56, CD27; clonality: Cy-kappa and Cy-lambda). Thus, combined assessment of clonality and immunophenotypic aberrancies is required for accurate, reliable and precise assessment of NPC and APC compartments in PCPD.

AB  - Objectives To establish communication with relatives of obstetrical patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) admitted to an isolation ward by systematic use of quality improvement tools during the COVID-19 pandemic as there were many challenges in communicating with relatives. Methods The study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at a tertiary-care teaching hospital based on four systematic steps of Point of Care Improvement methodology. After identifying the problem, a quality improvement team was constituted, which formed a specific aim. After root-cause analysis with fishbone tool, three Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles with various interventions were planned. Results The outcome was measured as percentage of relatives of obstetrical patients admitted to the hospital with COVID-19 who were counseled about vital patient-related information. The baseline percentage of counseling of relatives of COVID-19-positive obstetrical patients admitted to the hospital was 14% per day. After three PDSA cycles, the target of 66.5% was achieved. Conclusion Communication with the relatives of COVID-19-positive obstetrical patients admitted to isolation wards in the hospital could be easily streamlined without any additional resources using the principles of quality improvement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are stress-induced proteins that are important constituents of the cell's defense system. The activity of HSPs enhances when the cell undergoes undesirable environmental conditions like stress. The protective roles of HSPs are due to their molecular chaperone and anti-apoptotic functions. HSPs have a central role in the eye, and their malfunction has been associated with the manifestation of ocular diseases. Heat shock protein 27 (HSP27, HSPB1) is present in various ocular tissues, and it has been found to protect the eye from disease states such as retinoblastoma, uveal melanoma, glaucoma, and cataract. But some recent studies have shown the destructive role of HSP27 on retinal ganglionic cells. Thus, this article summarizes the role of heat shock protein 27 in eye and ocular diseases and will focus on the expression, regulation, and function of HSP27 in ocular complications.

AB  - Multimodality of an optical system implies the use of one or more optical techniques to improve the system's overall performance and maximum utility. In this article, we demonstrate a multimodal system with oblique illumination that combines two different techniques; fluorescence micro-endoscopy and spectroscopy simultaneously and can be utilized to obtain diverse information from the same location of biological sample. In present system, use of graded index (GRIN) rod-lens makes it highly compact and oblique incidence decouples illumination geometry with collection geometry, preventing CCD cameras from saturation and reduces number of optical elements, thereby making system further miniaturized and field-portable. It also overcomes the disadvantages of undesired reflections from different optical elements. The experimental results of simultaneous imaging and spectroscopy of the biological samples are presented along with quantitative spectroscopic parameters; peak wavelength shift, area under the curve and full width half maximum (FWHM). The spatial resolution, spectral resolution and field of view of the system are found to be 4.38 mu m, 0.5 nm and 2.071x1.548mm2, respectively. Furthermore, we have obtained the red shift for cancerous oral tissue with respect to normal oral tissue 5.79 +/- 1.071 nm. This could be important indicator for oral cancer screening.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
KW  - PORTAL-VEIN THROMBOSIS
KW  - CONGESTION
AB  - Purpose: To quantify liver stiffness measurement (LSM) changes after endovascular intervention for Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and evaluate whether LSM changes predict restenosis after endovascular intervention.
   Materials and Methods: Patients with BCS who underwent endovascular intervention and had at least 2 LSM values available after the intervention were included. Delta LSM was the difference between LSMs estimated at the last and second last hospital visits. In patients with restenosis, 2 LSM values before restenosis were included. Delta LSM% was calculated as the ratio of Delta LSM to the LSM at the second last visit and expressed as a percentage. Odds ratio (OR) with confidence interval (CI) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs) were calculated for the predictors of restenosis.
   Results: The median baseline and postinterventional 1-week, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month LSM values were 47.2 kPa (33.8-68.4 kPa), 29.2 kPa (24.5-43.0 kPa), 26.2 kPa (18.6-38.9 kPa), 20.9 kPa (13.3-29.8 kPa), and 17.3 kPa (11.8-25.4 kPa), respectively. Of the 118 patients, including 67 men, restenosis developed in 10 patients after a median (interquartile range) duration of 19 months (11-46 months). Delta LSM% was higher (more positive) in patients with restenosis than in those without restenosis (44.7 [8.3-134.3] vs -6.6 [-19.4 to 14.9], P=.001). Delta LSM% was a significant predictor of restenosis with an OR of 1.032 (95% CI, 1.015-1.050; P<.001). The AUROC for Delta LSM% was 0.831 (95% CI, 0.750-0.893; P=.001), and a Delta LSM% increment of 13.2% predicted restenosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.0% and 74.1%, respectively.
   Conclusions: LSM gradually decreases after endovascular intervention, and transient elastography is a promising test for detecting restenosis after the endovascular treatment of patients with BCS.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the outcomes of children with congenital heart disease (CHD) awaiting surgery admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with acute illness. Methods In this retrospective study from a single center, the outcomes of children up to 18 y of age with unoperated CHD admitted to PICU with acute illness and factors affecting the outcomes, were evaluated. Results Fifty-eight (41 boys) children were included. Median age was 3.2 (1.5, 6) mo. Thirty-six (62%) children had acyanotic CHD (ACHD), and 22 (38%) had cyanotic CHD (CCHD). Most common ACHD was ventricular septal defect (n = 14; 38.8%) and CCHD was double-outlet right ventricle (n = 6; 27.2%). Twenty-four (41%) children underwent surgery - 10 (41.6%) palliative procedure and 14 (58.3%) corrective procedure. Hospital mortality was 50%. Of the operated children, 37.5% died and of the nonoperated children, 58.8% died. Type of the heart disease and surgical intervention was not associated with mortality (p = 0.27 and 0.11). Requirement of vasoactive agents was associated with increased mortality (p = 0.02). In children with ACHD, factors associated with mortality were lower score for weight for age (p = 0.03) and weight for length (p = 0.04), lower admission pH (p = 0.02), hemodynamic instability at admission (p = 0.002), and requirement of vasoactive agents (p = 0.04). Conclusion Children with unoperated CHD with acute illness have high morbidity and mortality. Early diagnosis and surgical interventions in children with CHD are warranted.

AB  - Purpose: Trace elements and/or heavy metals are important for various biological activities. However, excess amount of these elements is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer. We aimed to analyse the alterations of trace elements levels in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients.
   Materials and methods: In this observational study, patients with biopsy proven RCC were taken as study group while age- and sexmatched healthy volunteers were taken as control. Blood and urine samples were compared for Arsenic (As), Copper (Cu), Manganese (Mn), Selenium (Se), Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb) and Mercury (Hg) levels measured by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectroscopy. Serum glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels were assessed to know the redox status between 2 groups.
   Results: A total of 76 RCC cases and 64 controls were recruited in the study. A significantly higher concentration of As, Cu, Mn, Cd, Pb and Hg were observed in the blood of RCC patients as compared to controls. However, blood Se level was significantly lower in RCC patients. In 33 (43.4%) patients, one or more heavy metals were higher in the blood above their permitted level as compared to 10 (15.6%) subjects in control group. RCC patients had a higher urinary Mn and Se levels compared to controls. A significantly lower GSH-Px (182.08 +/- 132.91 vs. 236.95 +/- 132.94, P = 0.04) and a higher LPO levels (26.02 +/- 20.79 vs. 14.06 +/- 8.44, P = 0.003) were noted in RCC patients than controls. SOD levels were comparable between two groups.
   Conclusions: A significantly altered heavy metals concentration is noted in the blood and urine in RCC patients as compared to healthy controls. An associated lower levels of GSH-Px antioxidant enzyme and increased LPO in RCC patients signifies an imbalance in the redox status. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Effectiveness of an inactivated virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, BBV152, in India: a test-negative, case-control study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Background BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been deployed in India. The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
   Methods We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India), who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar time, using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with the second dose received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds ratio) x 100%.
   Findings Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 sympto matic employees had data on vaccination status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0middot0001). The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61).
   Interpretation This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this vaccine to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological measures.

AB  - Objective: To measure the impact of 12 weeks of physical exercise as complementary management strategy on quality of life (QOL) in people with epilepsy (PWE). Methods: In a parallel-group, randomized controlled study with blinded outcome assessment, PWE of 18-65 years old, smartphone users were randomized into two groups. The exercise group was advised minimum 150 min per week of moderate-intense aerobic activity, as per current WHO recommendation [1], in addition to standard medical care; the control group received only standard medical care. QOL was assessed using Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) inventory [2,3]; physical activity, with Global Physical Activity Questionnaire version 2 (GPAQ), and Pedometer Step Counter (a smartphone-based activity tracker application), at baseline and after 12 weeks. Body weight, body mass index, seizure frequency, and stigma scores (Epilepsy Stigma Scale Austin and colleagues) [4] were also noted. Results: One hundred and seventeen PWE were recruited (58 exercise, 59 control). Although there was an improvement in the physical activity correlates after 12 weeks compared to mean values at baseline, the differences were not significant between the groups. The total QOL mean scores at baseline in the exercise and control groups were 64.9 and 63.7 (p = 0.597) and after 12 weeks, 68.4 and 66.9 (p = 0.660), respectively. However, intragroup comparison of energy/fatigue score in the exercise group showed significant change with a p value of 0.009 and intragroup comparison of Overall QOL score in the control group showed a significant change with a p value of 0.003. Similar improvement was seen in stigma scores (p = 0.500) and seizure frequency (p = 0.388) at 12 weeks in exercise and control groups. After 12 weeks, mean values of METS ((metabolic equivalents) were 794.81 and 714.27 (p = 0.159), steps per day were 4018.32 and 3730.0 (p = 0.314), calories spent per day were 173.85 and 159.68 (p = 0.320 and distance walked per day in meters were 2576.52 and 2198.42 (p = 0.072), in the exercise and control groups, respectively. Significance: Regular physical activity for at least 150 min per week, in the form of moderate-intense aerobic exercises resulted in positive yet non-significant improvement of QOL, seizure frequency, and stigma in PWE.

TI  - Ureter-first Approach and Reduction of Pelvis: Standardizing Handling of Ureteropelvic Junction During Pyeloplasty
T2  - UROLOGY
KW  - OBSTRUCTION
KW  - SURGERY
KW  - KIDNEYS
AB  - OBJECTIVE To present our "ureter -first" approach as a standardized step-wise incision-making technique to deal with all types of uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) anatomy during pyeloplasty. Pyeloplasty is a common surgery performed for UPJ obstruction, with Anderson-Hynes' pyeloplasty being the commonest. However, there is great variability in handling UPJ and incision-making among the surgeons with no detailed standardized description that can be followed in all cases, notwithstanding broad descriptions of incision lines. We underscore this aspect of pyeloplasty and present our universal technique with a goal to minimize surgical errors. METHODS A standardized step-by-step handling of UPJ and sequential incision-making was developed for pyeloplasty. It avoids unwarranted loss of any pelvis tissue before confirming individual UPJ anatomy, emphasizes preservation of lower lip of pelvis and minimizes tension on anastomosis. This standardized technique was uniformly used in all cases over 5 years. The peri-operative and functional outcome results are presented. RESULTS Fifty-one consecutive cases were done using ureter -first approach. UPJ was >1 cm in eight cases. Three of these had UPJ >2 cm. Eight other cases had a low-insertion below level of kidney while three had high insertion of ureter. There were no cases which were deemed to be done under tension or unsatisfactory repair by the surgeon. There were no failures requiring any kind of redo repair at mean follow up of 39 months. CONCLUSION A uniform standardized approach saves the surgeon from unwarranted or wrongly designed incisions on the pelvis and thus has the potential to reduce surgical mistakes.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO.) is critical for functionality of endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs). Dimerization of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is must to produce NO. and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) plays a crucial role in stabilizing this state. We investigated BH4 level in ECFCs and its effect on ECFCs functionality in CAD patients. Intracellular biopterin levels and ECFCs functionality in terms of cell viability, adhesion, proliferation, in vitro wound healing and angiogenesis were assessed. Guanosine Triphosphate Cyclohydrolase-1 (GTPCH-1) expression was studied in ECFCs. Serum total reactive oxygen/nitrogen species was measured and effect of nitrosative stress on ECFC's biopterins level and functionality were evaluated by treating with 3-morpholino sydnonimine (SIN-1). BH4 level was significantly lower in ECFCs from CAD patients. Cell proliferation, wound closure reflecting cellular migration as well as in vitro angiogenesis were impaired in ECFCs from CAD patients. Wound healing capacity and angiogenesis were positively correlated with ECFC's BH4. A negative effect of nitrosative stress on biopterins level and cell functionality was observed in SIN-1 treated ECFCs. ECFCs from CAD exhibited impaired functionality and lower BH4 level. Association of BH4 with wound healing capacity and angiogenesis suggest its role in maintaining ECFC's functionality. Oxidative stress may be a determinant of intracellular biopterin levels.

AB  - The 2021 WHO Classification of Thoracic Tumours was published earlier this year, with classification of lung tumors being one of the chapters. The principles remain those of using morphology first, supported by immunohistochemistry, and then molecular techniques. In 2015, there was particular emphasis on using immunohistochemistry to make classification more accurate. In 2021, there is greater emphasis throughout the book on advances in molecular pathology across all tumor types. Major features within this edition are (1) broader emphasis on genetic testing than in the 2015 WHO Classification; (2) a section entirely dedicated to the classification of small diagnostic samples; (3) continued recommendation to document percentages of histologic patterns in invasive nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, with utilization of these features to apply a formal grading system, and using only invasive size for T-factor size determination in part lepidic nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas as recommended by the eighth edition TNM classification; (4) recognition of spread through airspaces as a histologic feature with prognostic significance; (5) moving lymphoepithelial carcinoma to squamous cell carcinomas; (6) update on evolving concepts in lung neuroendocrine neoplasm classification; (7) recognition of bronchiolar adenoma/ciliated muconodular papillary tumor as a new entity within the adenoma subgroup; (8) recognition of thoracic SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated tumor; and (9) inclusion of essential and desirable diagnostic criteria for each tumor.

AB  - Background Diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, at younger ages can be a largely preventable cause of death with the correct health care and services. We aimed to evaluate diabetes mortality and trends at ages younger than 25 years globally using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.
   Methods We used estimates of GBD 2019 to calculate international diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years in 1990 and 2019. Data sources for causes of death were obtained from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, and other surveillance systems for 1990-2019. We estimated death rates for each location using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model. We analysed the association of age-standardised death rates per 100 000 population with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a measure of universal health coverage (UHC) and described the variability within SDI quintiles. We present estimates with their 95% uncertainty intervals.
   Findings In 2019, 16 300 (95% uncertainty interval 14 200 to 18 900) global deaths due to diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) occurred in people younger than 25 years and 73.7% (68.3 to 77.4) were classified as due to type 1 diabetes. The age-standardised death rate was 0.50 (0.44 to 0.58) per 100 000 population, and 15 900 (97.5%) of these deaths occurred in low to high-middle SDI countries. The rate was 0.13 (0.12 to 0.14) per 100 000 population in the high SDI quintile, 0.60 (0.51 to 0.70) per 100 000 population in the low-middle SDI quintile, and 0.71 (0.60 to 0.86) per 100 000 population in the low SDI quintile. Within SDI quintiles, we observed large variability in rates across countries, in part explained by the extent of UHC (r(2)=0.62). From 1990 to 2019, age-standardised death rates decreased globally by 17.0% (-28.4 to -2.9) for all diabetes, and by 21.0% (-33.0 to -5.9) when considering only type 1 diabetes. However, the low SDI quintile had the lowest decline for both all diabetes (-13.6% [-28.4 to 3.4]) and for type 1 diabetes (-13.6% [-29.3 to 8.9]).
   Interpretation Decreasing diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years remains an important challenge, especially in low and low-middle SDI countries. Inadequate diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is likely to be major contributor to these early deaths, highlighting the urgent need to provide better access to insulin and basic diabetes education and care. This mortality metric, derived from readily available and frequently updated GBD data, can help to monitor preventable diabetes-related deaths over time globally, aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Targets, and serve as an indicator of the adequacy of basic diabetes care for type 1 and type 2 diabetes across nations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES This study aims to determine the impact of yoga as an adjunct to standard therapy versus standard therapy alone on the symptomatic burden in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope (VVS).
   BACKGROUND There is a significant reduction in the quality of life (QoL) of patients with recurrent VVS. Existing management therapies have been largely ineffective. Recent trials have demonstrated the efficacy of yoga in diseases with autonomic imbalance, suggesting its possible utility in VVS.
   METHODS Patients with recurrent VVS were randomized to receive either a specialized yoga training program in addition to current guideline-based therapy (intervention arm, group 1) or current guideline-based therapy alone (control arm, group 2). The primary outcome was a composite of the number of episodes of syncope and presyncope at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included QoL assessment by World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief Field questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF) scores and Syncope Functional Status Questionnaire scores at 12 months, head up tilt test, and heart rate variability at 6 weeks.
   RESULTS A total of 55 patients underwent randomization. The mean number of syncopal or presyncopal events at 12 months was 0.7 +/- 0.7 in the intervention arm compared to 2.52 +/- 1.93 in the control arm (P < 0.01). In the intervention arm, 13 (43.3%) patients remained free of events versus 4 (16.0%) patients in the control arm (P = 0.02). QoL at 12 months showed significant improvement of all Syncope Functional Status Questionnaire scores and 2 domains of WHOQoL-BREF scores (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS Yoga as adjunctive therapy is superior to standard therapy alone in reducing the symptomatic burden and improving QoL in patients with recurrent VVS. (C) 2022 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

AB  - Introduction Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is associated with cognitive deficits, and age at diagnosis is thought to play a substantial role. However, there are limited data for the cognitive performance in young adults, in relation to the age of diabetes onset. The lack of information is particularly striking in the context of developing regions. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed from August 2018 to July 2020. We included adult participants with T1DM, stratified by the age of diabetes onset (till 6 years of age, between 7 to 12 years of age, and 13 to < 18 years of age) and compared them with the control group (no diabetes or pre-diabetes). We filled a structured case record proforma for all participants and recorded relevant socio-demographic and medical details. Detailed neuropsychological assessment with 13 psychological tests representing four cognitive domains was carried-(1) attention, working memory and executive functions; (2) learning and memory; (3) visuoperceptual functions; and (4) information processing speed. Results We evaluated 100 individuals, 73 (men 48.0%) with T1DM and 27 (men 51.9%) without T1DM. After adjustment for age, gender and education, the mean differences in composite Z scores (for the four cognitive domains) between participants with T1DM and without T1DM were 0.08 for attention, working memory and executive functions (p = 0.614); 0.07 for learning and memory (p = 0.694); 0.05 for visuoperceptual (p = 0.784); and 0.22 for information processing speed (p = 0.305). No significant differences were found for the three subgroups of individuals with T1DM, when compared with the control group. Effect size (Cohen's d) for the individual tests (n = 13) ranged from - 0.36 to + 0.39, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant. Amongst the participants with T1DM, higher education had a significant positive association with three of the four cognitive domains evaluated. Conclusions To conclude, our findings suggest minimal differences in the cognitive functioning of patients with T1DM with different age of onset of diabetes compared to healthy controls, when evaluated in early adulthood. This is possibly the first study from South Asia with an in-depth and comprehensive assessment of cognitive functions in patients with T1DM, using a detailed neuropsychological battery.

AB  - Extra-nodal (NK/T) cell lymphoma (NKTCL) of nasal type (ENKL) presents with extranodal involvement and is associated with EBV. They are localized primarily to nasal and upper airway region but can rarely involve skin, testis, intestine, muscle, or present as a disseminated disease. We present a case of a 65-year-old male presented with bilateral orbital swelling, right parotid swelling, fever, mediastinal nodes, pleural effusion and hepatomegaly. Cytology of pleural fluid showed monomorphic lymphoid cells with folded nuclei, vesicular chromatin, inconspicuous nucleoli and granular cytoplasm. Few histiocytes showing hemophagocytosis were also noted in a background of inflammatory cells. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping of pleural fluid showed abnormal lymphoid cells which were positive for CD45, CD2 and CD56. Histopathological examination of the right eye swelling showed many atypical lymphoid cells which were positive for CD56 and negative for B and T cell markers. Based on morphological and immunophenotypic features a diagnosis of NKTCL, extra-nasal type was suggested. Patient succumbed to the disease despite aggressive therapy.

AB  - MPS II is an X linked recessive lysosomal storage disorder with multi-system involvement and marked molecular heterogeneity. In this study, we explored the clinical and molecular spectrum of 144 Indian patients with MPS II from 130 unrelated families. Clinical information was collected on a predesigned clinical proforma. Sanger method was employed to sequence all the exons and exon/intron boundaries of the IDS gene. In cases where causative variation was not detected by Sanger sequencing, MLPA and RFLP were performed to identify large deletions/duplications and complex rearrangements. Cytogenetic microarray was done in one patient to see the breakpoints and extent of deletion. In one patient with no detectable likely pathogenic or pathogenic variation, whole-genome sequencing was also performed. Novel variants were systematically assessed by in silico prediction software and protein modelling. The pathogenicity of variants was established based on ACMG criteria. An attempt was also made to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation. Positive family history was present in 31% (41/130) of patients. Developmental delay and intellectual disability were the main reasons for referral. Macrocephaly, coarse facies and dysostosis were present in almost all patients. Hepatosplenomegaly, joint contractures and short stature were the characteristic features, seen in 87% (101/116), 67.8% (74/109) and 41.4% (41/99) patients respectively. Attenuated phenotype was seen in 32.6% (47/144) patients, while severe phenotype was seen in 63% (91/144) patients. The detection rate for likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in our cohort is 95.5% (107/112) by Sanger sequencing, MLPA and RFLP. We also found two variants of unknown significance, one each by Sanger sequencing and WGS. Total of 71 variants were identified by Sanger sequencing and 29 of these variants were found to be novel. Amongst the novel variants, there was a considerable proportion (51%) of frameshift variants (15/29). Almost half of the causative variants were located in exon 3,8 and 9. A significant genotype-phenotype correlation was also noted for both known and novel variants. This information about the genotype spectrum and phenotype will be helpful for diagnostic and prognostic purposes.

AB  - Neck of femur fractures have often been termed as "The Unsolved Fractures", since they have a guarded outcome even after improved understanding of biomechanics and biology of this area. Gap-nonunion is one such dreaded complication of this fracture, especially in younger (<60 years) population, where arthroplasty may not be the best go-to option.
   We have earlier described "The AIIMS BOX" technique to manage such cases of gap non-union in neglected neck femur fractures [1]. Here we intend to describe a more successful modification of this technique.
   We operated 7 cases of gap non-union with our new "Cage in Box" strategy and followed these cases for 5 years. 6 patients from this group achieved excellent to good outcomes and only 1 reported a poor outcome. All the patients, except the one with poor outcome, could walk without aid and do activities of daily living independently. 3 patients developed AVN but had no evidence of collapse. 3 patients also developed Coxa vara, but it was significant only in one case. 6/7 patients were able to squat.
   We describe this method in detail and feel this can be a viable option in the armamentarium of orthopedic surgeons, along with valgus osteotomy, vascularized and non-vascularized fibular strut graft as well as Meyer's Graft, to help them solve this unsolved fracture.

AB  - Endothelial colony forming cells (ECFCs) participate in neovascularization. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) derived NO center dot helps in homing of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) at the site of vascular injury. The enzyme cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) stabilizes the catalytic active state of eNOS. Association of intracellular ECFCs biopterins and ratio of reduced to oxidized biopterin (BH4:BH2) with circulatory EPCs and ECFCs functionality have not been studied. We investigated ECFCs biopterin levels and its association with circulatory EPCs as well as ECFCs proliferative potential in terms of day of appearance in culture. Circulatory EPCs were enumerated by flowcytometry in 53 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 42 controls. ECFCs were cultured, characterized, and biopterin levels assessed by high performance liquid chromatography. Appearance of ECFCs' colony and their number were recorded. Circulatory EPCs were significantly lower in CAD and ECFCs appeared in 56% and 33% of CAD and control subjects, respectively. Intracellular BH4 and BH4:BH2 were significantly reduced in CAD. BH4:BH2 was positively correlated with circulatory EPCs (p = 0.01), and negatively with day of appearance of ECFCs (p = 0.04). Circulatory EPCs negatively correlated with ECFCs appearance (p = 0.02). These findings suggest the role of biopterins in maintaining circulatory EPCs and functional integrity of ECFCs.

AB  - Background/Aims The journal Dental Traumatology (DT) is one of the best resources in the field of dental traumatology. It has always encouraged publication of case reports of good quality. The CARE statement (2011) was developed for uniform and transparent reporting of cases in medical sciences. Since case reports are inseparable from the DT literature, the aim of this bibliometric-analysis was to evaluate the case reports published in the DT in the last two decades (2001-2021) and assess their compliance regarding CARE guidelines for elucidating the trends in DT and the reporting quality of these papers. Methodology Two authors independently observed the tables of contents in all issues of DT from 2002-2021 and identified case reports. Selected articles were scrutinized to determine their eligibility. Data extraction was performed, case reports were segregated into domains, and their CARE compliance was evaluated by using a self-designed-validated method. Differences between the case reports published in two decades (2002-2011 and 2012-2021) were analysed with the Chi-square test. Results A total of 1612 articles published between February 2002 and October 2021 were scrutinized to identify 357 case reports with 277 from the period of 2002-2011 and 80 between 2012 and 2021. The highest number of case reports originated from Asia (2002-2011:135, 2012-2021:28). The CARE compliances of the majority of reports in the decade of 2002-2011 were between 75 and 85% (good) while the CARE compliances of the majority of reports from 2012-2021 were between 85 and 95% (very good) or >95% (excellent). These differences were statistically significant (p < .005). Conclusions The number of case reports published in the decade of 2002-2011 were more than three times the number of case reports published in the decade of 2012-2021. The highest number of reports in both decades were from Asia and belonged to the therapeutic and prognostic domains. The CARE compliances of the reports in the decade of 2012-2021 were better than those from 2002-2011.

AB  - Neutropenic diet(ND) has been hypothesized to decrease the rate of febrile neutropenia(FN) occurring post-chemotherapy for pediatric cancers. Despite widespread use, it has not shown to be of benefit by randomized controlled trials(RCT) in western countries. No RCT has been conducted in India/LMIC to evaluate its efficacy against the standard Indian diet. Forty-two(42) children, aged 3-14 y, with cancer, scheduled to receive strongly myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive either neutropenic diet(n = 21) or standard Indian diet(n = 21) for one chemotherapeutic cycle. FN rate was recorded as the primary outcome while the focus of infection, antibiotic length, the requirement for hospital admission, adherence to diet were the secondary outcomes. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Twelve patients (57%) in the neutropenic diet and nine patients(43%) in the standard diet arm developed FN. Patients in ND-arm had significantly higher chance of getting neutropenic enterocolitis(NEC) (33.33% vs 4.76% p = 0.044). Mortality (14.29%vs 0%, p = 0.23) and requirement for admission (47.6%vs 19.05%, p = 0.06), was more in the ND-arm but statistically non-significant. There was no significant difference in antibiotic length. Adherence was similar in both groups (95% vs 98%). Neutropenic diet was not effective in reducing FN rate and was associated with higher rate of NEC when compared to the standard diet.

AB  - Background Recently there has been a growing interest in the laparoscopic management of common bile duct stones with gallbladder in situ (LBDE), which is favoring the expansion of this technique. Our study identified the standardization factors of LBDE and its implementation in the single-stage management of choledocholithiasis. Methods A retrospective multi-institutional study among 17 centers with proven experience in LBDE was performed. A cross-sectional survey consisting of a semi-structured pretested questionnaire was distributed covering the main aspects on the use of LBDE in the management of choledocholithiasis. Results A total of 3950 LBDEs were analyzed. The most frequent indication was jaundice (58.8%). LBDEs were performed after failed ERCP in 15.2%. The most common approach used was the transcystic (63.11%). The overall series failure rate of LBDE was 4% and the median rate for each center was 6% (IQR, 4.5-12.5). Median operative time ranged between 60-120 min (70.6%). Overall morbidity rate was 14.6%, with a postoperative bile leak and complications >= 3a rate of 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. The operative time decreased with experience (P = .03) and length of hospital stay was longer in the presence of a biliary leak (P = .04). Current training of LBDE was defined as poor or very poor by 82.4%. Conclusion Based on this multicenter survey, LBDE is a safe and effective approach when performed by experienced teams. The generalization of LBDE will be based on developing training programs.

AB  - Background This meta-analysis provides a quantitative measure of the otorhinolaryngological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 in children. Methods A structured literature review was carried out using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central, employing pertinent search terms. The statistical analysis was performed using Stata version 14.2 software, and the analysed data were expressed as the pooled prevalence of the symptoms with 95 per cent confidence intervals. Results The commonest symptoms noted were cough (38 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval = 33-42; I-2 = 97.5 per cent)), sore throat (12 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval =10-14; I-2 = 93.7 per cent)), and nasal discharge (15 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval = 12-19; I-2 = 96.9 per cent)). Anosmia and taste disturbances showed a pooled prevalence of 8 per cent each. Hearing loss, vertigo and hoarseness were rarely reported. Conclusion Cough, sore throat and nasal discharge were the commonest otorhinolaryngological symptoms in paediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Compared with adults, anosmia and taste disturbances were infrequently reported in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: South Asian body composition is characterized by higher body fat at any given BMI. While this does not occur during fetal growth, it is important to understand if inappropriate fat accretion then begins in the first 2 years in Indian infants.
   METHODS: The fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) of healthy term newborns was evaluated at 12 days, 3.5 months, 1 year, and 2 years, by deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution. The effect of being born small versus appropriate for gestational age (SGA vs. AGA), and accelerated early growth pattern on FM and FFM accretion was also investigated.
   RESULTS: Newborns (262 total, 150 males) with mean birth weight of 2863 +/- 418 g were enrolled. FM percentage (FM%) assessed by D2O in 144, 166, 81, and 115 infants at 12 days, 3.5 months, 1 year, and 2 years respectively, was11.6 +/- 6.8, 21.1 +/- 7.0, 17.9 +/- 8.2 and 22.4 +/- 9.5%. Boys had higher FFM at all ages, but FM% was similar in both sexes. Children born SGA had similar FM index (FMI) but a lower FFM index (FFMI) at 2 years compared with those born AGA. Infants with catch-up growth between 0 and 2 years had higher FMI at 2 years compared to those without. Infants in the present study had a lower FM% and FMI till 1 year of age in comparison to previous studies from other countries, but had an increase in adiposity between 1 and 2 years, whereas in previous studies FM% remained stable or declined between 1 and 2 years of age.
   CONCLUSION: There was an upward inflection in the curve of FM% and FMI between 1 and 2 years of age in the present study, which may represent an early adiposity rebound. Further longitudinal body composition data for Indian infants as well as those of other ethnicities but with low birth weight will clarify whether early accelerated growth pattern contributes to greater accrual of fat rather than lean mass during childhood.

AB  - Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, aggressive hematopoietic neoplasm derived from precursors of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We describe cytomorphological and immunophenotypic features of BPDCN in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in a 66-year-old patient who presented with delayed central nervous system relapse. Morphological examination showed dense infiltration by monotonous population of intermediate-sized cells, resembling blasts. Nuclei had irregular contour with fine chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The cells had scant, pale blue, agranular cytoplasm. In some cells, intracytoplasmic vacuoles were also seen. No lymphoglandular bodies were seen. No mitosis or karyorrhexis were observed. On immunophenotyping, these cells were positive for CD45dim, CD123dim, HLA-DR, CD56, CD36bright, TCL1, CD4, CD117, CD38dim and negative for CD13, CD33, CD34, CD14, CD64 and CD16. The relevance of clinical suspicion, cytological recognition, and inclusion of BPDCN specific immunophenotypic markers is emphasized.

AB  - Cysticercosis is caused by Taenia solium, a cestode or tapeworm that preferentially affects the subcutaneous tissue, brain, muscle, and the eye. It is traditionally a disease of low socioeconomic regions, but large-scale population migration has made it a matter of global concern. Its ocular invasion is a potentially blinding disease. In the last two decades, there has been considerable discussion of cysticercosis; however, most comes from a limited number of case observations. Thus, to overcome this limitation, we summarize and analyze twenty years of medical literature (from 2000 to 2020) on cysticercosis in ophthalmology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and methylation via one-carbon (C1) metabolism during embryonic development. It is transported into the developing oocytes via folate receptors (FOLR1 and FOLR2) and transporters (RFC1) for utilization during embryo development. However, the role of folate receptors during pre-implantation stages of embryos is not well known. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression of folate transport genes and proteins in mature oocytes and pre-implantation embryos and the effect of FOLR1 knockdown in zygotes on blastocyst outcome. For this, immature goat oocytes were matured in maturation medium followed by in vitro fertilization and culture at standard conditions. A group of zygotes was transfected with esiRNA against FOLR1 and in vitro cultured for blastocyst outcome assessment. The transcripts and proteins for FOLR1, FOLR2 and RFC1 were present in oocytes as well as all the stages of pre-implantation embryos. Immunofluorescence revealed the presence of FOLR1 in the nuclei of embryos but not in the metaphase (matured) oocytes. The knockdown of FOLR1 in embryos was effective and significantly reduced the blastocyst production rate. The present study demonstrates the existence of active folate transport in oocytes and pre-implantation goat embryos. FOLR1 is vital for pre-implantation embryo development and may aid in the progression by functioning as a transcription factor.

AB  - Diseases affecting the anterior segment and the external surface of the eye are usually treated by drugs applied topically. The formulations designed for this purpose are developed to deliver active pharmaceutical agents to the eye optimally. These formulations are prepared by adding various agents (excipients) that help to maintain stability of the formulation, prevent microbial contamination, and allow easy administration with adequate drug bioavailability with the minimum ocular irritation and toxic effects at the administration site. The excipients do not have their own pharmacological actions, but Vitamin E TPGS (D-alpha-Tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) seems to break this notion. Besides having drug formulation enhancement properties, it also possesses antioxidant properties, which have been found to have a beneficial effect on various ophthalmological diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, uveitis, glaucoma, and cataract. In this review, we primarily focus on the properties and applications of Vitamin E TPGS in ocular drug delivery and the benefits of Vitamin E (Vit E) in numerous sight-threatening ailments of the rear and front segment of the eye. Additionally, p-glycoprotein inhibition and the anti-cancer potential of vitamin E TPGS have also been summarized.

AB  - A novel organic p-toluidinium succinate succinic acid (PTSSA) single crystal with dimensions 13 x 09 x 10 mm3 was grown at ambient temperature by slow evaporation procedure. The 3D molecular structure and cell parameters of the compound were evaluated through single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The PTSSA crystallizes in triclinic system with centrosymmetric space group P1. The crystal structure was stabilized by N-H...O and O-H...O bond interactions and its supramolecular aggregation have been reported. Optical band gap energy was calculated to be 4.1 eV and procures the transparency in the visible region with low UV cut-off wavelength at 279 nm. The presence of essential functional groups was identified in the grown crystal using FTIR analysis. The title crystal structure contributes the most prominent role to the H-H interactions of about 54.1%. A photoluminescence study determines the emission spectrum of the grown crystal at the red region. The open and closed aperture curve of Z-scan setup discloses the third order NLO properties of the PTSSA crystal.

AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is an extension and an enhanced form of ultrasound that allows real-time evaluation of the various structures in different vascular phases. The last decade has witnessed a widespread expansion of CEUS applications beyond the liver. It has shown fair potential in kidneys and its diagnostic efficacy is comparable to CT and MRI. Ultrasound is the well-accepted screening modality for renal pathologies, however, it underperforms in the characterization of the renal masses. CEUS can be beneficial in such cases as it can help in the characterization of such incidental masses in the same sitting. It has an excellent safety profile with no risk of radiation or contract-related nephropathy. It can aid in the correct categorization of renal cysts into one of the Bosniak classes and has proven its worth especially in complex cysts or indeterminate renal masses (especially Bosniak Category IIF and III). Few studies also describe its potential role in solid masses and in differentiating benign from malignant masses. Other areas of interest include infections, infarctions, trauma, follow-up of local ablative procedures, and VUR. Through this review, the readers shall get an insight into the various applications of CEUS in kidneys, with imaging examples.

AB  - Objective: Retrospective case record analysis of children with Neurobehavioral Deterioration associated with Sleep-augmented Epileptiform abnormalities (NDSE). Methods: Hospital records of children with NDSE (July, 2015 through December, 2016) were analyzed. Children were categorized as: Encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) if sleep EEG Spike-wave-Index (SWI) was >50% and sleep-induced epileptiform activity (SIEA)-related cognitive dysfunction if SWI >25% but <50%. Demography, neurobehavior profile (IQ/SQ and behavior using validated psychometric tools), etiology, investigations and treatment details were documented. Outcome assessment was based on three-month follow-up records. Results: Eighteen children with NDSE (12 boys; median age at diagnosis: 7.5 years (IQR: 6-10 years); SIEA (7); ESES (11)) were included. Etiology was structural (23%) and presumed genetic (77%). All children received intravenous-methylprednisolone pulse followed by oral steroids for eight weeks. Electroencephalography of children with SIEA was partly organized with median SWI of 40% (IQR 35, 42), with anterior-predominant epileptiform abnormalities and less apparent secondary synchronization. Children with ESES had a disorganized EEG background with median SWI of 80% (IQR 66, 95). Both SIEA and ESES groups had a similar neurobehavior profile. Behavior scores improved in 6/8 children with ESES and 5/7 in SIEA post steroids. In both the groups, median SWI improved (to <5% in SIEA, 45% in ESES). Mild improvement in IQ/SQ was also noted (SIEA [Median (IQR): 3 (1.6, 4.3)]; ESES [Median (IQR): 3.8 (2.8, 7)]). Conclusion: The study supports the fact that SWI >50% in the nap EEG is not mandatory for the diagnosis of ESES, thus it should not be a constraint for steroid treatment. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Improving postural stability of lower limb amputees by integrating vibrotactile sensory feedback (VF) with balancing exercises has been proved advantageous. However, the cortical processes engaged in human balance control which process the VF and help to improve postural stability remain elusive. To this end, Electroencephalography in synchronization with the center of pressure (CoP) signals was collected from six transfemoral amputees during a balance control task in two sessions: with and without VF. The improved limit of stability (LOS) during the balance task with VF was in response to elicited strong theta and gamma oscillations. The secondary somatosensory cortex-S2 (contralateral to amputated side) processes the sensory information from VF by significantly reducing the theta spectral power. Additionally, the fronto-central (FC) region executed the motor response to improve the LOS by significantly increasing the gamma power. The intra-regional functional connectivity at the S2 and FC region was significantly stronger with VF, in comparison to no feedback condition, and the two regions (S2 and FC) were strongly connected while perceiving the VF during forward voluntary sway in comparison to no feedback sessions. These findings provide fundamental insights into the cortical activity associated with the VF and helps in understanding the cortical mechanism of balance improvement in trans femoral amputees.

AB  - Background and Aim We showed in our anatomical review, ventricular septal defects existing as multiple entities can be considered in terms of three major subsets. We address here the diagnostic challenges, associated anomalies, the role and techniques of surgical instead of interventional closure, and the outcomes, including reinterventions, for each subset. Methods We reviewed 80 published investigations, noting radiographic findings, and the results of clinical imaging elucidating the location, number, size of septal defects, associated anomalies, and the effect of severe pulmonary hypertension. Results Overall, perioperative mortality for treatment of residual multiple defects has been cited to be between 0% and 14.2%, with morbidity estimated between 6% and 13%. Perioperative mortality is twice as high for perimembranous compared to muscular defects, with the need for reoperation being over four times higher. Perventricular hybrid approaches are useful for the closure of high anterior or apical defects. Overall, the results have been unsatisfactory. Pooled data reveals incidences between 2.8% and 45% for device-related adverse events. Currently, however, outcomes cannot be assessed on the basis of the different anatomical subsets. Conclusions We have addressed the approaches, and the results, of therapeutic treatment in terms of coexisting discrete defects, the Swiss-cheese septum, and the arrangement in which a solitary apical muscular defect gives the impression of multiple defects when viewed from the right ventricular aspect. Treatment should vary according to the specific combination of defects.

AB  - Evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggests that three-hourly feeding is safe and might help achieve full feeds earlier in preterm infants. We systematically compared the benefits and harms of three-hourly and two-hourly feeding schedules in preterm infants. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus) and trial registries until November 16, 2021, for RCTs comparing the two feeding schedules. We did a random-effects meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4 software. The primary outcome was the incidence of stage II or III necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Other outcomes were the incidence of any stage NEC, mortality, time to full enteral feeds, and hospital stay. Six trials (872 participants) are included. There was no significant difference in the incidence of stage II/III NEC (3 trials; 530 participants; RR 1.39; 95% CI: 0.53, 3.65; I-2 - 0%, low certainty), and any stage NEC (5 studies; 767 participants; RR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.53, 1.82; I-2 -0%, very low certainty) between three and two-hourly feeding groups. There was no difference in achieving full feeds (5 trials; 755 participants; MD: - 0.0 days; 95% CI: - 0.32, 0.31, low certainty) or other outcomes. On subgroup analysis, neonates with birthweight < 1000 g and in the three-hourly feeding regime achieved full enteral feeds slower than those in the two-hourly feeding group (1 trial; 84 participants; MD: 2.9 days, 95% CI: 1.16, 4.64, low certainty).
   Conclusion: In stable preterm infants (1000-1500 g), three-hourly feeding can be followed safely. In infants < 1000 g, there is insufficient evidence to advise on an optimal feeding interval, although a 2-h interval might be preferable. Prospero Registration Number: CRD42021246568.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are adult stem cells owing to their regenerative potential and multilineage potency. MSCs have wide-scale applications either in their native cellular form or in conjugation with specific biomaterials as nanocomposites. Majorly, these natural or synthetic biomaterials are being used in the form of metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles (NPs) to encapsulate MSCs within hydrogels like alginate or chitosan or drug cargo loading into MSCs. In contrast, nanofibers of polymer scaffolds such as polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA), silk fibroin, collagen, chitosan, alginate, hyaluronic acid (HA), and cellulose are used to support or grow MSCs directly on it. These MSCs based nanotherapies have application in multiple domains of biomedicine including wound healing, bone and cartilage engineering, cardiac disorders, and neurological disorders. This review focused on current approaches of MSCs-based therapies and has been divided into two major sections. The first section elaborates on MSC-based nano-therapies and their plausible applications including exosome engineering and NPs encapsulation. The following section focuses on the various MSC-based scaffold approaches in tissue engineering. Conclusively, current review mainly discussed the MSC-based nanocomposite's current approaches their advantages and limitations for building effective regenerative medicines.

AB  - Background Over the course of time, new developments associated with the embryogenesis of the murine heart have served to clarify the developmental processes observed in the human heart. This evidence allows for the creation of a developmental framework for many congenital cardiac defects. Aims We aim to solidify the framework related to the categorization of both solitary and multiple ventricular septal defects. Materials and Methods Mice having genetic perturbation of the Furin enzyme have demonstrated perimembranous and juxta-arterial ventricular septal defects, permitting the inference to be made that these defects can co-exist with defects occurring within the apical muscular septum. Results Basis of developmental evidence, furthermore, all interventricular communications can be placed into one of three groups, namely those which are perimembranous, juxta-arterial, and muscular. All of the defects are described based on their borders as seen from the morphologically right ventricle. Our focus here will be on those defects within the muscular ventricular septum, recognizing that such defects can co-exist with those that are perimembranous. We discuss the differentiation of multiple discrete defects from those referred to as the "Swiss cheese" variant. Conclusions As we show, appropriate surgical management requires an understanding of the specific terminology, as the surgical approach may differ depending on the combination of the individual defects. Data from the Society for Thoracic Surgeons revealed that both mortality and morbidity were increased in the setting of multiple as opposed to solitary ventricular septal defects.

AB  - Background
   Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. We assessed the prevalence, spectrum, and determinants of NAFLD among adults in urban and rural North India.
   Methods
   A representative sample of adults aged 30-60 years were recruited from urban Delhi and rural Ballabhgarh during 2017-2019. Participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) with FibroScan to assess fatty liver and fibrosis, respectively. We estimated the age- and sex-standardised prevalence of NAFLD and its spectrum. The factors associated with 'ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD' were identified using multivariate logistic regression.
   Results
   A total of 828 urban (mean +/- SD age: 45.5 +/- 8.0 years; women: 52.7%) and 832 rural (mean +/- SD age: 45.1 +/- 7.9 years; women: 62.4%) participants were recruited. The age- and sex-standardized prevalence of ultrasound-diagnosed NAFLD was 65.7% (95`)/Xl: 60.3-71.2) in the urban and 61.1% (55.8-66.5) in the rural areas, respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD with elevated alanine transaminase (>= 40IU/L) was 23.2% (19.8-26.6), and 22.5% (19.0-26.0) and any fibrosis by liver stiffness measurement on transient elastography (>= 6.9 kPa) was 16.5% (13.8-19.8) and 5.2% (3.8-6.7) in urban and rural participants, respectively. In both urban and rural areas, diabetes, central obesity and insulin resistance were significantly associated with NAFLD.
   Conclusion
   NAFLD prevalence was high among rural and urban North Indian adults, including fibrosis or raised hepatic enzymes. The strong association of metabolic determinants confirms its linkage with metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Objectives: Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta), a serine/threonine protein kinase, gets activated and worsen stroke outcome after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by inducing inflammation and apoptosis. In this study, tideglusib, a selective irreversible and non-ATP competitive inhibitor of GSK-3 beta, was explored in cerebral I/R damage using middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in rats. Materials and Methods: MCAo was done for 90 min in male Wistar rats (250-280 g) using doccol suture. In pre-treatment group, tideglusib (50 mg/kg) was administered once daily for 2 days and on the day of surgery, 30 min before MCAo. Next day, rats were examined for neurobehavioral parameters and MRI was performed to assess brain damage. In post-treatment group, tideglusib was started at 30 min after MCAo and continued for the next 2 days. After 72 h of MCAo, behavioral parameters and brain damage by MRI were assessed. Further, oxidative stress markers (MDA and GSH), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IL-10) and expression levels of pGSK-3 beta S9, Bcl-2 and Bax were estimated in pre-treatment group. Results: Tideglusib pre-treatment but not post-treatment significantly improved neurobehavioral parameters (p < 0.05) and reduced brain damage (p < 0.01) when compared with MCAo group. I/R induced changes in MDA (p < 0.01), TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta (p < 0.05) were significantly attenuated by pre-treatment. Further, tideglusib pre-treatment ameliorated MCAo induced altered expressions of pGSK-3 beta S9, Bcl-2 and Bax. Conclusion: The results of our exploratory study indicated prophylactic potential of tideglusib in I/R injury by modulating pGSK-3 beta S9, apoptosis and neuro-inflammation.

KW  - MODEL
AB  - Background: To the best of our knowledge, there are no reporting guidelines for design, conduct and reporting of Finite Element studies in health sciences. We intend to propose specific and detailed guidelines for reporting these studies.
   Method: After recognizing the need to have uniform guidelines for reporting of finite element analysis in medicine and dentistry, a group of 5 researchers working on FEA as their research area met in the summer of 2020 and drafted the methodology for the development of such guidelines. Each researcher individually made a list of major headings required for reporting these studies and met again in September 2020 to finalize the domains. Subsequently, sub headings and details were charted. The draft list of items for reporting the guidelines were presented to a larger team of 15 experts and some changes were further made based on their inputs.
   Results: The guidelines entail seven major domains and their sub-domains, including parameters for model structure, segmentation, mesh structure, force application and model validation, etc. This checklist aims to improvise the reporting and consistency of FEA studies.
   Conclusion: We hope that the usage and adoption of these guidelines by the scientific community would result in more thoughtful and uniform documentation. Also, the confidence in the results would be enhanced through model reproducibility, reusability and accountability. The proposed guidelines were named as 'Reporting of in-silico studies using finite element analysis in medicine' and the term 'RIFEM' was used as acronym. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Leprosy type 1 reaction (T1R) is a cell-mediated inflammatory reaction which involves skin and peripheral nerves in leprosy. Lesions with T1R have higher production of IL-17 cytokine from CD4(+) T cells along with lower TGF-beta producing FOXP3(+) CD4(+) Tregs. IL-21 is an important cytokine that promotes the development and stability of Th17 cells in an autocrine manner. It can play an important role in the pathogenesis of T1R in leprosy. However, the mechanism by which IL-21 influences the pathogenic progress of leprosy T1R remains poorly understood. In the present study, we evaluated the expression of IL-21 cytokine in skin lesions of both nonreactional (NR) and T1R via immuno-histochemistry and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Further, expression of various genes (IL-17A, IL-17F, TGF-beta, FOXP3, RORC and IL-21) was also measured by qPCR in cultured cells. We also analyzed the secretion of various cytokines such as of IL-21, IL-17A/F and TGF-beta in the culture supernatants by ELISA. In addition, differentiation of Th17 and Treg cells were studied in PBMC cultures after stimulation with Mycobacterium leprae sonicated antigens and rIL-21 for 48 hrs and the phenotypes of Th17 and Tregs were determined by flowcytometric analysis. Our results clearly indicate that IL-21(+)T cells were significantly higher in both peripheral blood and skin lesions of T1R as compared to NR patients. Moreover, we observed that recombinant IL-21 cytokine inhibited TGF-beta producing Treg cells differentiation along with up-regulating Th17 cells under in-vitro conditions. The gene expression of IL-21 was significantly negatively correlated with Treg and positively correlated with Th17 cell markers in T1R patients. Our results suggested that IL-21 promotes T1R mediated inflammation via modulating the balance of Th17 and Treg cell populations.

AB  - This study is an assessment of the effects of outdoor air pollution and extreme weather events on the health of outdoor workers in Delhi, including auto rickshaw drivers, street vendors, and sweepers. To carry it out, a cross-sectional and perception-based epidemiological research design was used, and the primary tool used for data collection was a questionnaire. Two hundred twenty-eight people participated in the survey, and a pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed on 63 participants. Most of the respondents from different occupational groups complained about headaches/giddiness, nausea, and muscular cramps during extreme heat events due to the physically demanding nature of their jobs in the outdoor environment. Furthermore, autorickshaw drivers reported the highest prevalence of ophthalmic symptoms, such as eye redness (44%) and eye irritation (36%). In comparison, vendors reported a higher prevalence of headaches (43%) and eye redness (40%) due to increased exposure to vehicular emissions. Among sweepers, musculoskeletal problems like joint pain (40%), backache (38%), and shoulder pain (35%) were most prevalent due to occupation-related ergonomic factors. In addition, the majority of autorickshaw drivers (47%), vendors (47%), and sweepers (48%) considered that air quality had a severe impact on their health. PFT results showed that most respondents had restricted lung function. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that lung function impairment had a significant association with smoking (p = 0.023) and age (0.019). The odds ratio for smoking, which was around 4, indicated that respondents who smoked had a nearly four times greater risk of developing lung impairment. The study also highlighted the need for using personal protective equipment and developing guidelines to reduce their exposure level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: External ventricular drain (EVD)-associated cerebrospinal fluid infection (EACI) remains a major complication associated with EVD. Length of EVD tunnel, an overlooked but modifiable factor, can be associated with increased risk of EACI. The aim of this study is to find the tunnel length associated with least chances of EACI by performing a network meta-analysis.
   METHODS: A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve studies that studied the rates of EACI with different EVD tunnel lengths and a Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed.
   RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the network meta-analysis. With 0 cm tunnel length as reference, the odds ratio (OR) for developing EACI was minimum for tunnel length 5-10 cm (OR, 0.027). It was followed by tunnel length of 5 cm (OR, 0.060) and 10 cm (OR, 0.075). The surface under the cumulative ranking curve plot showed that the probability of the tunnel length 5-10 cm (ranked first), 5 cm (ranked second), and 10 cm (ranked third) for being the best EVD tunnel length was found to be 86%, 64%, and 61%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: The length for which an EVD is tunneled may have an impact on the rate of EACI. Our network meta-analyses showed that the tunnel length of 5-10 cm was associated with the lowest rates of EACI, with 86% probability of being the best EVD tunnel length. The probability of a patient with 5-10 cm EVD length developing EACI was 2.7% compared with zero tunnel length.

AB  - Extraintestinal manifestations occur frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of the Endpoints for Extraintestinal Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Trials (EXTRA) initiative was to achieve international expert consensus on how to assess these manifestations in IBD trials. A systematic literature review was done to identify methods to diagnose extraintestinal manifestations in patients with IBD and measure treatment outcomes. A consensus meeting involving a panel of 41 attendees, including gastroenterologists and referral specialists, was held on March 31, 2021, as part of an International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases initiative. The panel agreed that a specialist's expertise is needed to confirm the diagnosis of extraintestinal manifestations before the inclusion of a patient in IBD trials, except for axial spondyloarthritis, for which typical symptoms and MRI can be sufficient. Easy to-measure endpoints were identified to assess the response of extraintestinal manifestations to treatment without needing specialist involvement. For uveitis, peripheral spondyloarthritis, and arthralgia, endpoint measurements need specialist expertise. The timing of endpoint measurements was discussed for individual extraintestinal manifestations. The EXTRA consensus proposes guidelines on how to thoroughly evaluate extraintestinal manifestations within IBD trials, and recommends that these guidelines are implemented in future trials to enable prospective assessment of these manifestations and comparison between studies.

AB  - Aims To evaluate the impact of a simplified, rapid cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) protocol embedded in care and supported by a partner education programme on the management of cardiomyopathy (CMP) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and results Rapid CMR focused particularly on CMP was implemented in 11 centres, 7 cities, 5 countries, and 3 continents linked to training courses for local professionals. Patients were followed up for 24 months to assess impact. The rate of subsequent adoption was tracked. Five CMR conferences were delivered (920 attendees-potential referrers, radiographers, reporting cardiologists, or radiologists) and five new centres starting CMR. Six hundred and one patients were scanned. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance indications were 24% non-contrast T2* scans [myocardial iron overload (MIO)] and 72% suspected/known cardiomyopathies (including ischaemic and viability). Ninety-eighty per cent of studies were of diagnostic quality. The average scan time was 22 +/- 6 min (contrast) and 12 +/- 4 min (non-contrast), a potential cost/throughput reduction of between 30 and 60%. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance findings impacted management in 62%, including a new diagnosis in 22% and MIO detected in 30% of non-contrast scans. Nine centres continued using rapid CMR 2 years later (typically 1-2 days per week, 30 min slots). Conclusions Rapid CMR of diagnostic quality can be delivered using available technology in LMICs. When embedded in care and a training programme, costs are lower, care is improved, and services can be sustained over time. Key question Can cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) be delivered with a simplified and rapid core protocol in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with available technology? Can rapid CMR improve patient's care if embedded with a training programme for local professionals in LMICs and incorporated into clinical care? Key finding Five CMR conferences (920 attendees), 11 scanning centres, 7 cities, 5 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Scanning time: 22 min (contrast) and 12 min (non-contrast). Cost reduction: 30-60%. CMR findings impacted management in 62% of patients. Take-home message Rapid CMR can be provided quickly and cheaply with diagnostic quality in LMICs. When embedded in an education programme, this improves patient care and can be sustainable.

AB  - The addition of metformin to anti-tuberculosis therapy does not affect sputum conversion. However, it brings about early closure of cavities and decreases inflammation in the lungs secondary to tuberculosis and, thus, may favor faster recovery and decreased lung tissue damage.
   Background Metformin, by reducing intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth, can be considered an adjunctive therapy to anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). We determined whether metformin with standard ATT reduces time to sputum culture conversion and tissue inflammation in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Methods In a randomized, 8-week, clinical trial, newly diagnosed, culture-positive PTB patients were randomized to standard ATT (HREZ = control arm) or standard ATT plus daily 1000 mg metformin (MET-HREZ = Metformin with Rifampicin [METRIF] arm) for 8 weeks during 2018-2020 at 5 sites in India. The primary end point was time to sputum culture conversion by liquid culture during 8 weeks of ATT. Plasma inflammatory markers were estimated in a subset. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate time and predictors of culture conversion. Results Of the 322 patients randomized, 239 (74%) were male, and 212 (66%) had bilateral disease on chest radiograph with 54 (18%) showing cavitation. The median time to sputum culture conversion by liquid culture was 42 days in the METRIF arm and 41 days in the control arm (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], .624-1.019). After 8 weeks of ATT, cavitary lesions on X-ray (7, 5.3% vs 18, 12.9%; relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, .18-.96; P = .041) and inflammatory markers were significantly lower in the METRIF arm. Higher body mass index and lower sputum smear grading were associated with faster sputum culture conversion. Conclusions The addition of metformin to standard ATT did not hasten sputum culture conversion but diminished excess inflammation, thus reducing lung tissue damage as seen by faster clearance on X-ray and reduced inflammatory markers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and radiological outcome of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) in treatment of intracranial dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) with cortical venous drainage (CVD) and compare it with the outcome of endovascular therapy.
   METHODS: Patients who underwent GKS or endovascular therapy for intracranial DAVF with CVD over 10 years (January 2007 to December 2016) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, were included. Demographics, clinical presentation, imaging details, and follow-up clinical status were reviewed retrospectively. Clinical follow-up was conducted once every 6 months. Radiological follow-up using digital subtraction angiography was performed at a mean 24 months after intervention. Patients with clinical follow-up of <1 year were excluded from the study.
   RESULTS: The study included 35 patients (26 in embolization group and 9 in GKS group) who had intracranial DAVF with CVD were included in the study. Clinical improvement was seen in 77.78% of the patients who received GKS and 57.7% of the patients who underwent embolization (P = 0.431). Complete obliteration of DAVF was seen in 55.56% of the patients in the GKS group and 57.7% of the patients in the embolization group (P = 1). GKS was at least as effective as embolization in terms of clinical and radiological outcome in treatment of intracranial DAVF with CVD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to popular perception, GKS should be considered as an effective first-line treatment alternative of intracranial DAVF with CVD.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the morphology and associated cardiovascular abnormalities in patients with juxtaposition of atrial appendages (JAA) on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography. Materials and Methods We performed the retrospective study at a tertiary referral center to identify patients diagnosed with JAA on MDCT angiography using dual-source CT scanner between January 2014 and April 2021. The various imaging abnormalities evaluated included the type of JAA, morphological and positional classification of JAA, atrial situs, cardiac position, atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial connections, great vessel relationship, and other associated cardiovascular anomalies. Results We identified 129 patients with JAA. Left-sided juxtaposition was seen in 124 (96.1%) patients while right-sided juxtaposition was seen in 5 (3.9%) patients. Among patients with left-sided juxtaposition, frequent cardiovascular associations included outflow tract malformations (100%), hypoplastic right ventricle (40.3%), tricuspid atresia (32.2%), and right-sided heart (19.4%). The most frequent outflow tract malformation was double outlet right ventricle (DORV; 60.5%) followed by transposition of great arteries (20.1%) and transposed aorta with pulmonary atresia (18.5%). In patients with right-sided juxtaposition, outflow tract malformation was seen in three (60%) patients with one (20%) patient each showing DORV, transposed aorta with pulmonary atresia, and tetralogy of Fallot, respectively. Conclusion The identification of JAA on MDCT angiography suggests coexistence of various complex congenital heart diseases, especially outflow tract malformations. A meticulous search is imperative to identify this anomaly before interventional or surgical procedures to avoid complications.

AB  - Serotonin-dopamine activity modulators (SDAMs) have been approved as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressants in patients with inadequate response. These drugs have been proposed to have a beneficial effect on cognition, sleep-related problems, and other affective symptoms in patients with depression. Previous studies have shown inconsistent evidence and have not reported a pooled effect of the 2 drugs of this class: aripiprazole and brexpiprazole. This meta-analysis evaluated the effect of augmentation with SDAM drugs in patients with major depression. The meta-analysis protocol was made as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol guidelines and registered in the International Prospective Register of Ongoing Systematic Reviews. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Trial registry, and EudraCT databases were searched with prespecified search terms. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed using the meta package in R software. Fifteen studies were included in this meta-analysis. The random-effects model analysis observed a pooled effect of 1.55 (95%CI, 1.32-1.84; prediction interval, 0.95-2.55, z = 5.19 [P < .0001]) for remission between the SDAM and placebo groups. A pooled effect of 1.58 (95%CI, 1.37-1.83; prediction interval, 1.00-2.51, z = 6.34 [P < .0001]) for adverse events and 0.72 (95%CI, 0.48-1.08; prediction interval, 0.46-1.12; z = -1.58 [P = .113]) for serious adverse events was observed. No significant publication bias was noticed. The quality of the evidence was rated as high. Adjunct SDAM increased remission in patients and had no significant effect on serious adverse events compared to placebo. Therefore, we conclude that SDAM drugs can be an effective and safe antidepressant augmentation strategy in patients with major depressive disorder.

AB  - Acquired aplastic anemia (aAA) is an autoimmune disease, characterized by infiltration of T lymphocytes in the bone marrow with destruction of hematopoietic stem cells by the effector cells. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and perforin are important mediators of cell destruction. In this flow cytometry-based study, we have investigated the percentage of intracellular IFN-gamma(+) and perforin(+) CD5(+) T cells in peripheral blood of newly diagnosed aAA patients before and after immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Patients were categorized as per standard disease severity and response to IST. The median percentage of IFN-gamma(+) and perforin(+) CD5(+) T cells was higher in untreated patients compared to healthy controls. The percentage of these cells was also increased in untreated severe and very severe aplastic anemia when compared with non-severe aplastic anemia patients. In patients before and after IST the median percentage of T cells producing IFN-gamma and perforin was elevated in non-responders as compared to partial plus complete responders. The higher percentage of IFN-gamma(+) and perforin(+) CD5(+) T cells may be useful as an early diagnostic marker for aberrant activation of immune system and predict poor response to IST in aAA patients, who will benefit from alternative therapy.

AB  - In this study, we utilized an untargeted NMR metabolomics approach to identify the vector response in terms of metabolic profiling after temperature and insecticide exposure in comparison with the control. Clearly, temperature and insecticide exposure cause changes in the underlying metabolism, and the NMR metabolomic profile enables a direct examination of the immediate response of the vector to cope up with these changes. The present study was designed in four parts: A-Aedes aegypti were exposed to 40 degrees C for one-hour, DDT-4%, malathion-5%, and deltamethrin-0.05% separately and, part B-D; one-hour exposure at 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C temperatures followed by one-hour exposure to insecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles were compared with the control. In response to temperature and insecticide exposure, several metabolites and altered pathways were identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major biological pathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating the impact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease with a 5-year survival rate of 5-10%. Radiation is commonly used in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings to improve local control. Studies have shown that circulating lymphocyte count depletion after radiation has been associated with poor tumor control and inferior overall survival (OS) outcomes. Method: To better understand the impact of radiation-associated lymphopenia in pancreatic cancer, the authors undertook this systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies that have reported radiation-related lymphopenia in pancreatic cancer. Results: A systematic methodology search of PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library resulted in 2969 abstracts. Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Six studies reported on outcomes in patients undergoing definitive chemoradiation and three studies comparing outcomes in stereotactic body radiotherapy versus definitive chemoradiation. The patients with severe lymphopenia were at increased risk of death with a pooled hazard ratio of 2.33 (95% CI: 1.79, 3.03; I-2: 36%; p < 0.001) compared with patients with no severe lymphopenia. The odds of developing severe lymphopenia were 1.12 (95% CI: 0.45, 2.79; I-2: 95%; p < 0.81). The pooled mean difference for OS was -6.80 months (95% CI: -10.35, -3.24; I-2: 99%; p < 0.002), suggesting that patients who develop grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia have inferior median OS outcomes. Limiting the mean splenic dose to less than 9 Gy as well as various spleen dosimetric parameters such as V10 <32%, V15 Conclusion: Radiation-related lymphopenia is associated with an increased hazard of death and inferior median OS. Spleen dosimetric parameters correlate with the incidence of severe lymphopenia and with sub-optimal survival outcomes. There is a need to validate these findings in prospective studies.

AB  - Background Patients with asymptomatic prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis may progress to needing surgery; no biomarker supporting the identification of these cases is currently available. The aim of the study was to assess the role of Plasma Renin Activity (PRA) as a discriminatory factor to identify patients with asymptomatic prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis who require close monitoring and are at-risk for surgery. Methods The study group consists of 30 children prenatally diagnosed with asymptomatic unilateral hydronephrosis, initially managed with medical follow-up. Pyeloplasty was indicated if patients became symptomatic or if there was a significant drop in split renal function (SRF) during follow-up. An association was sought between PRA and renal parameters in post-hoc analysis. Results During the mean follow-up of 55.5 +/- 8.2 months, 13/30 (43.3%) patients developed delayed drainage and 8/30 (26.6%) underwent pyeloplasty. Mean PRA was higher at presentation in the group which later presented with a drop in differential kidney function >= 10%, while it was within the normal range for age in the other patients. Before pyeloplasty, progression to delayed drainage coincided with a drop in SRF and a rise in PRA. While PRA levels normalized after pyeloplasty, SRF improved but did not reach initial values. A mean rise of 68.9% in PRA preceded current indications for surgery by 27.5 +/- 9.5 months. Conclusions A progressive increase in PRA in children with asymptomatic prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis reflects obstructive stress in the tubulo-interstitial compartment. This stress is relieved by pyeloplasty and is reflected by a drop in PRA after surgery. PRA can, thus, serve as the discriminatory factor to identify hydronephrosis patients 'at-risk' for surgery even before the current criteria for pyeloplasty are met.

AB  - Barefoot slips contribute to over 37% of recurrent fall-related injuries across all age groups. To study slip risk across a wide range of flooring conditions, slip meters with barefoot surrogates (i.e., sensors, as per ASTM standard nomenclature) such as animal skins and rubbers have been used to date, which exhibit biomechanical and frictional properties widely different from the barefoot human skin. Development of a surrogate which can accurately simulate the human heel skin properties would be immensely beneficial for realistic assessment of barefoot slipping risk. A novel surrogate was developed using 3D scanning and printing, and biomimetics, which precisely simulates the biomechanical and frictional properties of the barefoot human heel skin. Mechanical slip testing was conducted with this surrogate on three common bathroom floorings and with six different contaminants. Coefficient of Friction (COF) results similar to human slipping experiments, high repeatability and reproducibility across wet and oily flooring conditions, were confirmed through experiments with the developed heel skin surrogate. The heel skin surrogate would be an indispensable model for accurate estimation of barefoot risk against slips and falls in bathrooms, bathtubs, and swimming pools.

AB  - Introduction. The Global Delphi Panel of Keratoconus (KC) and Ectatic Diseases formulated management guidelines for KC in 2015. The aim of this study was to evaluate management outcomes in pediatric KC. Materials and Methods. Prospective, interventional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital including KC patients aged <18 years. Based on disease severity and progression of disease, patients were prescribed either glasses or contact lenses (CLs) or underwent corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL), deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK), or penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Main Outcome Measures. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), manifest cylinder, maximum keratometry, thinnest corneal thickness, total higher order aberrations, and corneal hysteresis at baseline and 12 and 24 months. Results. 116 eyes of 62 patients with a mean age of 14.76 +/- 2.77 years were included. 32.8% of the eyes (n = 38) achieved satisfactory BCVA with glasses/CLs only. Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) was performed in 43.1% of the eyes (n = 50) with progressive KC and halting of progression was noted in 83.3% (n = 35) of the eyes at 2 years. 7.7% of the eyes (n = 9) were managed for acute hydrops. DALK and PK were successfully performed in 9.5% (n = 11) and 6.9% (n = 8) of the eyes with BCVA of 0.14 +/- 0.09 and 0.08 +/- 0.12 at 2 years, respectively. Conclusions. Pediatric KC cases with progression show good visual and aberrometric outcomes and halting of progression after CXL. DALK and PK have good outcomes. The global consensus guidelines showed good clinical utility in pediatric patients. Presence of VKC did not have an impact on the outcomes of CXL in pediatric patients.

AB  - Objective: The emergence of resistance against last-resort antibiotics, carbapenem and colistin, in Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported across the globe. Bacteriophage therapy seems to be one of the most promising alternatives. This study aimed to optimize the quantity and frequency of bacteriophage cocktail dosage/s required to eradicate the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria in immunocompetent septicemic mice.
   Methods: The three most active phages phi KpBHU4, phi KpBHU7, and phi KpBHU14 characterized by molecular and TEM analyses were in the form of cocktail and was given intraperitoneally to mice after inducing the septicemia mice model with a constant dose of 8 x 10(7) colony-forming unit/mouse (CFU/mouse) Klebsiella pneumoniae. After that, the efficacy of the phage cocktail was analyzed at different dosages, that is, in increasing, variable, constant, and repeated dosages. Furthermore, interleukin-6 and endotoxin levels were estimated with variable doses of phage cocktail.
   Results: We have elucidated that phage therapy is effective against the Klebsiella pneumoniae septicemia mice model and is a promising alternative to antibiotic treatments. Our work delineates that a single dose of phage cocktail with 1 x 10(5) plaque-forming unit/mouse (PFU/mouse) protects the mice from fatal outcomes at any stage of septicemia. However, a higher phage dosage of 1 x 10(12) PFU/mice is fatal when given at the early hours of septicemia, while this high dose is not fatal at the later stages of septicemia. Moreover, multiple repeated dosages are required to eradicate the bacteria from peripheral blood. In addition, the IL-6 levels in the 1 x 10(5) PFU/mouse group remain lower, but in the 1 x 10(12) PFU/mouse group remains high at all points, which were associated with fatal outcomes.
   Conclusion: Our study showed that the optimized relatively lower and multiple dosages of phage cocktails with the strict monitoring of vitals in clinical settings might cure septicemia caused by MDR bacteria with different severity of infection.

AB  - Background Evidence on the role of curative metastasectomy (CM) for malignant melanoma (MM) patients is limited, especially in the current era of effective systemic therapy. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to ascertain the role of CM compared with incomplete or nonsurgical treatment for patients with MM. Methods Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched for studies investigating CM for MM until 30 September 2021. The review included studies that compared CM with no-CM and reported a hazard ratio (HR) after multivariate analysis for overall survival. A random-effects model with inverse variance was used to calculate pooled HR. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Results For the final analysis, 40 studies including 31,282 patients (CM, 9958; no-CM, 21,324) were considered. Compared with no-CM, CM was associated with a significantly lower risk of death (HR, 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.47; p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed that the outcome was independent of the effective systemic therapy and anatomic location of metastasis. An unfavorable prognosis was associated with advancing age, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), male gender, prior stage 3 disease, multiple metastases and organ sites, and shorter disease-free interval. Conclusion Curative metastasectomy for MM is associated with a lower risk of death than non-curative treatment methods. Selection bias and underlying weakness of studies reduced the strength of evidence in this review. However, CM should be a part of the multimodality treatment of MM whenever technically feasible.

AB  - Background and Aim On the basis of previously published accounts, coupled with our own experience, we have assessed the surgical approaches to patients with isomeric atrial appendages. Methods We reviewed pertinent published studies on surgical treatment of individuals with isomeric atrial appendages, with the pertinent surgical details provided by most of the manuscripts. Results Half of patients with right isomerism, and two-thirds of those with left isomerism have bilateral superior caval veins. Azygos extension of the inferior caval vein is reported in three-quarters of those with left isomerism. The coronary sinus is universally absent in right isomerism, along with totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and is absent in two-fifths of those with left isomerism. Univentricular atrioventricular connections are expected in up to three-quarters of those with right isomerism. Atrioventricular septal defect is reported in up to four-fifths, more frequently in right isomerism, with such patients typically having discordant ventriculoatrial connections or double outlet right ventricle. Reported mortalities extend to 85% for those with right, and 50% for those with left isomerism. In right isomerism, mortality is up to 54% for systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunting, up to 75% for univentricular repair, and up to 95% for repair of totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection itself. No more than one-quarter had undergone Fontan completion, with reported mortalities of 21%. Conclusion Early surgical results are satisfactory in patients with left isomerism, but disappointing for those with right. Recent advances in cardiac and liver transplantation may offer improved survival.

AB  - Background Acute retinal toxicity has been demonstrated to be associated with the intraoperative use of perfluorocarbon liquids (PFCLs), especially perfluorooctane (PFO). Recently, several cases of PFO-associated blindness have been reported in Spain, Holland, France, Italy, the Middle East, and South America.
   Methods As a result, a new ISO guideline (ISO 16672:2020) was drafted, discussed, approved, and released in 2019. This recent ISO16672:2020 guideline recommends performing direct cytotoxicity tests as an option along with chemical analysis to measure PFCL quality (purity and safety).
   Results In this review paper, it has been emphasized why an appropriate biological test, specifically direct exposure of PFCL to live cells, for measuring cytotoxicity must be performed with each PFCL batch along with chemical analysis.
   Conclusions The paper intends to compile all available information to discuss possible approaches for avoiding adverse clinical cases in future.

AB  - Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an alternative route of viral entry in the susceptible host cell. In this process, antiviral antibodies enhance the entry access of virus in the cells via interaction with the complement or Fc receptors leading to the worsening of infection. SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a general concern for the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that may fail to neutralize infection, raising the possibility of a more severe form of COVID-19. Data from various studies on respiratory viruses raise the speculation that antibodies elicited against SARS-CoV-2 and during COVID-19 recovery could potentially exacerbate the infection through ADE at sub-neutralizing concentrations; this may contribute to disease pathogenesis. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study the effectiveness of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19-infected subjects. Theoretically, ADE remains a general concern for the efficacy of antibodies elicited during infection, most notably in convalescent plasma therapy and in response to vaccines where it could be counterproductive.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has profoundly affected the work of mental health professionals with many transitioning to telehealth to comply with public health measures. This large international study examined the impact of the pandemic on mental health clinicians' telehealth use. Methods: This survey study was conducted with mental health professionals, primarily psychiatrists and psychologists, registered with WHO's Global Clinical Practice Network (GCPN). 1206 clinicians from 100 countries completed the telehealth section of the online survey in one of six languages between June 4 and July 7, 2020. Participants were asked about their use, training (i.e., aspects of telehealth addressed), perceptions, and concerns. Outcomes: Since the pandemic onset, 1092 (90.5%) clinicians reported to have started or increased their telehealth services. Telephone and videoconferencing were the most common modalities. 592 (49.1%) participants indicated that they had not received any training. Clinicians with no training or training that only addressed a single aspect of telehealth practice were more likely to perceive their services as somewhat ineffective than those with training that addressed two or more aspects. Most clinicians indicated positive perceptions of effectiveness and patient satisfaction. Quality of care compared to in-person services and technical issues were the most common concerns. Findings varied by WHO region, country income level, and profession. Interpretation: Findings suggest a global practice change with providers perceiving telehealth as a viable option for mental health care. Increasing local training opportunities and efforts to address clinical and technological concerns is important for meeting ongoing demands.

AB  - As blood-derived miRNAs (c-miRNAs) are modulated by exercise and nutrition, we postulated that they might be used to monitor the effects of a lifestyle intervention (LI) to prevent diabetes development. To challenge this hypothesis, obese Asian Indian pre-diabetic patients were submitted to diet modifications and physical activity for 4 months (LI group) and compared to a control group which was given recommendations only. We have considered 2 periods of time to analyze the data, i.e.; a first one to study the response to the intervention (4 months), and a second one post-intervention (8 months). At basal, 4 months and 8 months post-intervention the levels of 17 c-miRNAs were quantified, selected either for their relevance to the pathology or because they are known to be modulated by physical activity or diet. Their variations were correlated with variations of 25 metabolic and anthropometric parameters and cytokines. As expected, fasting-glycaemia, insulin-sensitivity, levels of exercise- and obesity-induced cytokines were ameliorated after 4 months. In addition, the levels of 4 miRNAs (i.e.; miR-128-3p, miR-374a-5p, miR-221-3p, and miR-133a-3p) were changed only in the LI group and were correlated with metabolic improvement (insulin sensitivity, cytokine levels, waist circumference and systolic blood pressure). However, 8 months post-intervention almost all ameliorated metabolic parameters declined indicating that the volunteers did not continue the protocol on their own. Surprisingly, the LI positive effects on c-miRNA levels were still detected, and were even more pronounced 8 months post-intervention. In parallel, MCP-1, involved in tissue infiltration by immune cells, and Il-6, adiponectin and irisin, which have anti-inflammatory effects, continued to be significantly and positively modified, 8 months post-intervention. These data demonstrated for the first time, that c-miRNA correlations with metabolic parameters and insulin sensitivity are in fact only indirect and likely associated with the level systemic inflammation. More generally speaking, this important result explains the high variability between the previous studies designed to identify specific c-miRNAs associated with the severity of insulin-resistance. The results of all these studies should take into account the level of inflammation of the patients. In addition, this finding could also explain why, whatever the pathology considered (i.e.; cancers, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory diseases) the same subset of miRNAs is always found altered in the blood of patients vs healthy subjects, as these pathologies are all associated with the development of inflammation.

AB  - Objective. Sympathetic blocks are invaluable to prevent morbidity from Raynaud's phenomenon (RP). RP may occur in children with rheumatological disorders and causes severe pain, discoloration of digits, gangrene, and autoamputation. We describe the planning and execution of sympathectomy blocks in children with rheumatological disorders presenting with RP. Methods. With upper-limb involvement, ultrasound-guided stellate ganglion block (USGB) was given with ropivacaine and clonidine. When all four limbs were involved, intrathecal block with bupivacaine and clonidine was also given. Results. A total of 68 sympathectomy blocks were performed: 28 bilateral USGBs, two unilateral USGBs, and 10 intrathecal injections. Multiple interventions in a single day were frequently required. For safety, all USGBs were performed with an ultrasound with strict adherence to local anaesthetic volume was maintained, with periprocedure monitoring of 2-3 hours. All blocks were performed by an experienced specialist. All children reported immediate pain relief with prevention of major amputation. Conclusion. With meticulous planning, monitoring, and precautions, sympathectomy of limbs in pediatric rheumatological disorders with RP can be safely undertaken. Bilateral stellate ganglion block with ultrasound is safe in children, and clonidine is a useful adjunct for vasodilation and prolongation of the effect of sympathectomies in children.

AB  - This study aimed to document the method standardisation and assessment of micronutrient and inflammatory markers in women from indigenous tribal communities of Jharkhand using a low-volume, high-throughput assay. This cross-sectional study was done among women of the reproductive age group from Sauria Paharia and Santhal tribal households (HH) in selected villages. Capillary blood samples were collected from the women during a HH survey to estimate ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, retinol binding protein 4 and inflammatory biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) using a multiplex assay. Vitamin D and Hb were estimated using an LC-MS technique and cyanmethaemoglobin method, respectively. A multiplex Luminex-based method was developed and standardised. The assay was used to estimate biomarkers in samples from 413 women (178 and 235 from Sauria Paharia and Santhal tribes, respectively). Over 51 % of women had raised CRP or AGP levels. Fe status was significantly better in Sauria Paharia compared with the Santhal women. Anaemia prevalence was 72 % among Santhal women. The proportion of women with Fe deficiency increased after adjusting for inflammation. The overall prevalence of vitamin A deficiency and insufficiency was 25 and 34 %, respectively, with similar prevalence in both tribes. All Santhal women had sufficient vitamin D levels, while 25 and 20 % of Sauria Paharia women had insufficient and deficient vitamin D levels, respectively. Our low-volume, high-throughput multiplex assays may provide a feasible approach for assessing nutritional biomarkers in nutritionally vulnerable hard-to-reach communities.

AB  - Background: Better patient-ventilator interactions, during neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA), are expected to result in lower rate of diaphragm dysfunction.
   Objective: This study was planned to compare the rate of diaphragm dysfunction between the conventional modes of mechanical ventilation and NAVA.
   Methods: Patients who were initiated on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure were randomized to continue either conventional mode of mechanical ventilation or switched to NAVA. The rates of diaphragm dysfunction were compared between two groups.
   Results: This study included 46 participants (male 30/46) with a mean age of 58 years. Mean APACHE II and SOFA scores were 15 and 3, respectively. The mean (SD) diaphragm thickness fraction in the conventional mechanical ventilation and NAVA group were 37.12% (18.48) and 39.27% (27.65), respectively. The diaphragm dysfunction was observed in 5 (22.7%) and 8 (34.7%) patients in NAVA and conventional arm, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p-value = 0.37). Diaphragm excursion was better in the NAVA group as compared with the conventional mechanical ventilation group. Diaphragm thickness and thickness fraction were comparable between two groups.
   Conclusion: Switching from the conventional mode of mechanical ventilation to NAVA leads to statistically non-significant reduction in the occurrence of diaphragm dysfunction. Adequately powered studies are required to assess the exact role of NAVA on diaphragm functions. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Norepinephrine is as effective as phenylephrine for management of spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension. Most of the studies comparing these vasopressors have been conducted in healthy pregnant women undergoing elective caesarean section. In the current study, we tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in neonatal outcome when phenylephrine or norepinephrine is used to treat spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension in women undergoing emergency caesarean section for fetal compromise.
   Methods: Patients undergoing caesarean section for fetal compromise who developed spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension were randomised to receive phenylephrine 100 mu g or norepinephrine 8 mu g for treatment of each hypotensive episode, defined as systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg. Umbilical cord arterial and venous blood samples were obtained for blood gas analysis. The primary outcome measure was umbilical artery pH.
   Results: One hundred patients (50 in each group) were studied. There was no significant difference in umbilical artery pH between the two groups (mean difference 0.001; 95% CI - 0.032 to 0.034). The number of hypotensive episodes, vasopressor boluses required, the incidence of bradycardia, heart rate and blood pressure trends following vasopressor administration, and the incidence of nausea/vomiting were not significantly different between groups.
   Conclusion: Phenylephrine 100 mu g and norepinephrine 8 mu g were not significantly different in terms of neonatal outcome when administered as intravenous boluses for treatment of spinal anaesthesia-induced hypotension in parturients undergoing emergency caesarean sections for fetal compromise.

AB  - Background and objectives Observing biomarkers that affect alternative pathway dysregulation components may be effective in obtaining a new and more rapid diagnostic portrayal of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. We have conducted a systematic review on the aHUS biomarkers: C3, C5a, C5b-9, factor B, complement factor B, H, and I, CH50, AH50, D-dimer, as well as anti-CFH antibodies.
   Methods An exhaustive literature search was conducted for aHUS patient population plasma/serum, collected/reported at the onset of diagnosis. A total of 60 studies were included with the data on 837 aHUS subjects, with at least one biomarker reported.
   Results The biomarkers C3 [mean (SD): 72.1 (35.0), median: 70.5 vs. reference range: 75-175 mg/dl, n = 752]; CH50 [28.3 (32.1), 24.3 vs. 30-75 U/ml, n = 63]; AH50 [27.6% (30.2%), 10% vs. >= 46%, n = 23]; and CFB [13.1 (6.6), 12.4, vs. 15.2-42.3 mg/dl, n = 19] were lower among aHUS subjects as compared with the reference range.
   The biomarkers including C4 [mean (SD): 20.4 (9.5), median: 20.5 vs. reference range: 14-40 mg/dl, n = 343]; C4d [7.2 (6.5), 4.8 vs. <= 9.8 mu g/ml, n = 108]; CFH [40.2 (132.3), 24.5 vs. 23.6-43.1 mg/dl, n = 123 subjects]; and CFI [8.05 (5.01), 6.55 mg/dl vs. 4.4-18.1 mg/dl, n = 38] were all observed to be within the reference range among aHUS subjects.
   The biomarkers C5a [mean (SD): 54.9 (32.9), median: 48.8 vs. reference range: 10.6-26.3 mg/dl, n = 117]; C5b-9 [466.0 (401.4), 317 (186-569.7) vs. <= 250 ng/ml, n = 174]; Bb [2.6 (2.1), 1.9 vs. <= 1.6 mu g/ml, n = 77] and D-dimer [246 (65.05), 246 vs. < 2.2 ng/ml, 2, n = 2 subjects] were higher among patients with aHUS compared with the reference range.
   Conclusion If a comprehensive complement profile were built using our data, aHUS would be identified by low levels of C3, CH50, AH50, and CFB along with increased levels of C5a, C5b-9, Bb, anti-CFH autoantibodies, and D-dimer.

AB  - Aims Overt diabetes in pregnancy is defined as hyperglycemia first recognized during pregnancy which meets the diagnostic threshold of diabetes in non-pregnant adults. This case-based narrative review aims to describe this unique condition and discuss the potential implications for its accurate diagnosis and management. Methods and Results We conducted a literature search in PubMed for relevant articles published in English language up to January 2022. Women with overt diabetes have a higher risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes and postpartum diabetes, compared to their counterparts with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Such women often need aggressive management, including early and prompt initiation of insulin therapy, and a close follow-up during pregnancy and in the postpartum period. Not all pregnant women with overt diabetes have persistent diabetes in the postpartum period. Early diagnosis, especially during the first trimester, and fasting plasma glucose elevation (>= 126 mg/dl or 7 mmol/L) at the time of initial diagnosis are predictors of postpartum diabetes. Conclusions Both GDM and overt diabetes in pregnancy are hyperglycemic conditions first recognized during pregnancy, but the two conditions differ in severity; the latter is a more severe form of hyperglycemia associated with worse maternal and fetal outcomes, and a higher risk of postpartum diabetes.

AB  - Background The occurrence of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) is associated with increased mortality. HE is commonly precipitated by infection, but whether HE predisposes to new infection is unclear. This study aimed to test if OHE predisposes to de novo infection during hospitalisation and its association with short-term mortality. Aims and Methods Seven hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients were identified at two institutions from prospectively maintained clinical databases of cirrhotic patients admitted with acute decompensation (AD). Infection and HE data were collected on the day of admission, and the occurrence of de novo infections was assessed for 28 days after admission. EASL-CLIF organ failure criteria were used to determine the presence of organ failures. Multivariable analysis using the logistic regression model was used to assess predictors of 28-day mortality and de novo infection. Results Patients were divided into four groups; no baseline OHE or infection (n = 352); OHE with no baseline Infection (n = 221); no OHE but baseline infection (n = 100) and OHE with baseline infection (n = 86). On multivariate analyses, OHE (OR, 1.532 [95% CI, 1.061-2.300, P = 0.024]), and admission to ITU (OR, 2.303 [95% CI, 1.508-3.517, P < 0.001]) were independent risk factors for de novo infection. 28-day mortality was 25.3%, 60.2%, 55.0% and 72.1% in the 4-groups respectively. Age, INR and creatinine were independently predictive of mortality. The presence of overt HE, infection, coagulation, kidney, circulatory, respiratory and liver failures were significantly associated with higher mortality. Conclusion OHE is an independent risk factor for de novo infection in cirrhotic patients with AD.

AB  - Objective: Various studies have depicted the incidence of glove perforations during open (OS) and minimally invasive surgeries (MIS). The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the incidence of macroscopic and microscopic glove perforations during MIS and OS. Methods: The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE) were systematically searched for comparative studies depicting the glove perforation rates during MIS and OS. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for both the outcomes (dichotomous) and the Mantel-Haenszel method was utilized for the estimation of pooled RR. The methodological quality assessment was performed by two independent investigators using the Downs and Black scale. The main outcomes of the study were the proportion of gloves with gross (macroscopic) perforations and the proportion of gloves with microscopic perforations. Results: Four comparative studies including a total of 1428 gloves (435 from the MIS group) were included. Pooling the data demonstrated no difference in the incidence of macroscopic glove perforations among the MIS and OS groups (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.54, p = 0.27). On the other hand, the incidence of microscopic perforations was significantly higher in the OS group versus the MIS group (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95, p = 0.02). However, all the studies had a moderate risk of bias. Conclusions: When compared to OS, the macroscopic glove perforation rate during MIS showed no significant difference. The incidence of microscopic glove perforations was significantly higher during OS as compared to MIS. However, due to the moderate risk of bias of the available comparative studies, the level of evidence of these studies is limited.

AB  - Objective
   This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to define the current evidence and systematically summarize the relevant data regarding the utility and safety of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) as an adjunctive treatment in complicated reoperative cases of hypospadias.
   Method
   The authors systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases on August 5, 2021. Patients were divided into two groups, i.e. HBOT and non-HBOT. The main outcomes were graft failure rate and the incidence of complications following urethroplasty. The proportion of patients developing adverse events due to HBOT was the secondary outcome. The pooled risk ratio and heterogeneity were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the I-2 statistics respectively. The quality assessment of the included studies was performed using the Downs and Black scale.
   Result
   Four studies constituting 176 patients (101 in the HBOT group) were included (Figure). Variations were observed among these studies in terms of the age of participants, the number and types of previous operations performed, and the protocol of administration of HBOT. The graft failure rate (RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.05-0.73, p Z 0.02) and the incidence of complications (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.77, p Z 0.007) were significantly low in the HBOT versus the nonHBOT group. Apart from myringotomy insertion (n = 10; 9.9%) and claustrophobia (n = 1), no other adverse events were associated with HBOT. All studies had a moderate risk of bias. An almost perfect agreement (kappa = 0.956, p < 0.0001) was observed between the two investigators assessing the risk of bias.
   Conclusion
   The present systematic review and meta-analysis significantly favor the administration of HBOT versus no HBOT in terms of graft failure rate and incidence of complications following urethroplasty. The available data also highlights the safety of HBOT in complicated cases of hypospadias. However, well-designed randomized controlled trials need to be conducted for an optimal comparison between the two treatment groups.

KW  - STATEMENT
AB  - India has a high share in the global burden of chronic terminal illnesses. However, there is a lack of a uniform system in providing better end-of-life care (EOLC) for large patients in their terminal stage of life. Institutional policies can be a good alternative as there is no national level policy for EOLC. This article describes the important aspects of the EOLC policy at one of the tertiary care institutes of India. A 15 member institutional committee including representatives from various departments was formed to develop this institutional policy. This policy document is aimed at helping to recognize the potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatments and provide transparency and accountability of the process of limitation of treatment through proper documentation that closely reflects the Indian legal viewpoint on this matter. Four steps are proposed in this direction: (i) recognition of a potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatment by the physicians, (ii) consensus among all the caregivers on a potentially non-beneficial or harmful treatment and initiation of the best supportive care pathway, (iii) initiation of EOLC pathways, and (iv) symptom management and ongoing supportive care till death. The article also focuses on the step-by-step process of formulation of this institutional policy, so that it can work as a blueprint for other institutions of our country to identify the infrastructural needs and resources and to formulate their own policies.

AB  - Biochemical recurrence (BCR) is a clinical challenge in prostate cancer (PCa) patients, as recurrence localization guides subsequent therapies. The use of PET with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) provides better accuracy than conventional imaging practice. This prospective, multicenter, international study was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical impact of PSMA PET/CT for evaluating BCR in PCa patients in a worldwide scenario. Methods: Patients were recruited from 17 centers in 15 countries. Inclusion criteria were histopathologically proven prostate adenocarcinoma, previous primary treatment, clinically established BCR, and negative conventional imaging (CT plus bone scintigraphy) and MRI results for patients with PSA levels of 4-10 ng/mL. All patients underwent PET/CT scanning with Ga-68-PSMA-11. Images and data were centrally reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the independent predictors of PSMA-positive results. Variables were selected for this regression model on the basis of significant associations in the univariate analysis and previous clinical knowledge: Gleason score, the PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and primary treatment strategy. All patients were monitored for a minimum of 6 mo. Results: From a total of 1,004 patients, 77.7% were treated initially with radical prostatectomy and 22.3% were treated with radiotherapy. Overall, 65.1% had positive PSMA PET/CT results. PSMA PET/CT positivity was correlated with the Gleason score, PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and radiotherapy as the primary treatment (P < 0.001). Treatment was modified on the basis of PSMA PET/CT results in 56.8% of patients. PSMA PET/CT positivity rates were consistent and not statistically different among countries with different incomes. Conclusion: This multicenter, international, prospective trial of PSMA PET/CT confirmed its capability for detecting local and metastatic recurrence in most PCa patients in the setting of BCR. PSMA PET/CT positivity was correlated with the Gleason score, PSA level at the time of the PET scan, PSA doubling time, and radiotherapy as the primary treatment. PSMA PET/CT results led to changes in therapeutic management in more than half of the cohort. The study demonstrated the reliability and worldwide feasibility of PSMA PET/CT in the workup of PCa with BCR.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to understand middle-aged perimenopausal women's perspectives and beliefs regarding their body weight status, and evaluate the barriers, and facilitators associated weight loss.
   Methods: Five focus group discussions were conducted with perimenopausal women (aged 40-55 y) who were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling. Discussions were conducted to understand their experiences related to weightmanagement during the perimenopausal period. The discussions were audio-recorded and transcribed and data analysis was done using Atlas.ti software to generate codes, subthemes, and themes from the discussions.
   Results: A total of 23 women with a mean age of 46.6 +/- 5.6 years were recruited. Several themes of risk factors of weight gain emerged like difficulty in physical activity, unhealthy eating, overeating, and religious and cultural practices. Appearance and prevention of health-related issues emerged as motivators of initiating weight loss. Barriers faced during weight loss included themes like difficulty in managing diet and activity, stress, socialization, and lack of time. Facilitators of weight loss included intrinsic motivation, experiencing early results and confidence in self-regulation.
   Conclusion: Women during their perimenopausal phase of life encounter a range of barriers and challenges related to weight loss. An understanding of these barriers might be useful to consider while planning strategies to regulate their weight.

AB  - Background The reference cut-offs for overweight and obesity have evolved from the use of International obesity task force (IOTF) to extended IOTF and revised Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) growth charts. Methods Secondary analysis of anthropometric data of school-going children from Delhi in the year 2008, 2013 and 2015 was performed. The proportions of children with overweight, obesity, and undernutrition were checked for agreement using different diagnostic cutoffs, and compared at three-time points. Results Among 8417 adolescents, weighted Kappa statistics showed good agreement between extended IOTF and IAP cutoffs (k=0.933; 95% CI 0.93-0.94), between eIOTF and IOTF (k=0.624; 95% CI 0.619-0.629) and between IAP and IOTF (k=0.654; 95% CI 0.645-0.662). A higher proportion of adolescents were diagnosed with obesity with extended IOTF and IAP charts than IOTF charts (P<0.001 for both genders). The mean (SD) BMI showed a rising trend for adolescents overall from 19.61 (3.89) kg/m(2) in 2008, 20.44 (4.37) kg/m(2) in 2013 and 20.88 (4.60) kg/m(2) in 2015 (P<0.001). 158 adolescent (97 girls) were undernourished using combined IAP and extended IOTF criteria. Conclusion Both extended IOTF and IAP charts showed good agreement for diagnosing overweight and obesity in adolescents. A secular trend in malnutrition was observed in adolescent girls.

AB  - (1) Objective-Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (IOMRI) guided surgery has revolutionized neurosurgery and has especially impacted the field of Neuro-Oncology, with randomized controlled trails demonstrating improved resection, fewer postoperative deficits and enhanced survival rates. Bibliometric analysis allows for analysing chronological trends and measuring the impact and directions of research in a particular field. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first Bibliometric analysis conducted on IOMRI. (2) Methods-a title specific search of the Web of Science database was executed using the keywords 'intraoperative MRI', 'intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging', and "IOMRI' on 23rd April 2021. Results-663 articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. In addition, the 100 most cited were analysed as well. Among these 100 articles, 76 were original research papers, while 14 others were review articles. Amongst all the authors, Ganslandt contributed the maximum number of articles, with USA being the largest single source of these articles, followed by Germany. Interestingly, a shift of trends from "Image guided surgery' and 'accuracy' in the early 2000s to 'extent of resection', 'impact', and 'survival' in the later years was noted. (3) Conclusions-IOMRI has now become an integral part of neurosurgery, especially in neuro-oncology. Focus has now shifted from implementation to refinement of technique in the form of functional and oncological outcomes. Therefore, future research in this direction is imperative and will be of more impact that in any other sub-field related to IOMRI.

AB  - Diagnostic tests are evolving with betterment of technology, quest for patient safety with less invasive medicine, and evolution of new diseases. It is important to assess diagnostic accuracy of a new test, and clinical impact of introduction of new test on outcomes and cost. A diagnostic study is planned for the index test based on place of new test in diagnostic pathway (screening, triage, diagnostic or add-on test) and established information of the test. A reference standard is used to classify population into diseased and healthy, and the discriminating ability of index test is measured. A sample size is calculated for expected sensitivity/specificity, margin of error and prevalence of disease in population. For dichotomous outcomes, sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratio are used to describe diagnostic accuracy. Efforts should be made to avoid common forms of bias including spectrum bias and partial verification bias, and blinding of observers should preferably be done.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, and despite many difficulties, significant progress has been made to advance child and adolescent tuberculosis (TB) care. Despite increasing availability of safe and effective treatment and prevention options, TB remains a global health priority as a major cause of child and adolescent morbidity and mortality-over one and a half million children and adolescents develop TB each year. A history of the global public health perspective on child and adolescent TB is followed by 12 narratives detailing challenges and progress in 19 TB endemic low and middle-income countries. Overarching challenges include: under-detection and under-reporting of child and adolescent TB; poor implementation and reporting of contact investigation and TB preventive treatment services; the need for health systems strengthening to deliver effective, decentralized services; and lack of integration between TB programs and child health services. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant negative impact on case detection and treatment outcomes. Child and adolescent TB working groups can address country-specific challenges to close the policy-practice gaps by developing and supporting decentral ized models of care, strengthening clinical and laboratory diagnosis, including of multidrug-resistant TB, providing recommended options for treatment of disease and infection, and forging strong collaborations across relevant health sectors.

AB  - Background & objectives: Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G plays a vital role in immunomodulation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The mounting evidence suggests a link between HLA-G gene polymorphisms, disease susceptibility and methotrexate treatment response. Various environmental factors influence the onset and progression of RA and its treatment outcomes. The aim is to identify the treatment response of HLA-G 3' untranslated region polymorphisms to yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI). Methods: In this eight-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2017/05/008589), patients with RA (n=140) were randomized into two groups namely, yoga group or non-yoga group. Baseline genomic DNA was isolated using salting-out method. PCR-based methods were used for genotyping. The levels of soluble (s) HLA-G and disease activity were assessed by ELISA and disease activity score-28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), respectively, at baseline (day 0) and after eight weeks of intervention. Results: Low-producing sHLA-G genotypes, i.e. +3142GG and 14 bp ins/ins, showed a significant increase in sHLA-G levels after YBLI. The association analysis between HLA-G polymorphisms and treatment for RA showed no considerable differential treatment remission in either of the groups (P > 0.05). The percentages of improvement were higher in the yoga group as compared to the non-yoga group in both the HLA-G +3142G > C and 14 bp ins/del polymorphisms irrespective of their respective genotypes. No significant association was found between sHLA-G levels and disease activity with respect to genotypes. Interpretation & conclusions: Yoga intervention results in improvement and reduced severity of RA in patients irrespective of the HLA-G 14 bp ins/del or +3142G > C polymorphisms. YBLI may be used as an adjunct therapy in RA independent of the genotypes.

AB  - Justification The emerging literature on prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in India, prevention and treatment strategies of rickets, and extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D suggest the need for revising the existing guidelines for prevention and treatment of vitamin D deficiency in India. Objectives To review the emerging literature on vitamin D prevalence and need for universal vitamin D supplementation. To suggest optimum vitamin D therapy for treatment of asymptomatic and symptomatic vitamin D deficiency, and rickets. To evaluate the extra-skeletal health benefits of vitamin D in children. Process A National consultative committee was formed that comprised of clinicians, epidemiologists, endocrinologists, and nutritionists. The Committee conducted deliberations on different aspects of vitamin D deficiency and rickets through ten online meetings between March and September, 2021. A draft guideline was formulated, which was reviewed and approved by all Committee members. Recommendations The group reiterates the serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D cutoffs proposed for vitamin D deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency as <12 ng/mL, 12-20 ng/mL and >20 ng/mL, respectively. Vitamin D toxicity is defined as serum 25OHD >100 ng/mL with hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria. Vitamin D supplementation in doses of 400 IU/day is recommended during infancy; however, the estimated average requirement in older children and adolescents (400-600 IU/day, respectively) should be met from diet and natural sources like sunlight. Rickets and vitamin D deficiency should be treated with oral cholecalciferol, preferably in a daily dosing schedule (2000 IU below 1 year of age and 3000 IU in older children) for 12 weeks. If compliance to daily dosing cannot be ensured, intermittent regimens may be prescribed for children above 6 months of age. Universal vitamin D supplementation is not recommended in childhood pneumonia, diarrhea, tuberculosis, HIV and non-infectious conditions like asthma, atopic dermatitis, and developmental disorders. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level of >20 ng/mL should be maintained in children with conditions at high-risk for vitamin deficiency, like nephrotic syndrome, chronic liver disease, chronic renal failure, and intake of anticonvulsants or glucocorticoids.

KW  - mesenchymal stromal cells
AB  - Human bone marrow (BM) has been highlighted as a promising source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) containing various growth factors and cytokines that can be potentially utilized in regenerative procedures involving cartilage and bone. However, the proportion of MSCs in the nucleated cell population of BM is only around 0.001% to 0.01% thereby making the harvesting and processing technique crucial for obtaining optimal results upon its use in various regenerative processes. Although several studies in the literature have given encouraging results on the utility of BM aspiration concentrate (BMAC) in various regenerative procedures, there is a lack of consensus concerning the harvesting variables such as choice of anesthetic agent to be used, site of harvest, size of the syringe to be used, anticoagulant of choice, and processing variables such as centrifugation time, and speed. In this review article, we aim to discuss the variables in the harvesting and processing technique of BMAC and their impact on the yield of MSCs in the final concentrate obtained from them.

The MOAN (musculo-osteo-arthro-neuropathic) syndrome highlights the close relationship between these four organ-systems, and their contribution to each other's health and disease. The mnemonic MOAN also underscores the discomfort and pain associated with the condition and encourages health professionals to address these patients in a holistic manner, rather than just addressing one of the components.

AB  - Preterm babies with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) can become blind if they do not receive appropriate timely intervention. The presence of cataract in these individuals in addition to visual deprivation amblyopia, also delays proper screening, adequate treatment, and makes follow-up assessment difficult. Anatomical differences in these infants and amblyopia management, especially in unilateral cataract, are other important concerns, and hence, management of these cases with cataract and ROP is challenging. In this review, studies where ROP cases were associated with cataract, were evaluated with a focus on preterm individuals less than 6 months age. Preterm babies are at increased risk of developing cataract because of systemic factors. In addition, those with ROP may have cataract associated with retinal detachment or treatment received. The type of cataract, risk factors, and pathophysiology associated with each cause varies. This review highlights these different aspects of cataract in ROP including causes, pathophysiology, types of cataracts, and management. The management of these cases is critical in terms of the timing of cataract surgery and the challenges associated with surgery and posterior segment management for ROP. Anatomical differences, preoperative retina status, pupillary dilatation, neovascularization of iris in aggressive posterior ROP, fundus examination, amblyopia, and follow-up are various important aspects in the management of the same. The preoperative workup, intraoperative challenges, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in these individuals are discussed.

The presence of cataract in these individuals in addition to visual deprivation amblyopia, also delays proper screening, adequate treatment, and makes follow-up assessment difficult. Anatomical differences in these infants and amblyopia management, especially in unilateral cataract, are other important concerns, and hence, management of these cases with cataract and ROP is challenging. In this review, studies where ROP cases were associated with cataract, were evaluated with a focus on preterm individuals less than 6 months age. Preterm babies are at increased risk of developing cataract because of systemic factors. In addition, those with ROP may have cataract associated with retinal detachment or treatment received. The type of cataract, risk factors, and pathophysiology associated with each cause varies. This review highlights these different aspects of cataract in ROP including causes, pathophysiology, types of cataracts, and management. The management of these cases is critical in terms of the timing of cataract surgery and the challenges associated with surgery and posterior segment management for ROP. Anatomical differences, preoperative retina status, pupillary dilatation, neovascularization of iris in aggressive posterior ROP, fundus examination, amblyopia, and follow-up are various important aspects in the management of the same. The preoperative workup, intraoperative challenges, postoperative care, and rehabilitation in these individuals are discussed.

AB  - Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important regulatory role and serve as biomarkers in various human cancers. However, their role in the prognosis and predicting response to therapy in Indian lung cancer patients is not fully explored. Methods: We collected surgically resected tumors and paired adjacent normal lung tissues from 29 early-stage and tissue biopsies from 103 locally advanced and metastatic lung cancer patients in this prospective study. We quantified the expression levels of miR-375-3p, miR-197-3p, and miR-15a-5p using TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays. We correlated miRNAs expression with response to therapy and survival outcomes. Results: The median age of lung cancer patients was 60 years. We found significant overexpression of miR-375-3p and miR-197-3p in the tumors compared to paired normal lung tissues. Higher expression of miR-375-3p was observed more frequently in responders compared to nonresponders. The expression of miR-375-3p and miR-197-3p was able to differentiate patients of lung adenocarcinoma from lung squamous cell carcinoma. We did not find any correlation between miRNAs expression and survival outcomes. Conclusion: Overexpression of miR-375-3p and miR-197-3p might contribute to lung carcinogenesis. The expression of miR-375-3p may assist in predicting therapeutic response. More prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the potential of miR-375-3p as a predictive biomarker of response to therapy.

AB  - Cellular membrane-derived nanoparticles, particularly of red blood cells (RBCs), represent an emerging class of drug delivery systems. The lack of nucleus and organelles in these cells makes them easy to process and empty out intracellular contents. The empty vesicle membranes can then be either used as a coating on nanoparticles or can be reassembled into a nanovesicle. Engineered RBCs membrane has unique ability to retain its lipid bilayer architecture with host's proteins during top-down approach, thus allowing it to form stable nanoformulations mimicking RBCs stealth properties. In addition, its core-shell structure allows loading of different drug molecules, and its surface chemistry can be manipulated by facile conjugation with ligands on the shell. The remarkable ability of RBCs membrane to fuse with membranes of other cells enables the formation of hybrid nanovesicles. In this review, we highlight the biomedical applications of such vesicles and discuss the potential challenges related to its clinical translation. Although nano-RBCs retain much of the host's proteins, which may give an edge over synthetic nanoparticles in terms of lower immunogenicity, its production at industrial level is more challenging. This review gives the critical analysis of barriers involved in the translation of RBCs-derived nanoparticles from preclinical to clinical level.

AB  - PurposeCancer patients and their caregivers are overwhelmed with features of uncertainty, fear, shock, worry, anxiety, sadness, and grief. To add on to their misery, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely afflicted the cancer care delivery. The study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers and to formulate strategies for oncological setups to overcome those challenges.MethodsAfter obtaining institutional ethical clearance, a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to observe the challenges faced by patients and their caregivers at the level of various domains (physical, logistic, psychological, socioeconomic, and spiritual) who visited the outpatient and inpatient department of cancer pain and palliative care unit. The results were expressed in absolute numbers.ResultsMajor challenges encountered were suffering from physical symptoms like pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea (90%), postponement of cancer treatment (80%), fear of contracting COVID infection due to hospital visit (93.5%), lack of accommodation (70%), and lack of spiritual clarity and hope (50%).ConclusionsMajor challenges faced by patients were in physical and psychological domains, and those by caregivers were in socioeconomic domains and handling physical symptoms of their patients. It is imperative to recognize and be cognizant of the challenges faced by cancer patients and their caregivers. Health care setups should formulate strategies to alleviate these challenges and provide holistic care to cancer patients. These strategies will hold in good stead for future pandemics also.

AB  - Background Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a major threat to human health around the world. Previous publications have estimated the effect of AMR on incidence, deaths, hospital length of stay, and health-care costs for specific pathogen-drug combinations in select locations. To our knowledge, this study presents the most comprehensive estimates of AMR burden to date.
   Methods We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to and associated with bacterial AMR for 23 pathogens and 88 pathogen-drug combinations in 204 countries and territories in 2019. We obtained data from systematic literature reviews, hospital systems, surveillance systems, and other sources, covering 471 million individual records or isolates and 7585 study-location-years. We used predictive statistical modelling to produce estimates of AMR burden for all locations, including for locations with no data. Our approach can be divided into five broad components: number of deaths where infection played a role, proportion of infectious deaths attributable to a given infectious syndrome, proportion of infectious syndrome deaths attributable to a given pathogen, the percentage of a given pathogen resistant to an antibiotic of interest, and the excess risk of death or duration of an infection associated with this resistance. Using these components, we estimated disease burden based on two counterfactuals: deaths attributable to AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by drug-susceptible infections), and deaths associated with AMR (based on an alternative scenario in which all drug-resistant infections were replaced by no infection). We generated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for final estimates as the 25th and 975th ordered values across 1000 posterior draws, and models were cross-validated for out-of-sample predictive validity. We present final estimates aggregated to the global and regional level.
   Findings On the basis of our predictive statistical models, there were an estimated 4.95 million (3.62-6.57) deaths associated with bacterial AMR in 2019, including 1.27 million (95% UI 0.911-1.71) deaths attributable to bacterial AMR. At the regional level, we estimated the all-age death rate attributable to resistance to be highest in western subSaharan Africa, at 27.3 deaths per 100 000 (20.9-35.3), and lowest in Australasia, at 6.5 deaths (4.3-9.4) per 100 000. Lower respiratory infections accounted for more than 1.5 million deaths associated with resistance in 2019, making it the most burdensome infectious syndrome. The six leading pathogens for deaths associated with resistance (Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were responsible for 929 000 (660 000-1 270 000) deaths attributable to AMR and 3.57 million (2.62-4.78) deaths associated with AMR in 2019. One pathogen-drug combination, meticillin-resistant S aureus, caused more than 100 000 deaths attributable to AMR in 2019, while six more each caused 50 000-100 000 deaths: multidrug-resistant excluding extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant A baumannii, fluoroquinolone-resistant E coli, carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae, and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K pneumoniae.
   Interpretation To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive assessment of the global burden of AMR, as well as an evaluation of the availability of data. AMR is a leading cause of death around the world, with the highest burdens in low-resource settings. Understanding the burden of AMR and the leading pathogen-drug combinations contributing to it is crucial to making informed and location-specific policy decisions, particularly about infection prevention and control programmes, access to essential antibiotics, and research and development of new vaccines and antibiotics. There are serious data gaps in many low-income settings, emphasising the need to expand microbiology laboratory capacity and data collection systems to improve our understanding of this important human health threat.

AB  - We report the ocular features of the tongue sole, Cynoglossus bilineatus (Lacepede, 1802), a marine, bottom-dwelling flatfish. In this species, both eyes are located juxtaposed on the same side of the flat head. Histology revealed the sclera to be fibrous (collagenous) in nature. The choroid possesses the choriocapillaris, and adjacent to it, 3-4 rows of iridophores with stacks of cytoplasmic platelets. No choroidal gland is present. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) contains scanty melanin granules. Its vitread half is modified into a dense tapetum with lipid spheres (about 0.34 mu m in diameter). In juveniles, the tapetal spheres arise by budding from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the RPE. There are blood vessels within the retina; the vitreal vessels penetrate the retina and ramify close to the level of the outer limiting membrane. The vessels are capillaries in nature. The photoreceptor layer contains abundant rods, and twin cones and single cones, being arranged into square mosaics. The optic disc is non-pleated and shows pan- cytokeratin immunopositivity, which is related to the bundled cytokeratin filaments detected in astrocytes by electron microscopy. The retinal tapetum and choroidal iridophores help the species to live in a muddy bottom having dim-light environment. The lack of a choroidal gland, hypoxic aquatic condition and presence of a dense retinal tapetum (that limits O-2 transport to the photoreceptors) appear to have favored the proliferation of vitreal vessels within the retina in this species. The fibrous sclera has probably arisen to provide structural support to the eye in migration from the lateral to the dorsal aspect of the head during larval metamorphosis.

AB  - Objective. Different sleep stages exert differential effects on interictal discharges, neural synchrony and seizure threshold. We sought to assess the relationship between localization of the epileptogenic focus and seizure distribution in sleep versus wakefulness among patients with refractory epilepsy. Methods. We conducted a retrospective chart review-based study. Video-electroencephalography of patients with refractory epilepsy, planned for resective surgery, were reviewed for seizure localisation and occurrence relative to stage of sleep/wakefulness. Demographic/clinical data, including details of surgery, were also recorded. Bivariate analysis was conducted using the chi-square test for proportions and unpaired t-test/ANOVA to compare the means within groups. Results. We enrolled 175 patients (107 males) with a mean age of 26.1 +/- 9.8 years (range: 4-53 years). We analysed 1,282 seizures, of which 916 (71.5%) were temporal, 95 (7.4%) frontal, 144 (11.2 %) central/ parietal and 19 (1.5%) arose from the occipital lobe. Temporal lobe onset seizures were more frequent during wakefulness (77.7%) compared to extra-temporal localization (65%) (p<0.0001). Amongst temporal lobe onset seizures, those during wakefulness arose more frequently from the lateral temporal (88.6%) compared to the mesial temporal lobe (75.5%) (p=0.0003). A higher proportion of seizures evolved into secondary generalisation during sleep (23.5%) versus 8.7% during wakefulness (p<0.0001). Significance. Our study demonstrates that lobar location of epileptogenic foci is associated with a predilection of seizures to occur, as well as secondarily generalise, during sleep/wakefulness. Seizures with lateral temporal lobe as well as extratemporal lobe onset were more likely to occur during wakefulness. Overall, sleep related seizures were more likely to be of extratemporal lobe onset, though.

AB  - Stroke, affecting approximately 15 million people worldwide, has long been a global cause of death and disability. Virtual Reality (VR) has shown its potential as an assistive tool for post-stroke rehabilitation. The objective of this pilot study was to define the task-specific performance metrics of VR tasks to assess the performance level of healthy subjects and patients quantitatively and to obtain their feedback for improving the developed framework. A pilot prospective study was designed. We tested the designed VR tasks on forty healthy right-handed subjects to evaluate its potential. Qualitative trajectory plots and three quantitative performance metrics-time taken to complete the task, percentage relative error, and trajectory smoothness-were computed from the recorded data of forty healthy subjects. Two patients with stroke were also enrolled to compare their performance with healthy subjects. Each participant received one VR session of 90 min. No adverse effects were noticed throughout the study. Performance metrics obtained from healthy subjects were used as a reference for patients. Relatively higher values of task completion time and trajectory smoothness and lower values of relative % error was observed for the affected hands w.r.t the unaffected hands of both the patients. For the unaffected hands of both the patients, the performance levels were found objectively closer to that of healthy subjects. A library of VR tasks for wrist and fingers were designed, and task-specific performance metrics were defined in this study. The evaluation of the VR exercises using these performance metrics will help the clinicians to assess the patient's progress quantitatively and to design the rehabilitation framework for a future clinical study.

AB  - Objectives Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, behavioural interventions to reduce disease transmission have been central to public health policy worldwide. Sustaining individual protective behaviour is especially important in low-income and middle-income settings, where health systems have fewer resources and access to vaccination is limited. This study seeks to assess time trends in COVID-19 protective behaviour in India. Design Nationally representative, panel-based, longitudinal study. Setting We conducted a panel survey of Indian households to understand how the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviours has changed over time. Our data span peaks and valleys of disease transmission over May-December 2020. Participants Respondents included 3719 adults from 1766 Indian households enrolled in the Harmonised Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia for the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India. Analysis We used ordinary least squares regression analysis to quantify time trends in protective behaviours. Results We find a 30.6 percentage point (95% CI (26.7 to 34.5); p<0.01) decline in protective behaviours related to social distancing over the observation period. Mask wearing and handwashing, in contrast, decreased by only 4.3 percentage points (95% CI (0.97 to 7.6); p<0.05) from a high base. Our conclusions are unchanged after adjusting for recorded COVID-19 caseload and nationwide COVID-19 containment policy; we also observe significant declines across socioeconomic strata spanning age, gender, education and urbanicity. Conclusion We argue that these changes reflect, at least in part, 'COVID-19 fatigue,' where adherence to social distancing becomes more difficult over time irrespective of the surrounding disease environment.

AB  - Background :This video shows the dreaded complication of expulsive suprachoroidal haemorrhage in a penetrating keratoplasty . It teaches the various measures that help in preventing and managing the challenge peri-operatively. Purpose:This video is intended to sensitize the corneal surgeons about this rare complication using real-time surgical video and prepare them to face this challenge by demonstrating the preventive and mitigating strategies. Synopsis:A patient who was suitably taken up for an autokeratoplasty had expulsive choroidal haemorrhage in the non-seeing eye. This complication was managed using glycerin-preserved donor corneal button. Further, the video discusses various pre-operative and intra-operative optimizations to avoid such a complication and mitigate the damage caused by it, should it ever happen during a surgery. Highlights:Expulsive choroidal haemorrhage can be a traumatizing event and one must be mentally prepared to manage it. Pre-operative high-risk factors should always be managed and intra-operative maneuvers performed to prevent the complication, as shown in the video. Video link: https://youtu.be/s_ImBugPELw

AB  - Background There is limited data from India regarding medical management of congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI). Objective To study the molecular diagnosis, medical management and outcomes of children with CHI. Study design Ambispective. Participants Children with CHI admitted in from December, 2011 till March, 2020 at a tertiary care referral hospital. Outcomes Clinical and genetic profile, treatment, and response Results 42 children with a median age of 3 days (range 1 day to 6 years) were enrolled, of which 23 (54.7%) were diazoxide-responsive. Mutations were identified in 28 out of 41 (68.2%) patients. The commonest gene affected was ABCC8 in 22 patients. The pathogenic variant c.331G>A in ABCC8 gene was identified in 6 unrelated cases from one community. Good response to daily octreotide was seen in 13 of the 19 (68.4%) diazoxide-unresponsive patients. Monthly long-acting octreotide was initiated and daily octreotide could be stopped or tapered in 9 patients. Sirolimus was tried with variable response in 6 patients but was discontinued in 5 due to adverse effects. Four patients had focal CHI, of which one underwent partial pancreatic resection. The disease severity reduced with age and neurodevelopment was good in the patients with identifiable genetic defects who were optimally managed. Conclusions Medical management of CHI is effective, if compliance can be ensured, with good quality of life and neurological outcomes.

AB  - Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) mediate oxidative degradation of plant polysaccharides. The genes encoding LPMOs are most commonly arranged with one catalytic domain, while a few are found tethered to additional noncatalytic units, i.e., cellulase linker and carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The presence of CBM is known to facilitate catalysis by directing the enzymes toward cellulosic polymer, while the role of linkers is poorly understood. Based on limited experimental evidence, linkers are believed to serve merely as flexible spacers between the structured domains. Thus, this study aims to unravel the role of the linker regions present in LPMO sequences. For this, we analyzed the genome of Botrytis cinerea and found 9 genes encoding cellulose lytic monooxygenases (AA9 family), of which BcAA9C was overexpressed in cellulose-inducible conditions. We designed variants of fl(LPMO) (full-length enzyme) with truncation of either linker or CBM to examine the role of linker in activity, binding, and thermal stability of the associated monooxygenase. Biochemical assays predicted that the deletion of linker does not impact the potential of fl(LPMO) for catalyzing the oxidation of Amplex Red, but that it does have a major influence on the capability of fl(LPMO) to degrade recalcitrant polysaccharide substrate. Langmuir isotherm and SEM analysis demonstrated that linker domain aids in polysaccharide binding during fl(LPMO)-mediated deconstruction of plant cell wall. Interestingly, linker domain was also found to contribute toward the thermostability of fl(LPMO). Overall, our study reveals that linker is not merely a spacer, but plays a key role in LPMO-mediated biomass fibrillation; these findings are broadly applicable to other polysaccharide-degrading enzymes.
   IMPORTANCE The polysaccharide-disintegrating carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are often found with multimodular architecture, where the catalytic domain is connected to an accessory CBM domain with the help of a flexible linker region. So far, the linker has been understood merely as a flexible spacer between the two domains. Therefore, the current study is designed to determine the role of linker in polysaccharide fibrillation. To conceive this study, we have selected LPMO as a model enzyme, as it is not only an industrially relevant enzyme but it also harbors a catalytic domain, linker region, and CBM domain. The present study highlighted the crucial and indispensable role of the linker region in mediating polysaccharide disintegration. Considering its role in binding, thermostability, and activity toward polysaccharide substrate, we propose linker as a potential candidate for future CAZyme engineering.

AB  - Glioblastoma is the most life-threatening tumor of the central nervous system. Despite recent therapeutic advancements, maximum survival of glioblastoma patients remains dismal. The mediator complex is a set of proteins, essential for eukaryotic gene expression. Abnormal expression/mutations of specific mediator genes have been associated with progression of various cancers, however, its role and status in glioblastoma remains largely unknown. Our work shows overexpression of a subunit of kinase assembly of mediator complex, MED12, in various glioblastoma patient cohorts including Indian glioblastoma patients and cell lines. Functional characterization of MED12 using both overexpression and knockdown approach revealed that it promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and inhibits apoptosis. Transcriptome analysis post MED12 knockdown revealed Vitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway to be one of the key pathways affected by MED12 in glioblastoma. We studied direct interaction of MED12 with VDR protein using docking studies and co-immunoprecipitation assay. We identify BCL6, a secondary regulator of VDR signaling, to be directly regulated by MED12 through a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation, qRT-PCR and western analyses. We further show that MED12 brings about the inhibition of p53 levels and apoptosis partly through induction of BCL6 in glioblastoma. Overall, this stands as the first report of MED12 over-expression and involvement in glioblastoma pathogenesis and identifies MED12 as an important mediator of VDR signaling and an attractive molecule for development of new therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Effective Dose of Prophylactic Oxytocin Infusion During Cesarean Delivery in 90% Population of Nonlaboring Patients With Preeclampsia Receiving Magnesium Sulfate Therapy and Normotensives: An Up-Down Sequential Allocation Dose-Response Study

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxytocin administration during cesarean delivery is the first-line therapy for the prevention of uterine atony. Patients with preeclampsia may receive magnesium sulfate, a drug with known tocolytic effects, for seizure prophylaxis. However, no study has evaluated the minimum effective dose of oxytocin during cesarean delivery in women with preeclampsia.
   METHODS: This study compared the effective dose in 90% population (ED90) of oxytocin infusion for achieving satisfactory uterine tone during cesarean delivery in nonlaboring patients with preeclampsia who were receiving magnesium sulfate treatment with a control group of normotensives who were not receiving magnesium sulfate. This prospective dual-arm dose-finding study was based on a 9:1 biased sequential allocation design. Oxytocin infusion was initiated at 13 IU/h, on clamping of the umbilical cord, in the first patient of each group. Uterine tone was graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory by the obstetrician at 4 minutes after initiation of oxytocin infusion. The dose of oxytocin infusion for subsequent patients was decided according to the response exhibited by the previous patient in the group; it was increased by 2 IU/h after unsatisfactory response or decreased by 2 IU/h or maintained at the same level after satisfactory response, in a ratio of 1:9. Oxytocin-associated side effects were also evaluated. Dose-response data for the groups were evaluated using a log-logistic function and ED90 estimates were derived from fitted equations using the delta method.
   RESULTS: The ED90 of oxytocin was significantly greater for the preeclampsia group (n = 27) than for the normotensive group (n = 40) (24.9 IU/h [95% confidence interval {CI}, 22.4-27.5] and 13.9 IU/h [95% CI, 12.4-15.5], respectively); the difference in dose requirement was 10.9 IU/h (95% CI, 7.9-14.0; P < .001). The number of patients with oxytocin-related hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure >20% from baseline or to <90 mm Hg, was significantly greater in the preeclampsia group (92.6% vs 62.5%; P = .030), while other side effects such as ST-T depression, nausea/vomiting, headache, and flushing, were not significantly different. There was no significant difference in the need for additional uterotonic or uterine massage, estimated blood loss, and need for re-exploration for uncontrolled bleeding.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with preeclampsia receiving preoperative magnesium therapy need a greater intraoperative dose of oxytocin to achieve satisfactory contraction of the uterus after fetal delivery, as compared to normotensives.

AB  - The use of Bisphenol-A (BPA) and its derivatives are rapidly increasing in dentistry for dental sealants and composite filling materials. The release of BPA from polymerized resin into saliva has aroused considerable concern regarding exposure to xenoestrogen by dental treatment. Many shreds of evidence have stated that leakage of BPA and its derivatives has posed health risks problems due to its endocrine-disrupting estrogenic properties. Various conventional techniques were designed for estimating leached BPA from dental sealants but having lengthy, complex procedures and requirements of technical experts, rapid utilization of these techniques is difficult. However, biosensors have emerged as a strong alternative to overcome these limitations. A vast range of electrochemical biosensors based on carbon and metal nanomaterials, molecularly-imprinted polymers, quantum dots, metal-organic frameworks, and polymer nanocomposites have been introduced for screening of BPA in real samples. But no study has been done to test leached BPA from dental sealants using biosensors. Therefore, we have provided an outlook of nanomaterials-based biosensors to test leached BPA from dental sealants. The present review also highlights different studies that assessed the absence/presence of BPA in the oral cavity after its use in dental materials. It also describes the challenges and future prospects in the progress of BPA-based biosensors.

AB  - Infectious endophthalmitis is a serious and vision-threatening complication of commonly performed intraocular surgeries such as cataract surgery. The occurrence of endophthalmitis can result in severe damage to the uveal and other ocular tissues even among patients undergoing an uncomplicated surgical procedure. If the infections result from common factors such as surgical supplies, operative or operation theater-related risks, there can be a cluster outbreak of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) or infectious endophthalmitis, leading to several patients having an undesirable outcome. Since prevention of intraocular infections is of paramount importance to ophthalmic surgeons, the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) has taken the lead in the formation of a National Task Force to help ophthalmic surgeons apply certain universal precautions in their clinical practice. The Task Force has prepared a handy checklist and evidence-based guidelines to minimize the risk of infectious endophthalmitis following cataract surgery.

AB  - Simple Summary Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a complex disease. A combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy is used to treat DLBCL at initial diagnosis. Additional treatments are available when DLBCL does not respond to initial treatment; however, for many patients, DLBCL will stop responding to treatment (relapse) or may not respond at all (refractory). Selinexor is a novel, oral medication that belongs to a class of drugs called selective inhibitors of nuclear export, and it works by killing cancer cells in patients with DLBCL that has relapsed after or is refractory to at least two treatments. When deciding on a course of treatment, it is useful for physicians to know which frequently described clinical characteristics of DLBCL affect the activity and tolerability of selinexor. We found that selinexor showed similar activity and tolerability across most of the frequently described clinical characteristics assessed. Selinexor, an oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export, was evaluated in the Phase 2b SADAL study in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who previously received two to five prior systemic regimens. In post hoc analyses, we analyzed several categories of patient characteristics (age, renal function, DLBCL subtype, absolute lymphocyte count, transplant status, number of prior lines of therapy, refractory status, Ann Arbor disease stage, and lactate dehydrogenase) at baseline, i.e., during screening procedures, to determine their potential contributions to the efficacy (overall response rate [ORR], duration of response [DOR], overall survival [OS]) and tolerability of selinexor. Across most categories of characteristics, no significant difference was observed in ORR or DOR. OS was significantly longer for patients < 65 vs. >= 65 years, and for those with lymphocyte counts >= 1000/mu L vs. < 1000/mu L or lactate dehydrogenase <= ULN vs. > ULN. The most common adverse events (AEs) across the characteristics were thrombocytopenia and nausea, and similar rates of grade 3 AEs and serious AEs were observed. With its oral administration, novel mechanism of action, and consistency in responses in heavily pretreated patients, selinexor may help to address an important unmet clinical need in the treatment of DLBCL.

AB  - Background: In the west, survival following treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) approaches 90%. Outcomes in India do not exceed 70%. To address this disparity, the Indian Collaborative Childhood Leukaemia group (ICiCLe) developed in 2013 a contemporary treatment protocol for uniform riskstratified management of first presentation ALL based on cytogenetics and minimal residual disease levels (MRD). A multicentre randomised clinical trial opened in 2016 (ICiCLe-ALL-14) and examines the benefit of randomised interventions to decrease toxicity and improve outcomes.
   Methods: Patients 1-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL are categorised into four risk groups based on presentation features, tumour genetics and treatment response. Standard risk includes young (< 10 years) B cell precursor ALL (BCPALL) patients with low presentation leucocyte count (< 50 x 10(9)/L) and no high-risk features. Intermediate risk includes BCP-ALL patients with no high-risk features but are older and have high presentation leucocyte counts and/or bulky disease. High risk includes BCP-ALL patients with any high-risk feature, including high-risk genetics, central nervous system leukaemia, poor prednisolone response at treatment day 8 and high MRD (>= 0.01%) at the end of induction. Patients with T-lineage ALL constitute the fourth risk group. All patients receive four intensive treatment blocks (induction, consolidation, interim maintenance, delayed intensification) followed by 96 weeks of maintenance. Treatment intensity varies by risk group. Clinical data management is based on a web-based remote data capture system. The first randomisation examines the toxicity impact of a shorter induction schedule of prednisolone (3 vs 5 weeks) in young nonhigh-risk BCP-ALL. The second randomisation examines the survival benefit of substituting doxorubicin with mitoxantrone in delayed intensification for all patients. Primary outcome measures include event-free survival (overall, by risk groups), sepsis rates in induction (first randomisation) and event-free survival rates following second randomisation.
   Discussion: ICiCLe-ALL-14 is the first multicentre randomised childhood cancer clinical trial in India. The pre-trial phase allowed standardisation of risk-stratification diagnostics and established the feasibility of collaborative practice, uniform treatment, patient enrolment and data capture. Pre-trial observations confirm the impact of risk-stratified therapy in reducing treatment-related deaths and costs. Uniform practice across centres allows patients to access care locally, potentially decreasing financial hardship and dislocation.

AB  - Background Conventional periacetabular pelvic resections are associated with poor functional outcomes. Resections through surgical corridors beyond the conventional margins may be helpful in retaining greater function without compromising the oncological margins. Methods The study included a retrospective review of 82 cases of pelvic resections for pelvic tumors. Outcomes of acetabulum preservation (Group A) were compared with complete acetabular resection (Group B). Also, we compared outcomes of Type I + half resections (Group 1) with Type I + II resections (Group 2), and Type III + half resections (Group 3) with Type II + III resections (Group 4). Results Group A (n = 44) had significantly better functional outcome than Group B (n = 38) with average MSTS93 score 22.3 versus 20.1 and average HHS 91.3 versus 82.5 (p < 0.001). Group 1 (n = 14) and Group 2 (n = 12) had similar functional outcomes (mean MSTS93 score 22.07 vs. 21.58 [p = 0.597] and mean HHS 90.37 vs. 86.51 [p = 0.205]). Group 3 (n = 11) had significantly better functional outcome than Group 4 (n = 17), with mean MSTS93 score 22.8 versus 19.7 (p < 0.001) and mean HHS 92.3 versus 80.1 (p < 0.001). Oncological outcomes were similar among the groups. Conclusion Transacetabular pelvic resections provide functional benefit over conventional resections without compromising oncological margins. There is a need to revisit and revise the pelvic resection planes.

AB  - Objective: To develop and test a brief Composite Intervention Module for Pre-adolescents with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (CIMPALL). Design: Single-center randomized controlled design. Setting: A tertiary care center of national importance Participants: A total of 36 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the maintenance phase of the treatment. Intervention: A five-session (540 min) brief, multidomain, audiovisually aided, therapist-facilitated conjoint intervention module for children with cancer and their parents. Main outcome measures: Standardized psychological tools for children including CBCL, CPSS (Child Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms Scale), PedsQol (Pediatric Quality of Life), and NIMHANS (National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences) neuropsychological battery and parents including PTSD CC (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Civilian Checklist), CHIP (Coping Health Inventory for Parents), CBS (Caregiver Burden Scale), and SRQ (Self-Reporting Questionnaire). Results: A total of 36 patients were randomized to an experimental or a control group. Over 80% agreement was observed on indices of expert evaluation; 100% of participants found the sessions to be helpful, useful, appropriate in terms of time, duration, and place, and interventionist. The participation rate in the sessions was 94% and the study flow was smooth; 97.3% eligible candidates agreed to participate. Furthermore, 100% agreement on performance of activities was observed and the attrition rate was 5.26%. Conclusion: This pilot study presents the CIMPALL, which to the best of our knowledge is the first of its kind in India. The data suggest that the CIMPALL intervention is feasibly delivered by a clinical psychologist and that the CIMPALL intervention has an impact on important psychosocial variables for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and their parents.

AB  - Introduction: Patellar fractures constitute almost 1% of total skeletal injuries. Existing common operative methods include the use of different types of Tension band wiring techniques like cannulated screws and K-wires. The Patellar plating construct is a relatively newer operative method for patellar fracture fixation with promising outcomes with fewer complications.
   Method: We conducted a pilot prospective study at our Apex Trauma center in twenty patients aged 18-65years with displaced patellar fractures, AO type A2, A3, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3. Fractures were fixed with low profile patellar plates (1.8 mm). Radiological and functional follow-up was done using X-rays, CT scans and BKS scoring (Bostman-Knee-Scale), Knee Society Score(KSS), and Tegner Lysholm knee scores respectively for two years.
   Result: Mean functional outcome scores at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 2 years was 25.5, 28.3, 29.05 and 29.9 for BKS; 64.62, 84.12, 90.6, and 97.5 for KSS; 73.75, 89.7,94.8, and 99.3 for Tegner Lysholm knee score respectively. Radiological union, confirmed by CT scan, was observed in all patients at 3 months. Two patients had superficial surgical site infection (SSI) at 2 weeks. Implant impingement was also found in 2 patients at 3 months. None of the patients had a failure of fixation at the end of the study.
   Conclusion: Patients with low profile patellar plate constructs have favorable clinical and radiological outcomes with minimal non-specific complications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Polymicrobial growth in standard urine culture: Time to Act or Ignore?
T2  - TROPICAL DOCTOR
AB  - Diagnosing Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) remains a clinical challenge. A monobacterial growth in standard urine culture is diagnostic while polymicrobial growth is usually considered as contaminants. However, in certain cases, true mixed infections may exist making it important to correctly identify the pathogens and streamline the therapy. Communication between the clinician and microbiologist is essential to establish the right diagnosis at right time. Here, we would like to share our experience about a polymicrobial UTI in a paediatric patient in which coordinated discussion between the clinical team and microbiologist was helpful for favourable outcome.

AB  - Background: Tuberculosis currently stands as the second leading cause of deaths worldwide due to single infectious agent after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The current challenges of drug resistance in tuberculosis highlight an urgent need to develop newer anti-mycobacterial compounds. In the present study, we report the serendipitous discovery of a bacterial laboratory contaminant (LC-1) exhibiting a zone of growth inhibition on an agar plate seeded with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
   Results: We utilized microbiological, biochemical and biophysical approaches to characterize LC-1 and anti-mycobacterial compound(s) in its secretome. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and BIOLOG analysis, LC-1 was identified as Staphylococcus hominis, a human bacterial commensal. Anti-mycobacterial activity was initially found in 30 kDa retentate that was obtained by ultrafiltration of culture filtrate (CF). SDS-PAGE analysis of peak fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography of 30 kDa retentate confirmed the presence of high molecular weight (>= 30 kDa) proteins. Peak fraction-1 (F-1) exhibited inhibitory activity against M. bovis BCG, but not against M. smegmatis, E. coli and S. aureus. The active fraction F-1 was inactivated by treatment with Proteinase K and alpha-chymotrypsin. However, it retained its anti-mycobacterial activity over a wide range of heat and pH treatment. The anti-mycobacterial activity of F-1 was found to be maintained even after a long storage (similar to 12 months) at -20 degrees C. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the identified peptide masses do not match with any previously known bacteriocins.
   Conclusions: The present study highlights the anti-mycobacterial activity of high molecular weight protein(s) present in culture filtrate of LC-1, which may be tested further to target M. tuberculosis. The heat and pH stability of these proteins add to their characteristics as therapeutic proteins and may contribute to their long shelf life. LC-1 being a human commensal can be tested in future for its potential as a probiotic to treat tuberculosis.

AB  - Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) constitute a high-risk group for COVID-19 with underlying chronic lung disease. COVID-19 severity varying from mild infection to need of intensive care has been described in children with CF. Two children with significant underlying pulmonary morbidity are described here, who developed severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Case 1 (a 9-y-old boy) had pneumonia with respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation support. He had delayed clearance of SARS-CoV-2, with recurrence of symptomatic disease with short asymptomatic period in between. He was also diagnosed with CF-related diabetes and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis during the second episode. Case 2 (an 18-mo-old boy) had two episodes of SARS-CoV-2-related severe lower respiratory infection within a period of 2 mo, requiring high-flow nasal oxygen support. Both children had 3 rd pulmonary exacerbation but SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in respiratory secretions. To conclude, children with CF with underlying pulmonary morbidity, can develop severe COVID-19 and prolonged SARS-CoV-2 shedding.

AB  - Background The pathogenesis of autoantibody generation in anti-factor H (FH) antibody associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is unknown and is perhaps triggered by an infectious or environmental agent. We observed an unusual increase of patients with anti-FH antibody associated aHUS coinciding with the second pandemic wave in New Delhi and suspected that SARS-CoV-2 infection might be a potential trigger.
   Methods We screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology in 13 consecutive patients with anti-FH antibody associated aHUS during the past year in New Delhi.
   Results We report 5 patients, 4-13 years old, who presented with a febrile illness without respiratory symptoms during the second pandemic wave. Of these, 3 patients presented with a relapse 25-85 months following the initial episode of aHUS. SARS-CoV-2 was detected by RT-PCR in 1 patient and by serology in 4 patients (median titer 47.1 cut-off index). Patients had high titers of anti-FH antibodies (median 2,300 AU/ml). Genetic studies, done in 3 of the 5 patients, showed homozygous CFHR1 deletion without other significant genetic abnormalities. Specific management comprised plasma exchanges and oral prednisolone, combined with either cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. At median followup of 3.3 months, the estimated glomerular filtration rate in 4 patients ranged from 62 to 110 ml/min/1.73 m(2) ; one patient was dialysis-dependent.
   Conclusion Increased vigilance is required during the pandemic, especially in patients with anti-FH associated aHUS, who might relapse despite quiescent disease for a prolonged period.

AB  - Various surgical risk assessment tools, including the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (R) (ACS NSQIP (R)) risk calculator, have been devised to predict postoperative mortality. However, the role of individual factors on mortality is unclear. We sought to identify patient characteristics from the database that were associated with postoperative mortality in patients undergoing elective, non-cardiac surgery. Data from the ACS NSQIP (R) database at a tertiary care academic medical center was analyzed from January 2011 to September 2016. Relevant patient-related variables were extracted from the database and univariable logistic regression was used to assess the association of each potential risk factor with 30-day mortality. A multivariable logistic regression model was then used to assess the adjusted effect of each potential risk factor on the outcome. A total of 5254 database patient records were identified and among the analyzed variables, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status III and IV (odds ratio and 95%CI: 16.75 [2.29, 122.69]), poor preoperative functional health status (odds ratio and 95%CI: 38.52 [2.46, 604.12]), and low serum albumin (odds ratio and 95%CI: 3.76 [1.35, 10.44]) were significant predictors of 30-day postoperative mortality. In a comprehensive analysis of the ACS NSQIP (R) database, spreading across multiple surgical specialties, we found an association between ASA physical status, preoperative albumin levels, and functional health status with 30-day mortality after elective non-cardiac surgery.

KW  - REPORTER
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB), including extrapulmonary TB, is responsible for more than one million deaths in a year worldwide. Existing methods of mycobacteria detection have poor sensitivity, selectivity, and specificity, especially in human tissues. Herein, the synthesis of a cholic acid-derived fluorescent probe (P4) that can specifically stain the mycobacterium species is presented. It is shown that P4 probe specifically binds with mycobacterial lipids, trehalose monomycolate, and phosphatidylinositol mannoside 6. P4 probe can detect mycobacteria in polymicrobial planktonic cultures and biofilms with high specificity, selectivity, and sensitivity. Moreover, it can detect a single mycobacterium in the presence of 10 000 other bacilli. Unlike the probes that depend on active mycobacterial enzymes, the membrane-specific P4 probe can detect mycobacteria even in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded mice and human tissue sections. Therefore, the ability of the P4 probe to detect mycobacteria in different biological milieu makes it a potential candidate for diagnostic and prognostic applications in clinical settings.

AB  - Objective Severe edema in children with nephrotic syndrome is often refractory to conventional diuretics. Tolvaptan has been used satisfactorily for managing edema in patients with heart failure and cirrhosis. The safety and efficacy of combination therapy with oral tolvaptan and intravenous (IV) furosemide was assessed in patients with furosemide refractory edema. Methods Patients, aged 5-18 y with nephrotic syndrome and severe edema, were screened for eligibility. After excluding hypovolemia, patients received IV furosemide (3-4 mg/kg/d) for 48 h. Those refractory to IV furosemide (weight loss < 3%) received tolvaptan (0.5-1 mg/kg once daily) and IV furosemide for the next 48 h. Parameters were compared between 48 h of furosemide alone and combination therapy. Results A total of 24 patients (18 boys) with mean age of 8.0 +/- 3.0 y were enrolled. Urine volume significantly increased with combination therapy as compared to furosemide therapy (mean difference: 1.2 mL/kg/h; 95% CI: 0.8-1.65 mL/kg/h) (p < 0.001). Compared to therapy with furosemide alone, combination therapy resulted in significant reduction in body weight from 26.9 +/- 10.3 kg to 24.8 +/- 9.7 kg (p < 0.001). Estimated glomerular filtration rate did not change (p = 0.81) but serum sodium increased from 135.7 +/- 3.3 mEq/L to 140.4 +/- 4.8 mEq/L (p < 0.001) with combination therapy; 2 patients showed asymptomatic hypernatremia. Conclusion The combination of oral tolvaptan and IV furosemide is effective in augmenting diuresis and reducing weight in patients with furosemide refractory edema but requires monitoring of electrolytes and volume status.

TI  - Primary intraosseous oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the jaw: First case report
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - Herein we present a rare case of oncocytic variant of mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) occurring intraosseously. Oncocytic MEC (OMEC) is a variant of MEC composed predominately of oncocytic cells with parotid gland being the most common site for its occurrence [1]. To the best of our A 4-year-old male presented with four month long complaints of swelling and pus discharge from the region of right lower back tooth. On extraoral examination a diffuse swelling with ill-defined borders was present over the angle of mandible on the right side. Intraorally, diffuse swelling was An orthopantomograph (OPG) examination revealed a well-defined multilocular radiolucency with respect to right body, ramus and coronoid region of mandible (Fig. 1). Central type-radiolucency extending from distal of primary first molar to coronoid process of mandible was seen surrounding the crown of developing permanent first molar. Developing crown of permanent second molar was pushed towards the coronoid process. The hypodensity, with developing tooth (permanent right mandibular first molar) in centre of the lesion, cortical perforation on lingual cortex and On histopathological examination, tissues revealed dense fibrous capsule lined by non-keratinized epithelium (2-5 cell layers thickness) suggestive of dentigerous cyst, also showing intraluminal proliferation as solid cellular sheets of oncocytic cells (Fig. 2). Most of these tumor cells were polygonal and angular in shape with abundant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Cords of elliptical shaped tumor cells with a stalked appearance were also evident. Few zones of epidermoid cells with prominent intercellular bridges blending imperceptibly with other cells Tumor cells were immunopositive for p40, EMA, CK5/6 and CK19. Focal immunopositivity could be seen for CK7 and MUC5AC. Ki-67 proliferative Primary intraosseous MEC (PIMEC) of the jawbones is a rare occurrence and comprises 2-3% of all MECs.

AB  - Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common cancer across the globe. This is generally associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. Cancer in the pharynx majorly arises through human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, thus classifying head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) into HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCCs. Aberrant, mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-MET) signal transduction favors HNSCC progression by stimulating proliferation, motility, invasiveness, morphogenesis, and angiogenesis. c-MET upregulation can be found in the majority of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. c-MET pathway acts on several downstream effectors including phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma), cellular Src kinase (c-Src), phosphotidylinsitol-3-OH kinase (PI3K), alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (Akt), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and wingless-related integration site (Wnt) pathways. c-MET also establishes a crosstalk pathway with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and contributes towards chemoresistance in HNSCC. In recent years, the signaling communications of c-MET/HGF in metabolic dysregulation, tumor-microenvironment and immune modulation in HNSCC have emerged. Several clinical trials have been established against c-MET/hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) signaling network to bring up targeted and effective therapeutic strategies against HNSCC. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism(s) and current understanding of c-MET/HGF signaling and its effect on HNSCC.

AB  - Purpose The knowledge regarding meniscus has vastly evolved over the past few decades. The meniscus's intact, injured, and repaired status can affect other joint structures, i.e., ligaments, articular surfaces, and overall biomechanics of the knee joint. Due to available evidence's extensiveness, it is challenging to determine the most influential topics and the emerging trends in concurrent meniscus research. This study aims to identify the top fifty cited papers in meniscus research and concurrent knee issues and analyse their characteristics. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted on the Thompson Reuters Web of Science database to prepare a list of top fifty cited articles that included original articles and review articles concerning meniscus. The included articles were analysed for the source journal, investigating institution, country of the corresponding author, year of publication, total citations, annual citation rate, and a qualitative review. Results The search strategy resulted in 6768 original articles and 453 review articles. The top fifty cited articles were published from 1969 to 2014 and belonged to 14 journal sources. There were 43 original articles and seven review articles. The average citations per article were 417.4 and the average citations per paper per year were 22.6. Besides the meniscus, a general interest in the clinical assessment scores, anterior cruciate ligament, long-term osteoarthritis, and cartilage was observed. Conclusion Most of the research concerning meniscus relates to the importance of meniscus preservation, the link between meniscus injuries and concomitant anterior cruciate ligament and chondral injuries, and its role in long-term gonarthrosis. The western countries have contributed the maximum to the top-cited evidence concerning meniscus. The meniscus repair and transplantation techniques have recently gained importance and need further research to qualify for the top-cited evidence.

AB  - A growing body of scientific evidence supports the notion that gut microbiota plays a key role in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes related to human health. Recent findings have now established that gut microbiota also contributes to the regulation of bone homeostasis. Studies on animal models have unraveled various underlying mechanisms responsible for gut microbiota-mediated bone regulation. Normal gut microbiota is thus required for the maintenance of bone homeostasis. However, dysbiosis of gut microbiota communities is reported to be associated with several bone-related ailments such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and periodontitis. Dietary interventions in the form of probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics have been reported in restoring the dysbiotic gut microbiota composition and thus could provide various health benefits to the host including bone health. These dietary interventions prevent bone loss through several mechanisms and thus could act as potential therapies for the treatment of bone pathologies. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of how gut microbiota and its derived microbial compounds are associated with bone metabolism and their roles in ameliorating bone health. In addition to this, we also highlight the role of various dietary supplements like probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics as promising microbiota targeted interventions with the clinical application for leveraging treatment modalities in various inflammatory bone pathologies.

AB  - Background: Previous data from South Asia and India had shown that patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have mild liver disease severity. There are no data regarding long-term clinical outcomes in patients with NAFLD from South Asia. The aim of the study was to evaluate the clinicopathological profile, severity of NAFLD, and clinical outcomes in a large cohort of patients with NAFLD from South Asia.Methods: In an ongoing real-life study [Indian Consortium on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (ICON-D)], interim data captured across 23 centers in India over 18 months was analyzed for clinicopathological profile, severity of NAFLD, and hepatic/extrahepatic events on follow-up.Results: Of 4313 patients (mean age 45 +/- 12.2 years, males 52%), data on metabolic risk factors in 3553 (82.3%) patients revealed that 378 (10.6%) were lean, 575 (16.2%) overweight, 2584 (72.7%) obese; metabolic syndrome in 1518 (42.7%) and at least one metabolic risk factor in 3292 (92.6%) patients. Evidence of significant or advanced fibrosis assessed with [aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index (APRI), n = 3196 (74%)], [fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), n = 3554 (82.4%)], [NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), n = 1924 (44.6%)], [Fibroscan, n = 2475, (57.3%)], and histology [n = 267 (6.2%)] was present in 682 (21.3%), 676 (19%), 397 (20.6%), 715 (29%), and 41 (15.4%) patients, respectively; 246 (10%) patients on Fibroscan and 22 (8.2%) on histology had evidence of cirrhosis. On a mean follow-up 43.5 months, hepatic and extrahepatic events recorded in 1353 (31.3%) patients showed that patients with compensated cirrhosis [71 (5.2%)] had more hepatic [26 (36.7%)] and extrahepatic events [8 (11.3%)] in comparison with those without cirrhosis (P < 0.0001).Conclusion: Around one fifth of patients with NAFLD in South Asia have significant liver disease. Both hepatic and extrahepatic events on follow-up are observed more commonly in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis-related compensated cirrhosis.

AB  - Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IVIg) and subcutaneous (SCIg) immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in the treatment of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).& nbsp;Methods: PubMed, Embase and SCOPUS were searched to identify studies on Ig therapy in patients with IIM and/ or JDM (2010-2020). Outcome measures were complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in terms of muscle power and extramuscular disease activity measures on the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) core set domains.& nbsp;Results: Twenty-nine studies were included (n = 576, 544 IIM, 32 JDM). Muscle power PR with pooled Ig therapy was 88.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 80.6-93.5, n = 499) and PR with SCIg treatment was 96.61% (95% CI: 87.43-99.15, n = 59). Pooled PR with first-line use of IVIg was 77.07% (95% CI: 61.25-92.89, n = 80). Overall, mean time to response was 2.9 months (95% CI: 1.9-4.1). Relapse was seen in 22.76% (95% CI: 14.9-33). Studies on cutaneous disease activity and dysphagia showed significant treatment responses. Glucocorticoid and immunosuppressant sparing effect was seen in 40.9% (95% CI: 20-61.7) and 42.2% (95% CI: 20.4-64.1) respectively. Ig therapy was generally safe with low risk of infection (1.37%, 95% CI: 0.1-2.6).& nbsp;Conclusions: Add-on Ig therapy improves muscle strength in patients with refractory IIM, but evidence on Ig therapy in new-onset disease and extramuscular disease activity is uncertain.

AB  - An isolated carotid artery is a rare aortic arch anomaly. Instead of connecting to the aorta, the isolated carotid artery connects anomalously to the pulmonary artery. Chronically altered cerebral circulation poses the risk of cerebral hyperaemia following surgical reimplantation. We describe successful reimplantation of the isolated left common carotid artery in a child, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for good clinical and neurological outcomes. We also briefly discuss the embryologic basis of this rare arch anomaly.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic 2nd wave catastrophic effect in the state of Chhattisgarh, India, from where no exclusive genomic data yet published, has prompted us to undertake this study to unearth the causative variant. Whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 infected nine vaccinated healthcare workers (HCW), thirty mild/moderate, seventeen severe, and twenty-seven deceased patients, was performed. The sig-nificant predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC), Delta (lineage B.1.617.2) identified in sixty-four (77.1%) cases in contrast to B.1 and its sublineage in eleven (13.2%), variant under monitoring (VUM), Kappa (lineage B.1.617.1) in five (6.0%) and another VOC Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7) in three (3.6%) cases respectively (p < 0.05, chi(2) = 162.49). 88.8% vaccine breakthrough, 60% mild/moderate, 94.4% severe and 81.5% dead patients were infected by Delta. Kappa presents exclusively in mild/moderate, Alpha in vaccine breakthrough, mild/moderate, and dead patient and B.1 and its sublineages in mild, severe, and dead patient categories. Delta variant spike mutation of T19R, G142D, E156G, L452R, and deletion (F157 and R158) helps in escaping antibody response, T478K and D614G enhance viral affinity with ACE2 receptor while P681R and D950N result in higher replication and transmissibility by cleaving S1/S2 at furin site. We conclude that Delta variant predominant role along with co-occurrence of Kappa, Alpha, and B.1 variant during COVID-19 2nd wave pandemic in Chhattisgarh may pose a potential threat of future outbreak through hybrid variant evolution. Thus, intensive genomic surveillance for monitoring variant evolution and a more efficacious vaccine against the Delta and Alpha variants are required.

AB  - Objective: Data for the association between diabetes and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility are conflicting. We aimed to evaluate this association using an analytical cross-sectional study design. Methods: Study participants were recruited from endocrine clinics of our hospital and belonged to 3 groups: group 1 (type 1 diabetes mellitus [T1DM]), group 2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]), and group 3 (controls). All participants submitted blood samples for SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 immunoglobulin G antibody test (LIAISON; DiaSorin) and were interviewed for a history of documented infection. Results: We evaluated a total of 643 participants (T1DM, 149; T2DM, 160; control, 334; mean age, 37.9 +/- 11.5 years). A total of 324 (50.4%) participants were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2. The seropositivity rate was significantly higher in the T1DM (55.7% vs 44.9%, P = .028) and T2DM (56.9% vs 44.9%, P = .013) groups than in the control group. The antibody levels in seropositive participants with T1DM and T2DM were not significantly different from those in seropositive controls. On multivariable analysis, low education status (odds ratio [OR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.03-1.94]; P = .035), diabetes (OR, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.20-2.34]; P = .002), and overweight/obesity (OR, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.10-2.10]; P =.012) showed a significant association with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. The association between diabetes and SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity was found to further increase in participants with coexisting overweight/obesity (adjusted OR, 2.63 [95% CI, 1.54-4.47]; P < .001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity, assessed before the onset of the national vaccination program, was significantly higher in participants with T1DM and T2DM than in controls. The antibody response did not differ between seropositive participants with and without diabetes. These findings point toward an increased SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility for patients with diabetes, in general, without any differential effect of the diabetes type. (c) 2021 AACE.

AB  - Objective: High burden of anaemia exists amongst rural adolescent girls in India. The objective of this study was to characterise anaemia in school going adolescent girls in rural Haryana, India. Design: Linear and multiple logistic regression analysis of data collected prior to an intervention trial was conducted. Participants were classified into anaemic (haemoglobin <12 g/dl) and non-anaemic group and were further classified into deficiencies of Fe, folate or vitamin B-12, mixed, anaemia of other causes and inflammation. Setting: Three schools in Ballabgarh block of Faridabad District, Haryana, India. Participants: One hundered and ninety-eight non-anaemic and 202 anaemic adolescent girls (12-19 years). Results: Anaemic girls had 29 center dot 6 % Fe deficiency, 28 center dot 1 % folate or vitamin B-12 deficiency, 15 center dot 8 % mixed deficiency and 9 center dot 7 % acute inflammation. Anaemia of other causes was found in 16 center dot 8 % of the anaemic participants. Girls with Fe and isolated folate deficiency had 2 center dot 5 times and four times higher odds of developing anaemia, respectively, as compared with non-anaemic girls. Fe deficiency with no anaemia was found amongst 11 % non-anaemic girls. Non-anaemic girls had a high prevalence of combined deficiency of folate or vitamin B-12 (29 center dot 5 %) and acute inflammation (14 center dot 4 %). Conclusions: The current strategy of Fe and folic acid supplementation alone will not suffice for achieving the desired reduction in the prevalence of anaemia as unknown causes and anaemia of inflammation contribute to a substantial proportion of anaemia. Integrating other nutrition-specific components like improving water, sanitation and hygiene practices with the ongoing micronutrient supplementation program will comprehensively tackle anaemia. Unknown causes of anaemia warrant further research.

AB  - Background and aims Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) alone or its combination with platelet counts [Baveno-VI criteria (B6C)] is an important non-invasive tool to predict risk of clinical decompensation in patients with advanced compensated cirrhosis. We compared its utility to decide need for beta-blockers in this regard compared with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) estimation. Methods Patients with compensated cirrhosis with available baseline HVPG and LSM were followed up over a median follow-up of 26 (IQR 7-55) months to determine onset of clinical decompensations. Optimal cut-off for LSM for predicting decompensations was identified and compared with HVPG of 10 mmHg and B6C. Feasibility of initiating beta-blockers based on these strategies was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA) at different threshold probabilities of rates of clinical decompensation. Results 626 patients (mean age: 50.8 +/- 12.4 years, 72.4% males) related to alcohol (30.3%), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (26.4%), hepatitis C (16.6%), hepatitis B (10.2%) were included. Altogether, 132 (21.0%) patients developed clinical decompensation. The time-dependant area under curve over 5 years for HVPG and LSM for predicting clinical decompensation was 0.716-0.742 and 0.709-0.784, respectively. A LSM of 22 kPa (Sensitivity-88.6%/Specificity-51.8%) had a similar negative predictive value but a higher positive predictive value [37.9% (LSM) vs.30.9% (HVPG)vs.30.6% (B6C), p = 0.026 at 3 years] for incident decompensations. On DCA, LSM-based strategy emerged superior for deciding beta-blocker initiation with 150, 47, and 18 additional patients meriting treatment identified over and above B6C and HVPG based strategy at 5%, 10%, 20% annual rates of clinical decompensation, respectively. Conclusion Measurement of liver stiffness alone can be a useful alternative to B6C and HVPG in deciding need for beta-blockers to prevent decompensations in compensated cirrhosis.

AB  - Objectives: To characterize baseline T1 values of tumors, measure changes after the course of chemotherapy, and evaluate its potential as a marker of response assessment in patients with osteosarcoma.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 35 patients (male:female = 27:8; age = 17.9 +/- 6 years; metastatic:localized = 11:24) with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were analyzed prospectively. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (baseline) and after NACT completion (follow-up), followed by surgery and histopathological evaluation. Histopathological necrosis served as the gold standard for assessing chemotherapy response (responder: >= 50% necrosis and non-responder: <50% necrosis). Three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo images were acquired with varying flip angles (5(0), 10(0), 20(0), and 30(0)) using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. T1 values were estimated in healthy muscle tissue and tumors at baseline and follow-up, and the relative percentage changes after NACT (Delta T1) were evaluated, and histogram analysis was performed to characterize the T1 value of the tumor and predict the NACT response using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   Results: At baseline, a significantly higher T1-mean (830.96 +/- 193.88 msec versus 683.29 +/- 210.00 msec; p = 0.003) and lower T1-skewness (0.86 +/- 1.66 versus 1.60 +/- 1.55; p = 0.02) were observed in osteosarcoma than healthy tissue. Responder:non-responder ratio was 13:22. At baseline, a significantly higher T1-mean (936.14 +/- 193.17 msec versus 768.82 +/- 169.25 msec; p = 0.018) and lower T1-skewness (-0.17 +/- 0.85 versus 1.47 +/- 1.73; p = 0.003) were observed among responders, than non-responders. After NACT, Delta T1 in tumor was significantly higher among responders than non-responders (-27.22 +/- 12.17% versus -15.70 +/- 18.99%; p = 0.034). Delta T1-mean and Delta T1-skewness after NACT were moderately correlated (r = - 0.4, p = 0.030; r = 0.4, p = 0.011) with histopathological necrosis. For predicting NACT response, T1-mean and T1-skewness jointly produced an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80 at baseline, and Delta T1-mean and Delta T1-skewness jointly produced AUC = 0.76 after NACT.
   Conclusion: The mean and skewness of Tl values in osteosarcoma are potential non-invasive imaging markers for chemotherapy response assessment.

AB  - Post-mortem MRI (PMMRI) can reliably detect most major organ malformations in cases of stillbirth. However, variable normal post-mortem changes mimicking pathology make the interpretation difficult. Varying morphological appearances of internal organs could be due to differences in gestational age of the fetuses being evaluated or the presence of maceration changes which occur after fetal demise in-utem. Final differentiation and detection of abnormality require a close interaction and inputs from the geneticist regarding clinical examination of the fetus and thorough evaluation of intranatal imaging records. With the increasing use of PMMRI in cases of fetal demise, it is prudent for the radiologists to be aware of normal post-mortem findings to avoid misdiagnosis.

AB  - Ultrastructural and molecular changes in the myelin of the cochlear nerve (CN) have been associated with decreased hearing-acuity with increasing age. But most of these are animal studies or with very few human samples. Hence, we studied the ultrastructure of the human CN at different ages.
   We obtained samples of CN from persons, who at the time of death belonged to young, middle or old age-groups; defined as <= 30, 31 to 50, and >= 51 years of age, respectively. These were processed for viewing under a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Morphology and morphometry were assessed after blinding the observer. Measurements of diameter (whole nerve fibre, axon), myelin thickness and calculation of G-ratio were made on calibrated images using ImageJ software. K-Means cluster analysis was performed based on total and inner nerve fibre area.
   Middle and old age CN showed degenerating axons, splitting of myelin sheath and myelin balloons. Between the middle and old age groups there was significant decrease in axon diameter (p < 0.001), inner nerve fibre area (p < 0.001), myelin thickness (p < 0.001), nerve fibre diameter (p < 0.001), and G ratio (p < 0.001). By clustering, we identified three distinct populations of myelinated nerve fibres: large, medium and small. The large fibres (by size), seen in the young, disappeared in the old age-group. We were unable to find any unmyelinated nerve fibres in this study.
   The morphological deterioration CN fibres may be a visible sign of molecular degeneration and contribute to decreased hearing-acuity. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, herein we report the synthesis, structural characterization and in vitro cytotoxic evaluation of two mixed Co(II)/Ni(II)-nalidixic acid-bipyridyl complexes (1 and 2). The structural analysis of metal complexes 1 and 2 was carried out by analytical and multispectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, UV-vis, EPR, sXRD). The crystallographic details of complexes 1 and 2 revealed a monoclinic crystal system with P21/c space group. DFT studies of complexes were performed to get electronic structure and localization of HOMO and LUMO electron densities. Hirshfeld surface analysis of metal complexes 1 and 2 was employed to understand the various intermolecular interactions (C-H center dot center dot center dot O, N-H center dot center dot center dot H and O-H center dot center dot center dot O) that define the stability of crystal lattice structures. The comparative interaction studies of complex 1 and complex 2 with DNA/BSA were performed by diverse multispectroscopic and analytical techniques to evaluate their chemotherapeutic potential. The magnitude of the DNA binding propensity and binding mode was verified by calculating K-b, K and K-sv values. Higher binding affinity was observed in case of complex 2 via intercalative mode. Furthermore, the cytotoxic assessment of complexes 1 and 2 was examined against MDA-MB-231 (triple negative human breast cancer cell line) and HepG2 (liver carcinoma cell line) employing MTT assay which revealed remarkably effecient and specific cytotoxic activity of complex 2.

AB  - Stainless steels are considered to be corrosion resistant; however, the performance of the material is affected under long-term or extreme conditions. The development of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has opened avenues to enhance a useful life even under extreme environmental conditions. However, the fabrication of HEAs involves multiple-stage (milling, compaction, sintering, and inert environment) manufacturing processes. The present study explores the single-stage process development of a TiNbMoMnFe high-entropy alloy (HEA) coating on 304L stainless steel substrate using a high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) thermal spray technique. Prior to HVOF coating, the feedstock powders were milled for 5, 10, and 15 h, respectively. The coated surfaces were analyzed for morphology, wettability, microstructure, corrosion resistance, presence of different phases and their distribution. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microhardness tester, 3D optical profilometry, and x-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to get different metallurgical and mechanical characteristics. The results indicated that 15-h milled powder-coated substrate exhibited higher corrosion resistance than the other coatings as well as the 304L stainless steel substrate. Chemically stable BCC phase was observed in 15-h milled powder-coated substrates. Moreover, the microhardness, surface roughness, and hydrophobicity of the coated surface were also improved with an increased milling rate. Thus, corrosion resistance of HEA coating can be optimized by a good selection of milling time of powder feedstock.

AB  - In the present study, a highly sensitive and reproducible bio-analytical method was developed using LC-ESI-MS/MS to assess the lower plasma levels of bortezomib in multiple myeloma patients. The gradient elution was optimized using reverse-phase C18 column with mobile phases consisting of water and acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for quantification using precursor-to-product ion transition for bortezomib and sulfadiamethoxine was used as internal standard. This method was validated with a linearity range of 0.195-25 ng mL(-1). Intra-day and inter-day accuracy was 99.17-101.89% and 95.01-102.92% with precision of < 9.87% and < 8.77%, respectively. Bortezomib was stable in plasma samples stored at - 80 degrees C for up to 10 months. The lower limit of quantification was found to be 0.195 ng mL(-1). This method was also found to be capable of quantifying bortezomib trough levels (ranging 0.19-0.7 ng mL(-1)) in plasma of multiple myeloma patients post-cycle 1-6. Bortezomib content in the commonly prescribed generic formulations was also studied. The concentration in all formulations was within the 90-110% of the innovator, as prescribed by the USFDA, ruling out their role blood level variation. The study supports the use of this method for trough level estimation and therapeutic drug monitoring of bortezomib in multiple myeloma patients.

AB  - After the results of two large, randomized trials, the global implementation of lung cancer screening is of utmost importance. However, coronavirus disease 2019 infections occurring at heightened levels during the current global pandemic and also other respiratory infections can influ-ence scan interpretation and screening safety and uptake. Several respiratory infections can lead to lesions that mimic malignant nodules and other imaging changes suggesting malignancy, leading to an increased level of follow-up procedures or even invasive diagnostic procedures. In periods of increased rates of respiratory infections from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and others, there is also a risk of transmission of these infections to the health care providers, the screenees, and patients. This became evident with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic that led to a temporary global stoppage of lung cancer and other cancer screening programs. Data on the optimal management of these situations are not available. The pandemic is still ongoing and further periods of increased respiratory infections will come, in which practical guidance would be helpful. The aims of this report were: (1) to summarize the data available for possible false positive results owing to respiratory infections; (2) to evaluate the safety concerns for screening during times of increased respiratory infections, especially during a regional outbreak or an epidemic or pandemic event; (3) to provide guidance on these situations; and (4) to stimulate research and discussions about these scenarios.

AB  - Background and objectives. - Seroprevalence estimation of COVID-19 is quite necessary for controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seroprevalence rate in recovered COVID-19 patients help us to identify individual with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and its protective nature. The objective of present study was to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among potential convalescent plasma donors and analysis of their deferral reasons.
   Materials and methods. - A total 400 potential convalescent plasma donors were enrolled over five-month period for this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were lab confirmed COVID-19 recovered patients and 14 days of symptoms free period. All prospective plasmapheresis donors were tested for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody through chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, CBC, serum protein, blood grouping along with other required test for normal blood donation as per Drugs & Cosmetics Act. After pre donation testing and medical examination if donor was found to be ineligible for plasmapheresis was deferred. Seroprevalence rate was calculated by positive IgG antibody test results among the potential plasma donors.
   Results. - Seroprevalence rate was 87% for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in prospective convalescent plasma donors (recovered COVID-19 patients). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence rate between different sub-groups with respect to gender, age, blood groups, Rh factor, mode of treatment, day of Ab testing and repeat plasma donation. Most common reason for their deferral was absent IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (13%) followed by absenteeism of eligible screen donors (6.7%), low Hb (1.7%) and poor veins for plasmapheresis (1.7%). Till five-month study period none of the plasmapheresis develop symptoms of reinfection with COVID-19.
   Conclusion. - In all, 13% recovered patients did not develop IgG antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies persist for quite some time and are protective against reinfection. More long-term serology studies are needed to understand better antibody response kinetics and duration of persistence of IgG antibodies.

AB  - This overview of the fifth edition of the WHO classification of thymic epithelial tumors (including thymomas, thymic carcinomas, and thymic neuroendocrine tumors [NETs]), mediastinal germ cell tumors, and mesenchymal neoplasms aims to (1) list established and new tumor entities and subtypes and (2) focus on diagnostic, molecular, and conceptual advances since publication of the fourth edition in 2015. Diagnostic advances are best exemplified by the immunohistochemical characterization of adenocarcinomas and the recognition of genetic translocations in metaplastic thymomas, rare B2 and B3 thymomas, and hyalinizing clear cell carcinomas. Advancements at the molecular and tumor biological levels of utmost oncological relevance are the findings that thymomas and most thymic carcinomas lack currently targetable mutations, have an extraordinarily low tumor mutational burden, but typically have a programmed death-ligand 1(high) phenotype. Finally, data underpinning a conceptual advance are illustrated for the future classification of thymic NETs that may fit into the classification scheme of extrathoracic NETs. Endowed with updated clinical information and state-of-the-art positron emission tomography and computed tomography images, the fifth edition of the WHO classification of thymic epithelial tumors, germ cell tumors, and mesenchymal neoplasms with its wealth of new diagnostic and molecular insights will be a valuable source for pathologists, radiologists, surgeons, and oncologists alike. Therapeutic perspectives and research challenges will be addressed as well. (C) 2021 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is the 'gold standard' surgical procedure for the management of metastatic axillary nodes in patients with invasive breast cancer. The procedure involves removal of all the lymph nodes below the inferior border of axillary vein along with fibro-fatty tissue from the axilla preserving important nerves and vessels. Following ALND, histological examination reveals the number of involved lymph node(s) along with findings of any perinodal spread of tumour which is considered a significant prognostic indicator according to the 8th Edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer-AJCC 8th edition. The risk of locoregional and systemic recurrence is determined by the number of positive nodes, the stage of the cancer and the extent of axillary dissection. With complete ALND, the axillary recurrence varies from 0.5 to 2.5% at 10 years. The extent of clearance of axillary tissue in ALND has clearly defined anatomical boundaries all around except for the 'inferior limit' of dissection. The surgical literature does not provide a clear guideline regarding the lower border of axillary dissection.

AB  - Pain following traumatic rib fractures is one of the most common symptoms and requires adequate management initiated in the emergency department (ED). Many strategies for in-patient management of rib fracture pain have been discussed in literature, but a standardized algorithm to provide uniform care is not available. We hereby propose a multimodal "AIIM-STRAP" (Traumatic Rib fracture Acute Pain management) algorithm to achieve pain-free experience for chest injury patients and also reduce further complications resulting as a consequence of severe pain such as limited chest expansion, reduced tidal volumes, risk of atelectasis, and respiratory infections.

AB  - Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood with significant morbidity. Management of asthma has evolved from inhaled corticosteroids to personalized therapy in recent years. This article summarizes the recent advances in the management of asthma. The severity of asthma is assessed retrospectively by the level of treatment required to control asthma symptoms. Recently, there has been an emphasis on not to use short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) alone, even for intermittent or mild asthma. Single maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) is increasingly being recommended. Asthma therapy should be personalized based on phenotype (clinical presentations) and endotypes (distinct mechanistic pathways) of asthma and by a continuous cycle of assessment of asthma control and risk assessment, treatment, and reviewing the response in children on treatment. Various add-on therapy like tiotropium and biological monoclonal antibodies have been approved for use in a subset of children with severe asthma. Before considering biologicals, it is vital to have a proper diagnosis, good compliance and inhaler technique, and treatment of comorbidities.

AB  - Receptors enable cells to detect, process and respond to information about their environments. Over the past two decades, synthetic biologists have repurposed physical parts and concepts from natural receptors to engineer synthetic receptors. These technologies implement customized sense-and-respond programs that link a cell's interaction with extracellular and intracellular cues to user-defined responses. When combined with tools for information processing, these advances enable programming of sophisticated customized functions. In recent years, the library of synthetic receptors and their capabilities has substantially evolved-a term we employ here to mean systematic improvement and expansion. Here, we survey the existing mammalian synthetic biology toolkit of protein-based receptors and signal-processing components, highlighting efforts to evolve and integrate some of the foundational synthetic receptor systems. We then propose a generalized strategy for engineering and improving receptor systems to meet defined functional objectives called a 'metric-enabled approach for synthetic receptor engineering' (MEASRE).

AB  - Regucalcin (RGN) regulates intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and the activity of several proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways, which highlights its importance in cell biology. Regucalcin has cytoprotective effects reducing intracellular levels of oxidative stress, also playing a crucial role in the control of cell survival and apoptosis. In an effort to assess its gene regulation, we initially identified the expression of Regucalcin in rat lungs treated with hypoxia at various time points. Previously, HIF-1 alpha expression was also reported to be upregulated in hypoxia. Interestingly hypoxic induced Regucalcin expression in a fashion similar to that of HIF-1 alpha expression in rat lungs. Sequence analysis of the Regucalcin promoter region revealed the presence of putative HRE binding motifs. Further analysis of the 1 kb Regucalcin promoter region with 5 & PRIME; deletion and point mutants of HRE binding motif showed that the HRE binding site was critical for high promoter activity. In addition, HIF1 alpha protein binds directly to the HRE binding motifs within the Regucalcin promoter in-vivo, and regulates Regucalcin gene expression. All together, these findings suggest that Regucalcin is the novel target gene of HIF-1 alpha and that Regucalcin gene expression in hypoxia may be regulated by the control of HIF-1 alpha expression.

AB  - In the growing field of graphene-based materials (GBM) for biomedical application, it is crucial to understand how different physicochemical properties of GBM influence interaction with biomolecules like protein, growth factors, and amino acids that could elicit cell fate. At present, many exciting reviews are available that collectively emphasize the importance of protein and growth factor interaction with GBM to regulate cell function. However, not a single review is available to signify the importance of amino acid interaction on GBM to regulate cell response. Given that, media contain several essential amino acids, which have been shown to regulate cellular metabolism and function. Several research articles independently looked into the molecular interaction of amino acids with different GBM and studied their biological response. Hence, it is important to compile such studies to collectively create a consensus on how different amino acids interact with different GBM at the molecular level and how such interactions regulate cell response differently. This review collectively gathers such studies and tries to establish a link between amino acid interaction with different GBM co-relating to cell response.

AB  - Background A weak implant-soft tissue interface may lead to bacterial ingression, breakdown of underlying tissues, and eventually implant failure. This study proposes a surface modification technique of titanium alloy (Ti), using a nano-biopolymer scaffold to enhance soft tissue attachment in dental implants. Methods Gelatin (20% w/v) embedded with 10 +/- 2 nm silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) was electrospun to form a gelatin electrospun mat (GEM) scaffold, bonded to Ti alloy surface using chemical surface functionalization. Antimicrobial activity of AgNPs was tested against representative Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli) at 4, 24, and 48 hours and after embedding in scaffold at 48 hours. Cytotoxicity analysis (MTT assay) was performed using the 3T3 mouse fibroblast cell line at 24 and 72 hours for two groups: control (unmodified Ti disc) and experimental (GEM embedded with AgNPs); and further validated by scanning electron microscopy. Results The AgNPs-embedded GEM showed good antimicrobial activity at 48 hours, with the AgNPs showing complete (99.99%) inhibition of bacterial colony counts at 24 and 48 hours. Cell viability and proliferation over the GEM modified Ti discs were seen to be significantly increased (P < 0.05) at 72 hours as compared with control. SEM images revealed intimate spreading of fibroblasts, with differentiated cell morphology and pseudopodial processes, indicative of enhanced fibroblastic adhesion, growth, and differentiation over the scaffold. Conclusion Results show good antifouling properties and biocompatibility of the fabricated coating, making it a promising strategy to reduce postoperative infections and peri-implant diseases in Ti dental implants.

AB  - The authors describe a case series of co-infection with COVID-19 and scrub typhus in two Indian patients. Clinical features like fever, cough, dyspnea and altered sensorium were common in both patients. Case 1 had lymphopenia, elevated IL-6 and history of hypertension, while case 2 had leukocytosis and an increased liver enzymes. Both patients had hypoalbuminemia and required admission to the intensive care unit; one of them succumbed to acute respiratory distress syndrome further complicated by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Seasonal tropical infections in COVID-19 patients in endemic settings may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, high clinical suspicion and an early diagnosis for co-infections among COVID-19 patients are essential for better patient management.

AB  - In the present study, statistically optimized production of thermotolerant Aspergillus fumigatus phytase was carried out in batch fermentation (1-L). An enhancement in phytase production was noted up to 3.3-folds as compared to unoptimized and using One Variable at a Time strategy. Phytase was purified up to 26-folds with a single band of similar to 62 kDa. The optimum activity of purified phytase was recorded at pH 5.5 and 65 degrees C. The kinetic parameters, K-m and V-max, were observed to be, 0.75 mM, and 345 mu mol/min/mg-protein,respectively. The activity was constrained by silver and mercuric ions and slightly increased by calcium ions. The phytase showed high dephytinization up to 78.7% of wheat flour (10 g) at a small reaction volume (30 mL). On up-scaling to 3-L reaction, a slight decrease in dephytinization to 72.5% was recorded. This is the first report where hyperactive purified phytase from thermotolerant A. fumigatus has been demonstrated to degrade wheat flour-based phytic acid up to a 3-L scale at the bioreactor level. This finding can be explored at a commercial scale for multi-dimensional future biotechnological applications.

TI  - Authors submission guidelines, a survey of pediatric dentistry journals regarding ethical issues
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Objective To assess the pattern of instructions regarding the ethical requirements given to authors in various Pediatric Dental Journals.
   Material & methods A cross-sectional survey of 'instructions for authors,' for analysis of guidelines on ethical processes, was done. Instructions to authors in journals of pediatric dentistry across the globe were reviewed for guidelines with regards to fourteen key ethical issues. Descriptive statistics were used, and results were expressed in percentages as well as numbers.
   Results Of the 18journals of pediatric dentistry, all 14 ethical issues were covered by the instructions to authors in only three journals with only 50% of these providing clarity about authorship using ICMJE guidelines. Furthermore, COI declaration was found to be present as mandatory in about 44% of the journals. 38.9% of the sampled journals mentioned guidelines on research misconduct, publication issues such as plagiarism, overlapping/fragmented publications, and availability of raw research data from authors. Guidelines on handling of complaints about editorial team was provided to authors by slightly over 33% of the selected pediatric dentistry titles while handling of complaints about authors and reviewers were mentioned in 16.7%and 55.6% of the journals respectively.
   Conclusion A significant proportion of Journals of Pediatric Dentistry did not provide adequate instructions to authors regarding ethical issues.

AB  - The Human Aurora Kinase (AURK) protein family is the key player of cell cycle events including spindle assembly, kinetochore formation, chromosomal segregation, centrosome separation, microtubule dynamics, and cytokinesis. Their aberrant expression has been extensively linked with chromosomal instability in addition to derangement of multiple tumor suppressors and oncoprotein regulated pathways. Therefore, the AURK family of kinases is a promising target for the treatment of various types of cancer. Over the past few decades, several potential inhibitors of AURK proteins have been identified and have reached various phases of clinical trials. But very few molecules have currently crossed the safety criteria due to their various toxic side effects. In the present study, we have adopted a computational polypharmacological strategy and identified four novel molecules that can target all three AURKs. These molecules were further investigated for their binding stabilities at the ATP binding pocket using molecular dynamics based simulation studies. The molecules selected adopting a multipronged computational approach can be considered as potential AURKs inhibitors for cancer therapeutics.

AB  - COVID-19 is a sneaking deadly disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The rapid increase in the number of infected patients worldwide enhances the exigency for medicines. However, precise therapeutic drugs are not available for COVID-19; thus, exhaustive research is critically required to unscramble the pathogenic tools and probable therapeutic targets for the development of effective therapy. This study utilizes a chemogenomics strategy, including computational tools for the identification of viral-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and molecular docking of potential chemical compounds available in antiviral, anticancer, and natural product-based libraries against these DEGs. We scrutinized the messenger RNA expression profile of SARS-CoV-2 patients, publicly available on the National Center for Biotechnology Information-Gene Expression Omnibus database, stratified them into different groups based on the severity of infection, superseded by identification of overlapping mild and severe infectious (MSI)-DEGs. The profoundly expressed MSI-DEGs were then subjected to trait-linked weighted co-expression network construction and hub module detection. The hub module MSI-DEGs were then exposed to enrichment (gene ontology + pathway) and protein-protein interaction network analyses where Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (ARHGEF1) gene conjectured in all groups and could be a probable target of therapy. Finally, we used the molecular docking and molecular dynamics method to identify inherent hits against the ARHGEF1 gene from antiviral, anticancer, and natural product-based libraries. Although the study has an identified significant association of the ARHGEF1 gene in COVID19; and probable compounds targeting it, using in silico methods, these targets need to be validated by both in vitro and in vivo methods to effectively determine their therapeutic efficacy against the devastating virus.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Two major pathological hallmarks have been identified for AD: extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Recently, proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), which belongs to the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) non-receptor tyrosine kinase family, was recognized to contribute significantly towards the pathogenesis of AD. Pyk2 can influence the formation of amyloid plaques as well as NFTs. The kinase can directly phosphorylate tau, which is a significant component of NFTs and enhances tau pathology. Several competitive inhibitors have been developed for Pyk2, tested in several cancer models, as Pyk2 is known to be overexpressed under those conditions. The current review article discusses the possible mechanistic pathways by which Pyk2 can influence the pathogenesis of AD. Besides, it describes various inhibitors for Pyk2 and their potential role as therapeutics for AD in the future.

AB  - Aims To explore the impact of incorporating a faster cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging protocol in a low-middle-income country (LMIC) and using the result to guide chelation in transfusion-dependent patients. Methods and results A prospective UK-India collaborative cohort study was conducted in two cities in India. Two visits 13 months apart included clinical assessment and chelation therapy recommendations based on rapid CMR results. Participants were recruited by the local patient advocate charity, who organized the patient medical camps. The average scanning time was 11.3 +/- 2.5 min at the baseline and 9.8 +/- 2.4 min (P < 0.001) at follow-up. The baseline visit was attended by 103 patients (mean age 25 years) and 83% attended the second assessment. At baseline, 29% had a cardiac T-2* < 20 ms, which represents significant iron loading, and 12% had left ventricular ejection fraction <60%, the accepted lower limit in this population. Only 3% were free of liver iron (T-2* >= 17 ms). At 13 months, more patients were taking intensified dual chelation therapy (43% vs. 55%, P = 0.002). In those with cardiac siderosis (baseline T-2* < 20 ms), there was an improvement in T-2*-10.9 +/- 5.9 to 13.5 +/- 8.7 ms, P = 0.005-and fewer were classified as having clinically important cardiac iron loading (T-2* < 20 ms, 24% vs. 16%, P < 0.001). This is the first illustration in an LMIC that incorporating CMR results into patient management plans can improve cardiac iron loading. Conclusion For thalassaemia patients in an LMIC, a simplified CMR protocol linked to therapeutic recommendation via the patient camp model led to enhanced chelation therapy and a reduction in cardiac iron in 1 year.

TI  - A machine learning application for raising WASH awareness in the times of COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the power of internet disinformation in influencing global health. The deluge of information travels faster than the epidemic itself and is a threat to the health of millions across the globe. Health apps need to leverage machine learning for delivering the right information while constantly learning misinformation trends and deliver these effectively in vernacular languages in order to combat the infodemic at the grassroot levels in the general public. Our application, WashKaro, is a multi-pronged intervention that uses conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine translation, and natural language processing to combat misinformation (NLP). WashKaro uses AI to provide accurate information matched against WHO recommendations and delivered in an understandable format in local languages. The primary aim of this study was to assess the use of neural models for text summarization and machine learning for delivering WHO matched COVID-19 information to mitigate the misinfodemic. The secondary aim of this study was to develop a symptom assessment tool and segmentation insights for improving the delivery of information. A total of 5026 people downloaded the app during the study window; among those, 1545 were actively engaged users. Our study shows that 3.4 times more females engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of AI-filtered news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning, and the prudence of integrated AI chatbot "Satya" increased thus proving the usefulness of a mHealth platform to mitigate health misinformation. We conclude that a machine learning application delivering bite-sized vernacular audios and conversational AI is a practical approach to mitigate health misinformation.

AB  - We prospectively evaluated use of plerixafor for stem cell mobilization in a risk adapted approach using day 4 peripheral blood CD34+ counts as a guide; if count was < 20 cells/mu l, patients received plerixafor. Compared with similar cohort of patients transplanted in earlier period and mobilized with G-CSF alone, failure rate was 3.8% for plerixafor + G-CSF cohort vs. 12.8% (P < .014) in Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone cohort to collect target stem cells(>= 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg). Our results suggest that risk adapted approach for plerixafor for stem cell mobilization in myeloma patients is efficient and also cost effective.
   Background: We used plerixafor in 'a risk adapted approach' for stem cell mobilization for multiple myeloma (MM) patients prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Patients and Methods: Between January, 2017 and December, 2019 105 consecutive patients of MM were recruited (Study Cohort). Patients received inj G-CSF 10 mu g/kg in 2 divided doses for 5 days. Day 4 peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ count was used as a guide; if count was < 20 cells/mu l, patients received plerixafor. For those with >= 20 cells/mu l apheresis was commenced on day 5. We compared their outcome with 156 MM patients transplanted between 2012 and 2016 with G-CSF mobilized PB stem cells (Control Cohort). Primary end point was to collect >= 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (minimal harvest). Secondary end points were: no of apheresis sessions, percentage of patients with optimal stem cell harvest (>= 4.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg) and cost analysis. An intent to treat analysis was done. Result: 96.2% of patients achieved >= 2.0 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg in the study cohort vs. 87.2% in the control cohort, P < .01. Mean apheresis sessions were 1.5 vs. 1.7 respectively, P < .014. Optimal stem cell harvest was 29.5% vs. 16%,P = .23. Days for neutrophil engraftment (P < 0.025) and for IV antibiotics (P < .0017) were favorable for the study cohort. Incremental cost effectiveness ratio was $ 15.80/- and $ 10.56/- per 1% increase to achieve a minimal and optimal harvest. Conclusion: Plerixafor in this risk adapted strategy resulted in successful mobilization, decreased time to engraftment and was cost effective. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Splenectomy is usually deferred for the first 12 months of onset of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) because patients may have spontaneous remission. However, in patients with failed medical management, splenectomy is a valuable treatment option. This study aimed to evaluate the role of splenectomy in patients with persistent ITP with failed medical management at a tertiary care center. A retrospective review of records of all patients who underwent splenectomy for ITP between January 2010 and December 2019 was done. We identified the patients with primary ITP refractory to medical management who were referred from hematology to our department for splenectomy and their clinical course was evaluated. Most of the patients were females (14/20, 70%), and the mean age of patients in our series was 33.7 +/- 11.1 years. Skin petechiae and mucosal bleeding were the most common presenting symptoms. Mean pre-operative platelet count was 20,079 +/- 11,644/mu L. After a trial of medical management for a mean duration of 6.7 +/- 3.6 months, patients were planned for splenectomy. All patients improved symptomatically after surgery. A significant increase in platelet count was observed (mean: 80,290 +/- 75,327/mu L). Splenectomy (either open or laparoscopic approach) is a safe and very good option in patients with new onset and persistent ITP refractory to medical management with favorable outcomes.

AB  - Wireless capsule endoscopy is a non-invasive and painless procedure to examine the gastrointestinal tract of human body, and an experienced clinician takes 2-3 hours for complete examination. To reduce this diagnosis time, the present work proposes a lightweight CNN model for binary classification of WCE images. The proposed model has a strong backbone of CNN in the primary branch complemented by resolution preserving dilated convolution layers in secondary branches. The proposed model extracts multiple features at different scales and finally fuses them together to fetch the dominant global feature that aids in binary classification problem. A new dataset has been created in collaboration with All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The efficacy of the proposed model has been verified using the developed dataset using various subjective and objective parameters. Feature maps generated at each branch have been thoroughly analyzed to understand the quality of learning. Thorough experimental analysis indicates that the proposed model yields an accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.93 and specificity of 0.97 on real data collected from AIIMS Delhi. To verify the efficacy of the proposed dilated CNN, extensive analysis has been done using standard KID dataset as well. For a fair comparison, these datasets have also been used for pre-trained inception net model. Thorough analysis indicates that the proposed architecture performs well both for AIIMS dataset and the standard KID dataset. Result analysis also reflects that the proposed dilated CNN architecture outperforms the performance of pre-trained inception net model.

AB  - Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) are rare tumors accounting for less than 1% of astrocytomas. They commonly occur in young patients and have relatively favorable prognosis. However, they are well known to have heterogenous morphology and biological behavior with the potential to recur and disseminate throughout the central nervous system, especially their anaplastic counterparts. Recent advances in the molecular characterization have discovered BRAFp.V600E mutations in conjunction with CDKN2A/B deletions and TERTp mutations to be the most frequent alterations in PXAs. These tumors can present a diagnostic challenge as they share overlapping histopathological, genomic as well as methylation profile with various other tumor types, particularly epithelioid glioblastomas (eGBs). This review provides the spectrum of evolution of PXAs from their genesis to recent molecular insights and attempts to review pathogenesis and relationship to other tumors that they mimic especially eGB. It is postulated based on evidence from literature that PXA and eGB are possibly related and not distinct entities, being two ends of a continuous spectrum of malignant progression (grade 2-grade 4) with anaplastic PXA (grade 3) lying in between. Future WHO classifications will have to possibly redefine these tumors using more confirmatory data from larger studies.

AB  - Primary surgical management is successful as the sole therapeutic modality in the majority of women with early-stage cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer, but the presence of certain risk factors in the surgico-pathological specimen indicates a poorer prognosis. Adjuvant treatment can improve overall survival in such cases. Important risk factors in cervical cancer include intermediate-risk factors (large tumor size, deep cervical stromal invasion, lymph vascular space invasion) and high-risk factors (positive or close margins, lymph nodes, or parametrial involvement). In vulvar cancer, positive margins and lymph nodes are the two most important factors for adjuvant therapy. Radiation therapy has been the mainstay of adjuvant therapy in these cancers, supplemented by chemotherapy. Recent advances have witnessed the inclusion of newer therapeutic modalities such as immunotherapy. This review addresses the current status of various adjuvant therapeutic modalities for these gynecological cancers. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Driven by the need to biosynthesize alternate biomedical agents to prevent and treat infection, silver nanoparticles have surfaced as a promising avenue. Cyanobacteria-derived nanomaterial synthesis is of substantive interest as it offers an eco-friendly, cost-effective, sustainable, and biocompatible route for further development. In the present study optimal conditions for synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were 1 : 9 v/v [cell extract: AgNO3 (1 mM)], pH 7.4, and 30 degrees C reaction temperatures. Synthesis of nanoparticles was monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometry and the maximum absorbance was observed at a wavelength of 420 nm. SEM with EDX analysis confirmed 96.85% silver by weight which revealed the purity of AgNPs. TEM & XRD analysis exhibited a particle size of similar to 12 nm with crystalline nature. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of possible biomolecules involved in the synthesis and stabilization of AgNPs. Decapping of AgNPs followed by SDS-PAGE, LCMS and MALDI TOF analysis elucidates the proteinaceous nature of the capping and stabilizing agent. Cyanobacterial-derived capped AgNPs showed more cytotoxicicity towards a non-small cell lung cancer (A549) cell line, free radical scavenger and an antimicrobial than de-capped AgNPs. In addition they showed significant synergistic characteristics with antibiotics and fungicides. The test revealed that the capped AgNPs were biocompatible with good anti-inflammatory properties. The blend of antimicrobial and biocompatible properties, coupled with their intrinsic "green" and facile synthesis, made these biogenic nanoparticles particularly attractive for future applications in nanomedicine.

AB  - Background: Telomeres and telomerase are considered cardinal biomarkers of cellular aging. Shorter telomeres and low telomerase activity have been associated with obesity and accelerated aging.Objective: To compare the effects of a yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) with the standard of care (SOC) on cellular aging by estimating telomere length (TL) and telomerase activity in obesity.Design and setting: A parallel, two-arm, randomized-controlled trial was conducted at the Integral Health Clinic, Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from March 2017 to October 2019.Participants: Obese (n = 72), body mass index (BMI), 25-35 kg/m(2), aged 20-45 years, male (21), and female (51).Intervention: Seventy-two obese participants were randomized to receive either a 12-week SOC (n = 36) or YBLI (n = 36). SOC included management of obesity as per Indian guidelines including a hypocaloric individualized diet and physical activity. The pretested YBLI included asana (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation.Methods: Blood samples were collected from both the groups at baseline, 2, 4, and 12 weeks. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TL was measured by quantitative PCR, and serum telomerase levels by immunoassay.Outcome measures: Primary outcome measures were the changes in the TL and telomerase levels between the two groups at week 12. Secondary outcome measures were the changes in TL and telomerase, and anthropometric parameters (body weight, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio) at 2, 4, and 12 weeks of intervention in both SOC and YBLI groups.Results: There were no significant changes in TL and telomerase levels between the groups at week 12. The TL was significantly greater in the YBLI group versus the SOC group (p < 0.0001) at 2 weeks. The anthropometric and physiological parameters were influenced positively by both SOC and YBLI.Conclusion: The study did not meet the primary objective, although the results are suggestive of a positive impact of YBLI on aging in obesity as noted within the YBLI group. However, the results should be interpreted carefully, and in the light of other published data. Larger studies to better understand the possible positive benefits of YBLI on cellular aging are recommended. Clinical Trail Registration No. CTRI/2016/08/007136.

AB  - Aim The present study sought to evaluate the morphology and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with anomalous origin of one pulmonary artery from aorta (AOPA) on CT angiography. Materials and Methods A retrospective search of the departmental database from January 2014 to September 2021 was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with AOPA on CT angiography. The subtype of AOPA, site of origin, and associated cardiovascular abnormalities were assessed. Results AOPA was identified in 27 patients (19 males, mean age: 8.8 years). Anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery from aorta (AORPA) was observed in 17/27 (63%) patients, while anomalous origin of the left pulmonary artery (AOLPA) was seen in 10/27 (37%) patients. The proximal and distal subtypes were observed in 24/27 (88.9%) and 3/27 (11.1%) patients respectively. AOPA was associated with other cardiac anomalies in 92.6% (25/27) patients. Patent arterial duct (11/17; 64.7%) was the most frequently anomaly associated with AORPA, while tetralogy of Fallot (10/10; 100%) was the most commonly anomaly associated with AOLPA. The anomalous pulmonary artery was contralateral to the aortic arch in 23/27 (85.2%) patients. Right-sided aortic arch was observed in only 2/17 (11.8%) patients with AORPA and 8/10 (80%) patients with AOLPA. In 2/10 (20%) patients, AORPA was associated with aortopulmonary window and aortic arch anomaly. Conclusion AOPA is rare and frequently associated with other cardiovascular anomalies like patent arterial duct, tetralogy of Fallot, and right-sided aortic arch. CT angiography helps in providing exact anatomical delineation and identifying associated anomalies, thus aiding preoperative planning of surgical management.

AB  - Temporarily deferred donors are a forgotten pool of potential blood source. When dealt appropriately, they can easily be inducted back to the main stream pool of voluntary donors. Although there are multiple studies from India on the deferral rates and patterns; not much has been done with respect to the follow up of these donors and active efforts to bring them back to donate blood. In this narrative review, we discuss the impact of temporary deferral, factors affecting the return and appropriate strategies to improve the return rate of these donors.

AB  - Since the description of bilateral ligation of internal iliac arteries (BLIIA) and preperitoneal pelvic packing (PPP) for hemorrhage control in pelvic injury patients, multiple reports have been published advocating its use with acceptable outcomes. We analyzed our experience with this technique in a setting where the facility of hybrid operating room for simultaneous angioembolization is not available. We analyzed data of sixty-six patients who presented in a state of unresponsive shock with pelvic fracture between January 2014 and September 2019. After initial resuscitation, they all underwent BLIIA with PPP as part of damage control surgery. Out of 66 patients, 55 were male. The mean age was 36.12 years. All patients sustained blunt trauma, with road traffic injuries being the most common mechanism involving 65% of the patients followed by fall from height. The mean systolic blood pressure at the time of surgery was 77 +/- 34.46 mm Hg. Median packed red blood cell transfusion in the first 24 h was 8.5 units with IQR of 6-12. The hemorrhage-related mortality was 48%. BLIIA with PPP may be considered as a viable treatment option in hemodynamically unstable patients with pelvic injuries in resource constraint facilities.

AB  - Omicron is a new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is currently infecting people around the world. Spike glycoprotein, an important molecule in pathogenesis of infection has been modeled and the interaction of its Receptor Binding Domain with human ACE-receptor has been analysed by simulation studies. Structural analysis of Omicron spike glycoprotein shows the 30 mutations to be distributed over all domains of the trimeric protein, wherein the mutant residues are seen to be participating in higher number of intra-molecular interactions including two salt bridges emanating from mutant residues thereby stabilizing their conformation, as compared to wild type. Complex of Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) with human ACE-2 receptor shows seven mutations at interacting interface comprising of two ionic interactions, eight hydrogen bonds and seven Van der Waals interactions. The number and quality of these interactions along with other binding biophysical parameters suggests more potency of RBD domain to the receptor as compared to the wild type counterpart. Results of this study explains the high transmissibility of Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 that is currently observed across the world. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose Existing technologies to measure central blood pressure (CBP) intrinsically depend on peripheral pressure or calibration models derived from it. Pharmacological or physiological interventions yielding different central and peripheral responses compromise the accuracy of such methods. We present a high-frame-rate ultrasound technology for cuffless and calibration-free evaluation of BP from the carotid artery. The system uses a pair of single-element ultrasound transducers to capture the arterial diameter and local pulse wave velocity (PWV) for the evaluation of beat-by-beat BP employing a novel biomechanical model. Materials and methods System's functionality assessment was conducted on eight male subjects (26 +/- 4 years, normotensive and no history of cardiovascular risks) by perturbing pressure via short-term moderate lower body negative pressure (LBNP) intervention (-40 mmHg for 1 min). The ability of the system to capture dynamic responses of carotid pressure to LBNP was investigated and compared against the responses of peripheral pressure measured using a continuous BP monitor. Results While the carotid pressure manifested trends similar to finger measurements during LBNP, the system also captured the differential carotid-to-peripheral pressure response, which corroborates the literature. The carotid diastolic and mean pressures agreed with the finger pressures (limits-of-agreement within +/- 7 mmHg) and exhibited acceptable uncertainty (mean absolute errors were 2.4 +/- 3.5 and 2.6 +/- 4.0 mmHg, respectively). Concurrent to the literature, the carotid systolic and pulse pressures (PPs) were significantly lower than those of the finger pressures by 11.1 +/- 9.4 and 11.3 +/- 8.2 mmHg, respectively (p < .0001). Conclusions The study demonstrated the method's potential for providing cuffless and calibration-free pressure measurements while reliably capturing the physiological aspects, such as PP amplification and dynamic pressure responses to intervention.

AB  - Latent tuberculosis infection is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persistence and poses a significant challenge to the eradication of tuberculosis. The detection of Mtb DevR/DosR dormancy regulon expression in clinical specimens has provided evidence for the existence of persistent/dormant tubercle bacilli in vivo. Targeting of DevR is expected to eliminate these persisters that are tolerant to antitubercular drugs. The presence of redundant pathways of DevR activation in Mtb necessitates targeting DevR, and not its cognate sensor kinases, DevS and DosT. Drug discovery programs are heavily dependent on inhibitor screening assays. Here, we report a high throughput screening assay in Mtb termed ReFPA (Real Time Fluorescence Plate Assay) to identify inhibitors that specifically target DevR. Using ReFPA, we identified novel thiazolidin-4-one-based inhibitors of DevR, namely N5, N6 and N11, that interfered with the hypoxic viability of Mycobacterium bovis BCG and were non-toxic to HepG2 cells. In silico docking analysis revealed that N5, N6 and N11 bound to a common pocket located in the C-terminal domain of DevR. The interaction of N5, N6 and N11 with DevR was experimentally confirmed using thermal shift assay. These findings demonstrate the identification of a new and promising scaffold to design anti-DevR molecules for intercepting mycobacterial dormancy. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women with infertility, elucidate the psycho-social factors affecting infertile women, identify the commonly employed coping strategies, and evaluate their self-esteem and quality of life. Methods A total of 150 women with infertility, from a tertiary care hospital, participated in this study. Cross-sectional assessment was performed by using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, WHO-Quality of life-BREF, and Brief-COPE Inventory. Results Overall, 58% (87/150) of women reported depression on HDRS, 24% (36/150) reported anxiety on HAM-A, and 24% (36/150) had both depression and anxiety on HDRS and HAM-A. Comparative analysis of women reporting depression and anxiety indicated that they were subjected to significant discrimination, received lower social acceptance, had financial problems, higher depression and anxiety, poorer quality of life, and employed maladaptive coping. Living in a joint family, and using maladaptive coping were significant risk factors for anxiety and depression. Conversely, the family's ability to provide support, share problems, and assist with decision-making, along with receiving support from their spouses, were chief protective factors. Conclusion Women with infertility experience depression, anxiety, poor quality of life, and employ maladaptive coping. Supportive relationships with one's family and spouse are chief protective factors.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MR) in hepatoblastoma as compared to multiphase contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) scans for detection of satellite lesions. Methods In this prospective study on new cases of hepatoblastoma, multiphase CECT scans and DW-MR were performed before initiation of chemotherapy. Results of interpretation were compared for detection of satellite lesions. PRETEXT grouping and risk categorization was done according to SIOPEL based on CECT scan. Results Nine boys and 1 girl with hepatoblastoma, with median age of 11.5 mo were included. All patients were stratified as high-risk group with 2 (20%) in PRETEXT II and 8 (80%) in PRETEXT III. In 2 of 10 (20%) patients, additional satellite lesions were detected on DW-MR, which upgraded their stage. One of the two patients had one satellite lesion identified on CECT, while additional seven satellite lesions were identified on DW-MR imaging. For the other patient, CECT showed no satellite lesion while DW-MR detected six satellite lesions. Conclusion MRI has become the gold standard investigation for evaluation of hepatoblastoma. DW-MR, which is a contrast free technique, is a better tool for assessment of satellite lesions which are usually missed on CECT. This would help in proper staging, planning of management and prognostication.

TI  - Sensitivity and specificity of waterbath ultrasound technique in comparison to the conventional methods in diagnosing extremity fractures
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE

KW  - Water-bath technique
KW  - Fracture
AB  - Introduction: Point of care ultrasound (POCUS) has variable diagnostic accuracy in diagnosing fractures. Waterbath technique is a modification of the conventional ultrasound technique which may improve diagnostic accuracy by enhancing image quality. Authors studied the diagnostic accuracy of waterbath technique compared to the final diagnosis based on clinical examination and radiology in the identification of fractures of hand and foot.
   Methods: Patients of >18 yrs. age with suspected distal hand and foot fractures presenting to the emergency department of a level 1 trauma center were recruited after informed consent. Unconscious and hemodynamically unstable patients, injuries >72 h old, open fractures, obvious deformities, and old fractures at the affected site were excluded. Cases were subjected to waterbath technique performed by an academic emergency medicine resident and relevant radiographs were ordered and interpreted by an orthopedic specialist. CT/MRI, if done in case of discrepancy, was interpreted by radiologist. The findings of both waterbath technique and radiology were blinded to each other and compared to the final diagnosis made by a cumulative assessment of clinical examination, radiographs, and CT/MRI of the discrepant cases.
   Results: Waterbath technique identified fractures of hand and foot with sensitivity of 97% (95% CI 90%-100%), specificity 94% (95% CI 81%-99%), PPV 98% (95%CI 91%-99%), NPV 94% (95%CI 79%-98%), LR+ 17.5(95% CI 4.5-67.2), LR-0.03(95% CI 0.01-0.12) and diagnostic accuracy 96% (95%CI 91%-99%).
   Conclusion: This pilot study has demonstrated the utility of Waterbath technique in the diagnosis of fractures of hand and foot in adults in the ED setting. Future well designed studies are required to explore the potential of this novel technique in both adult and pediatric population. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Extreme complexity in the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) system and its nomenclature makes it difficult to interpret and integrate relevant information for HLA associations with diseases, Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and Transplantation. PubMed search displays similar to 146,000 studies on HLA reported from diverse locations. Currently, IPD-IMGT/HLA (Robinson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 48:D948-D955, 2019) database houses data on 28,320 HLA alleles. We developed an automated pipeline with a unified graphical user interface HLA-SPREAD that provides a structured information on SNPs, Populations, REsources, ADRs and Diseases information. Information on HLA was extracted from similar to 28 million PubMed abstracts extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Python scripts were used to mine and curate information on diseases, filter false positives and categorize to 24 tree hierarchical groups and named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms followed by semantic analysis to infer HLA association(s). This resource from 109 countries and 40 ethnic groups provides interesting insights on: markers associated with allelic/haplotypic association in autoimmune, cancer, viral and skin diseases, transplantation outcome and ADRs for hypersensitivity. Summary information on clinically relevant biomarkers related to HLA disease associations with mapped susceptible/risk alleles are readily retrievable from HLASPREAD.The resource is available at URL http://hla-spread.igib.res.in/. This resource is first of its kind that can help uncover novel patterns in HLA gene-disease associations.

AB  - Objective: Flow diversion is becoming an increasingly established practice for the treatment of acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms. In this study the authors present a literature review and meta-analysis, adding a retrospective review of institutional registry on emergency treatment of aRIA with flow diverter stent. Materials and methods: A systematic search of PubMed, SCOPUS, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid EMBASE was performed on April 20th, 2021, extrapolating 35 articles. R language 'meta' and 'metafor' packages were used for data pooling. The DerSimonian-Laird model was used to calculate the pooled effect. The I2 value and Q statistic evaluated study heterogeneity. Additionally, the authors retrospectively reviewed their institutional database for the treatment and outcomes of all patients with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diverter stent placement from May 2010 to November 2020 was performed. Results: From the systematic literature review and meta-analysis, the pooled proportion of complete aneurysm occlusion was 78%, with a pooled rate of 79%, 71%, 80%, and 50% for dissecting, saccular, fusiform, and mycotic aneurysms, respectively. The pooled proportion of aneurysm rebleeding and intrastent stenosis was 12% and 15% respectively, for a total of 27% rate. The analysis of authors retrospective register showed an overall mortality rate of 16.7% (3/18), with a low but not negligible post procedural rebleeding and intrastent thrombosis rates (5.6% and 11.1% respectively). Conclusion: Although increasingly utilized in the management of selected patients with acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms, flow diversion for acutely ruptured intracranial aneurysms treatment presents rebleeding and intrastent stenosis rates not negligible.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Reinfection Rate and Estimated Effectiveness of the Inactivated Whole Virion Vaccine BBV152 Against Reinfection Among Health Care Workers in New Delhi, India
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
KW  - INFECTION
AB  - IMPORTANCE A surge of COVID-19 occurred from March to June 2021, in New Delhi, India, linked to the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out for health care workers (HCWs) starting in January 2021.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the incidence density of reinfection among a cohort of HCWs and estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virion vaccine BBV152 against reinfection.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a retrospective cohort study among HCWs working at a tertiary care center in New Delhi, India.
   EXPOSURES Vaccination with 0, 1, or 2 doses of BBV152.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The HCWs were categorized as fully vaccinated (with 2 doses and >= 15 days after the second dose), partially vaccinated (with 1 dose or 2 doses with >= 15 days after the second dose), or unvaccinated. The incidence density of COVID-19 reinfection per 100 person-years was computed, and events from March 3, 2020, to June 18, 2021, were included for analysis. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Estimated vaccine effectiveness (1 - adjusted HR) was reported.
   RESULTS Among 15 244 HCWs who participated in the study, 4978 (32.7%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 36.6 (10.3) years, and 55.0% were male. The reinfection incidence density was 7.26 (95% CI: 6.09-8.66) per 100 person-years (124 HCWs [2.5%], total person follow-up period of 1696 person-years as time at risk). Fully vaccinated HCWs had lower risk of reinfection (HR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.08-0.23]), symptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07-0.24]), and asymptomatic reinfection (HR, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.05-0.53]) compared with unvaccinated HCWs. Accordingly, among the 3 vaccine categories, reinfection was observed in 60 of 472 (12.7%) of unvaccinated (incidence density, 18.05 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 14.02-23.25), 39 of 356 (11.0%) of partially vaccinated (incidence density 15.62 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 11.42-21.38), and 17 of 1089 (1.6%) fully vaccinated (incidence density 2.18 per 100 person-years; 95% CI, 1.35-3.51) HCWs. The estimated effectiveness of BBV152 against reinfection was 86% (95% CI, 77%-92%); symptomatic reinfection, 87% (95% CI, 76%-93%); and asymptomatic reinfection, 84% (95% CI, 47%-95%) among fully vaccinated HCWs. Partial vaccination was not associated with reduced risk of reinfection.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These findings suggest that BBV152 was associated with protection against both symptomatic and asymptomatic reinfection in HCWs after a complete vaccination schedule, when the predominant circulating variant was B.1.617.2.

AB  - Purpose To summarize the graft loading, transporting and delivery devices used for endothelial keratoplasty (EK). Methods A literature search of electronic databases was performed. Results New techniques and devices have been introduced and implemented to prepare, load, transport and transplant the grafts for EK. The advantages are not only limited to the surgical theatre but also widely spread across the eye banking field. Investigation of advanced materials and designs have been rapidly growing with continuous evolution in the field of eye banking and corneal transplantation. Innovative techniques and modern devices have been evaluated to reduce the endothelial cell loss and increase the precision of the transplant in order to benefit both surgeons and the patients. Conclusions It is extremely important to reduce any potential wastage and optimize the use of every available donor cornea due to the limited availability of healthy cadaveric donor corneas required for transplants. As a result, the use of pre-cut and pre-loaded grafts supplied by the eye banks in calibrated devices have been gaining momentum. Innovation in the field of bioengineering for the development of new devices that facilitate excellent clinical outcomes along with reduction in learning curve has shown promising results.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an accelerating neurodegenerative disorder. Dysfunction of mitochondria and oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Sirtuins play a role in this pathway and can be a potential marker to study neurodegenerative changes. This study evaluated serum levels of all seven sirtuin (SIRT1-SIRT7) proteins in three study groups: AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and geriatric control (GC) by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique. Further, it was validated by the Western blot experiment. ROC analysis was performed to differentiate the study group based on the concentration of serum SIRT proteins. Out of seven sirtuins, serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 levels (mean +/- SD) were significantly decreased in AD (1.65 +/- 0.56, 3.15 +/- 0.28, 3.36 +/- 0.32 ng/mu l), compared to MCI (2.17 +/- 0.39, 3.60 +/- 0.51, 3.73 +/- 0.48 ng/mu l) and GC (2.84 +/- 0.47, 4.55 +/- 0.48, 4.65 +/- 0.55 ng/mu l). ROC analysis showed the cut-off value with high sensitivity and specificity for cognitive impairment (AD and MCI). The concentration declined significantly with the disease progression. No specific difference was observed in the case of other SIRTs between the study groups. This study reveals an inverse relation of serum SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT6 concentration with AD. ROC analysis showed that these serum proteins have greater accuracy in diagnosing of AD. This is the first report of estimation of all seven serum sirtuins and the clinical relevance of SIRT3 and SIRT6 as serum protein markers for AD.

AB  - The mid-paraseptal region corresponds to the portion of the pyramidal space whose right atrial aspect is known as the triangle of Koch. The superior area of this mid-paraseptal region is also para-Hisian, and is close to the compact atrioventricular node and the His bundle. The inferior sector of the mid-paraseptal area is unrelated to the normal atrioventricular conduction pathways. It is, therefore, a safe zone in which, if necessary, to perform catheter ablation. The middle part of the mid-paraseptal zone may, however, in some patients, house components of the compact atrioventricular node. This suggests the need for adopting a prudent attitude when considering catheter ablation in this area. The inferior extensions of the atrioventricular node, which may represent the substrate for the slow atrioventricular nodal pathway, take their course through the middle, and even the inferior, sectors of the mid-paraseptal region. In this review, we contend that the middle and inferior areas of the mid-paraseptal region correspond to what, in the past, was labelled by most groups as the 'midseptal' zone. We describe the electrocardiographic patterns observed during pre-excitation and orthodromic reciprocating tachycardia in patients with pathways ablated in the middle or inferior sectors of the region. We discuss the modification of the ventriculo-atrial conduction times during tachycardia after the development of bundle branch block aberrancy. We conclude that the so-called 'intermediate septal' pathways, as described in the era of surgical ablation, were insufficiently characterized. They should not be considered the surrogate of the 'midseptal' pathways defined using endocardial catheter electrode mapping.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The use of perioperative, prophylactic, intravenous antibiotics is standard practice to reduce the risk of surgical site infection after oncologic resection and complex endoprosthetic reconstruction for lower extremity bone tumors. However, evidence guiding the duration of prophylactic treatment remains limited.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of a 5-day regimen of postoperative, prophylactic, intravenous antibiotics compared with a 1-day regimen on the rate of surgical site infections within 1 year after surgery.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical superiority trial was performed at 48 clinical sites in 12 countries from January 1, 2013, to October 29, 2019. The trial included patients with a primary bone tumor or a soft tissue sarcoma that had invaded the femur or tibia or oligometastatic bone disease of the femur or tibia with expected survival of at least 1 year who required surgical management by excision and endoprosthetic reconstruction. A total of 611 patients were enrolled, and 7 were exduded for ineligibility.
   INTERVENTIONS A 1- or 5-day regimen of postoperative prophylactic intravenous cephalosporin (cefazolin or cefuroxime) that began within 8 hours after skin closure and was administered every 8 hours thereafter. Those randomized to the 1-day regimen received identical saline doses every 8 hours for the remaining 4 days; patients, care providers, and outcomes assessors were blinded to treatment regimen.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome in this superiority trial was a surgical site infection (superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ space) classified according to the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within 1year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic-related complications, unplanned additional operations, oncologic and functional outcomes, and mortality.
   RESULTS Of the 604 patients included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 41.2 [21.9] years; 361 [59.8%] male; 114 [18.9%] Asian, 43 [7.1%) Black, 34 [5.6%] Hispanic, 15 [2.5%] Indigenous, 384 [63.8%] White. and 12 [2.0%] other), 293 were randomized to a 5-day regimen and 311 to a 1-day regimen. A surgical site infection occurred in 44 patients (15.0%) allocated to the 5-day regimen and in 52 patients (16.7%) allocated to the 1-day regimen (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.62-1.40; P = .73). Antibiotic-related complications occurred in 15 patients (5.1%) in the 5-day regimen and in 5 patients (1.6%) allocated to the 1-day regimen (hazard ratio, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.17-8.98; P = .02). Other secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial did not confirm the superiority of a 5-day regimen of postoperative intravenous antibiotics over a 1-day regimen in preventing surgical site infections after surgery for lower extremity bone tumors that required an endoprosthesis. The 5-day regimen group had significantly more antibiotic-related complications.

AB  - Esophageal cancer is a complex gastrointestinal malignancy with an extremely poor outcome. Approximately 80% of cases of this malignancy in Asian countries including India are of squamous cell origin, termed Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC).The five-year survival rate in ESCC patients is less than 20%. Neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (NACRT) followed by surgical resection remains the major therapeutic strategy for patients with operable ESCC. However, resistance to NACRT and local recurrence after initial treatment are the leading cause of dismal outcomes in these patients. Therefore, an alternative strategy to promote response to the therapy and reduce the post-operative disease recurrence is highly needed. At the molecular level, wide variations have been observed in tumor characteristics among different populations, nevertheless, several common molecular features have been identified which orchestrate disease progression and clinical outcome in the malignancy. Therefore, determination of candidate molecular pathways for targeted therapy remains the mainstream idea of focus in ESCC research. In this review, we have discussed the key signaling pathways associated with ESCC, i.e., Notch, Wnt, and Nrf2 pathways, and their crosstalk during disease progression. We further discuss the recent developments of novel agents to target these pathways in the context of targeted cancer therapy. In-depth research of the signaling pathways, gene signatures, and a combinatorial approach may help in discovering targeted therapy for ESCC.

AB  - Objective This is a systematic review aimed at summarizing the evidence related to instruments that have been developed to measure stigma or attitudes toward epilepsy and on stigma-reducing interventions. Methods This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) standards. A broad literature search (1985-2019) was performed in 13 databases. Articles were included if they described the development and testing of psychometric properties of an epilepsy-related stigma or attitude scale or stigma-reducing interventions. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts, reviewed full-text articles, and extracted data. Basic descriptive statistics are reported. Results We identified 4234 abstracts, of which 893 were reviewed as full-text articles. Of these, 38 met inclusion criteria for an instrument development study and 30 as a stigma-reduction intervention study. Most instruments were initially developed using well-established methods and were tested in relatively large samples. Most intervention studies involved educational programs for adults with pre- and post-evaluations of attitudes toward people with epilepsy. Intervention studies often failed to use standardized instruments to quantify stigmatizing attitudes, were generally underpowered, and often found no evidence of benefit or the benefit was not sustained. Six intervention studies with stigma as the primary outcome had fewer design flaws and showed benefit. Very few or no instruments were validated for regional languages or culture, and there were very few interventions tested in some regions. Significance Investigators in regions without instruments should consider translating and further developing existing instruments rather than initiating the development of new instruments. Very few stigma-reduction intervention studies for epilepsy have been conducted, study methodology in general was poor, and standardized instruments were rarely used to measure outcomes. To accelerate the development of effective epilepsy stigma-reduction interventions, a paradigm shift from disease-specific, siloed trials to collaborative, cross-disciplinary platforms based upon unified theories of stigma transcending individual conditions will be needed.

KW  - PREVENTION
AB  - Background: Cervical cancer is a significant public health problem, with 570,000 new cases and 300,000 deaths of women per year globally, mostly in low-and middle-income countries. In 2018 the WHO Director General made a call to action for the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem. Main body: New thinking on programmatic approaches to introduce emerging technologies and screening and treatment interventions of cervical precancer at scale needed to achieve elimination goals. Implementation research (IR) is an important yet underused tool for facilitating scale-up of evidence-based screening and treatment interventions, as most research has focused on developing and evaluating new interventions. It is time for countries to define their specific IR needs to understand acceptability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of interventions as to design and ensure effective implementation, scale-up, and sustainability of evidence-based screening and treatment interventions. WHO convened an expert advisory group to identify priority IR questions for HPV-based screening and treatment interventions in population-based programmes. Several international organizations are supporting large scale introduction of screen-and-treat approaches in many countries, providing ideal platforms to evaluate different approaches and strategies in diverse national contexts. Conclusion: For reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality, the readiness of health systems, the reach and effectiveness of new technologies and algorithms for increasing screening and treatment coverage, and the factors that support sustainability of these programmes need to be better understood. Answering these key IR questions could provide actionable guidance for countries seeking to implement the WHO Global Strategy towards cervical cancer elimination.

AB  - The combination of Ocimum sanctum and Trigonella foenum-graecum L leaf water extract synergistically acts as a reducing and capping agent for the synthesis of narrow polydisperse silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with controlled sizes depending on the precursor (AgNO3) concentration in the plant extract. The toxicity of 40 nm-sized green synthesized Ag NPs is less than that of 10 nm-sized NPs. The Ag NP solution in Ocimum sanctum and Trigonella foenum-graecum L leaf water extract shows synergic antibacterial effect on Gram-negative bacteria by effecting the ester group of the lipids (hydrolysis) and also breaking the amide bonds of the bacterial chemical constituents, which leads to their rapid death.

TI  - Cost analysis of treating cardiovascular diseases in a super-specialty hospital
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - MEDICAL-CARE COSTS
AB  - Cardiovascular care is expensive; hence, economic evaluation is required to estimate resources being consumed and to ensure their optimal utilization. There is dearth of data regarding cost analysis of treating various diseases including cardiac diseases from developing countries. The study aimed to analyze resource consumption in treating cardio-vascular disease patients in a super-specialty hospital. An observational and descriptive study was carried out from April 2017 to June 2018 in the Department of Cardiology, Cardio-Thoracic (CT) Centre of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. As per World Health Organization, common cardiovascular diseases i.e. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), Cardiomyopathy, Congenital heart diseases, Cardiac Arrhythmias etc. were considered for cost analysis. Medical records of 100 admitted patients (Ward & Cardiac Care Unit) of cardiovascular diseases were studied till discharge and number of patient records for a particular CVD was identified using prevalence-based ratio of admitted CVD patient data. Traditional Costing and Time Driven Activity Based Costing (TDABC) methods were used for cost computation. Per bed per day cost incurred by the hospital for admitted patients in Cardiac Care Unit, adult and pediatric cardiology ward was calculated to be Indian Rupee (INR) 28,144 (US$ 434), INR 22,210 (US$ 342) and INR 18,774 (US$ 289), respectively. Inpatient cost constituted almost 70% of the total cost and equipment cost accounted for more than 50% of the inpatient cost followed by human resource cost (28%). Per patient cost of treating any CVD was computed to be INR 2,47,822 (US $ 3842). Cost of treating Rheumatic Heart Disease was the highest among all CVDs followed by Cardiomyopathy and other CVDs. Cost of treating cardiovascular diseases in India is less than what has been reported in developed countries. Findings of this study would aid policy makers considering recent radical changes and massive policy reforms ushered in by the Government of India in healthcare delivery.

AB  - Objective To review the evidence of felt and enacted stigma and attitudes toward persons living with epilepsy, and their determining factors. Methods Thirteen databases were searched (1985-2019). Abstracts were reviewed in duplicate and data were independently extracted using a standardized form. Studies were characterized using descriptive analysis by whether they addressed "felt" or "enacted" stigma and "attitudes" toward persons living with epilepsy. Results Of 4234 abstracts, 132 met eligibility criteria and addressed either felt or enacted stigma and 210 attitudes toward epilepsy. Stigma frequency ranged broadly between regions. Factors associated with enacted stigma included low level of knowledge about epilepsy, lower educational level, lower socioeconomic status, rural areas living, and religious grouping. Negative stereotypes were often internalized by persons with epilepsy, who saw themselves as having an "undesirable difference" and so anticipated being treated differently. Felt stigma was associated with increased risk of psychological difficulties and impaired quality of life. Felt stigma was linked to higher seizure frequency, recency of seizures, younger age at epilepsy onset or longer duration, lower educational level, poorer knowledge about epilepsy, and younger age. An important finding was the potential contribution of epilepsy terminology to the production of stigma. Negative attitudes toward those with epilepsy were described in 100% of included studies, and originated in any population group (students, teachers, healthcare professionals, general public, and those living with epilepsy). Better attitudes were generally noted in those of younger age or higher educational status. Significance Whatever the specific beliefs about epilepsy, implications for felt and enacted stigma show considerable commonality worldwide. Although some studies show improvement in attitudes toward those living with epilepsy over time, much work remains to be done to improve attitudes and understand the true occurrence of discrimination against persons with epilepsy.

AB  - Background: Mortality in infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is dynamic over the course of the disease, with type and timing of interventions as well as persistent organ failure being key determinants. The timing of infection onset and how it pertains to mortality is not well defined.
   Objectives: To determine the association between mortality and the development of early IPN.
   Methods: International multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients with IPN, confirmed by a positive microbial culture from (peri) pancreatic collections. The association between timing of infection onset, timing of interventions and mortality were assessed using Cox regression analyses.
   Results: A total of 743 patients from 19 centers across 3 continents with culture-confirmed IPN from 2000 to 2016 were evaluated, mortality rate was 20.9% (155/734). Early infection was associated with a higher mortality, when early infection occurred within the first 4 weeks from presentation with acute pancreatitis. After adjusting for comorbidity, advanced age, organ failure, enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition, early infection (<= 4 weeks) and early open surgery (<= 4 weeks) were associated with increased mortality [HR: 2.45 (95% CI: 1.63-3.67), p < 0.001 and HR: 4.88 (95% CI: 1.70-13.98), p = 0.003, respectively]. There was no association between late open surgery, early or late minimally invasive surgery, early or late percutaneous drainage with mortality (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Early infection was associated with increased mortality, independent of interventions. Early surgery remains a strong predictor of excess mortality. (C) 2021 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a vital role in apoptosis and cancer. Till date, there is no existing biosensor for detecting TNF-alpha in cancer patients serum samples. Here, a nano biosensor based on MoS2 nanoflower (nf) was fabricated for the recognition of TNF-alpha in cancer patients' serum. Hydrothermal method was employed for MoS2 nf synthesis followed by characterisation using various microscopy and spectroscopic techniques. The biosensor was fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of MoS2 nf onto indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate. The nanoflower morphology helped in the effective linker-free immobilization of antibodies on the surface of electrode via physical adsorption. The fabricated biosensor showed promising results within a broad linear detection range (1-200 pg ml(-1)) with limit of detection (LOD) as 0.202 pg ml(-1) and limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.01 pg ml(-1). The electrodes showed high sensitivity of 23.156 Omega pg(-1) ml cm(-2) with higher selectivity. Furthermore, the electrodes demonstrated a high correlation with the conventional technique, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for early screening of cancer patient serum samples.

AB  - It is advised that we should never hesitate in leaving the abdomen open when required. However, once the patient is stabilised, we should close it as soon as possible. But the factors which would hamper delayed primary fascial closure (DPFC) are not well studied. A retrospective 5-year analysis of patients with open abdomen (OA) after trauma laparotomy who survived was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups: those in which DPFC was possible and those in whom it was not. Out of the 58 patients that were recruited, DPFC could not be performed in 48 patients. Quantum of fluid resuscitation at 48 h was not associated with an inability to perform DPFC. Early definitive control of bleeding and damage control resuscitation are associated with the ability to perform DPFC in OA patients. Presence of blood stream infections (BSIs), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS) precluded DPFC.

AB  - Objective. Early aggressive therapy using biologicals is increasingly being used in JIA for early disease remission. Pulse steroids are used in induction regimes for rheumatic disorders such as SLE and systemic JIA; however, no controlled studies have demonstrated their use in non-systemic JIA. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulse dexamethasone therapy in children with treatment-naive non-systemic JIA as early aggressive therapy in resource-limited settings.
   Methods. Sixty treatment-naive children with non-systemic JIA with an active joint count of >= 5 and/or involvement of hip or cervical joints were randomized to receive either pulse dexamethasone (3 mg/kg/day, max 100 mg/day) or placebo (normal saline) for three consecutive days during each visit at 0, 6 (+/- 2) and 12 (+/- 2)weeks; along with standard therapy (MTX and NSAIDs). The use of oral bridge steroids was permissible for persistent severe disease as per predefined criteria. The primary outcome was ACR-Pedi 70 response at 16 (+/- 2)weeks after enrolment in the two groups.
   Results. The proportion of children achieving ACR-Pedi 70 in the two groups at last follow-up was 11/30 (36.7%) in pulse dexamethasone arm vs 11/28 (39.3%) in the placebo arm (P-value 0.837, relative risk 0.93, 95% CI 0.48, 1.80). We did not observe any significant difference in the proportion of children requiring bridge steroids. Adverse events were comparable in the two groups.
   Conclusion. The addition of pulse dexamethasone to standard treatment may not add any advantage in improving ACR-Pedi 70 scores at medium-term follow-up.

AB  - We aimed to compare surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) in prostate cancer patients with and without prior history of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), using a matched cohort analysis. In an IRB-approved protocol, all patients who underwent RARP at our institution between April 2005 and July 2018 with at least 1-year follow-up were included. Among these, patients who had undergone a previous TURP (Group A) were compared with those without TURP (Group B) using the Survival, Continence, and Potency outcomes reporting system. Using propensity score matching for age, PSA and Gleason score, the two cohorts were further subdivided in a 1:2 ratio into Group C (prior TURP from Group A) and Group D (without prior TURP from Group B). Similar comparisons were made between Group C and D. Patients in Group A (n = 40) had lower PSA (p = 0.031) and were more likely to have Gleason grade 1 disease (p = 0.035) than patients in Group B (n = 143). In the propensity-matched group analysis, patients of Group C (n = 38) had higher operative time and blood loss than Group D (n = 76) patients. Group C patients also had lower continence at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. However, oncological and potency outcomes were similar in both the groups. We concluded that previous TURP is a predictor for surgical and continence outcomes following RARP. Even though these patients have a potentially lower stage or grade of disease, they are less likely to achieve social continence than men who have not had a previous TURP. This information would be important in counseling them for treatment options.

AB  - Despite advances in testing for coeliac disease over the past two decades, awareness of this disease remains suboptimal worldwide. Here, Makharia and colleagues summarize the current knowledge of epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis and follow-up of coeliac disease and highlight opportunities for future research.
   Coeliac disease is a systemic disorder characterized by immune-mediated enteropathy, which is caused by gluten ingestion in genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical presentation of coeliac disease is highly variable and ranges from malabsorption through solely extra-intestinal manifestations to asymptomatic. As a result, the majority of patients with coeliac disease remain undiagnosed, misdiagnosed or experience a substantial delay in diagnosis. Coeliac disease is diagnosed by a combination of serological findings of disease-related antibodies and histological evidence of villous abnormalities in duodenal biopsy samples. However, variability in histological grading and in the diagnostic performance of some commercially available serological tests remains unacceptably high and confirmatory assays are not readily available in many parts of the world. Currently, the only effective treatment for coeliac disease is a lifelong, strict, gluten-free diet. However, many barriers impede patients' adherence to this diet, including lack of widespread availability, high cost, cross-contamination and its overall restrictive nature. Routine follow-up is necessary to ensure adherence to a gluten-free diet but considerable variation is evident in follow-up protocols and the optimal disease management strategy is not clear. However, these challenges in the diagnosis and management of coeliac disease suggest opportunities for future research.

AB  - Background Despite significant economic growth and development, undernutrition among children remains a major public health challenge for low- and middle-income countries in the twenty-first century. In Millennium Development Goals, India committed halving the prevalence of underweight children by 2015. This study aimed to explain the geographical variation in child malnutrition level and understand the socio-biomedical predictors of child nutrition in India. Methods We used the data from India's National Family Health Survey 2015-2016. The survey provided estimates of stunting, wasting, and underweight at the national, state, and district level to measure nutritional status of under-five children. Level of stunting, wasting and underweight at the district level are considered as outcome variables. We have used variance inflation factor to check the multicollinearity between potential predictors of nutrition. In this study, we performed spatial analysis using ArcGIS and multiple linear regression analysis using Stata version 15. Results Five states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Meghalaya) had very high prevalence of stunting (40% and above). High prevalence of wasting was documented in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Karnataka (23 to 29%). Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh had the highest proportion of underweight children in the country. We found that electricity and clean fuel use in the household, use of iodized salt, and level of exclusive breastfeeding had significantly negative influence on the stunting level in the districts. The use of iodized salt has similar effect on the wasting status of under-five children in the districts (b: - 0.27, p < 0.10). Further, underweight level had a negative association with clean fuel use for cooking (b: - 0.17, p < 0.01), use of iodized salt (b: - 0.36, p < 0.10), breastfeeding within one hour (b: - 0.18, p < 0.10), semisolid/solid food within 6-8 months (b: - 0.11, p < 0.05) and Gross Domestic Product of the districts (b: - 0.53, p < 0.10). Conclusion In the study, a variety of factors including electricity and clean fuel use in the household, use of iodized salt, level of exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding within one hour, semisolid/solid food within 6-8 months and Gross Domestic Product of the districts have a significant association with nutritional status of children.

AB  - Management and control of hemoglobinopathies are a challenge in India where 67.0% of people reside in rural regions. The GDP spent on health is one of the lowest (1.3%) resulting in high out-of-pocket expenses. The beta-thalassemias are prevalent with an estimated 7500-12000 new births each year. Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T) and Hb E (HBB: c.79G>A) are also common regionally. Over 80 beta-thalassemia (beta-thal) mutations have been characterized in Indians. The delta gene mutations are increasingly being described and their coinheritance in beta-thal carriers leads to a reduction in Hb A(2) levels and a misdiagnosis of carriers. Around 15-20 centers offer prenatal diagnosis (PND) mainly in urban regions. The projected annual cost of care of beta-thal patients over a decade (2016-2026) will increase from INR30,000 (US$448) million to INR55,000 (US$820) million if all patients are adequately treated. Cost comparisons are difficult to make with other international studies as the standard of care, cost of medicines and other services vary in different countries. Several centers provide hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) for thalassemias, however, only around 250 HSCTs are done annually. Although the cost is high, financial assistance is available for a few patients. There are disparities in the quality of care and to address this a National Policy has been proposed for the management and prevention of hemoglobinopathies that will embark on a comprehensive program, providing adequate care and augmenting the existing public health care services. It will also include training, genetic counseling and easier access to preventive options and a National Registry.

KW  - EFFICACY
AB  - Background: Evidence for the benefit of applying Fluoride Varnish FV to permanent teeth is generally very positive. However, the caries-inhibiting effect of FVs on primary teeth is still debatable. Aim: To assess the effectiveness of fluoride varnish in prevention of early childhood caries in children over the period of 3 years in high fluoride areas. Study design: A double-blind cluster-randomized controlled trial was undertaken amongst 3-4 years old children. The varnish application was done at three points in the intervention group. Results: Experimental group showed significantly lesser increment in mean ICDAS score than control group at both 12 month and 36 months. Preventive fraction was 72.4% at 12 months and 18.2% at 36 months. Multiple linear regression showed that at 12 months, intervention was the significant predictor with varnish group having 0.140 (95% CI 0.175-0.230) lower net caries increment. At 36 months, baseline ICDAS score and intervention were the significant predictors. Conclusion: This study suggests that fluoride varnish is an effective and a safe mode of prevention of early childhood caries in children residing in high fluoride zone. However, the overall effect is influenced by the baseline caries status.

AB  - Purpose To correlate histopathological changes of trabecular meshwork (TM) with clinical features in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Methods This was a prospective interventional study including 66 eyes of 39 PCG children aged <= 12 months at diagnosis. Corneal clarity, corneal diameter (CD), intraocular pressure (IOP) and cup disc ratio (C:D ratio) were assessed at baseline and at 1-year follow-up. The trabecular meshwork (TM) specimens obtained during primary combined trabeculectomy and trabeculotomy augmented with Mitomycin-C were evaluated on light microscopy to look for eosinophilic membrane (EM), status of trabecular beams and trabecular endothelial cells (TEC), presence of intervening spaces, TM thickness and TEC count which were then correlated with clinical features. Results At 1-year follow-up, IOP reduced from 27.96 +/- 10.2 to 11.88 +/- 5.63 mm Hg, p<0.001, C:D ratio decreased from 0.65 +/- 0.34 to 0.49 +/- 0.06, p=0.036, and the bleb had a significant tendency to change from well formed (59-46) to flat type (3-6) or thin, cystic type (4-14) (p=0.014). Presence of EM on the cameral surface was associated with a lower baseline IOP. Fused trabecular beams were associated with higher baseline IOP. The TM was significantly thicker in eyes with IOP >20 mm Hg at presentation (1.86 +/- 0.7 mm vs 1.3 +/- 0.47 mm, p=0.0356). Eyes with IOP <= 14 mm Hg at final follow-up had lower TEC count than eyes with IOP >14 mm Hg (0.92 +/- 0.45 cells/mm(2) vs 1.00 +/- 0.74 cells/mm(2), p=0.0028). Conclusion A light microscopic analysis of surgical specimens may guide prognosis of PCG. However, larger studies are required to validate these results.

AB  - Purpose:To describe the surgical results of concomitantly performed optical penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) with glued intrascleral haptic fixation (ISHF).Methods:Retrospective review of 18 patients (15-72 years) with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of <= 1/60 subjected to unilateral concomitant optical PKP with ISHF and followed up for 13.11 +/- 5.83 months (6-26 months) was undertaken.Results:The most common diagnoses were failed PKP (9/18, 50%) followed by aphakic bullous keratopathy (5/18, 27%). Preoperative glaucoma, peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS), and deep vascularization were present in 7/18 (38.88%), 12/18 (61.11%), and 5/18 (27.77%) patients, respectively. Intraoperatively, concomitant procedures such as pupilloplasty and intraocular lens explant were undertaken in 5/18 (27.277%) patients and 1/18 patients (5.55%) experienced suprachoroidal hemorrhage. At final follow-up, BCVA was >= 6/60 in 50% patients (mean astigmatism: 4.79 +/- 1.68D), and 55.55% cases experienced graft failure (90% failed within one year of surgery). The most common causes of graft failure were glaucoma (50%), glaucoma with rejection (20%), rejection (10%), retinal detachment (10%), and suprachoroidal hemorrhage (10%). The ODDS ratio (OR) of having graft failure with the following factors was postoperative secondary interventions (OR: 6), postoperative complications (OR: 2.25), prior failed graft (OR: 1.8), preoperative PAS (OR: 1.75), intraoperative concomitant procedures (OR: 1.5), preoperative glaucoma (OR: 1.33), previous surgeries (OR: 1.24), and deep corneal vessels (OR: 0.66).Conclusion:All patients underlying PKP combined with glued ISHF must be counseled about suboptimal surgical outcomes. Emphasis is laid on appropriate case selection and stringent follow-up during the first year after surgery. Secondary interventions should be undertaken cautiously and judiciously in these patients.

AB  - Simple Summary Tumor biomarkers are molecules at genetic or protein level, or certain evaluable characteristics. These help in perfecting patient management. Over the past decade, advanced and more sensitive techniques have led to the identification of many new biomarkers in the field of oncology. A knowledge of the recent developments is essential for their application to clinical practice, and furthering research. This review provides a comprehensive account of such various markers identified in thyroid carcinoma, the most common endocrine malignancy. While some of these have been brought into use in routine patient management, others are novel and need more research before clinical application. Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy. Recent developments in molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical behavior of thyroid neoplasms. This has culminated in the updating of thyroid tumor classification, including the re-categorization of existing and introduction of new entities. In this review, we discuss various molecular biomarkers possessing diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and therapeutic roles in thyroid cancer. A comprehensive account of epigenetic dysregulation, including DNA methylation, the function of various microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, germline mutations determining familial occurrence of medullary and non-medullary thyroid carcinoma, and single nucleotide polymorphisms predisposed to thyroid tumorigenesis has been provided. In addition to novel immunohistochemical markers, including those for neuroendocrine differentiation, and next-generation immunohistochemistry (BRAF V600E, RAS, TRK, and ALK), the relevance of well-established markers, such as Ki-67, in current clinical practice has also been discussed. A tumor microenvironment (PD-L1, CD markers) and its influence in predicting responses to immunotherapy in thyroid cancer and the expanding arena of techniques, including liquid biopsy based on circulating nucleic acids and plasma-derived exosomes as a non-invasive technique for patient management, are also summarized.

AB  - Objective: Early detection of peripheral neuropathy is extremely important as leprosy is one of the treatable causes of peripheral neuropathy. The study was undertaken to assess the role of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in ulnar neuropathy in leprosy patients.
   Methods: This was a case-control study including 38 patients (72 nerves) and 5 controls (10 nerves) done between January 2017 and June 2019. Skin biopsy proven cases of leprosy, having symptoms of ulnar neuropathy (proven on nerve conduction study) were included. MRI was performed on a 3 T MR system. Mean cross-sectional area, fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of ulnar nerve at cubital tunnel were calculated. Additional ancillary findings and appearance of base sequences were evaluated.
   Results: Ulnar nerve showed thickening with altered T2W signal in all the affected nerves, having an average cross-sectional area of 0.26 cm(2). Low FA with mean of 0.397 +/- 0.19 and high ADC with mean of 1.28 +/- 0.427 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s of ulnar nerve in retrocondylar groove was obtained. In the control group, mean cross-sectional area was 0.71cm(2) with mean FA and ADC of 0.53 +/- 0.088 and 1.03 +/- 0.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s respectively. Statistically no significant difference was seen in diseased and control group. Cut-off to detect neuropathy for FA and ADC is 0.4835 and 1.1020 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s respectively.
   Conclusion: DTI though is challenging in peripheral nerves, however, is proving to be a powerful complementary tool for assessment of peripheral neuropathy. Our study validates its utility in infective neuropathies.
   Advances in knowledge: 1. DTI is a potential complementary tool for detection of peripheral neuropathies and can be incorporated in standard MR neurography protocol.
   2. In leprosy-related ulnar neuropathy, altered signal intensity with thickening or abscess of the nerve is appreciated along with locoregional nodes and secondary denervation changes along with reduction of FA and rise in ADC value.
   3. Best cut-offs obtained in our study for FA and ADC are 0.4835 and 1.1020 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s respectively.

AB  - Background: Vitiligo places a significant psycho-social burden on caregivers and family members. Aims: The aim of the study was to develop and preliminarily validate a scale to measure the psychosocial impact of vitiligo on adult family members. Methods: Themes that emerged from qualitative interviews and a focus group discussion with family members were used to generate items for a preliminary scale, followed by pre-testing and scale development. The new scale was then tested with two comparator scales and a global question. Results: A preliminary scale with 32 items was pilot tested on 30 participants. Following this, the scale was condensed to 16 items in 12 domains that were administered to 159 participants. Scale scores ranged from 0 to 48 with a mean of 19.75 +/- 12.41. The scale had excellent internal consistency with Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.92 (0.70-0.95) and also showed good test-retest reliability at two weeks (r = 0.946). The scale showed criterion, convergent and known group validity. Limitations: It was conducted in a large teaching hospital which may have resulted in selection of patients with persistent or progressive disease and more worried family members. Vitiligo is highly stigmatized in our country and the performance of the scale may need to be evaluated in other communities and cultures as well where stigma is less oppressive. Conclusion: Family Vitiligo Impact Scale appears to be an easy-to-complete, reliable and valid instrument to measure the psychosocial impact of vitiligo in family members of patients. It may be useful as an outcome measure in both clinical and research settings.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the variation between the non-syndromic cleft lip and/or palate (NSCLP) and non-cleft (NC) subjects in relation to the lip morphology (LM) and nasolabial angle (NLA). Materials and Methods: Lateral cephalogram (Late. Ceph.) of 123 individuals (92 NSCLP [29 = bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP), 41 = unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), 9 = unilateral cleft lip and alveolus (UCLA), 13 = unilateral cleft lip (UCL)], and 31 NC) who did not undergo any orthodontic treatment were investigated. By WebCeph, an artificial intelligence- (A.I.) driven software, 2 (two) parameters of LM, namely upper lip to E line (LM-1) and lower lip to E line (LM-2), and NLA analysis was carried out for each individual. Multiple tests were carried out for statistical analysis. Results: The mean +/- SD observed for LM-1, LM-2, and NLA for NC individuals were 1.56 +/- 2.98, 0.49 +/- 3.51, and 97.20 +/- 16.10, respectively. On the other hand, the mean +/- SD of LM-1, LM-2, and NLA for NSCLP individuals were 4.55 +/- 4.23, 1.68 +/- 2.82, and 82.02 +/- 14.66, respectively. No significant variation was observed with respect to gender and side. NSCLP (different types) and NC individuals showed significant disparities in LM-1 and NLA. Conclusion: It can be concluded that parameters of lip morphology such as LM-1, LM-2, and NLA vary among NSCLP and NC individuals.

AB  - Background In estimating the global burden of cancer, adolescents and young adults with cancer are often overlooked, despite being a distinct subgroup with unique epidemiology, clinical care needs, and societal impact. Comprehensive estimates of the global cancer burden in adolescents and young adults (aged 15-39 years) are lacking. To address this gap, we analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, with a focus on the outcome of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), to inform global cancer control measures in adolescents and young adults.
   Methods Using the GBD 2019 methodology, international mortality data were collected from vital registration systems, verbal autopsies, and population-based cancer registry inputs modelled with mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Incidence was computed with mortality estimates and corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated using modelled survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as age-specific cancer deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death. The main outcome was DALYs (the sum of YLLs and YLDs). Estimates were presented globally and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles (countries ranked and divided into five equal SDI groups), and all estimates were presented with corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). For this analysis, we used the age range of 15-39 years to define adolescents and young adults.
   Findings There were 1.19 million (95% UI 1.11-1.28) incident cancer cases and 396 000 (370 000-425 000) deaths due to cancer among people aged 15-39 years worldwide in 2019. The highest age-standardised incidence rates occurred in high SDI (59.6 [54.5-65.7] per 100 000 person-years) and high-middle SDI countries (53.2 [48.8-57.9] per 100 000 person-years), while the highest age-standardised mortality rates were in low-middle SDI (14.2 [12.9-15.6] per 100 000 person-years) and middle SDI (13.6 [12.6-14.8] per 100 000 person-years) countries. In 2019, adolescent and young adult cancers contributed 23.5 million (21.9-25.2) DALYs to the global burden of disease, of which 2.7% (1.9-3.6) came from YLDs and 97.3% (96.4-98.1) from YLLs. Cancer was the fourth leading cause of death and tenth leading cause of DALYs in adolescents and young adults globally.
   Interpretation Adolescent and young adult cancers contributed substantially to the overall adolescent and young adult disease burden globally in 2019. These results provide new insights into the distribution and magnitude of the adolescent and young adult cancer burden around the world. With notable differences observed across SDI settings, these estimates can inform global and country-level cancer control efforts. Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: The available endoscopic techniques for ureterocele decompression include laser puncture (LP), electrosurgical incision (ES), and cold-knife incision. This systematic review was performed to compare the efficacy of LP versus ES techniques with special emphasis on de novo VUR. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched by the authors. The inclusion criteria were all comparative studies in which ureterocele decompression was performed by either LP or ES endoscopic techniques. Outcomes including the incidence of de novo VUR, the need for endoscopic retreatment of the ureterocele, and the need for secondary surgical procedures were studied. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for all outcomes and the Mantel-Haenszel method was utilized for the estimation of pooled RR. The methodological quality was assessed by the Downs and Black scale. Results: Five studies were considered for systematic review, while four of them were included in the meta-analysis. Out of 202 children, 67 developed de novo VUR. Significantly lower rates of reflux were observed in the LP group vis-a-vis ES group (RR = 0.17, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.32, p < 0.00001). Endoscopic retreatment rates (n = 20) demonstrated no significant difference among the two patient groups (RR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.26-1.68, p = 0.38). A total of 46 secondary procedures were performed in 170 children, mostly ureteral re-implantations, with a significantly lower need of secondary surgeries following LP versus ES (RR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.49, p < 0.0001). The risk of bias in the included studies was low-to-moderate. Conclusions: When compared to the ES technique, the LP technique is associated with a significantly low incidence of de novo VUR and requirement for secondary surgeries (particularly anti-reflux surgeries). Endoscopic retreatment rates showed no significant difference between the two techniques. However, due to the moderate risk of bias in two out of four included studies, randomized controlled trials are needed in the future.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects of submucosally administered platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on the rate of maxillary canine retraction. Levels of soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-Kb ligand (sRANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) were also measured over 2 months. Materials and Methods: This split-mouth trial involved 20 sites in 10 subjects randomly assigned to PRP (experimental) side and control side. After alignment, the freshly prepared PRP was injected submucosally distal to the experimental side maxillary canine, and retraction was performed using NiTi closed-coil springs (150 g) on 0.019 3 0.025-inch stainless steel wire. The rate of canine movement was assessed using digital model superimposition at 0, 30, and 60 days. The OPG and sRANKL were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from GCF collected at 0, 1, 7, 21, 30, and 60 days. Results: Twenty sites were analyzed using paired t test. The rate of tooth movement increased significantly by 35% on the PRP side compared with the control side in the first month (P = .0001) and by 14% at the end of the second month (P= .015). Using the Mann-Whitney U test, OPG levels were found to be significantly decreased on the 7th (P = .003) and 30th day on the PRP side (P = .01), while sRANKL became detectable by the third week postinjection on the PRP side (P = .069). Conclusions: Submucosal injection of platelet-rich plasma significantly increased tooth movement during the 60-day observation period. Local injection of PRP significantly altered the levels of OPG and sRANKL in GCF. (Angle Orthod. 2022;92:73-79.)

KW  - RELAPSE
AB  - Objectives: The Government of India prohibited the sale of tobacco products during the COVID-19 lockdown to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study assessed the tobacco cessation behaviour and its predictors among adult tobacco users during the initial COVID-19 lockdown period in India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 801 adult tobacco users (both smoking and smokeless tobacco) in two urban metropolitan cities of India over a 2-month period (July to August 2020). The study assessed complete tobacco cessation and quit attempts during the lockdown period. Logistic and negative binomial regression models were used to study the correlates of tobacco cessation and quit attempts, respectively. Results: In total, 90 (11.3%) tobacco users reported that they had quit using tobacco after the COVID-19 lockdown period. Overall, a median of two quit attempts (interquartile range 0-6) was made by tobacco users. Participants with good knowledge on the harmful effects of tobacco use and COVID-19 were significantly more likely to quit tobacco use (odds ratio [OR] 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-4.0) and reported more quit attempts (incidence risk ratio 5.7; 95% CI 2.8-11.8) compared to those with poor knowledge. Participants who had access to tobacco products were less likely to quit tobacco use compared to those who had no access (OR 0.3; 95% CI 0.2-0.5]. Conclusions: Access restrictions and correct knowledge on the harmful effects of tobacco use and COVID19 can play an important role in creating a conducive environment for tobacco cessation among users.

AB  - Purpose: The Castroviejo caliper is routinely used for measuring the corneal diameter in patients with primary congenital glaucoma, but needs an examination under anesthesia (EUA) or sedation. A simple U-shaped tool was devised to aid in the estimation of the corneal diameters of patients in settings where an ophthalmic caliper is not available or EUA is not feasible. Methods: Infants presenting to the congenital glaucoma clinic posted for EUA were recruited. The demographic details of the patients such as age, sex, and diagnosis were noted. A simple U-shaped tool was devised using three Schirmer strips or a printable ruler. Before the patient underwent a EUA, the corneal diameters were measured using the U-tool. During EUA, corneal diameters were measured using the Castroviejo caliper. Results: The mean age of infants was 6.7 +/- 3.39 months (R = 1-12). The mean corneal diameter measured using the U-tool was 13.29 +/- 1.33 mm and with Castroviejo caliper was 13.18 +/- 1.39 mm. The difference between the corneal diameters measured using the two techniques was -0.114 mm with the Bland-Altman plot 95% Limits of agreement (LoA) from -0.965 to 0.737 mm. Corneal diameters measured with both instruments had a good correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.95, P < 0.001). Conclusion: U-tool can be used for screening congenital glaucoma by first-contact physicians or optometrists. It can also be used by ophthalmologists when EUA is delayed.

AB  - Background: Gut microbiota plays an important role in the development of different diseases including colorectal cancer. The geography, lifestyle, and dietary habits of Indians are different from Western world, thus microbiome studies of Western population could not be extrapolated to their Indian counterparts. Method: Therefore, we have conducted a study on gut microbiota in Indian healthy subjects and patients of colon cancer using 16S ribosomal RNA Amplicon sequencing. Operational taxonomic units were calculated for different bacterial taxon including phylum, class, order, family, and genus level. Results: Observed results indicated a considerable difference in the bacterial diversity in both the groups. Phylum Firmicutes was significantly dominated in both the groups followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria which clearly indicates the dominance of phylum Firmicutes in Indian population. Phylum Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were significantly abundant in the healthy group while phylum Bacteroidetes in the colon cancer group. Bacterial genera Megamonas, Megasphaera, Mitsuokella, and Streptococcus were significantly abundant in the healthy group and Veillonella, Prevotella, and Eubacterium in the colon cancer group. Bacterial genus Bradyrhizobium was present in the healthy group and Alistipes, Coprococcus, Dorea, and Rhodococcus were present in the colon cancer group but absent in the healthy group. Conclusion: There was a considerable difference in bacterial diversity in both the study groups indicating dysbiosis in the colon cancer group.

AB  - Background: Primary extramedullary plasmacytomas (EMP) are rare; however, secondary forms may be seen in similar to 10-15% of patients with systemic multiple myeloma (MM). The diagnosis of EMP is based on the demonstration of monoclonal plasma cells in the lesion, which requires tissue sampling.
   Case Presentation: We present a case of a 38 year old female with MM who underwent diagnostic US at our institute. Multiple focal liver lesions were detected, which were suspicious for EMP. She underwent fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for diagnosis, following which she developed hemoperitoneum secondary to deranged clotting parameters (prothrombin time and platelet count). CT angiography revealed active hepatic capsular bleed. She was taken up for percutaneous embolisation, and the supplying vessel successfully embolised using gel foam particles.
   Conclusion: Complications may rarely occur in interventional procedures, particularly in patients with comorbidities. However, prompt diagnosis and management help prevent adverse outcomes.

AB  - Loss of lean muscle mass impairs immunity and increases mortality risk among individuals with HIV/AIDS. We evaluated the relative contributions of protein supplementation and nutrition education on body composition among 600 women living with HIV/AIDS in rural Andhra Pradesh, India. We conducted a cluster randomized controlled 2 x 2 factorial trial lasting six months with follow up at twelve and eighteen months. Interventions occurred in the Nellore and Prakasam regions of Andhra Pradesh by trained village women, ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists), and included: (1) the usual supportive care from ASHA (UC); (2) UC plus nutrition education (NE); (3) UC plus nutritional protein supplementation (NS); (4) combined UC plus NE plus NS. A Bioimpedance Analyzer Model 310e measured body composition. SAS 9.4 analyzed all data. Mixed models using repeated measures evaluated lean mass change from baseline as primary and fat weight and total weight as secondary outcomes. Lean mass change was significantly associated with NS (p = 0.0001), NE (p = 0.0001), and combined NS plus NE (p = 0.0001), with similar associations for secondary outcomes. Stronger associations for total weight were observed with greater ART adherence. Nutritional interventions may improve physiologic response to HIV. Significant increases in lean mass resulted from independent and combined protein supplementation and nutrition education.

AB  - The epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFI) is ever evolving. The aim of the present study was to analyze the clinical, microbiological, susceptibility, and outcome data of IFI in Indian patients to identify determinants of infection and 30-day mortality. Proven and probable/putative IFI (defined according to modified European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group and AspICU criteria) from April 2017 to December 2018 were evaluated in a prospective observational study. All recruited patients were antifungal naive (n = 3300). There were 253 episodes of IFI (7.6%) with 134 (52.9%) proven and 119 (47%) probable/putative infections. There were four major clusters of infection: invasive candidiasis (IC) (n = 53, 20.9%), cryptococcosis (n = 34, 13.4%), invasive aspergillosis (IA) (n = 103, 40.7%), and mucormycosis (n = 62, 24.5%). The significant risk factors were high particulate efficiency air (HEPA) room admission, ICU admission, prolonged exposure to corticosteroids, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease (CLD), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), coronary arterial disease (CAD), trauma, and multiorgan involvement (p < 0.5; odds ratio: >1). The all-cause 30-day mortality was 43.4% (n = 110). It varied by fungal group: 52.8% (28/53) in IC, 58.8% (20/34) in cryptococcosis, 39.8% (41/103) in IA, and 33.9% (21/62) in mucormycosis. HEPA room, ICU admission for IC; HEPA rooms, diabetes mellitus for cryptococcosis; hematological malignancies, chronic kidney disease (CKD), sepsis, galactomannan antigen index value >= 1 for IA and nodules; and ground glass opacities on radiology for mucormycosis were significant predictors of death (odds ratio >1). High minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for azoles were observed in C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, A. fumigatus, A. flavus, R. arrhizus, R. microsporus, and M. circinelloides. For echinocandin, high MIC values were seen in C. tropicalis, C. guillermondii, C. glabrata, and A. fumigatus. This study highlights the shift in epidemiology and also raises concern of high MICs to azoles among our isolates. It warrants regular surveillance, which can provide the local clinically correlated microbiological data to clinicians and which might aid in guiding patient treatment.

AB  - Introduction: Timely, affordable, and sustained interventions reduce the risk of heart attack or Stroke in people with a high total risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Risk prediction tools are available to estimate the cardiovascular risk using information on multiple variables. CVD risk charts prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) has laboratory-based and non-laboratory-based charts with the latter meant for use in resource limited settings. We conducted a study to determine concordance between the laboratory-and non-laboratory risk charts and to estimate the prevalence of selected CVD risk factors in a rural Indian population.Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in rural area of Ballabgarh in district Faridabad, Haryana. Sample of 1,018 participants aged 30-69 years was selected randomly from study area. Information on CVDs risk factors was obtained using WHO STEPS questionnaire, anthropometry and laboratory investigation. Risk distribution among the study participants was observed. Concordance between laboratory-and non-laboratory-based WHO CVD risk charts was determined using agreement analysis.Results: The mean age of the study participants was 43.9 (8.9) years and 55.6% participants were women. Among various CVD risk factors, hypertension (39.4%) was the major factor followed by overweight (34.1%) was found to be major factor, followed by current smoking (23.6%) and hypercholesterolemia (18.7%). The concordance between the two charts was 83.3% with kappa value of 0.64. Considering laboratory -based charts as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of non-laboratory -based risk charts at 5% risk as cut-off was 86.5% and 90.3% respectively.Conclusion: The study shows a good agreement between the laboratory-based and non-laboratory-based risk charts. Thus non-laboratory-based risk charts are suitable for risk estimation of CVDs for use in resource limited settings like India.

TI  - Utility of serum Galactomannan in diagnosing COVID-19 patients with suspected IPA: an observational study in resource limited settings
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis
KW  - Galactomannan
KW  - Pre-emptive
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the utility of Galactomannan (GM) antigen as a screening marker for diagnosing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: The serum samples from patients with severe COVID-19 diseases admitted to the Critical Care Unit were collected on the 5th day of admission for GM screening. The samples were analysed by enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA) and GM index of more than 1 was considered as positive. All GM positive patients were serially followed until discharge or death.
   RESULTS: The GM was raised in serum of 12 out of 38 patients, indicating an incidence of possible COVID-19 associated IPA (CAPA) in 31.57% of patients. The median age of these CAPA patients was 56.5 years, males were significantly more affected than females. The inflammatory marker serum ferritin was raised in all 12 patients (median value of 713.74 ng/ml), while IL-6 was raised in 9 patients (median value of 54.13 ng/ml). None of these patients received antifungals. Their median length of hospital stay was 20 days (IQR: 12, 34 days). All these patients succumbed to the illness.
   CONCLUSIONS: The serum GM appears to be sensitive diagnostic tool to identify early IPA in COVID-19 patients and pre-emptive antifungal therapy could play a role in salvaging these patients.

AB  - Introduction: Not much is known about impact of 1918 Influenza on patients confined inside mental asylums of that period.Aim and Methods: The study aimed to assess impact of Influenza pandemic on mentally ill patients in asylums, based on data extracted from provincial asylum reports (1915-1923) from British India.Results: The asylum population in most provinces was impacted both in terms of direct mortality (1918) as well as all-cause morbidity and mortality (1918; 1918-1920). Agra and Oudh lost 9.5% of average daily asylum strength directly due to influenza in 1918. All-cause mortality (1918) was highest for mental asylum/s in provinces of Agra and Oudh (16.83%), Punjab (14.83%), and Bombay (14.4%). Isolated outbreaks continued till 1923. Another peculiar finding was markedly reduced sickness and death rates in 1921-1923 compared to 1915-1917, across asylums of all provinces.Conclusion: Findings point to a significant impact of Influenza pandemic in mental asylums across several provinces, and provide historical insights with implications for the current pandemic.

T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Anterior commissure
KW  - hippocampal commissure
KW  - interhemispheric approach
KW  - minimally invasive epilepsy surgery
KW  - posterior commissure
AB  - Background: Corpus callosotomy (CC) is a major disconnection procedure that functionally isolates the cerebral hemispheres, thereby interrupting the spread of epileptic activity from one hemisphere to the other. It is extremely useful in children suffering from non-localized drug refractory epilepsy, especially drop attacks. The technique has evolved from microscopic to minimally invasive endoscopic surgery. The extent of callosotomy also varies based on the institutional practices ranging from anterior 1/3rd to total corpus callosotomies (TCC). The performance of TCC in conjunction with anterior, posterior, and hippocampal commissurotomies was described for the first time by the senior author from our institution.
   Objective: To describe the technique of performing endoscopic total corpus callosotomy, and pan commissurotomy using the interhemispheric corridor.
   Methods: A 12-year-old girl with seizure onset at the age of 10 years presented with aura of fear and nausea followed by tonic deviation of eyes to the right, and blinking with speech arrest. There were tonic-clonic movements of the right-side limbs along with ictal spitting, and occasional deviation of the angle of mouth to the right. Patient had loss of awareness for the event along with postictal confusion that lasted a few minutes.
   Results: Video electroencephalography (VEEG) revealed left parieto-central and left temporal localization. Serial MRI brain over three years revealed progressive left hemispheric changes suggestive of Rasmussen's encephalitis. Patient underwent left-sided endoscopic hemispherotomy. At two-year follow up, the patient was seizure-free (ILAE Class 1).
   Conclusion: Endoscopic corpus callosotomy and pan commissurotomy using the interhemispheric corridor is an elegant and minimally invasive technique best suited for appropriately selected children with refractory epilepsy.

AB  - The epidemic of obesity or adiposity-based chronic diseases presents a significant challenge with the rising prevalence of morbidities and mortality due to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The underlying pathophysiology of metabolic inflexibility is a common thread linking insulin resistance to cardiometabolic-based chronic disease (CMBCD), including dysglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia progressing to downstream ASCVD events. The complex CMBCD paradigm in the LMIC population within the socio-economic and cultural context highlights considerable heterogeneity of disease predisposition, clinical patterns, and socio-medical needs. This review intends to summarize the current knowledge of CMBCD. We describe recently established or emerging trends for managing risk factors, assessment tools for evaluating ASCVD risk, and various pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures particularly relevant for LMICs. A CMBCD model positions insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction at the summit of the disease spectrum may improve outcomes at a lower cost in LMICs. Despite identifying multiple pathophysiologic disturbances constituting CMBCD, a large percentage of the patient at risk for ASCVD remains undefined. Targeting dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension using antihypertensive, statins, anti-glycemic, and antiplatelet agents has reduced the incidence of ASCVD. Thus, primordial prevention targeting pathophysiological changes that cause abnormalities in adiposity and primary prevention by detecting and managing risk factors remains the foundation for CMBCD management. Therefore, targeting pathways that address mitochondrial dysfunction would exert a beneficial effect on metabolic inflexibility that may potentially correct insulin resistance, beta cell dysfunction and, consequently, would be therapeutically effective across the entire continuum of CMBCD.

AB  - Mutational Signatures and Tumor mutational burden (TMB) have emerged as prognostic biomarkers in cancer genomics. However, the association of TMB with overall survival (OS) is still unknown in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. Further, the change in the mutational spectrum involving both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations as MGUS progresses to MM is unexplored. This study addresses both these aspects via extensive evaluation of the mutations in MGUS and NDMM. WES data of 1018 NDMM patients and 61 MGUS patients collected from three different global regions were analyzed in this study. Single base substitutions, mutational signatures and TMB were inferred from the variants identified in MGUS and MM patients. The cutoff value for TMB was estimated to divide patients into low TMB and high TMB (hypermutators) groups. This study finds a change in the mutational spectrum with a statistically significant increase from MGUS to MM. There was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of all the three categories of variants, non-synonymous (NS), synonymous (SYN), and others (OTH), from MGUS to MM (P 0.05). However, there was a statistically significant rise in the TMB values for TMB_NS and TMB_SYN only. We also observed that 3' and 5'UTR mutations were more frequent in MM and might be responsible for driving MGUS to MM via regulatory binding sites. NDMM patients were also examined separately along with their survival outcomes. The frequency of hypermutators was low in MM with poor OS and PFS outcome. We observed a statistically significant rise in the frequency of C A and C>T substitutions and a statistically significant decline in T>G substitutions in the MM patients with poor outcomes. Additionally, there was a statistically significant increase in the TMB of the patients with poor outcome compared to patients with a superior outcome. A statistically significant association between the APOBEC activity and poor overall survival in MM was discovered. These findings have potential clinical relevance and can assist in designing risk-adapted therapies to inhibit the progression of MGUS to MM and prolong the overall survival in high-risk MM patients.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the mental well-being of the population and posed many challenges in availing mental healthcare. Telepsychiatry has been proven to be an effective route for the delivery of mental healthcare. We share our experience of using the telemedicine approach in providing mental health services at a tertiarycare hospital in India during the COVID-19 pandemic, following the break in routine outpatient services during the national lockdown. The telepsychiatry approach helped in ensuring the maintenance of mental healthcare. The utility of telepsychiatry as an option for such future situations and for its use in routine follow up care in indicated cases, have also been discussed.

AB  - Background. Low back pain (LBP) is a healthcare problem with high global prevalence, with non-operative management being the first line of treatment in the majority of patients. This literature review summarizes the current evidence for various modalities of non-operative treatment for LBP.
   Methods. We did a literature search to elicit high-quality evidence for non-operative treatment modalities for LBP, including Cochrane Database reviews and systematic reviews or meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Only when these were not available for a particular treatment modality, other level 1 studies were included. The quality of evidence was categorized in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) method'a globally adopted tool for grading the quality of evidence and making treatment recommendations.
   Results. The treatment modalities that were reviewed included: general measures, medications/pharmacotherapy, exercises, electromagnetic therapies, alternative treatment modalities and interventional therapies. We found that high -quality evidence is lacking for most non-operative treatment modalities for LBP. The majority of interventions have small benefits or are similar to placebo.
   Conclusion. The current evidence for non-operative treatment modalities for LBP is insufficient to draw conclusions or make recommendations to clinicians. High-quality trials are required before widespread use of any treatment modality. Considering that non-operative treatment is usually the first line of therapy for most patients with LBP, it deserves to be the focus of future research in spinal disorders.

AB  - Objective: To study impact of COVID-19 pandemic on frequency, clinical/electrophysiological profile and treatment outcomes in pediatric Guillain-Bani syndrome (GBS). Background: GBS is the most frequent cause of pediatric acute flaccid paralysis. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric GBS is unclear in the literature. Methods: We conducted an ambispective, multicentric, cohort study involving 12 of 27 centres in GBS Consortium, during two periods: pre-COVID-19 (March-August 2019) and during COVID-19 (March-August 2020). Children <= 12 years who satisfied National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke criteria for GBS/variants were enrolled. Details pertaining to clinical/laboratory parameters, treatment and outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge, GBS Disability score at discharge and 3 months) were analysed. Results: We enrolled 33 children in 2019 and 10 in 2020. Children in 2020 were older (median 10.4 linterquartile range 6.75-11.25] years versus 5 (2.5-8.4) years; P = 0.022) and had more sensory symptoms (50% versus 18.2%; P = 0.043). The 2020 group had relatively favourable mRS at discharge (median 1(1-3.5) versus 3 (2-4); P = 0.042) and GBS disability score at 3 months (median 0 (0-0.75) versus 2 (0-3); P = 0.009) compared to 2019. Multivariate analysis revealed bowel involvement (P = 0.000) and ventilatory support (P = 0.001) as independent predictors of disability. No child in 2020 had prtveding/concurrent SARS-CoV2 infection. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a marked decline in pediatric GBS presenting to hospitals. Antecedent illnesses, clinical and electrophysiological profile of GBS remained largely unchanged from the pre-pandemic era.

AB  - Background: Complete cervical spinal cord injury is devastating with the currently available treatment modalities offering no hope for improvement. Intrathecal pressure is raised following spinal cord injury due to injured and edematous spinal cord. Due to constraints of the thecal sac, this sets up a vicious cascade leading to further spinal cord injury. Durotomy and expansile duraplasty could potentially prevent this secondary spinal cord injury. The aim of our study is to assess the advantage of durotomy and expansile duraplasty in addition to spinal bony decompression and fixation for traumatic cervical spine fracture.
   Methods: Two patients with posttraumatic complete cervical spinal cord injury (ASIA A) were managed with expansile duraplasty in addition to decompression and fixation. A thorough examination including perianal sensations and bulbocavernosus reflex was done to rule out the possibility of incomplete cord injury with spinal shock. Both the patients underwent posterior decompression and lax duraplasty. Standard protocols of spinal cord injury were followed like maintenance of MAP >85 mmHg.
   Results: Both the patients showed significant improvement in clinical status improving to ASIA D from ASIA A.
   Conclusion: Durotomy and duraplasty may be offered in all patients with complete spinal cord injury who are undergoing instrumentation.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of multimorbidity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is thought to be rising rapidly. Research on the state of healthcare for multimorbidity in LMICs is needed to provide an impetus for integration of care across conditions, a baseline to monitor progress, and information for targeting of interventions to those most in need. Focusing on multimorbid cardiometabolic disease in India, this study thus aimed to determine 1) the proportion of adults with co-morbid diabetes and hypertension who successfully completed each step of the chronic disease care continuum from diagnosis to control for both conditions, and 2) how having additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors is associated with health system performance along the care continuum for diabetes, hypertension, and co-morbid diabetes and hypertension.
   Methods: Using a nationally representative household survey carried out in 2015 and 2016 among women aged 15-49 years and men aged 15-54 years, we created a 'cascade of care' for diabetes, hypertension, and co-morbid diabetes and hypertension by determining the proportion of those with the condition who had been diagnosed, were on treatment, and achieved control. We used Poisson regression with a robust error structure to estimate how having additional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, current smoking, and obesity) was associated with reaching each cascade step for diabetes, hypertension, and co-morbid diabetes and hypertension.
   Findings: Seven hundred thirty-four thousand seven hundred ninety-four adults were included in the analysis. Among individuals with co-morbid diabetes and hypertension, 28.8% (95% CI, 26.7%-31.0%), 16.1% (95% CI, 14.4%-17.9%), and 3.7% (95% CI, 2.8%-4.9%)- with these proportions varying between states by a factor of 4.8, 7.9, and 56.8 - were aware, treated, and achieved control of both conditions, respectively. Men, adults with lower household wealth, and those living in rural areas were less likely to reach each cascade step. Having additional CVD risk factors generally did not increase the probability of reaching each cascade step for diabetes, hypertension, and co-morbid diabetes and hypertension, except that having concurrent diabetes increased the probability of successfully transitioning through the hypertension care cascade.
   Interpretation: While varying widely between states and population groups, health system performance for co-morbid diabetes and hypertension is generally low in India, and there appears to be little integration of care across CVD risk factors.

AB  - Rosette forming glioneural tumors (RGNT) are a rare type of low-grade brain tumor included in 2007 in WHO classification. Given the benign nature of the disease, a complete surgical excision has been considered optimum. However, a handful of cases have reported the locally aggressive nature of RGNT. In addition, radiation may also be considered for a tumor located in areas where surgical excision is difficult. We present a similar case, where surgical risk was weighed against resection and we treated the patient with conformal radiation.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the study was to establish the role of inflammation in bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN). Background: Peripheral neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib that can lead to discontinuation of the treatment. There are multiple mechanisms involved in the disposition of BIPN. However, the role of inflammatory mediators is still under investigation. A complete understanding of inflammatory markers in relation to BIPN can lead to the development of effective therapy for prophylaxis and treatment of peripheral neuropathy. Objective: Based on the available data, the role of inflammatory mediators in the development of peripheral neuropathy due to bortezomib has been postulated. Methods: The "Pubmed" and "Google Scholar" were used as the search engines with terms like "peripheral neuropathy", "bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy" and "inflammation". Original research, case reports and review articles were considered. Results: Bortezomib use is associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy. This effect is due to the damage to Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons, mitochondrial damage, increased ion channel susceptibility, and higher infiltration of macrophages in the spinal cord. All these factors collectively increase the secretion of inflammatory mediators and lead to the development of neuropathic pain. Conclusion: Targeting inflammatory mediators may be helpful in the treatment of bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - Background: Impact of acne on the psychological aspect among adolescents and young adults is poorly understood and many times goes unnoticeable. Aim: To assess body image disturbance, self-esteem, quality of life among adolescents and young adults with acne. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional survey on 250 adolescents and young adults aged 13-25 years in Dermatology OPD of a tertiary care hospital, was performed. Severity of acne, body image disturbance, self-esteem, and quality of life were assessed using standardized tools like IGA scale, BIDQ, RSES, and TAQOL respectively. Results: A majority of the participants, 163 (65%), were aged 20-25 years, in which 141 (56.4%) were male, 237 (94.8%) were unmarried, 192 (76.8%) were residing in urban area, 142 (56.8%) were graduate/post-graduate, 173 (69.2%) were students and 113 (45.2%) belonged to upper middle class of socio-economic status. More than half, 137 (54.8%), had a family history of acne, 228 (91.2%) had oily skin, 166 (67.4%) had normal nutritional status, 154 (61.6%) had moderate form of acne whereas 80 (32%) had severe acne. The mean BIDQ score was 3.05 (SD = 0.89); 169 (67.60%) had normal self-esteem and 174 (69.64%) had mild impairment in quality of life. Severity of acne had significant association with body image disturbance (P = 0.007) and quality of life (P = 0.001) but not related with self-esteem. Conclusion: The results revealed body image disturbance and impaired quality of life among adolescents and young adults with acne which draws the attention of dermatologists towards unidentified psychological aspects of acne during treatment. However, the majority of them revealed normal self-esteem in the study.

AB  - Diabetes decrease the cardioprotective potential of ischemic postconditioning (IPOC), Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) induced the cardioprotection against I/R injury. Present study has been designed to investigate the role of ANP postconditioning in diabetic rat heart. Isolated Langendorff's perfused normal and diabetic rat heart was stabilized for 10 min proceed by global ischemia further followed by four cycles of IPOC, each cycle comprised 5 min of reperfusion and 5 min of ischemia at onset of 120 min of reperfusion. Perfusion of ANP (0.1 mu M/L) with Krebs Heinsleit buffer solution (K-H buffer) in isolated diabetic rat heart for four cycle of IPOC significantly decrease the I/R induced myocardial infarct size and release of CK-MB and LDH level in coronary effluent. Four cycles of IPOC produced cardioprotection noted by decreasing in infarct size and decrease in release of LDH and CK-MB in normal rat heart. However IPOC induced cardioprotection was completely attenuated in isolated heart obtained from diabetic rat. Perfusion of ANP (0.1 mu M/L) significantly restored the attenuated cardioprotection in diabetic rat heart which was completely blocked by perfusion of L-NAME (100 mu M/L), an eNOS inhibitor. IPOC induced cardioprotection was at-tenuated in diabetic rat heart. Perfusion of ANP restores the cardioprotection of IPOC in diabetic rat heart by NO pathway.

AB  - Hyperekplexia, an underdiagnosed motor paroxysm of infancy, mimics epilepsy closely. It is hallmarked by episodic and excessive startle response, brief episodes of intense, generalized hypertonia, or stiffness in response to unexpected auditory and/or tactile stimuli right from birth. Though a seemingly benign entity with an excellent prognosis, hyperekplexia has been occasionally associated with recurrent apneas, feeding difficulties, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). We describe three unrelated children with hyperekplexia (two SLC6A5; one GLRA1). All three children had the onset of motor paroxysms from the neonatal period and were initially labeled as drug-resistant epilepsy leading to a variable diagnostic delay, the longest being 2.5 years. An excellent response to oral clonazepam with a good neurodevelopmental outcome was observed. The lack of habituation on the nose-tapping test is a simple clinical clue to the diagnosis. Early differentiation from epilepsy minimizes treatment cost, allays caregiver anxiety, and empowers them with abortive measures.

KW  - COVID-19
AB  - Background: Governments have imposed lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals have restricted outpatient clinics and elective services meant for non-COVID illnesses. This has led to patients facing unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. This study was carried out to assess patients' concerns and apprehensions about the effect of the lockdown on their treatments. Materials and Methods: An ambispective, observational cross-sectional single centre study was conducted. Patients were contacted telephonically and requested to answer a structured questionnaire. Their responses were documented and summarized as frequency and proportions. Results: A total of 727 patients were interviewed. Epilepsy (32%) was the most common neurological illness in our cohort followed by stroke (18%). About half the patients and/or their caregivers reported health-related concerns during the lockdown. The primary concern was how to connect with their treating neurologist if need arose. Forty-seven patients (6.4%) had drug default. Among patients on immunomodulatoty treatments, only eight patients had drug default. High compliance rates were also observed in the stroke and epilepsy cohorts. Of the 71 patients who required emergency care during the lockdown, 24 could reach our hospital emergency. Fourteen patients either had a delay or could not seek emergency care. Two-thirds of our patients found the telemedicine experience satisfactory. Conclusion: The ongoing pandemic will continue to pose challenges to both physicians and patients. Patients in follow-up may need to be contacted regularly and counselled regarding the importance of maintaining drug compliance. Telemedicine can be used to strengthen the healthcare delivery to patients with non-COVID illnesses.

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a progressive polygenic disorder requiring a multi-targeted therapeutic approach. A polyherbal formula (PHF) comprised of four traditional herbs known for their anti-diabetic, anti-oxidant, and hepatoprotective activities were used in this study. Objectives: The purpose of this research was to find out the plausible mechanisms underlying the synergistic effects of PHF in an experimental setting of diabetes mellitus. Materials and Methods: PHF was evaluated for the presence of residual toxins, acute oral toxicity, and its effects on carbohydrate digestive enzymes. PHF (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg/p. o., respectively) was used to treat streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for 12 weeks followed by glycemic, histopathological, biochemical, and ultrastructural changes measurement. mRNA levels of AMPK, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), phosphoinositide-3-phosphate kinase (PI3K), Akt, and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) were measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: In PHF, the residual toxins were absent. PHF inhibited the alpha-amylase (IC50 152.2 +/-& nbsp; 9.3 mu g/mL), and alpha-glucosidase (IC50 103.0 +/-& nbsp; 0.81 mu g/mL) activities in-vitro. Further, up to a dose of 2000 mg/kg, PHF showed no signs of mortality. PHF treatment significantly maintained the glycemic state, antioxidant status, lipid profile, hepatic-architecture, and ultrastructural alterations in diabetic rats. Similarly, diabetic rats showed detrimental effects on the mRNA level of AMPK and IRS-PI3K-Akt-GLUT2 signaling which were attenuated by PHF treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis also revealed an improvement in p-Akt expression after PHF treatment. Conclusion: In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, PHF improves glucose and lipid metabolism by attenuating hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, oxidative stress, inflammation, and deterioration of hepatic architecture possibly through AMPK mediated improvement in hepatic IRS-PI3K-Akt-GLUT2 signaling pathway.& nbsp;& nbsp;& nbsp;

AB  - This paper discusses the design and development of a low-cost virtual reality (VR) based flight simulator with cognitive load estimation feature using ocular and EEG signals. Focus is on exploring methods to evaluate pilot's interactions with aircraft by means of quantifying pilot's perceived cognitive load under different task scenarios. Realistic target tracking and context of the battlefield is designed in VR. Head mounted eye gaze tracker and EEG headset are used for acquiring pupil diameter, gaze fixation, gaze direction and EEG theta, alpha, and beta band power data in real time. We developed an AI agent model in VR and created scenarios of interactions with the piloted aircraft. To estimate the pilot's cognitive load, we used low-frequency pupil diameter variations, fixation rate, gaze distribution pattern, EEG signal-based task load index and EEG task engagement index. We compared the physiological measures of workload with the standard user's inceptor control-based workload metrics. Results of the piloted simulation study indicate that the metrics discussed in the paper have strong association with pilot's perceived task difficulty.

AB  - Background
   Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can be separated into primary, genetic or secondary causes. Primary disease results in nephrotic syndrome while genetic and secondary forms may be associated with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Overall only about 20% of patients with FSGS experience a partial or complete remission of nephrotic syndrome with treatment. FSGS progresses to kidney failure in about half of the cases. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.
   Objectives
   To assess the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive treatment regimens in adults with FSGS.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies to 21 June 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention for FSGS in adults were included. Studies comparing different types, routes, frequencies, and duration of immunosuppressive agents and non-immunosuppressive agents were assessed.
   Data collection and analysis
   At least two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.
   Main results
   Fifteen studies (560 participants) were included. No studies specifically evaluating corticosteroids compared with placebo or supportive therapy were identified. Studies evaluated participants with steroid-resistant FSGS. Five studies (240 participants) compared cyclosporin with or without prednisone with different comparators (no specific treatment, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), dexamethasone). Three small studies compared monoclonal antibodies (adalimumab, fresolimumab) with other agents or placebo. Six single small studies compared rituximab with tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan with cyclosporin alone, MMF with prednisone, chlorambucil plus methylprednisolone and prednisone with no specific treatment, different regimens of dexamethasone and CCX140-13 (an antagonist of the chemokine receptor CCR2) with placebo. The final study (109 participants) compared sparsentan, a dual inhibitor of endothelin Type A receptor and of the angiotensin II Type 1 receptor, with irbesartan. In the risk of bias assessment, seven and five studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Four studies were at low risk of performance bias and 14 studies were at low risk of detection bias. Thirteen, six and five studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively.
   Of five studies evaluating cyclosporin, four could be included in our meta-analyses (231 participants). Cyclosporin with or without prednisone compared with different comparators may increase the likelihood of complete remission (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.73; I-2 =1%; low certainty evidence) and of complete or partial remission (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.44; I-2 = 19%) but not of partial remission (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.39, 1 2 = 22%). In Individual studies, cyclosporin with prednisone versus prednisone may increase the likelihood of partial (49 participants: RR 7.96, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.15) or complete or partial remission (49 participants: RR 8.85, 95% CI 1.22 to 63.92) but not of complete remission. The remaining individual comparisons may make little or no difference to the likelihood of complete remission, partial remission or complete or partial remission compared with no treatment, methylprednisolone, MMF, or dexamethasone. Individual study data and combined data showed that cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the outcomes of chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. It is uncertain whether cyclosporin compared with these comparators in individual or combined analyses makes any difference to the outcomes of hypertension or infection.
   MMF compared with prednisone may make little or no difference to the likelihood of complete remission (33 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.88; low certainty evidence), partial remission, complete or partial remission, glomerular filtration rate, or infection. It is uncertain whether other interventions make any difference to outcomes as the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than irbesartan.
   Authors' conclusions
   No RCTs, which evaluated corticosteroids, were identified although the KDIGO guidelines recommend corticosteroids as the first treatment for adults with FSGS. The studies identified included participants with steroid-resistant FSGS. Treatment with cyclosporin for at least six months was more likely to achieve complete remission of proteinuria compared with other treatments but there was considerable imprecision due to few studies and small participant numbers. In future studies of existing or new interventions, the investigators must clearly define the populations included in the study to provide appropriate recommendations for patients with primary, genetic or secondary FSGS.

AB  - Introduction: Chikungunya is caused by an alpha virus transmitted to humans by an infected mosquito. Infection is generally considered to be self-limiting and non-critical. Chikungunya infection may be diagnosed by severe joint pain with fever, but it is difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of chikungunya are common to many pathogens, including dengue fever. Diagnosis mainly depends on viral culture, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and IgM ELISA. Early and accurate diagnosis of the virus can be achieved by the application of PCR methods, but the high cost and the need for a thermal cycler restrict the use of such methods. On the other hand, antibody-based IgM ELISA is considered to be inexpensive, but antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) only develop after 4 days of infection, so it has limited application in the earlier diagnosis of viral infection and the management of patients. Because of these challenges, a simple antigen-based sensitive, specific, and rapid detection method is required for the early and accurate clinical diagnosis of chikungunya.Methods: The amino acid sequence of CHIKV ectodomain E1 and E2 proteins was analyzed using bioinformatics tools to determine the antigenic residues, particularly the B-cell epitopes and their characteristics. Recombinant E2-E1 CHIKV antigen was used for the development of polyclonal antibodies in hamsters and IgG was purified. Serological tests of 96 CHIKV patients were conducted by antigen-capture ELISA using primary antibodies raised against rCHIKV E2-E1 in hamsters and human anti-CHIKV antibodies.Results: We observed high specificity and sensitivity, of 100% and 95.8%, respectively, and these values demonstrate the efficiency of the test as a clinical diagnostic tool. There was no cross-reactivity with samples taken from dengue patients.Discussion: Our simple and sensitive sandwich ELISA for the early-phase detection of CHIKV infection may be used to improve the diagnosis of chikungunya.

AB  - Background
   Acute bronchiolitis is one of the most frequent causes of emergency department visits and hospitalisation in children up to three years of age. There is no specific treatment for bronchiolitis except for supportive treatment, which includes ensuring adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) aims to widen the lungs' peripheral airways, enabling deflation of overdistended lungs in bronchiolitis. Increased airway pressure also prevents the collapse of poorly supported peripheral small airways during expiration. Observational studies report that CPAP is beneficial for children with acute bronchiolitis. This is an update of a review first published in 2015 and updated in 2019.
   Objectives
   To assess the efficacy and safety of CPAP compared to no CPAP or sham CPAP in infants and children up to three years of age with acute bronchiolitis.
   Search methods
   We conducted searches of CENTRAL (2021, Issue 7), which includes the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE (1946 to August 2021), Embase (1974 to August 2021), CINAHL (1981 to August 2021), and LILACS (1982 to August 2021) in August 2021. We also searched the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for completed and ongoing trials on 26 October 2021.
   Selection criteria
   We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, cross-over RCTs, and cluster-RCTs evaluating the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data using a structured pro forma, analysed data, and performed meta-analyses. We used the Cochrane risk of bias tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies. We created a summary of the findings table employing GRADEpro GDT software.
   Main results
   We included three studies with a total of 122 children (62/60 in intervention/control arms) aged up to 12 months investigating nasal CPAP compared with supportive (or 'standard') therapy. We included one new trial (72 children) in the 2019 update that contributed data to the assessment of respiratory rate and the need for mechanical ventilation for this update. We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in the current update. The included studies were single-centre trials conducted in France, the UK, and India. Two studies were parallel-group RCTs, and one study was a cross-over RCT. The evidence provided by the included studies was of low certainty; we made an assessment of high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, and selective reporting, and confidence intervals were wide.
   The effect of CPAP on the need for mechanical ventilation in children with acute bronchiolitis was uncertain due to risk of bias and imprecision around the effect estimate (risk difference -0.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.09 to 0.08; 3 RCTs, 122 children; low certainty evidence). None of the trials measured time to recovery. Limited, low certainty evidence indicated that CPAP decreased respiratory rate (decreased respiratory rate is better) (mean difference (MD) -3.81, 95% CI -5.78 to -1.84; 2 RCTs, 91 children; low certainty evidence). Only one trial measured change in arterial oxygen saturation (increased oxygen saturation is better), and the results were imprecise (MD -1.70%, 95% CI -3.76 to 0.36; 1 RCT, 19 children; low certainty evidence). The effect of CPAP on change in arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO(2)) (decrease in pCO(2) is better) was imprecise (MD -2.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.29 to 0.05; 2 RCTs, 50 children; low certainty evidence). Duration of hospital stay was similar in both the CPAP and supportive care groups (MD 0.07 days, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.50; 2 RCTs, 50 children; tow certainty evidence). Two studies did not report pneumothorax, but pneumothorax did not occur in one study. No studies reported occurrences of deaths. Several outcomes (change in partial oxygen pressure, hospital admission rate (from the emergency department to hospital), duration of emergency department stay, and need for intensive care unit admission) were not reported in the included studies.
   Authors' conclusions
   The use of CPAP did not reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in children with bronchiolitis, although the evidence was of low certainty. Limited, low certainty evidence suggests that breathing improved (a decreased respiratory rate) in children with bronchiolitis who received CPAP; this finding is unchanged from the 2015 review and 2019 update. Due to the limited available evidence, the effect of CPAP in children with acute bronchiolitis is uncertain for our other outcomes. Larger, adequately powered trials are needed to evaluate the effect of CPAP for children with acute bronchiolitis.

AB  - Ionizing radiation results in extensive damage to biological systems. The massive amount of ionizing radiation from nuclear accidents, radiation therapy (RT), space exploration, and the nuclear battlefield leads to damage to biological systems. Radiation injuries, such as inflammation, fibrosis, and atrophy, are characterized by genomic instability, apoptosis, necrosis, and oncogenic transformation, mediated by the activation or inhibition of specific signaling pathways. Exposure of tumors or normal cells to different doses of ionizing radiation could lead to the generation of free radical species, which can release signal mediators and lead to harmful effects. Although previous FDA-approved agents effectively mitigate radiation-associated toxicities, their use is limited due to their high cellular toxicities. Preclinical and clinical findings reveal that phytochemicals derived from plants that exhibit potent antioxidant activities efficiently target several signaling pathways. This review examined the prospective roles played by some phytochemicals in altering signal pathways associated with radiation response.

AB  - Background: TRC150094, a novel mitochondrial modulator, reduces insulin resistance and is expected to improve the trinity of dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. In this multi-dose phase-2 study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of TRC150094 in diabetic subjects with dyslipidemia receiving standard of care.
   Methods: A randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, Phase 2 study was conducted in 225 subjects from July 2013 to August 2015. The key inclusion criteria were body mass index of 23-35 kg/m(2), age between 30 and 65 years, fasting glucose of >= 126 or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) of >= 6.4% stabilized on treatment with <= 2 oral hypoglycemic agents, apolipoprotein-B (apo-B) >= 100 mg/dL, serum triglyceride (TG) >= 150 mg/dL, systolic blood pressure (SBP) >= 130 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >= 85 mmHg with/without antihypertensive treatment. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of three TRC150094 doses (25, 50, or 75 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks. The outcomes assessed included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), insulin, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and apoB. In addition, safety and tolerability were assessed.
   Results: A reduction for dose up to 50 mg was noted for FPG in the range of 13.9 to 21.7 mg/dL (p < 0.05 for TRC150094 25 and 50 mg), fasting insulin reduction in the range 2.7 to 6.0 mU/L (all doses, p > 0.05), and improved HOMA-IR (-2.0 to -2.5) (all doses, p > 0.05) compared to placebo after 24 weeks of treatment. Furthermore, a significant reduction in MAP in the range 3.1 to 4.2 mmHg (p < 0.05 for TRC150094 25 and 75 mg) was noted. In addition, TRC150094 treatment was weight neutral, had a favorable effect on lowering atherogenic lipid fractions, including non-HDL cholesterol (-6.8 mg/dL at 50 mg dose). Adverse events were mild to moderate in nature and not dose-related. One adverse event not related to treatment led to the discontinuation of the study. Overall, TRC150094 was safe and well tolerated for up to 24 weeks.
   Conclusion: In this study, TRC150094 treatment in the dose range of 25 to 50 mg showed improvement in various components of CMBCD, ie, dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

AB  - Aims
   The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield of image-guided biopsy in providing a final diagnosis in patients with suspected infectious spondylodiscitis, to report the diagnostic accuracy of various microbiological tests and histological examinations in these patients, and to report the epidemiology of infectious spondylodiscitis from a country where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, including the incidence of drug-resistant
   Methods
   A total of 284 patients with clinically and radiologically suspected infectious spondylodiscitis were prospectively recruited into the study. Image-guided biopsy of the vertebral lesion was performed and specimens were sent for various microbiological tests and histological examinations. The final diagnosis was determined using a composite reference standard based on clinical, radiological, serological, microbiological, and histological findings. The overall diagnostic yield of the biopsy, and that for each test, was calculated in light of the final diagnosis.
   Results
   The final diagnosis was tuberculous spondylodiscitis in 250 patients (88%) and pyogenic spondylodiscitis in 22 (7.8%). Six (2.1%) had a noninfectious condition-mimicking infectious spondylodiscitis, and six (2.1%) had no definite diagnosis and improved without specific treatment. The diagnosis was made by image-guided biopsy in 152 patients (56%) with infectious spondylodiscitis. Biopsy was contributory in identifying 132/250 patients (53%) with tuberculous spondylodiscitis, and 20/22 patients (91%) with pyogenic spondylodiscitis. Histological examination was the most sensitive diagnostic modality, followed by Xpert MTB/RIF assay.
   Conclusion
   Image-guided biopsy has a reasonably high diagnostic yield in patients with suspected infectious spondylodiscitis. A combination of histological examination, Xpert MTB/RIF assay, bacterial culture, and sensitivity provides high diagnostic accuracy in a country in which TB is endemic.

AB  - We describe a modified technique of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT)-guided removal of post-laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) epithelial ingrowth with interface ethyl alcohol and mitomycin C application to prevent a recurrence. Epithelial ingrowth was visualized as hyperreflective deposits in the interface on iOCT, and the location and extent were noted at the beginning of the procedure. A simple dimple-down maneuver was performed to help identify the circumference of the LASIK flap. iOCT helped to delineate the flap edge and ensure dissection in the correct plane with complete removal of epithelial cell nests. Real-time visualization of the interface helped in on-table decision making regarding the extent of lifting the flap to encompass the entire region of hyperreflective epithelial ingrowth, as well as the need for additional interventions to ensure complete flap apposition at the end of surgery. All patients gained an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/20-20/25 with no recurrence.

AB  - Introduction: Tendons may rarely be ossified. The calcaneal tendon (CT) is the largest in the body. The incidence and mechanism of ossification of CT is not known. Material and Methods: We carried out a morphological, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical study on the CT of 50 (30 - male and 20 - female) human cadavers. Results: The mean length (cm) of the CT was 27.60 +/- 2.30 (right) and 27.51 +/- 2.60 (left) in males and 25.43 +/- 0.77 on both sides in females. The contribution to the formation of the CT from the two heads of gastrocnemius muscle was greater from medial head in 84%, lateral head in 12%, and equal in 4%. On screening the CT by C-arm radiography, slight opacification at the site of insertion of CT (bilaterally) was noted in an elderly male. Large, bilateral opacification was seen in another elderly male cadaver. Well-defined lamellar bone with osteocytes lying in lacunae and bone marrow amid the tendon collagenous tissue was noted in hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections. The osteocytes expressed hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha. Discussion and Conclusion: In this study, we confirmed that the radiological opacification in the CT was ossification that may have been triggered by hypoxia.

AB  - Vitiligo is an acquired chronic pigmentary disorder affecting the melanocytes, mainly in the skin and mucosae. It occurs due to the dynamic interaction between genetic and environmental factors leading to autoimmune destruction of melanocytes. Defects in melanocyte adhesion and increased oxidative stress further augment the immune response in vitiligo. It is a cosmetically disfiguring condition with a substantial psychological burden. Its autoimmune nature with resultant chronicity, variable responses to therapeutic modalities, and frequent recurrences have further diminished the quality of life. Hence, treatment should aim to provide more extended remission periods, prevent recurrences, provide good cosmetic outcomes and ensure patient satisfaction. These treatment goals seem plausible with the recent progress in our understanding of the complex pathogenic mechanisms underlying vitiligo at a molecular and genetic level. We provide a literature review of the pathogenic mechanisms and the therapies targeting these mechanisms.

AB  - Background: The evidences for demonstrating the contributions of the cerebral cortex in human postural control is increasing. However, there remain little insights about the cor-tical correlates of balance control in lower-limb amputees. The present study aimed to investigate the cortical activity and balance performance of transfemoral amputees in comparison to healthy individuals during a continuous balance task (CBT).Methods: The postural stability of the participants was defined with limit of stability param-eter. Electroencephalography (EEG) data were recorded in synchronization with the center of pressure (CoP) data from eighteen individuals (including eight unilateral transfemoral amputees). We anticipated that, due to the limb loss, the postural demand of transfemoral amputees increases which significantly modulates the spectral power of intrinsic cortical oscillations.Findings: Using the independent components from the sensorimotor areas and supplemen-tary motor area (SMA), our results present a well-pronounced drop of alpha spectral power at sensorimotor area contralateral to sound limb of amputees in comparison to SMA and the sensorimotor area contralateral to prosthetic limb. Following this, we found signifi-cantly higher (p < 0.05) limit of stability (LOS) at their sound limb than at the prosthetic limb. Healthy individuals have similar contribution from both the limbs and the EEG alpha spectral power was similar across the three regions of the cortex during the balance control task as expected. Overall, a decent correlation was found between the LOS and alpha spec-tral power in both amputee and healthy individuals (Pearson's correlation coefficient > 0.5). Interpretation: By externally stimulating the highlighted cortical regions, neuroplasticity might be promoted which helps to reduce the training time for the efficient rehabilitation of amputees. Additionally, this new knowledge might benefit in the designing and develop-ment of innovative interventions to prevent falls due to lower limb amputation.(c) 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background Severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) are a leading cause of hospitalizations in children, especially due to viral pathogens. We studied the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children aged <5 years hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in Kashmir, India. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study in two tertiary care hospitals from October 2013 to September 2014, systematically enrolling two children aged <5 years with SARI per day. We defined SARI as history of fever or measured fever (>= 38 degrees C) and cough with onset in the last 7 days requiring hospi-talization for children aged 3-59 months and as physician-diagnosed acute lower respiratory infection for children aged <3 months. Trained study staff screened children within 24 hours of hospitalization for SARI and collected clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs from enrolled participants. We tested for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, influenza viruses, rhinoviruses (HRV)/enterovi-ruses, adenovirus (AdV), bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) A and B, coronaviruses (OC43, NL65, C229E), and parainfluenza viruses (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4 using standardized duplex real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results Among 4548 respiratory illness admissions screened from October 2013 to September 2014, 1026 met the SARI case definition, and 412 were enrolled (ages = 5 days to 58 months; median = 12 months). Among enrolees, 256 (62%) were positive for any virus; RSV was the most commonly detected (n = 118, 29%) followed by HRV/enteroviruses (n = 88, 21%), PIVs (n = 31, 8%), influenza viruses (n = 18, 4%), BoV (n = 15, 4%), coronaviruses (n = 16, 4%), AdV (n = 14, 3%), and hMPV (n = 9, 2%). Fifty-four children had evidence of virus co-detection. Influenza-associated SARI was more common among children aged 1-5 years (14/18, 78%) while most RSV detections occurred in children <12 months (83/118, 70%). Of the RSV viruses typed (n = 116), the majority were type B (94, 80%). Phylogenetic analysis of G gene of RSV showed circulation of the BA9 genotype with 60bp nucleotide duplication. Conclusions Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, contributed to a substantial proportion of SARI hospitalizations among children <5 years in north India. These data can help guide clinicians on appropriate treatment and prevention strategies. Globally, respiratory viruses account for half of all causes of acute lower respiratory infections, including pneu-monia and bronchiolitis [1,2]. Respiratory viruses have been detected in over half of children hospitalized with respiratory illness in studies from India and the US [3,4]. Among them, the respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) among children <5 years of age, frequently causing bronchiolitis and pneumonia in both high-income countries (HIC) as well as low-and middle-income coun-tries (LMIC) [4-6]. Globally an estimated 33.8 million new episodes of RSV-associated ALRI occurred in 2005 and at least 3.4 million required hospitalisations [7]. High RSV-associated incidence of hospitalisation has been reported especially in LMICs [8,9]. Data from a community-based study in India showed annual incidence rates of 3.2/1000 among children <5 years of age [10]. As several candidate RSV vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials, it is important to generate more data on RSV burden to inform future policy.
   This is crucial for India, as many of its states have populations compara-ble to large countries, but with wide variation between the states in terms of lower respiratory disease burden [11]. Various studies in the last decade have reported the prevalence of RSV among children hospitalized with ALRI from different parts of India with tropical climates, but none are reported from Kashmir, a temperate re-gion of north India [12-15]. We present the prevalence of respiratory viruses among children aged <5 years hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infections in Kashmir.

AB  - Background. Dietary salt intake is an important modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Estimation of 24-hour salt intake using morning urine samples needs to be validated in the Indian context. We examined the performance of INTERSALT, Tanaka and Kawasaki equations for the estimation of 24-hour urinary sodium from morning fasting urine (MFU) samples.
   Methods. We enrolled 486 adults aged 18-69 years from four regions of India with equal rural/urban and sex representation to provide 24-hour urine samples. The next day, a MFU sample was obtained. Based on the volume and sodium content of the 24-hour urine sample, 24-hour sodium excretion (reference method) was calculated. Sodium levels in the MFU samples were measured along with other parameters required, and the above equations were used to estimate 24-hour urinary sodium levels. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess the degree of agreement between the estimates from the reference method and the three equations. Bland-Altman (BA) plots were used to identify systematic bias and limits of agreement. A difference of 1 g of salt (0.39 g of sodium) between the mean salt intake by 24-hour urine and as estimated by equations was considered acceptable.
   Results. A total of 346 participants provided both the samples. The mean (SD) daily salt intake estimated by the 24 -hour urine sample method was 9.9 (5.8) g. ICC was low for all the three equations: highest for Kawasaki (0.16; 95% CI 0.05-0.26) and least for Tanaka (0.12; 0.02-0.22). Only Tanaka equation provided estimates within 1 g of measured 24-hour salt intake (-0.36 g). BA plots showed that as the mean values increased, all the three equations provided lower estimates of salt intake.
   Conclusion. Tanaka equation provided acceptable values of 24-hour salt intake at the population level. However, poor performance of all the equations highlights the need to understand the reasons and develop better methods for the measurement of sodium intake at the population level.

AB  - Objective: To determine the demographic pattern of juvenile-onset parkinsonism (JP, <20 years), young-onset (YOPD, 20-40 years), and early onset (EOPD, 40-50 years) Parkinson's disease (PD) in India. Materials and Methods: We conducted a 2-year, pan-India, multicenter collaborative study to analyze clinical patterns of JP, YOPD, and EOPD. All patients under follow-up of movement disorders specialists and meeting United Kingdom (UK) Brain Bank criteria for PD were included. Results: A total of 668 subjects (M:F 455:213) were recruited with a mean age at onset of 38.7 +/- 8.1 years. The mean duration of symptoms at the time of study was 8 +/- 6 years. Fifteen percent had a family history of PD and 13% had consanguinity. JP had the highest consanguinity rate (53%). YOPD and JP cases had a higher prevalence of consanguinity, dystonia, and gait and balance issues compared to those with EOPD. In relation to nonmotor symptoms, panic attacks and depression were more common in YOPD and sleep-related issues more common in EOPD subjects. Overall, dyskinesias were documented in 32.8%. YOPD subjects had a higher frequency of dyskinesia than EOPD subjects (39.9% vs. 25.5%), but they were first noted later in the disease course (5.7 vs. 4.4 years). Conclusion: This large cohort shows differing clinical patterns in JP, YOPD, and EOPD cases. We propose that cutoffs of <20, <40, and <50 years should preferably be used to define JP, YOPD, and EOPD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is associated with widespread autonomic dysfunction where sympathetic predominance explains associated complaints such as widespread pain, sleep disorders and anxiety. Recent studies indicate a possible neurovascular autonomic interaction in the pathogenesis of FM.
   OBJECTIVE: Our study paradigm included a modified Ewing's battery of autonomic function tests to find the cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in FM patients. The battery comprises some tests such as the Valsalva maneuver, which are effort-dependent, so we also aimed to identify a potential simplified test out of the whole battery as an index marker of CAN in FM patients.
   METHODS: Forty-two female patients with FM were included in this study and were administered sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity tests to explore the presence of CAN. We compared the results from each sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity test against CAN.
   RESULTS: Delta heart rate in the deep breathing test was significantly different in patients with and without CAN. Delta heart rate also exhibited best diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.769, 95% CI: 0.619-0.920, p < 0.001), with 88% sensitivity, 64% specificity, and 89% negative predictive value (NPV). The 30: 15 ratio during the lying to standing test also emerged as a suitable index; however it did not show any difference between CAN and non-CAN patients.
   CONCLUSION: The delta heart rate has the best diagnostic accuracy, primarily in CAN's exclusion by its very high sensitivity and NPV.

AB  - Objective To document morbidities in adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) from India. Methods Details of children with cystic fibrosis surviving beyond 15 years of age were extracted from hospital records, and analyzed. Results 43 children [Median (IQR) age 18.7 (17, 20.6) years, were enrolled. Median (IQR) body mass index was 15.82 (13.5, 19.05) kg/m(2). Pseudomonas species were isolated from respiratory specimens of 34 (79%) adolescents. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) and Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) were seen in 12 (28%) and 11 (26%) patients, respectively. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS) were diagnosed in 15 (35%) and 6 (14%) children, respectively. Pseudomonas species colonization (P=0.04) and multiple pulmonary exacerbations in last one year (P<0.001) were significant predictors of FEV1% predicted. Conclusion Malnutrition, chronic airway colonization, ABPA, CFRD, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and DIOS are morbidities observed in adolescents with CF in India. The data support the need for early screening of CF-associated morbidities.

AB  - Background: The recovery of the upper-limb (UL) motor function after ischemic stroke (IS) remains a major scientific, clinical, and patient concern and it is hard to predict alone from the clinical symptoms. Objective: To determine the accuracy of the prediction of the recovery of UL motor function in patients with acute ischemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke using individual clinical, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters or their combination. Methods and Material: The first-ever acute ischemic MCA stroke patients within 7 days of the stroke onset who had an obvious UL motor deficit underwent TMS for the presence of motor-evoked potential (MEP) and DTI to evaluate the integrity of corticospinal tracts. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to test for the accuracy of the prediction of the recovery of UL motor function. Results: Twenty-nine acute ischemic MCA stroke patients (21 males and 8 females) with a mean age of 51.45 +/- 14.26 years were recruited. Model-I included clinical scales (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [FMA] + Motricity Index [MI]) + TMS (MEP) + DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA]) were found to be the most accurate predictive model, with the overall predictive ability (93.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.99) and sensitivity: 94.9% (95% CI: 0.87-1.0) and specificity: 95.8% (95% CI: 0.89-1.0); respectively. Conclusion: The accuracy of UL motor recovery can be predicted through the clinical battery and their elements as well as TMS (MEP) and DTI (FA) parameters. Further, well-designed prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.

AB  - Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein is encoded by the PARP1 gene located on chromosome 1 (1q42.12) in human cells. It plays a crucial role in post-translational modification by adding poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) groups to various proteins and PARP1 itself by utilizing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) as a substrate. Since the discovery of PARP1, its role in DNA repair and cell death has been its identity. This is evident from an overwhelmingly high number of scientific reports in this regard. However, PARP1 also plays critical roles in inflammation, metabolism, tumor development and progression, chromatin modification and transcription, mRNA stability, and alternative splicing. In the present study, we attempted to compile all the scattered scientific information about this molecule, including the structure and multifunctional role of PARP1 in cancer and non-cancer diseases, along with PARP1 inhibitors (PARPis). Furthermore, for the first time, we have classified PARP1-mediated cell death for ease of understanding its role in cell death pathways.

AB  - Purpose: Available literature on peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome (PPS) is very limited. The purpose of this study is to evaluate features of PPS using multimodal imaging and shed further light on this entity.
   Methods: This is a retrospective case series at a tertiary eye-care center. Patients with features of pachychoroid with preferential choroidal thickening in nasal macula along with pachyvessels were identified and included for analysis. The patients underwent fundus photography, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, fundus fluorescein angiography, and indocyanine angiography. Images were separately analyzed by two different retina specialists.
   Results: A total of 27 eyes of 14 patients with mean age of 52.2 years were included. Seven patients had bilateral PPS, whereas six had unilateral; one patient had only one seeing eye. A total of 21 eyes with PPS were studied. 52.4% of the eyes revealed retinal pigment epithelium gravitational tracks, outer retinal atrophy, and serous PEDs. None of the eyes showed choroidal folds. Fundus fluorescein angiography showed late leakage at macula in 33% eyes. Fundus autofluorescence showed features of PPS to be similar to central serous chorioretinopathy in most cases.
   Conclusion: Peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome shares common findings with central serous chorioretinopathy and seems to be a subset of central serous chorioretinopathy than a separate entity in pachychoroid disease spectrum.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of drainage through posterior retinotomy versus perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL)-assisted drainage in vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and to study intraoperative and postoperative complications.
   Methods: This was a prospective randomized study of 52 cases who underwent vitreoretinal surgery for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Group 1 underwent PFCL-assisted drainage through preexisting break, whereas Group 2 had posterior retinotomy to drain subretinal fluid. Cases were evaluated for retinal reattachment rates, visual outcomes, optical coherence tomography parameters, and postoperative metamorphopsia. The patients were followed up for minimum period of 3 months.
   Results: Two groups were comparable in terms of demographic and preoperative parameters. Both groups had single surgery success rate of 100% by the end of follow-up. Final best-corrected visual acuity in Group 1 was 0.61 +/- 0.33 and 0.61 +/- 0.32 in Group 2 (P = 0.77). Optical coherence tomography parameters (foveal contour, retinal layers, central macular thickness, and epiretinal membrane formation) were similar between the two groups. Subjective metamorphopsia was present in 30.77% (8 of 26) patients in Group-1 and 69.23% (18 of 26) patients in Group-2 (P = 0.034). One eye had retained subretinal PFCL away from the macula in Group 1.
   Conclusion: Anatomical and functional outcomes were similar in vitrectomy using PFCL-assisted drainage versus posterior retinotomy drainage. Postoperative metamorphopsia was lesser in patients who underwent PFCL-assisted drainage through the preexisting break.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary bladder cancer ranks the fourth most common cancer in men worldwide. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are antioxidant enzymes that play an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, we investigated whether PRDX 1 and 2 can be used as a urinary biomarker for surveillance of recurrence in urothelial cancer. Materials and Methods: PRDX1 and PRDX2 expression levels were examined in 119 bladder tumor specimens by immunohistochemistry and in 150 urine samples (case: 100; healthy controls: 50) using ELISA and their association with recurrence and survival of patients was evaluated. Results: Immunohistochemistry on FFPE tissue showed that both PRDX1 and PRDX2 were positive in bladder tumors and expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells. A significant elevation of urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 concentration was found in bladder cancer patients and recurrent cases compared to the urine of healthy controls and primary bladder cancer patients (p<0.001 & p<0.01) respectively. However, the concentration of both proteins was not found associated with survival. Conclusion: Elevated urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 in bladder cancer patients was found to be associated with recurrence and the estimation of urinary PRDX1 and PRDX2 during follow-up may help to extend the period between cystoscopies in patient follow-up.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the progressive brain disorder which degenerates brain cells connection and causes memory loss. Although AD is irreversible, it is not impossible to arrest or slow down the progression of the disease. However, this would only be possible if the disease is diagnosed at an early stage, and early diagnosis requires clear understanding of the pathogenesis at molecular level. Overactivity of GSK-3 beta and p53 accounts for tau hyperphosphorylation and the formation of amyloid-beta plaques.
   Objective: Here, we explored GSK-3 beta and p53 as blood-based biomarkers for early detection of AD.
   Methods: The levels of GSK-3 beta, p53, and their phosphorylated states were measured using surface plasmon resonance and verified using western blot in serum from AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and geriatric-control (GC) subjects. The neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cell line was treated with antioxidant Emblica Officinalis (EO) for rescue effect.
   Results: GSK-3 beta, p53, and their phosphorylated states were significantly over expressed (p > 0.001) in AD and MCI compared to GC and can differentiate AD and MCI from GC. The expression level of GSK-3 beta and p53 proteins were found to be downregulated in a dose-dependent manner after the treatment with EO in amyloid-b-induced neurotoxic cells.
   Conclusion: These proteins can serve as potential blood markers for the diagnosis of AD and EO can suppress their level. This work has translational value and clinical utility in the future.

TI  - Crouzon's Syndrome with a Dominant Sinus Pericranii Draining Transverse Sinus: Report of a Rare Association and Review of Literature
T2  - PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGERY
KW  - Crouzon's syndrome
KW  - Dominant type sinus pericranii
KW  - Craniosynostosis
KW  - Suboccipital sinus pericranii
AB  - Introduction: Crouzon's syndrome and sinus pericranii (SP) are rare entities. Only few cases having both the features are reported. SP most commonly drains in relation to superior sagittal sinus and their communication to major posterior dural sinuses is rare. Case Report: We report a rare case of Crouzon's syndrome with SP at a suboccipital location with termination of left transverse sinus into the SP draining further through the extracranial suboccipital and extravertebral cervical venous plexi into external jugular veins. Distal transverse sinus and sigmoid sinus on the left side were absent. Conclusion: Crouzon's syndrome with SP is an extremely rare entity. SP with communication to major posterior dural venous sinuses is also rare and mostly associated with multi-suture craniosynostosis. Management depends on the volume of venous blood they are draining. Most of them are dominant type and their occlusion is not feasible. Preoperative diagnosis of a dominant SP is essential for proper surgical planning as it needs to be preserved mandatorily to prevent cerebral venous infarction. (C) 2022 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - A ligand when bound to a macromolecule (protein, DNA, RNA) will influence the biochemical function of that macromolecule. This observation is empirical and attributable to the association of the ligand with the amino acids/nucleotides that comprise the macromolecule. The binding affinity is a measure of the strength-of-association of a macromolecule for its ligand and is numerically characterized by the association/dissociation constant. However, despite being widely used, a mathematically rigorous explanation by which the association/dissociation constant can influence the biochemistry and molecular biology of the resulting complex is not available. Here, the ligand-macromolecular complex is modeled as a homo- or hetero-dimer with a finite and equal number of atoms/residues per monomer. The pairwise interactions are numeric, empirically motivated and are randomly chosen from a standard uniform distribution. The transition-state dissociation constants are the strictly positive real part of all complex eigenvalues of this interaction matrix, belong to the open interval (0,1), and form a sequence whose terms are finite, monotonic, non-increasing and convergent. The theoretical results are rigorous, presented as theorems, lemmas and corollaries and are complemented by numerical studies. An inferential analysis of the clinical outcomes of amino acid substitutions of selected enzyme homodimers is also presented. These findings are extendible to higher-order complexes such as those likely to occur in vivo. The study also presents a schema by which a ligand can be annotated and partitioned into high- and low-affinity variants. The influence of the transition-state dissociation constants on the biochemistry and molecular biology of non-haem iron (II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (catalysis) and major histocompatibility complex (I) mediated export of high-affinity peptides (non-enzymatic association/dissociation) are examined as special cases.

AB  - Central granular cell odontogenic tumor (CGCOT) is sporadic benign odontogenic tumor and it especially occurs in women older than 50 years of age. Radiologically it manifests as unilocular to the multilocular radiolucency with sometimes mixed densities. Histopathology displays sheets and islands of large eosinophilic cells with abundant granular cytoplasm, however few cases exhibit inadequate epithelium, thus creating a diagnostic confusion. Though, resection is advocated by some surgeons, however because of the non-aggressive biological behaviour, enucleation or curettage is the treatment of choice for this lesion. Till now only 39 cases have been reported in the past six decades. We are reporting the first case of CGCOT occurring in the youngest age of eleven-year-old patient with massive size of 11 x 7 x 6 cm. This would add CGCOT as a differential diagnosis in the bony lesions of younger individuals. In addition, the importance of immunohistochemistry studies in cases with scarce odontogenic epithelium and the potential role of Carnoy's solution in the management of this rare tumor in this age group was emphasized.

AB  - Over the past few years, the concept of personalized medicine has percolated into the management of different neurological conditions. Improving outcomes after acute brain injury (ABI) continues to be a major challenge. Unrecognized individual multiomic variations in addition to multiple interacting processes may explain why we fail to observe comprehensive improvements in ABI outcomes even when applied treatments appear to be beneficial logically. The provision of clinical care based on a multiomic approach may revolutionize the management of traumatic brain injury, delayed cerebral ischemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage, acute ischemic stroke, and several other neurological diseases. The challenge is to incorporate all the information obtained from genomic studies, other omic data, and individual variability into a practical tool that can be used to assist clinical decision-making. The effective execution of such strategies, which is still far away, requires the development of protocols on the basis of these complex interactions and strict adherence to management protocols. In this review, we will discuss various omics and physiological targets to guide individualized patient management after ABI.

AB  - Objective To develop a set of strategies to enhance adherence to home-based exercises after stroke, and an overarching framework to classify these strategies. Method We conducted a four-round Delphi consensus (two online surveys, followed by a focus group then a consensus round). The Delphi panel consisted of 13 experts from physiotherapy, occupational therapy, clinical psychology, behaviour science and community medicine. The experts were from India, Australia and UK. Results In round 1, a 10-item survey using open-ended questions was emailed to panel members and 75 strategies were generated. Of these, 25 strategies were included in round 2 for further consideration. A total of 64 strategies were finally included in the subsequent rounds. In round 3, the strategies were categorised into nine domains-(1) patient education on stroke and recovery, (2) method of exercise prescription, (3) feedback and supervision, (4) cognitive remediation, (5) involvement of family members, (6) involvement of society, (7) promoting self-efficacy, (8) motivational strategies and (9) reminder strategies. The consensus from 12 experts (93%) led to the development of the framework in round 4. Conclusion We developed a framework of comprehensive strategies to assist clinicians in supporting exercise adherence among stroke survivors. It provides practical methods that can be deployed in both research and clinical practices. Future studies should explore stakeholders' experiences and the cost-effectiveness of implementing these strategies.

AB  - Background: Systemic inflammatory markers have been found to be of value in predicting the prognosis in renal cell and gastrointestinal cancers. Recent studies in gliomas correlating with Systemic inflammatory markers (SIMS) have shown promise in predicting survival.
   Objective: Meningiomas are the commonest intracranial primary brain tumors in adults. There is a need to distinguish low and high grade meningiomas preoperatively as they have crucial implications for the radicality of surgical excision and prognostication.
   Methods: A retrospective search was conducted, and the newly diagnosed meningioma cases were studied. The preoperative hematological parameters of the patients and pathological tumor grades were noted. The grade 1 meningioma was defined as low-grade meningioma while grade 2 and 3 meningiomas were defined as high-grade meningioma. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between the hematological parameters and tumor grade.
   Results: Seven hundred and eighty meningioma cases with a mean age of 43.5 years were included. The ANC, NLR, and dNLR were found to be significantly elevated in high-grade meningioma (P = 0.03). Other inflammatory parameters including TLC failed to show a statistically significant difference when compared between the grades of meningioma. ROC analysis further showed limited value of these markers in predicting meningioma grade. However, an elevated ANC (OR = 1.08, 95% CI = 1.02-1.14), male sex (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.13-2.58), and tumor origin from sites other than the skull base or theca! sac (OR = 3.33, 95% CI = 1.93-6.12) were predictive of high-grade meningioma in regression analysis.
   Conclusion: Preoperative hematological inflammatory parameters have limited value in predicting the grade of tumor in meningiomas. An elevated preoperative ANC, NLR. and dNLR were found to be more frequently associated with high grade of meningiomas.

AB  - Background The existing World Health Organiza-tion (WHO) pneumonia case management guide-lines rely on clinical symptoms and signs for identify-ing, classifying, and treating pneumonia in children up to 5 years old. We aimed to collate an individual patient-level data set from large, high-quality pre-ex-isting studies on pneumonia in children to identify a set of signs and symptoms with greater validity in the diagnosis, prognosis, and possible treatment of childhood pneumonia for the improvement of cur-rent pneumonia case management guidelines. Methods Using data from a published systematic review and expert knowledge, we identified stud-ies meeting our eligibility criteria and invited inves-tigators to share individual-level patient data. We collected data on demographic information, general medical history, and current illness episode, includ-ing history, clinical presentation, chest radiograph findings when available, treatment, and outcome. Data were gathered separately from hospital-based and community-based cases. We performed a narra-tive synthesis to describe the final data set. Results Forty-one separate data sets were includ-ed in the Pneumonia Research Partnership to Assess WHO Recommendations (PREPARE) database, 26 of which were hospital-based and 15 were commu-nity-based. The PREPARE database includes 285 839 children with pneumonia (244 323 in the hospital and 41 516 in the community), with detailed de-scriptions of clinical presentation, clinical progres-sion, and outcome. Of 9185 pneumonia-related deaths, 6836 (74%) occurred in children <1 year of age and 1317 (14%) in children aged 1-2 years. Of the 285 839 episodes, 280 998 occurred in chil-dren 0-59 months old, of which 129 584 (46%) were 2-11 months of age and 152 730 (54%) were males. Conclusions This data set could identify an improved specific, sensitive set of criteria for diagnosing clin-ical pneumonia and help identify sick children in need of referral to a higher level of care or a change of therapy. Field studies could be designed based on insights from PREPARE analyses to validate a potential revised pneumonia algorithm. The PREPARE methodology can also act as a model for disease database assembly.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Primary intracranial malignant melanomas (PIMMs) are uncommon lesions of the central nervous system. Brainstem involvement is of rare occurrence.
   Methods and Material: A 33-year-old male presented with the chief complaints of progressively increasing headache, visual disturbances, and diplopia from the last 6 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-defined lesion in the midbrain appearing heterogeneously hyperintense on T1WI and containing mixed hyperintense and hypointense areas on T2WI. Multiple areas of SWI blooming, suggestive of hemorrhage. were seen within the lesion.
   Conclusion: Brainstem malignant melanoma can masquerade cavernoma as seen in our case. Therefore, malignant melanomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of brainstem lesions that presents with bleed.

AB  - Objective: To determine the associations of demographic, clinical, laboratory, organ dysfunction, and illness severity variable values with: 1) sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock in children with infection and 2) multiple organ dysfunction or death in children with sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from January 1, 2004, and November 16, 2020. Study Selection: Case-control studies, cohort studies, and randomized controlled trials in children greater than or equal to 37-week-old postconception to 18 years with suspected or confirmed infection, which included the terms "sepsis," "septicemia," or "septic shock" in the title or abstract. Data Extraction: Study characteristics, patient demographics, clinical signs or interventions, laboratory values, organ dysfunction measures, and illness severity scores were extracted from eligible articles. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed. Data Synthesis: One hundred and six studies met eligibility criteria of which 81 were included in the meta-analysis. Sixteen studies (9,629 patients) provided data for the sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock outcome and 71 studies (154,674 patients) for the mortality outcome. In children with infection, decreased level of consciousness and higher Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores were associated with sepsis/severe sepsis. In children with sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, chronic conditions, oncologic diagnosis, use of vasoactive/inotropic agents, mechanical ventilation, serum lactate, platelet count, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, multi-organ dysfunction syndrome, Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction score, Pediatric Index of Mortality-3, and Pediatric Risk of Mortality score each demonstrated significant and consistent associations with mortality. Pooled mortality rates varied among high-, upper middle-, and lower middle-income countries for patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Strong associations of several markers of organ dysfunction with the outcomes of interest among infected and septic children support their inclusion in the data validation phase of the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce.

AB  - Down syndrome is a well-recognised genetic condition associated with several comorbidities. Although CHD is common in Down syndrome, transposition of the great arteries is exceptionally rare. We describe a neonate with Down syndrome who presented with transient abnormal myelopoiesis and transposition of the great arteries. Down syndrome may accelerate pulmonary hypertension in transposition of the great arteries and is associated with poor outcomes.

AB  - Background: Optimal fluid management during neurosurgery is controversial. Evidences suggest that goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) can improve postoperative outcome. This study aimed to assess the intraoperative use of GDFT on the duration of hospital stay and postoperative complications in patients undergoing craniotomy for large supratentorial tumors.
   Materials and Methods: Forty patients of 18-65 years age undergoing large supratentorial tumor surgery were prospectively randomized into two groups. Control-group received fluid regimen based on routine hemodynamic monitoring, whereas patients belonging to GDFT group received fluid based on stroke volume variation (SVV)-guided therapy. A colloid bolus of 250 ml 6% hydroxyl ethyl starch was given, if the SVV was more than 12% in the GDFT group. Hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure and heart rate, and dynamic parameters, such as cardiac index, stroke volume index, and SVV, were recorded at different time intervals.
   Results: The total amount of fluid required was significantly lower in GDFT (P = 0.003) group as compared to the Control group. Intraoperative complications were significantly lower in GDFT group (P =0.005), but the incidence of tight brain was significantly higher in the control group. The duration of hospital stay (P = 0.07) and incidence of postoperative complications (P = 0.32) were lower in GDFT group. Neurological outcomes at-discharge were similar in both the groups.
   Conclusions: This study did not show any benefit of GDFT over conventional intraoperative fluid therapy in terms of incidence of postoperative complications, hospital and ICU stay, and Glasgow outcome scores at-discharge in patients undergoing craniotomy for excision of large supratentorial tumors. However, the use of GDFT leads to better perioperative fluid management and brain relaxation scores.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated neurological, mental health disorders, and neurocognitive issues. However, there is a lack of inexpensive and efficient brain evaluation and screening systems. As a result, a considerable fraction of patients with neurocognitive or psychobehavioral predicaments either do not get timely diagnosed or fail to receive personalized treatment plans. This is especially true in the elderly populations, wherein only 16% of seniors say they receive regular cognitive evaluations. Therefore, there is a great need for development of an optimized clinical brain screening workflow methodology like what is already in existence for prostate and breast exams. Such a methodology should be designed to facilitate objective early detection and cost-effective treatment of such disorders. In this paper we have reviewed the existing clinical protocols, recent technological advances and suggested reliable clinical workflows for brain screening. Such protocols range from questionnaires and smartphone apps to multi-modality brain mapping and advanced imaging where applicable. To that end, the Society for Brain Mapping and Therapeutics (SBMT) proposes the Brain, Spine and Mental Health Screening (NEUROSCREEN) as a multi-faceted approach. Beside other assessment tools, NEUROSCREEN employs smartphone guided cognitive assessments and quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) as well as potential genetic testing for cognitive decline risk as inexpensive and effective screening tools to facilitate objective diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and guide personalized treatment interventions. Operationalizing NEUROSCREEN is expected to result in reduced healthcare costs and improving quality of life at national and later, global scales.

TI  - Greater Curvature, Centerline or Straightened Centerline Length - Which length is Most Accurate for Preprocedural Planning in Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair?
T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
KW  - ENDOLEAK FORMATION
KW  - PREDICTION
KW  - TEVAR
KW  - RISK
AB  - Background: Automated centerline (CL) measurements have been conventionally used for stent-graft length estimation during thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of greater curvature length (GL), semiautomated CL and straightened centerline length (SCL) for preprocedural planning in TEVAR.
   Methods: Immediate postprocedural CT Angiographies of 30 patients (22 males, age-49.2 +/- 10.1years) who underwent TEVAR between 2015 and 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. CL, GL, SCL and the straightline length(SL) were measured between proximal and distal ends of the stent-graft and results were compared with the true length of the stent-graft (TL). Tortuosity index (TI = CL/SL) was calculated.
   Results: GL (17.92 +/- 4.78 cm) was the closest in predicting the TL (17.75 +/- 4.29 cm) (P = 0.414) overall, as well as in both dissection and aneurysm subgroups (P= 0.9). There was a significant difference between CL (16.67 +/- 4.07 cm) and TL (P < 0.0001) aswell as between SCL (16.86 +/- 4.16 cm) and TL (P= 0.001). These differences were greater in dissection subgroup than in the aneurysm group (P < 0.0001 and P= 0.03 for TL-CL and TL-SCL, respectively). The extent of mismatch between GL or CL and TL did not correlate with tortuosity, but the difference between TL and SCL had a significant positive correlation with tortuosity (r = 0.375, P= 0.04). TL-GL had a negative linear correlation with the stent-graft length (TL) in the dissection group (r = 0.50, P= 0.03).
   Conclusions: The greater curvature length predicts the actual total length of the deployed stent-graft more accurately than centerline or straightened centerline lengths. Hence, it should be used in planning for the length of stent-graft required for TEVAR.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accu-racy (DA) of dual-source CT coronary angiography (DSCTCA) against invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in assessing stenotic cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) in heart transplant (HTX) recipients. Methods: Consecutive HTX recipients(n = 38) on annual surveillance, underwent DSCTCA prior to ICA on a 192-detector 384 -slice DSCT scanner. Cases were clas-sified as no CAV (no stenosis), any CAV (any degree of stenosis) or significant CAV (>50% stenosis). Results: Mean age was 33.66 +/- 11.45 years (M:F = 27:11, median time from HTX- 23.5 months). Prevalence of any CAV on DSCTCA and ICA was 44.7%(n = 17) and 39.5%(n = 15), respectively and that of signifi-cant CAV was 21.1%(n = 8) and 15.8%(n = 6), respec-tively. 557 (96.7%) segments were interpretable on DSCTCA. Mean radiation dose was 4.24 +/- 2.15 mSv. At patient-level, the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value, negative-predictive value (NPV), and DA of DSCTCA for detection of any CAV and signifi-cant CAV were 100%, 91.3%, 88.2%, 100%, 94.73% and 100%, 94%, 75%, 100%, 95% respectively. The same on segment -based analysis were 96%, 97.6%, 80%, 99.6%, 97.5% and 100%, 99.6%,86.7%,100%, 99.6%, respec-tively. There was excellent agreement between the two modalities for detection of any CAV and signifi-cant CAV [Kappa = 0.892 and 0.826 (patient-level), 0.859 and 0.927 (segment-level)]. CAC score correlated significantly with the presence of any CAV on both modalities. A diagnosis of rejection on biopsy did not correlate with any/significant CAV on DSCTCA or ICA. Conclusion: High sensitivity and NPV of DSCTCA in the evaluation of stenotic CAV suggests that it can be an accurate and non-invasive alternative to ICA for routine surveillance of HTX recipients. Advances in knowledge: DSCTCA detects the stenotic CAV non-invasively in transplant recipients with high sensitivity, specificity and NPV when compared with catheter coronary angiography, at lower radiation doses. There is excellent agreement between CT angiography and catheter coronary angiography for detection of any CAV and significant CAV. A diagnosis of rejection on biopsy does not correlate with any/significant CAV on CT angiography or catheter angiography.

AB  - Background: The use of plants and plant products in health care has shown an exponential increase in the past two decades. Introduction: In-spite of the availability of well-established pharmacotherapy for epilepsy, a large no of the population still explores alternative treatments due to refractory seizures, adverse effects of drugs, chronic treatment, inaccessibility of standard therapies in rural areas and the social stigma attached to the disease. Various studies on medicinal plants showed the protective effect of herbals in animal models of epilepsy. Methods: In the present review, a status analysis of the traditional use of various medicinal plants in epilepsy with a special focus on plats having anti-inflammatory potential is recorded. Result and Conclusion: The shortcomings of research on medicinal plants which need to be explored further in order to tackle the growing need for safer and effective drugs for epilepsy are discussed. Overall, there is a huge scope of herbal drugs in CNS disorders, especially epilepsy, either as an adjunct by reducing the dose and thus side effects of standard anti-epileptic drugs or as a standalone agent. Although, there is still an urgent need of well planned randomized controlled clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ANATOMICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
KW  - Fetal posterior cerebral artery
KW  - variations
KW  - vertebrobasilar system
AB  - Introduction: The aim is to study morphometric analysis of normal and variant anatomy of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and incidence of fetal PCA (FPCA) in Uttar Pradesh region. The PCA and its cortical branches supply blood to the occipital lobe, inferomedial temporal lobe, and portions of posterior inferior parietal lobe. Fetal-type PCA is a common anatomic variation of PCA that is closely associated with intracranial aneurysm. The present study provides the description of PCA regarding its normal morphology, morphometry, and variations in Uttar Pradesh region. Material and Methods: The study evaluated 100 computed tomography angiograms. Results: Among arteries that displayed normal anatomy, mean diameter of PCA was observed to be 4.29 +/- 0.74 mm on the right side and 2.47 +/- 0.74 mm on the left side. Mean diameter in males and in females was found to be 2.48 +/- 0.73 mm and 2.47 +/- 0.74 mm, respectively. In 56.5% of cases, the diameters of P1 segment of PCAs ranged from 2.1 to 3 mm whereas >3 mm diameter was observed in 18.5% cases. Nineteen percent cases showed 1.1-2 mm. In 6% cases, hypoplasia (<= 1 mm) of PCA was observed. FPCA was observed in 26% cases. Unilateral observed in 17% cases and bilateral in 9% cases and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.000). Discussion and Conclusion: Anomalies of PCA may assume considerable significance in surgeries of head and neck, which require ligation of internal carotid and common carotid artery. Awareness of these anatomical variations described shall prove to be useful for any cerebrovascular procedures.

AB  - Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted volume, management strategies and patient outcomes of acute appendicitis. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate whether the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in higher incidence of complicated appendicitis in children presenting with acute appendicitis compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. The secondary aim was to investigate the proportion of the patients treated by non-operative management (NOM). Methods: A systematic search of four scientific databases was performed. The search terms used were (coronavirus OR SARS-CoV-2 OR COVID-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (appendicitis). The inclusion criteria were all patients aged <18 years and diagnosed with acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 and pre-COVID-19 periods. The proportion of children presenting with complicated appendicitis and the proportion of children managed by NOM was compared between the two groups. The Downs and Black scale was used for methodological quality assessment. Results: The present meta-analysis included thirteen studies (twelve retrospective studies and one cross-sectional study). A total of 2782 patients (1239 during the COVID-19 period) were included. A significantly higher incidence of complicated appendicitis (RR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.33-2.01, p < 0.00001) and a significantly higher proportion of children managed via the NOM (RR = 1.95, 95% CI 1.45-2.61, p < 0.00001) was observed in patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Conclusion: There is a significantly higher incidence of complicated appendicitis in children during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the pre-COVID-19 period. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of children was managed via the NOM during the pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period.

AB  - Background Infant massage is commonly practiced in many parts of the world. However, the effectiveness of this intervention has not been reviewed for term, healthy newborns.
   Methods This systematic review of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessed the effect of whole-body massage with or without oil, compared to no massage in term healthy newborns. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, systemic infections, growth, behaviour (crying or fussing time, sleep duration), and neurodevelopment. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CINAHL (updated till November 2021), and clinical trials databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesized effect estimates using mean difference (MD) and standardized mean difference (SMD). The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence.
   Results We included 31 randomized and quasi-randomized trials involving 3860 participants. Infant massage was performed by different care providers starting in the neonatal period and continuing for 1-2 months in most studies. Thirteen studies reported the use of oil with body massage. No study reported neonatal mortality or systemic infections. Meta-analyses suggested that whole-body massage may increase infant length at the end of the intervention period (median assessment age 6 weeks; mean difference (MD) = 1.6 cm, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4 to 1.7 cm; low certainty evidence), but the effect on weight (MD = 340 g, 95% CI = 240 to 441 g), head circumference (MD = 0.8 cm, 95% CI = 0.6 to 1.1 cm), sleep duration (MD = 0.62 hours/d, 95% CI = 0.12 to 1.12 hours/d) and bilirubin levels (MD = -31.8 mmol/L or -1.8 mg/dL, 95% CI = -23.5 to -40.0 mmol/L) was uncertain. The effect on crying/fussing time at median 3 months of age, sleep duration at 6 months of age, weight, length, and head circumference at 6-12 months follow-up, and neurodevelopment outcomes, both at the end of the intervention period and follow-up was uncertain.
   Conclusions Whole-body massage may improve the infant length at the end of the intervention period (median age 6 weeks, range 1-6 months) but the effect on other short- or long-term outcomes is uncertain. There is a need for further well-designed trials in future.

TI  - Timing of first bath in term healthy newborns: A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
AB  - Background This systematic review of intervention trials and observational studies assessed the effect of delaying the first bath for at least 24 hours after birth, com-pared to conducting it within the first 24 hours, in term healthy newborns.Methods We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, CI-NAHL (updated till November 2021), and clinical trials databases and reference lists of retrieved articles. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, systemic infections, hypothermia, hypoglycaemia, and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates. Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesized effect estimates using relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). The GRADE approach was used to as-sess the certainty of evidence.Results We included 16 studies (two trials and 14 observational studies) involving 39 020 term or near-term healthy newborns. Delayed and early baths were defined variably in the studies, most commonly as >24 hours (six studies) and as <= 6 hours (12 studies), respectively. We performed a post-hoc analysis for studies that defined early bath as <= 6 hours. Low certainty evidence suggested that bathing the newborn 24 hours after birth might reduce the risk of infant mortality (OR = 0.46, 95% con-fidence interval (CI) = 0.28 to 0.77; one study, 789 participants) and neonatal hy-pothermia (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.28-0.88; one study, 660 newborns), compared to bathing within first 24 hours. The evidence on the effect on EBF at discharge was very uncertain. Delayed bath beyond 6 hours (at or after nine, 12, or 24 hours) after birth compared to that within 6 hours might reduce the risk of hypothermia (OR = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.36-0.61; four studies, 2711 newborns) and hypoglycaemia (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.23-0.66; three studies, 2775 newborns) and improve the incidence of EBF at discharge (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.08-1.34; six studies, 6768 newborns); the evidence of the effect on neonatal mortality was very uncertain.Conclusion Delayed first bath for at least 24 hours may reduce infant mortality and hypothermia. Delayed bath for at least 6 hours may prevent hypothermia and hypoglycaemia and improve EBF rates at discharge. However, most of these con-clusions are limited by low certainty evidence.Registration PROSPERO 2020 CRD42020177430.

AB  - Background This systematic review of randomized trials assessed the effect of emollient application compared to no emollient application in term or near-term healthy newborns. Methods We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and CINAHL (updated until November 2021), clinical trials databases, and ref-erence lists of retrieved articles. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, system-ic infections, atopic dermatitis, skin condition, and adverse events. Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesized effect esti-mates using relative risks (RR). The GRADE approach was used to assess the cer-tainty of evidence. Results We screened 19 243 records and included 16 eligible trials involving 5643 participants. Five trials recruited 3352 healthy newborns (term = 728; ges-tation ???35 weeks = 2624); and 11 trials included 2291 term newborns who were ???at risk??? for developing atopy but were otherwise healthy. We conducted a sepa-rate analysis for these two groups of newborns. Emollient application (creams or nut, seed, and vegetable oils) started in the neonatal period and continued for four weeks to two years across studies. Meta-analysis for term healthy newborns sug-gests that topical emollient application may have little to no effect on atopic der-matitis (RR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.96-1.72; two trials, 1408 newborns; low certainty evidence). Effects on food allergy (RR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.42-1.70; one trial, 233 newborns), allergic sensitization to food allergens (RR 1.31; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.68; one trial, 234 newborns) and inhalational allergens (RR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.44, 2.14; 1 trial, 234 newborns), skin dryness (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55-1.00; two trials, 294 newborns), and skin problems (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.81-1.05; two tri-als, 292 newborns) were uncertain. Meta-analysis for ???at-risk??? newborns suggests that intervention probably lowers the risk of atopic dermatitis (RR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.63-0.86; 11 studies, 1988 infants; moderate certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on food allergy and allergic sensitization to food or inhala-tion allergens. The effect on skin dryness and skin rash was uncertain. Conclusions Topical emollient application may not prevent atopic dermatitis in term healthy newborns. There is little data for other skin and allergic outcomes.

AB  - Background Though recommended by numerous guidelines, adherence to su-pine sleep position during the first year of life is variable across the globe. Methods This systematic review of randomized trials and observational studies assessed the effect of the supine compared to non-supine (prone or side) sleep position on healthy newborns. Key outcomes were neonatal mortality, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), acute life-threatening event (ALTE), neurodevelopment, and positional plagiocephaly. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, and CI-NAHL (updated till November 2021). Two authors separately evaluated the risk of bias, extracted data, and synthesised effect estimates using relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR). The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of ev-idence. Results We included 54 studies (43 observational studies and 11 intervention tri-als) involving 474 672 participants. A single study meeting the inclusion criteria suggested that the supine sleep position might reduce the risk of SUDI (0-1 year; OR = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.23-0.65; 384 infants), compared to non-supine position. Supine sleep position might reduce the risk of SIDS (0-1 year; OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.42-0.61; 26 studies, 59332 infants) and unexplained SIDS/severe ALTE (neonatal period; OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.03-0.82; 1 study, 119 newborns), but the evidence was very uncertain. Supine sleep position probably increased the odds of being 0.5 standard deviation (SD) below mean on Gross Mo-tor Scale at 6 months (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.22-2.27; 1 study, 2097 participants), but might have little to no effect at 18 months of age (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.96, 1.43; 1 study, 1919 participants). An increase in positional plagiocephaly at 2-7 months of age with supine sleep position is possible (OR = 2.77, 95% CI = 2.06-3.72; 6 studies, 1774 participants). Conclusions Low-to very low-certainty evidence suggests that supine sleep po-sition may reduce the risk of SUDI (0-1 year) and SIDS (0-1 year). Limited ev-idence suggests that supine sleeping probably delays short-term ???gross motor??? development at 6 months, but the effect on long-term neurodevelopment at 18 months may be negligible.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) of suspicious axillary lymph nodes and its combination with B -mode USG in predicting nodal metastasis in breast cancer patients. Methods: Prospective observational study was performed from June 2018 to August 2020 on breast cancer patients with suspicious axillary nodes on USG. B -mode features (cortical thickness, effacement of fatty hilum, non- hilar blood flow and round shape) and SWE parameters (Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD) of the node with the thickest cortex were evaluated. Diagnostic performances of USG, SWE and their combination were estimated using pathological status of the node on biopsy as the gold standard. Results: Of the 54 patients evaluated, optimal elasticity maps were obtained in 49 nodes of 49 patients (mean age, 46.3 ?? 12.1 years; 48/49 (98%) females). On biopsy, 38 nodes (77.6%) had metastasis, while 11 (22.4%) had reactive hyperplasia. Emax, Emin, Emean and ESD of both cortex and hilum were significantly higher in metastatic than reactive nodes. Emax (cortex) >_14.9 kPa had the best diagnostic performance (sensitivity, 73.7%; specificity, 81.8%). Cortical thickness >_6.7 mm had the best diagnostic performance among B -mode features (sensitivity, 89.5%; specificity, 72.7%). Combining cortical thickness with effacement of fatty hilum and/or non- hilar blood flow yielded sensitivity of 89.5% and specificity of 90.9%. Addition of Emax (cortex) to cortical thickness and combination of >_2 B -mode features increased their specificities to 90.9 and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: Metastatic axillary nodes are stiffer than reactive nodes on SWE in breast cancer patients. Emax (cortex) has the best diagnostic performance in differentiating between reactive hyperplasia and nodal metastasis. Combination of Emax (cortex) and cortical thickness increases the specificity for diagnosing metastasis, especially in nodes showing only cortical thickening. Advances in knowledge: Combination of SWE and B -mode USG is highly specific for differentiating metastasis from reactive hyperplasia in suspicious nodes of breast carcinoma patients, especially in nodes with only cortical thickening.

AB  - Stroke is the second most common cause of death worldwide. The rates of stroke are increasing in less affluent countries predominantly because of a high prevalence of modifiable risk factors. The Lipid Association of India (LAI) has provided a risk stratification algorithm for patients with ischaemic stroke and recommended low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals for those in very high risk group and extreme risk group (category A) of <50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) while the LDL-C goal for extreme risk group (category B) is <= 30 mg/dl (0.8 mmol/l). High intensity statins are the first-line lipid lowering therapy. Non-statin therapy like ezetimibe and proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors may be added as an adjunct to statins in patients who do not achieve LDL-C goals with statins alone. In acute ischaemic stroke, high intensity statin therapy improves neurological and functional outcomes regardless of thrombolytic therapy. Although conflicting data exist regarding increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) with statin use, the overall benefit risk ratio favors long-term statin therapy necessitating detailed discussion with the patient. Patients who have statins withdrawn while being on prior statin therapy at the time of acute ischaemic stroke have worse functional outcomes and increased mortality. LAI recommends that statins be continued in such patients. In patients presenting with ICH, statins should not be started in the acute phase but should be continued in patients who are already taking statins. ICH patients, once stable, need risk stratification for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

AB  - The succedaneous permanent teeth develop in close proximity to primary teeth. They can get accidentally luxated or avulsed during the extraction of primary teeth. The purpose of this paper was to describe a case of a 14-year-old boy with an "iatrogenic avulsion" of an immature mandibular second premolar during the extraction of a primary mandibular second molar. The case was managed successfully with replantation technique within 30 minutes of extra oral period and followed up for 5 years. The replanted tooth remained clinically asymptomatic, showed continued root development and eruption and remained vital. This paper had also discussed about the modifications in extraction technique to avoid the iatrogenic avulsion of permanent tooth bud during extraction of primary teeth.

AB  - Meningiomas are benign intracranial neoplasms arising from arachnoid cap cells. High grade meningiomas are uncommon and metastasis from these is an extremely rare event. Commonest sites of metastasis from high grade meningiomas include lung, liver, lymph nodes and bone. It is unusual for meningiomas to recur in the surgical track following excision. More so, it is even the rarest phenomenon for a meningioma to implant in subgaleal location. Various mechanisms have been proposed for the scalp implantation vis-a-vis CSF dissemination, direct surgical implantation etc., It may apply to all histological grades of meningiomas. Even the benign tumors have been shown to seed at postoperative scar. This seems to have provoked our interest to review the literature regarding this scalp implantation. We have reviewed all the cases where surgical excision of intracranial meningiomas has led to seeding of surgical track as well as scalp. We have discussed the various genetic aberrations that can guide us regarding the progression of the tumor and prognosis. We also report a case of surgical track and scalp implantation of an atypical intraventricular meningioma following excision.

AB  - GRP78 overexpression in myeloma cells has been associated with bortezomib resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, serum GRP78 as a maker of bortezomib-based treatment response remains unexplored. The objective of the study was to evaluate serum GRP78 levels in MM patients who underwent a bortezomib-based induction regimen. This cross-sectional study included adult MM patients (n=30) who completed at least four cycles of bortezomib-based induction therapy. Healthy volunteers (n=30) and newly diagnosed MM patients (n=19) were also recruited to identify the disease -associated change in GRP78 levels. Serum GRP78 was estimated by ELISA. Surface and intracellular expression of GRP78 in bone marrow plasma cells was evaluated in ten MM patients by flow cytometry. Among 30 MM patients [median (range): 52 (38-68) years; 20 males] who completed at least four cycles of bortezomib-based induction therapy, 20 were responders and 10 were non-responders. Serum GRP78 levels were not significantly different between responders [median (IQR): 5.2 (3.1, 8.0) mu g/ml] and non-responders [median (IQR): 4.3 (0.1, 7.1) mu g/ml] (p=0.4). Although non-significant (p=0.3), median serum GRP78 was higher in newly diagnosed patients when compared to healthy volunteers. Bone marrow plasma cells ranged from 0.2 to 57.8% in the analyzed samples. Intracellular GRP78 expression in bone marrow plasma cells was higher (1.6 to 5 times) when compared to surface expression. To conclude, serum GRP78 levels vary widely in different MM patient groups but did not correlate with response to a bortezomib-based induction regimen.

AB  - Substance use disorder impacts the lives of significant others, more especially the wives of individuals using substances. However, the physical and mental health issues among wives of people who inject drugs (PWID) are less studied. The current cross-sectional, multisite study assessed the physical and mental health of wives of 433 PWID across six sites in Delhi. The mean age of the participants was 32.7 years (standard deviation: 9.7). More than 50% of the participants reported menstrual problems, most commonly dysmenorrhea. Around 55.9% had adverse pregnancy outcomes (abortion, miscarriage, or stillbirth). Around one out of four participants reported at least one specific sexually transmitted infection symptom. Around 11% were diagnosed with tuberculosis and 35% with a major medical illness in their lifetime. More than 90% of the participants had depressive and anxiety symptoms. The study showed that there is a huge burden of physical and mental health issues among the wives of PWID.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of solid lipid nanoparticles of berberine against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Background: Berberine (Ber) is cardioprotective, but its oral bioavailability is low, and its effect on chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity has not been studied. Objective: Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of berberine chloride were prepared, characterized and evaluated in vitro against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte injury. Methods: Berberine-loaded SLNs (Ber-SLNs) were synthesized using the water-in-oil microemulsion technique with tripalmitin, Tween 80 and poloxamer 407. Ber-SLNs were evaluated for preventive effect against toxicity of doxorubicin in H9c2 cells. The culture was pre-treated (24 h) with Ber (10 mu M) and Ber-SLNs (1 and 10 mu M), and 1 mu M of doxorubicin (Dox) was added for 3 h. The cell viability assay (MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase)), levels of Creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), Nitrite, MDA (Malondialdehyde), ROS (Reactive oxygen species) generation, and apoptotic DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) content were assessed. Results: Ber-SLNs had a mean particle size of 13.12 +/- 1.188 nm, the zeta potential of -1.05 +/- 0.08 mV, poly-dispersity index (PDI) of 0.317 +/- 0.05 and entrapment efficiency of 50 +/- 4.8%. Cell viability was 81 +/- 0.17% for Ber-SLNs (10 mu M) and 73.22 +/- 0.83% for Ber (10 mu M) treated cells in the MTT assay. Percentage cytotoxicity calculated from LDH release was 58.91 +/- 0.54% after Dox, 40.3 +/- 1.3% with Ber (10 mu M) and 40.7 +/- 1.3% with Ber-SLNs (1 mu M) (p<0.001). Inflammation and oxidative stress markers were lower with Ber and Ber-SLNs. Attenuation of ROS generation and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes were noted on fluorescence microscopy. Conclusion: Ber SLNs effectively prevented doxorubicin-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in rat cardiomyocytes. The results demonstrate that microemulsion is a simple and cost-effective technique to prepare Ber-SLNs, and may be considered as a drug delivery vehicle for berberine.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antiepileptic-drug (AED) serum level and inflammatory biomarkers are primarily monitored/assessed during epilepsy treatment for effective seizure control; however, their correlation with seizure recurrence (SR) following AED-tapering has not been established, and this is being investigated in this study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled persons with epilepsy (PWE) on AED monotherapy and going to start tapering after being seizure-free for >= 2 years. Data regarding seizure episodes, AED-treatment, and adverse events (using Liverpool Adverse Event profile [LAEP]-score) were recorded. Serum AED levels using high-performance liquid chromatography and biomarkers levels through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were estimated at AED-tapering commencement and at 6 months/SR time. RESULTS: Among 129 enrolled PWE (levetiracetam [n = 52], valproate [n = 34], carbamazepine [n = 29], and phenytoin [n = 14]), SR occurred in 23.3% during follow-up (range 12-44 months). PWE with subtherapeutic serum AED level at the onset of tapering had higher SR (P = 0.004) than those with therapeutic or higher levels. Levetiracetam-treated PWEs with SR have significantly low AED levels than PWE with no-SR (P < 0.001). PWE had significantly raised inflammatory biomarkers (interleukin [IL]-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, IL-6, and high-mobility group box protein 1) and decreased IL-10 than healthy control subjects. SR and no-SR groups did not differ significantly in inflammatory markers except for higher IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels in SR group (P = 0.001, 0.02, respectively). Improvement in LAEP score was observed in follow-up visits without any difference between SR and no-SR groups. CONCLUSION: Low serum AED levels (especially levetiracetam) and raised levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta during tapering commencement had a higher association with SR following AED-tapering.

AB  - Introduction: Prognostic scores in Ewing sarcoma including baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics are necessary for pre-treatment risk stratification. In this study, we formulated and validated a prognostic model for baseline risk categorization in Ewing sarcoma. Materials and methods: A retrospective single-institutional study was conducted on Ewing sarcoma patients treated uniformly between January 2003 and December 2018. Baseline clinical/pathological characteristics and survival outcomes were noted from medical records. The cohort was randomised into a derivation and validation cohort. A prognostic score was formulated by including independent prognostic factors from the derivation cohort by multivariable analysis. The prognostic model was validated in the validation cohort along with estimation of its predictive ability. Results: A total of 860 patients were included with 40.3% having baseline metastases. Tumor diameter 0.001, score 2), and total leucocyte count 11000/mm(3) (HR 1.44; P=0.015; score 1) were independent predictors of overall survival in derivation cohort and included for prognostic score calculation. Patients were categorized into low (score 0), intermediate (score 1-3) and high-risk (score 4-5) groups. Harrell's c-indexes of the model were 0.625, 0.622 and 0.624 in the derivation, validation and whole cohort respectively. The timed AUC of ROC of the prognostic score-group for 5-year survival was 0.72, 0.71 and 0.73 in the derivation, validation and whole cohort respectively. Conclusions: We have formulated and validated a prognostic score for Ewing sarcoma incorporating baseline clinical and laboratory parameters, with fair predictive ability for risk stratification and facilitating riskadapted personalized therapy.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes abnormalities in the hemostatic system, collectively known as COVID-associated coagulopathy. The dynamics of clot formation are best discerned by whole-blood viscoelastic tests, such as thromboelastography (TEG). We aimed to assess the various abnormalities seen on TEG and explored the predictors of outcomes in these patients.
   Methods: Thromboelastography was performed for 28 patients with COVID-19 using an automated thromboelastogram. The hemostatic condition was categorized as hypercoagulable in 17 (63%), hypocoagulable in 2 (7%), and normal in 8 (30%) based on TEG variables, such as reaction time , time until clot reaches a fixed strength, alpha angle, maximum amplitude, and clotting index. Laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes were compared between hypercoagulable and normal groups.
   Results: Twenty-seven patients with a median age of 50 years (interquartile range, 40-60 years), male-to-female ratio of 0.9:1, median C-reactive protein of 25.7 (10.9-108.8) mg/L, serum ferritin of 693 (317-1031) mu g/L, and albumin 2.9 (2.6-3.3) g/dL were included. The median prothrombin time/international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time were within normal range in the hypercoagulable and normal groups. The severity of COVID-19 was mild in 6 (22.2%), moderate in 2 (7.4%), and severe in 19 (70.4%) patients. Twenty-eight-day mortality among patients with hypocoagulable and hypercoagulable states was higher than normal coagulation status. (log-rank test, P = .002).
   Conclusions: Hypercoagulable state, together with a severe inflammatory state, is common in patients with COVID-19, despite thromboprophylaxis. TEG assesses coagulation status better than conventional coagulation tests. Coagulation abnormalities are associated with poor outcomes.

AB  - IntroductionTrans-radial approach (TRA) is recommended over trans-femoral approach (TFA) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We intended to study the effect of access on all-cause mortality. Methods and resultsWe searched PubMed and EMBASE for randomized studies on patients with ACS undergoing PCI. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-days. The secondary outcomes included in-hospital mortality, major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACE) as defined by the study, net adverse clinical event (NACE), non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, stent thrombosis, study-defined major bleeding, and minor bleeding, vascular complications, hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, non-access site bleeding, need for transfusion, access site cross-over, contrast volume, procedure duration, and hospital stay duration. We studied 20,122 ACS patients, including 10,037 and 10,085 patients undergoing trans-radial and trans-femoral approaches, respectively. We found mortality benefit in patients with ACS for the trans-radial approach [(1.7% vs. 2.3%; RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.62-0.91; P = 0.004; I2 = 0%). Out of 10,465 patients with STEMI, 5,189 patients had TRA and 5,276 had TFA procedures. A similar benefit was observed in patients with STEMI alone [(2.3% vs. 3.3%; RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56-0.90; P = 0.004; I2 = 0%). We observed reduced MACE, NACE, major bleeding, vascular complications, and pseudoaneurysms. No difference in re-infarction, stroke, and serious bleeding requiring blood transfusions were noted. We noticed a small decrease in contrast volume(ml) {mean difference (95% CI): -4.6 [-8.5 to -0.7]}, small but significantly increase in procedural time {mean difference (95% CI) 1.2 [0.1 to 2.3]}and fluoroscopy time {mean difference (95% CI) 0.8 [0.3 to1.4] min} in the trans-radial group. ConclusionTRA has significantly reduced 30-day all-cause mortality among patients undergoing PCI for ACS. TRA should be the preferred vascular access in patients with ACS.

AB  - Purpose: With millions of people being affected by COVID-19, people living with post COVID-19 clinical symptoms (PCS) are expected to rise further. The primary aim of the study was to comprehensively assess self-reported PCS and its associated risk factors among beneficiaries of Hospital Employee Scheme of a tertiary healthcare institution in Delhi.Patients and Methods: An online cross-sectional study was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire developed by employing nominal group technique among individuals aged 18 years and above who were novel SARS-CoV-2 positive from January to April 2021. Participants were telephoned first, before sending the online survey link. Socio-demographic data, information on PCS along with potential risk factors, pre-existing morbidities, vaccination status, severity of acute illness and management were collected between June and July 2021. PCS was presented as relative frequency; Chi-Square test and odds ratio; adjusted values were used to rule out any association between PCS and predictors.Results: In total, 773 of 1801 eligible participants responded to the survey (completion rate 42.9%), with a median age of 34 years (IQR 27- 44). Males accounted for 56.4% and PCS was present in 33.2%. The most prevalent symptoms were fatigue (79.3%), arthralgia (33.4%), myalgia (29.9%), hair loss (28.0%), headache (27.2%), breathlessness (25.3%), and sleep disturbance (25.3%). The prevalence of PCS was reduced to 12.8% at 12 weeks. Female gender, older age, oxygen supplementation, severity of acute illness, and pre-existing co-morbidities were positively associated with PCS. Vaccination (second dose) reduced the odds of developing PCS by 39% compared to unvaccinated participants (aOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.40-0.96).Conclusion: PCS affects almost all organ systems of the body, regardless of the severity of acute COVID-19 illness. Two doses of vaccine hel reduce the development of PCS.

AB  - Development of immunotherapy agents has changed the cancer treatment paradigm with better outcomes and lesser side effects. Yet, there are adverse events associated with them. Owing to the increased stimulation of the immune system, the normal homeostatic mechanisms protecting the body from its own immune response can become disrupted, leading to a variety of side effects termed immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). irAEs can have significant associated morbidity and in many cases lead to discontinuation of therapies with unpredictable impact on the course of patients' disease. Few key articles laying out guidelines for the management of irAEs provide general treatment algorithms for the majority of the common irAEs. Nurses should have knowledge of the mechanism and adverse events associated with such therapies. Oncology nurses have a crucial role in identification of irAEs. irAEs may involve multiple systems, and thus, it is necessary to identify and manage these adverse events according to the case these at soon as possible.

TI  - COVID-19: Finally on Wane, with Reduced Lethality
T2  - COMBINATORIAL CHEMISTRY & HIGH THROUGHPUT SCREENING
AB  - As most of the countries have already passed the peaks of the second or third wave of infections, COVID-19 is (finally) on the wane and will soon touch the baseline persistence with a reduced death rate. The Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) or lethality is presently only similar to 2.0%, which is relatively low in comparison to the high of 14% in April 2020. More importantly, the lethality in healthy people is 20 times lower. In addition, successful vaccination programs are currently under-way in several countries. Thus, although new pathogenic variants as well as a few isolated cases of resurgence, will continue to emerge, the worst seems to be over and we will surely win this battle soon.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a worldwide problem after the emergence of colistin resistance since it was the last option left to treat carbapenemase-resistant bacterial infections. The mcr gene and its variants are one of the causes for colistin resistance. Besides mcr genes, some other intrinsic genes are also involved in colistin resistance but still need to be explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate differential proteins expression of colistin-resistant E. coli clinical isolate and to understand their interactive partners as future drug targets. Methods: In this study, we have employed the whole proteome analysis through LC-MS/MS. The advance proteomics tools were used to find differentially expressed proteins in the colistin-resistant Escherichia coli clinical isolate compared to susceptible isolate. Gene ontology and STRING were used for functional annotation and protein-protein interaction networks, respectively. Results: LC-MS/MS analysis showed overexpression of 47 proteins and underexpression of 74 proteins in colistin-resistant E. coli. These proteins belong to DNA replication, transcription and translational process; defense and stress related proteins; proteins of phosphoenol pyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) and sugar metabolism. Functional annotation and protein-protein interaction showed translational and cellular metabolic process, sugar metabolism and metabolite interconversion. Conclusion: We conclude that these protein targets and their pathways might be used to develop novel therapeutics against colistin-resistant infections. These proteins could unveil the mechanism of colistin resistance.

AB  - Purpose: Fructose is highly lipogenic, and its unhindered ingestion by children and adolescents is understood to induce hypertriglyceridemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (ped-NAFLD) that is till date managed symptomatically or surgically. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of hydroethanolic extract of leaves of Guava (PG-HM) to suppress the alterations in the hepatic molecular signals due to unrestricted fructose (15%) drinking by growing rats. Methods: Weaned rats (4 weeks old) in control groups had ad libitum access to fructose drinking solution (15%) for four (4FDR) or eight (8FDR) weeks, ie, till puberty or early adulthood, respectively, while treatment groups (4PGR, 8PGR) additionally received PG-HM (500 mg/kg, po). Results: The PG-HM suppressed ped-NAFLD through hepatic signalling pathways of 1) leptin-insulin (Akt/FOX-O1/SREBP-1c), 2) hypoxia-inflammation (HIF-1alpha/VEGF, TNF-alpha), 3) mitochondrial function (complexes I-V), 4) oxidative stress (MDA, GSH, SOD) and 5) glycolysis/gluconeogenesis/de novo lipogenesis (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, ketohexokinase, aldehyde dehydrogenase). Parri passu, the insulin sensitizing effect of PG-HM and its ethyl acetate fraction (PG-EA) was elucidated using HepG2 cells grown in media enhanced with fructose. Further, in murine hepatocytes cultured in fructose-rich media, PG-HM (35 mu g mL-1) outperformed Pioglitazone (15 mu M) and Metformin (5 mM), to suppress hepatic insulin resistance. Conclusion: This study established that hydroethanolic extract of leaves of Guava (PG-HM) has potential to suppress hepatic metabolic alteration for the management of the pediatric NAFLD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a vicious woe to the public health and wellness. Uncertainty in their underlying causes, lack of effective biomarkers for their early detection, existence of only supportive therapy, and their ever rising incidence creates an unmatched need for targeted therapies. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have found to be promising candidates for regenerative and remedial therapy in neurodegenerative disorders, however several biological risks and practical issues impede in their translational utility. Deriving from MSCs are certain Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), which aid in the paracrine action of MSCs and have lately gained the scientific interest for their implacability in diverse set ups. Their cargo is of utmost importance and is being explored in various different diseases like heart diseases, neuronal diseases, respiratory diseases and hepatic diseases. They thereby hold the position of a likely prospective remedial candidate for therapy against neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Background: Markers of ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) predict cardiovascular events. We estimated the prevalence of ideal CVH markers in two levels of cities and villages in India.
   Methods: We did pooled analysis of individual-level data from three cross sectional surveys of adults >= 30 years over 2010-14 (CARPS: Centre for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia; UDAY and Solan Surveillance Study) representing metropolitan cities; smaller cities and rural areas in diverse locations of India. We defined ideal CVH using modified American Heart Association recommendations: not smoking, >= 5 servings of fruits and vegetables (F&V), high physical activity (PA), body mass index (BMI) <25 Kg/m(2), blood pressure (BP) <120/80 mm Hg, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <100 mg/dl, and total cholesterol (TC) <200 mg/dL. We estimated (1) age-and sex-standardized prevalence of ideal CVH and (2) prevalence of good (>= 6 markers), moderate (4-5), and poor CVH (<= 3) adjusted for age, sex, education, and stratified by setting and asset tertiles.
   Results: Of the total 22,144 participants, the prevalence of ideal CVH markers were: not smoking (76.7% [95% CI 76.1, 77.2]), consumed >= 5 F&V (4.2% [3.9, 4.5]), high PA (67.5% [66.8. 68.2]). optimum BMI (59.6% [58.9, 60.3]), ideal BP (34.5% [33.9, 35.2]), FPG (65.8% [65.1, 66.5]) and TC (65.4% [64.7, 66.1]). The mean number of ideal CVH metrics was 3.7(95% CI: 3.7, 3.8). Adjusted prevalence of good, moderate, and poor CVH, varied across settings: metropolitan (3.9%, 41.0%, and 55.1%), smaller cities (7.8%, 49.2%, and 43%), and rural (10.4%, 60.9%, and 28.7%) and across asset tertiles: Low (11.0%. 55.9%, 33.1%), Middle (6.3%, 52.2%, 41.5%), and High (5.0%, 46.4%, 48.7%), respectively.
   Conclusion: Achievement of ideal CVH varied, with higher prevalence in rural and lower asset tertiles. Multi-sectoral and targeted policy and program actions are needed to improve CVH in diverse contexts in India.

This study was to assess whether ASHAs could imbibe new knowledge in eye care and conduct vision screening. Methods: Settings and Design:A pre-post-intervention study in South Delhi Integrated Vision Centres. It was conducted from January 2016 to March 2017. One day of conceptual training followed by hands-on training in vision screening was imparted to ASHAs. The knowledge was assessed thrice: before, immediately after, and following 1 year after training. The vision screening skill was assessed twice. Descriptive analysis using percentages, mean and standard deviations. Paired t-test was used for assessing the change in scores. Results: A total of 102 ASHAs were recruited. A significant increase in the knowledge score of ASHAs before (14.96) and after training (25.38) (P < 0.001) was noted. The knowledge score was sustained at 1 year (21.75). The satisfactory skill of vision screening was seen in 88 (86.3%) ASHAs after training, while 79 (77.5%) ASHAs still retained it after 1 year. Conclusion: The potential to involve ASHAs in community-based frontline eye care activities: awareness generation of eye diseases, identification of referrable conditions, and facilitating individuals to seek eye care facilities. This study informs about the duration, frequency, and content of the training. It also provides evidence on the improvement and sustainability of eye care knowledge and skills by ASHAs after conceptual and hands-on training.

Descriptive analysis using percentages, mean and standard deviations. Paired t-test was used for assessing the change in scores. Results: A total of 102 ASHAs were recruited. A significant increase in the knowledge score of ASHAs before (14.96) and after training (25.38) (P < 0.001) was noted. The knowledge score was sustained at 1 year (21.75). The satisfactory skill of vision screening was seen in 88 (86.3%) ASHAs after training, while 79 (77.5%) ASHAs still retained it after 1 year. Conclusion: The potential to involve ASHAs in community-based frontline eye care activities: awareness generation of eye diseases, identification of referrable conditions, and facilitating individuals to seek eye care facilities. This study informs about the duration, frequency, and content of the training. It also provides evidence on the improvement and sustainability of eye care knowledge and skills by ASHAs after conceptual and hands-on training.

AB  - Background: The ESKAPE group of pathogens which comprise of multidrug resistant bacteria, namely Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species are the cause of deadly nosocomial infections all over the world. While these pathogens have developed robust strategies to resist most antibiotics, their ability to form biofilms is one of their most combative properties. Hence there is an urgent need to discover new antibacterial agents which could prevent or destroy the biofilms made by these bacteria. Though it has been established that lactoferrin (LF), a potent iron binding antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral protein displays anti-biofilm properties, its mechanisms of action, in addition to its iron chelation property, still remains unclear. Objective: The binding and inhibition studies of LF with the enzyme Nucleoside diphosphate Kinase (NDK) and its elastase cleaved truncated 12 kDa fragment (12-NDK). Methods: The characterization studies of NDK and 12-NDK using florescence spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, size exclusion chromatography and ADP-glo Kinase Assay. Inhibition studies of LF-NDK using ADP-glo kinase assay, Surface Plasmon Resonance and Biofilm inhibition studies. Results: NDK and 12-NDK were cloned, expressed and purified from Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The characterization studies revealed NDK and 12-NDK from both species are stable and functional. The inhibition studies of LF-NDK revealed stable binding and inhibition of kinase activity by LF. Conclusion: The binding and inhibition studies have shown that while LF binds with both the NDK and their truncated forms, it tends to have a higher binding affinity with the truncated 12 kDa fragments, resulting in their decreased kinase activity. This study essentially gives a new direction to the field of inhibition of biofilm formation, as it proves that LF has a novel mechanism of action in other than iron sequestration.

AB  - Background: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs) are rare, accounting for less than 1% of astrocyto-mas, and commonly occur in young patients. The majority are WHO grade II. A fraction of tumors that present or recur with malignant change are classified as anaplastic (APXA, grade III). Limited data are available on their mo-lecular characteristics. Methodology: Genome-wide expression profiling of 14 PXA and 6 APXAs was performed by microarray. Among differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 14 (CDK14) and Mitochondrial Fission Process 1 (MTFP1) were validated by qRT PCR. Result: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed two distinct molecular clusters (Cluster 1: 10 PXA, 3 APXA and Cluster 2: 4 PXA, 3 APXA) with grade II and III tumors dis-tributed in both highlighting molecular heterogeneity within the same grade. There was an insignificant difference in age, sex, immunohistochemical profile, frequency of BRAF mutation, or CDKN2A deletion among the two clusters. Significantly, worse progression-free survival was observed in cluster 2 (P=0.003). mRNA profiling-based prediction of recurrence was superior to and independent of histological grade, BRAF mutation, or CDKN2A deletion status. A total of 10 upregulated and 418 downregulated genes were identified between the PXA clusters. qRT-PCR validation of CDK14 (upregulated in cluster 2) and MTFP1 (upregulated in cluster 1) showed strong concordance with expres-sion array data. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive study highlighting distinct molecular subgroups of PXA. The differentially expressed genes between two clusters may potentially be used for developing histology indepen-dent classification schemes, prognostication and may serve as prospective therapeutic targets for PXA patients.

KW  - CARE
AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in India, and little is known about the perception of patients and providers about a package of collaborative quality improvement (C-QIP) strategies consisting of provider-focused electronic health records-decision support system (EHR-DSS), non-physician health workers (NPHW), and patient-facing text messages to enhance the CVD care.Objective: To explore the barriers and enablers of the C-QIP strategy from the perspective of providers, health administrators, patients, and care givers in India.Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to understand the challenges and facilitators of implementing C-QIP strategy to enhance CVD care in the Indian context. A diverse sample of 38 physicians, 14 non-physician health workers (nurses, pharmacists), 4 health administrators, and 16 patients and their caregivers participated in semi-structured interviews. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, translated, anonymised, and coded using MAXQDA software. We used the framework method and CFIR domains to analyze the qualitative data.Results: Barriers perceived from providers' and health administrators' perspectives in providing quality CVD care were high patient volume, physician burnout, lack of robust communication or referral system, paucity of electronic health records, lack of patient counsellors, polypharmacy, poor patient adherence to medications, and lack of financial incentives. Low health literacy, high cost of treatment, misinformation bias, and difficulty in maintaining lifestyle changes were barriers from patients' perspectives. The CFIR identified key enablers for the implementation of C-QIP such as standardized treatment protocol, reduced medication errors, improved physician-patient relationships, and enhanced patient self-care through trained and supported NPHW. Barriers included: heterogenous healthcare settings, diverse patient groups and comorbidities, associated costs of care and interoperability, confidentiality, and data privacy issues around the use of EHR-DSS.Conclusion: Strategies to enhance CVD care must be low-cost, culturally acceptable, and integrated into existing care pathways.

AB  - Background & objectives: Inflammation has been studied to be an important contributory factor to carcinogenesis through pro-inflammatory markers such as interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP). Furthermore, K-ras mutation is an important genetic alteration in the pathogenesis of pancreatic cancer. This study aimed to compare these inflammatory markers in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with the diseased and healthy controls (HCs) and to check for any association between IL-6 and CRP serum levels with the disease status, survival and K-ras mutation status of PDAC patients. Methods: The study included 135 PDAC, 25 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and 25 HCs. The serum levels of IL-6 and CRP were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and K-ras mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Results: The serum levels of both these markers were elevated in PDAC cases than that in HCs. High IL-6 levels and higher CRP levels were found to be associated with locally advanced disease, lymphatic invasion, metastasis and advanced stage of the PDAC. In patients with unresectable PDAC, higher IL-6 levels were found to be associated with the presence of K-ras mutations. Interpretation & conclusions: Higher IL-6 and CRP levels in patients with advanced PDAC suggest an important role of these inflammatory markers in tumour progression. Furthermore, the association of mutations in the K-ras gene with serum IL-6 indicates cross-talks that may contribute to the progression of the PDAC.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate and compare the visual outcomes of two phakic intraocular lenses in high myopia. Methods: A prospective comparative study was undertaken on 50 eyes of 26 patients {age >= 21 years and divided into two groups (implantable collamer lens [ICL] V4c, n=25 eyes and refractive implantable lens [RIL], n=25 eyes)}. Patients were evaluated for uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCVA), best-corrected distance visual acuity, manifest refractive spherical equivalent (MRSE), contrast sensitivity, intraocular pressure, dilated fundus examination, trabecular-iris angle (TIA), anterior chamber depth, horizontal white-to-white diameter, wavefront aberrometry, and endothelial cell (EC) count. All patients were followed up until 6 months and additionally evaluated for anterior chamber inflammation, cataract, and lens vault. Results: The baseline parameters (UCVA, MRSE, and EC count) and postoperative improvement in UCVA, contrast sensitivity, MRSE, EC loss, safety index, and efficacy index were comparable between both the lenses. The improvement in aberrometric profile was significantly better in the ICL group. The mean postoperative vault was higher in RIL group (434.88 +/- 162.48 mu m vs. 547.24 +/- 159.83 mu m, P=0.0173); however, the vault was within normal range in both the groups. The decrease in mean TIA was significantly higher in RIL group (8.58 vs. 13.45 mu m, P=0.0073). Conclusion: Acrylic phakic lens can be considered as a suitable alternative to collamer lens for refractive correction of high myopia. The collamer lenses showed slight superiority in some qualitative visual parameters; however, collamer lenses do not present with subjective complaints in the patients.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the long-term outcomes of intrascleral haptic fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) with fibrin glue in children. Methods: This is a retrospective case study conducted in a tertiary eye institute in North India. A total of 118 eyes of 82 children who underwent glued intrascleral haptic fixation of PCIOLs were retrospectively analyzed. Detailed analysis of the indication for surgery and ocular and systemic associations was performed. The outcome measures included intraoperative complications, final visual and refractive outcomes, and postoperative complications. Results: The mean age of the patients was 10.16 +/- 3.94 years. Fifty-one patients (62.2%) were male and 31 (37.8%) were female. The mean follow-up period was 31.28 +/- 13.22 months. The mean preoperative corrected distance visual acuity was 1.18 +/- 0.63 Logarithm of Mean angle of resolution (logMAR) which improved to 0.60 +/- 0.58 logMAR postoperatively at 6 weeks (P<0.001). The mean preoperative and 6 weeks postoperative endothelial cell density were 3,176.08 +/- 318.6 and 2,936 +/- 289.9 cells/mm(2), respectively (P=0.23). In the immediate postoperative period, corneal edema (19 eyes; 16.1%), decentered IOL/tilt (3 eyes; 2.54%), vitreous hemorrhage (3 eyes; 2.54%), optic capture (4 eyes; 3.38%), and hypotony (2 eyes; 1.69%) were seen. In the late postoperative period (>6 weeks), retinal detachment was observed in two eyes that had associated Marfan syndrome. Cystoid macular edema was seen in four eyes (3.38%), and glaucoma was seen in five eyes (4.23%). Conclusions: Fibrin glue-assisted intrascleral haptic fixation of a PCIOL is a safe and effective method to manage aphakia with inadequate capsular support in children.

AB  - Adult Mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes carry several biologically active molecules that play prominent roles in controlling disease manifestations. The content of these exosomes, their functions, and effect on the immune cells may differ depending on their tissue sources. Therefore, in this study, we purified the exosomes from three different sources and, using the RNA-Seq approach, highly abundant microRNAs were identified and compared between exosomes and parental cells. The effects of exosomes on different immune cells were studied in vitro by incubating exosomes with PBMC and neutrophils and assessing their functions. The expression levels of several miRNAs varied within the different MSCs and exosomes. Additionally, the expression profile of most of the miRNAs was not similar to that of their respective sources. Exosomes isolated from different sources had different abilities to induce the process of neurogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, these exosomes demonstrated their varying effect on PBMC proliferation, neutrophil survival, and NET formation, highlighting their versatility and broad interaction with immune cells. The knowledge gained from this study will improve our understanding of the miRNA landscape of exosomes from hMSCs and provide a resource for further improving our understanding of exosome cargo and their interaction with immune cells.

AB  - Background: We aimed to understand the needs of service users - families and patients with schizophrenia and related disorders, and mental health professionals (MHPs) and expectations from a home-based psychosocial intervention program in Indian setting.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted four focus group discussions (FGDs) with families, patients with schizophrenia and related disorders and MHPs. Two FGDs were conducted with families and one each with the patients and MHPs. Participants in families and MHP group were asked about their primary concerns in caring for the patients, perceived needs of patients and the areas that can be targeted through a home-based psychosocial intervention program. All FGDs were audio-recorded and verbatim transcribed. Content analysis of the data was done to obtain a final list of needs and expected outcomes from a psychosocial intervention supported by families.
   Results: Six key priority needs were identified for intervention: medication adherence, activities of daily living, promoting physical health, engagement in meaningful work, building of social and support networks and information about all aspects of illness. Priority outcomes identified by MHPs were mostly clinical like symptom reduction, fewer rehospitalisation while families and patients focused more on psychosocial outcomes, such as improvement of wellbeing, having relationships, engagement in meaningful activities, better organization of the day, increased self-respect, reduced stress, lesser interference, and critical comments. All groups suggested that book or mobile app or video could be used.
   Conclusion: This qualitative study shows that while both clinicians and service users consider recovery from schizophrenia and related disorders to be important, they differ on what they prioritise.

AB  - Discoveries in the last few years have emphasized the existence of an enormous breadth of communication between bone and the immune system in maintaining skeletal homeostasis. Originally, the discovery of various factors was assigned to the immune system viz. interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATc1), etc., but now these factors have also been shown to have a significant impact on osteoblasts (OBs) and osteoclasts (OCs) biology. These discoveries led to an alteration in the approach for the treatment of several bone pathologies including osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is an inflammatory bone anomaly affecting more than 500 million people globally. In 2018, to highlight the importance of the immune system in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis, our group coined the term "immunoporosis". In the present review, we exhaustively revisit the characteristics, mechanism of action, and function of both innate and adaptive immune cells with the goal of understanding the potential of immune cells in osteoporosis. We also highlight the Immunoporotic role of gut microbiota (GM) for the treatment and management of osteoporosis. Importantly, we further discuss whether an immune cell-based strategy to treat and manage osteoporosis is feasible and relevant in clinical settings.

AB  - Context: Chemoradiation is the standard of care in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Clinical presentation, disease course, and available treatment options are challenges to overcome. Little is known about the ideal timing and interaction of the two modalities, its relevance in day-to-day decision-making and the treatment outcome.& nbsp;Aims: The study evaluates the demographic profile, treatment pattern, outcome, and radiotherapy (RT) practice and patient care of LA-NSCLC at a tertiary cancer center.& nbsp;Setting and Design: This is a retrospective study from a tertiary cancer centre. Archives of patients of LA-NSCLC treated between June 2016 and June 2018 were included in our study.& nbsp;Materials and & nbsp;Methods: Clinical, demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, and outcomes were recorded. RT practice and patient care process including the integration of RT with other specialties, waiting time, and compliance to treatment were documented and analyzed.& nbsp;Statistical Analysis: Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were the primary endpoints of the study. Log-rank test was used for univariate analysis for the factors on OS, and Cox's proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analysis for cofactors on OS.& nbsp;Results: Two hundred and thirty-two patients of lung cancer were treated during the study period. Fifty-four patients were squamous cell carcinoma, 108 were adenocarcinoma, and 12 were others. Out of 59 patients of LA-NSCLC, 34 underwent definitive chemoradiation. The median follow-up was 11 months (0.7-29), median overall treatment time was 44 days, median PFS was 8.9 months (range: 1.6-28.6), and median OS was 9.4 months (1.7-44.8). Time to start any oncological intervention was 1 month (0.1-4.3) and time to start RT was 2.1 months (0.1-5.4). Adherence to treatment was 91.2%. Age >= 65 and performance status >= 2 were significant for OS on univariate analysis and none on multivariate analysis.& nbsp;Conclusions: One-third of the cases of NSCLC present in LA stage and a third are suitable for definitive chemoradiation and only 20% undergo the planned treatment.

AB  - Background
   Phototherapy is the mainstay of treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia. Periodic change in position of the neonate under phototherapy (from supine to prone or lateral positions) may improve the efficiency of phototherapy by hastening the access of phototherapy light to bilirubin deposited in different parts of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the effects of periodic change of body position during phototherapy as compared to no prescribed change in body position, on serum total bilirubin level and duration of treatment in neonates with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia during the first 28 days of life.
   Secondary objectives of the review included evaluation of the efficacy of periodic change of body position on the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of bilirubin-induced neurological damage (BIND), side effects of phototherapy, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
   Search methods
   We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to run comprehensive searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2021, Issue 3) in the Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE and Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Daily and Versions on 5 March 2021. We also searched clinical trials databases and the reference lists of included studies and relevant reviews for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.
   Selection criteria
   We included RCTs and quasi-RCTs if they enrolled neonates (term and preterm) of either gender with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia requiring phototherapy and compared periodic change of the body position of the infant under phototherapy with no prescribed change in body position.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data, consulting with a third review author in the case of disagreement. We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures, including assessing the risk of bias of included studies. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. Primary outcomes were the duration of phototherapy and rate of fall of serum bilirubin at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes included the need for exchange transfusion, number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, and SIDS.
   Main results
   We included five studies (343 neonates) with an overall high risk of bias in the review. The body position under phototherapy was changed every two hours or every two-and-a-half hours in two studies each, and every three hours in one study. Three of the five studies included healthy term neonates, whilst the other two studies also included preterm neonates (>= 33 weeks' gestation); however, separate data about review outcomes in preterm neonates were not available.
   Periodic change in body position may lead to little or no difference in the duration of phototherapy (mean difference (MD) 1.71 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.17 to 6.59 hours; I-2 = 58%; 4 studies, 231 participants; low certainty evidence). Only one study reported the rate of fall of serum total bilirubin at 24 hours of starting the phototherapy. Periodic change in body position may lead to little or no difference in the rate of fall of serum total bilirubin at 24 hours (MD 0.02 mg/dL/h, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.06 mg/dL/h; 1 study, 100 participants; low certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to risk of bias and imprecision. None of the included studies reported the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, or SIDS. Lack of separate data precluded subgroup analysis.
   Authors' conclusions
   The available evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of periodic change of body position compared with no prescribed change of body position under phototherapy. There is low certainty evidence that there may be little or no difference in the duration of phototherapy and rate of fall in bilirubin at 24 hours of starting phototherapy between periodic change in body position and no prescribed change of body position under phototherapy in term and preterm neonates. None of the included studies reported the effect of change of position on the need for or number of exchange transfusions, incidence of BIND, or SIDS. One study is awaiting classification and could not be included in the review. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of periodic change in body position under phototherapy, especially in neonates with haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia and in very preterm neonates. The results of this systematic review apply mainly to neonates born at late-preterm or term gestation receiving phototherapy for non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia.

AB  - Rationale: Smoking is the primary cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); however, only 10-20% of smokers develop the disease suggesting possible genomic association in the causation of the disease. In the present study, we aimed to explore the whole genome transcriptomics of blood monocytes from COPD smokers (COPD-S), COPD Ex smokers (COPD-ExS), Control smokers (CS), and Control Never-smokers (CNS) to understand the differential effects of smoking, COPD and that of smoking cessation. Methods: Exploratory analyses in form of principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical component analysis (uHCA) were performed to evaluate the similarity in gene expression patterns, while differential expression analyses of different supervised groups of smokers and never smokers were performed to study the differential effect of smoking, COPD and smoking cessation. Differentially expressed genes among groups were subjected to post-hoc enrichment analysis. Candidate genes were subjected to external validation by quantitative RT-PCR experiments. Results: CNS made a cluster completely segregated from the other three subgroups (CS, COPDS and COPD-ExS). About 550, 8 and 5 genes showed differential expression, respectively, between CNS and CS, between CS and COPD-S, and between COPD-S and COPDExS. Apoptosis, immune response, cell adhesion, and inflammation were the top process networks identified in enrichment analysis. Two candidate genes (CASP9 and TNFRSF1A) found to be integral to several pathways in enrichment analysis were validated in an external validation experiment. Conclusion: Control never smokers had formed a cluster distinctively separated from all smokers (COPDS, COPD-ExS, and CS), while amongst all smokers, control smokers had aggregated in a separate cluster. Smoking cessation appeared beneficial if started at an early stage as many genes altered due to smoking started reverting towards the baseline, whereas only a few COPD-related genes showed reversal after smoking cessation.

AB  - Nanotechnology has been extensively exploited for its enormous therapeutic and diagnostic potential in the management of multiple disorders. It employs nanomaterials as drug carriers with enhanced efficacy and limited side effects on normal tissues. A lot of nanomaterials have been studied and produced, imminently reforming the treatment and diagnostics of numerous malignancies, including cancer. The purpose of the present study is to explore the role of nanotechnology-based devices/therapies that have a vital function in the therapeutics and diagnostics of cancer with potential impact at three levels: early detection, tumor imaging, and drug delivery methods. Concentrating on cancer, promising nanotechnology-based approaches have been planned to satisfy the need for targeted specificity of traditional agents of chemotherapeutics, in addition to early recognition of malignant and precancerous lesions. Prostate cancer is the fifth most well-known cancer worldwide and the second most usually detected cancer in men. Therefore, there is a crucial need to improve therapeutic prospects for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer via the exploitation of the potential of nanomaterials for cell-targeted specificity and improved primary diagnosis of precancerous tumors. The present review, therefore, focuses on summarizing all prospective applications of nanotechnology in the prognosis and diagnosis of prostate cancer, which would further help researchers to elucidate a more potent therapeutic approach for the better management of prostate cancer in the days ahead.

AB  - Incidence of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oral cancers is on the rise. However, epidemiological data of this subset of cancers are limited. Dental hospital poses a unique advantage in detection of HPV-positive oral malignancies. We assessed the utility of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, which are readily available, for evaluation of high-risk HPV infection in oral cancer. For protocol standardization, we used 20 prospectively collected paired FFPE and fresh tissues of histopathologically confirmed oral cancer cases reported in Oral Medicine department of a dental hospital for comparative study. Only short PCRs (similar to 200 bp) of DNA isolated using a modified xylene-free method displayed a concordant HPV result. For HPV analysis, we used additional 30 retrospectively collected FFPE tissues. DNA isolated from these specimens showed an overall 23.4% (11/47) HPV positivity with detection of HPV18. Comparison of HPV positivity from dental hospital FFPE specimens with overall HPV positivity of freshly collected oral cancer specimens (n = 55) from three cancer care hospitals of the same region showed notable difference (12.7%; 7/55). Further, cancer hospital specimens showed HPV16 positivity and displayed a characteristic difference in reported sub-sites and patient spectrum. Overall, using a xylene-free FFPE DNA isolation method clubbed with short amplicon PCR, we showed detection of HPV-positive oral cancer in dental hospitals.

AB  - Periaortic air can be seen in various conditions which can be a benign imaging finding or harbinger of a catastrophic event. The causes vary in native aorta and post- operative aorta. A radiologist has an important part in the management process of these patients, as the treatment varies from conservative to radical surgery based on the aetiology. The presence of periaortic air seen in the light of various clinical, laboratory and radiological findings can guide the radiologist towards a particular aetiology. Cross- sectional imaging, mainly computed tomography, is an indispensable tool in recognising ectopic periaortic air and to identify the associated findings and eventually make an accurate diagnosis. We present a pictorial review of various causes of the periaortic air in native and postoperative aorta, the salient features and management of the described conditions.

AB  - Background: Combination fractures of the C1-C2 complex especially atlas and hangman are relatively uncommon and management usually compromises C1-C2 mobility.
   Objective: To evaluate the treatment of combined C1- hangman's fracture with and without intraoperative O -arm based navigation system, and its outcome in terms of preserving C1-C2 mobility.
   Methods: This was a case series of patients with combined C1 and hangman's fracture, managed at a tertiary care hospital during February 2009 to December 2016. Neurological function assessed with American Spine Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale. Radiological fusion of the operated segment assessed with computed tomographic scan, criteria used for successful fusion included formation of callus across the fracture. Preservation of rotational motion between C1 and C2 was assessed by cervical flexion rotation (CFR) test.
   Results: We included 10 patients (male/female: 9/1; mean 47.7 +/- 17.5 years) in our study. Operative intervention was performed in 9 patients. We used intraoperative computed tomogram (CT) scan with navigation in 5 patients. The mean follow-up period was 28.7 months (range 6 to 70 months). Neurological recovery occurred in all 4 patients with preoperative neurological deficits. Radiological fusion occurred in all cases. Rotation at C1-2 was preserved in all 5 cases operated under O-arm guidance and in one patient with type 1 fracture who was managed conservatively.
   Conclusions: The goals in treating these complex fractures are to achieve early maximum stability and preserving maximum range of motion. These are often competing phenomena, which can be achieved by using intra operative CT scan and navigation system.

AB  - Background: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes mellitus. Epalrestat, an aldose reductase inhibitor, has been approved for clinical therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain. In the present study, solid lipid-based nanoparticles are used for oral administration of epalrestat (E-SLN) and evaluated against diabetic neuropathic pain in a rat model.
   Methods: Experimental diabetes in rats was induced by a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ) administration. The therapeutic efficiency of Epalrestat nanoparticles (0.25, 0.50, 1, and 5 mg/kg) in diabetic rats was studied. STZ-induced diabetic rats were treated with different doses of E-SLN for 8 weeks. The nanoparticles were orally administered at a single dose in rats, and the various parameters related to peripheral neuropathy were evaluated and compared with the bare drug. The blood glucose level was estimated by standard glucometer, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and liver function test (ALT and AST) were analyzed by blood samples collected from retro-orbital plexus. Oxidative stress markers and Na(+)K(+)ATPase, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta levels were measured in the homogenate of sciatic nerves. Behavioral tests were also performed by the hot plate method and tail-flick method.
   Results: E-SLN synthesized by the micro-emulsification method was 281 +/- 60 nm in size, and encapsulation efficacy was found to be 88 +/- 2%. Optimized E-SLN were characterized and found to be optimum in size, spherical shape, decent encapsulation efficiency, stable at acidic gastric pH, and suitable for oral delivery. E-SLNs did not significantly reverse the STZ-induced elevated blood glucose level (FBS and PPBS), HbA1c, triglycerides, and total cholesterol but significantly improved TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and increased Na(+)K(+)ATPase levels, oxidative stress marker and ALT, AST in the treated rat group as compared with the diabetic group. Doses of E-SLN, i.e. 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5 mg/kg, significantly increased the tail-flick latency time and hot plate response time in a dose-dependent manner compared with the diabetic group.
   Conclusion: Thus, it is suggested that E-SLN were equally effective and less hepatotoxic compared with the standard treatment of epalrestat. To the best of our knowledge, we, for the first time, propose the orally deliverable E-SLN that ameliorates STZ-induced diabetes neuropathic pain effectively as compared with conventional epalrestat.

AB  - Sodium fluoride (NaF) is widely used in clinical dentistry. However, the administration of high or low concentrations of NaF has various functions in different tissues. Understanding the mechanisms of the different effects of NaF will help to optimize its use in clinical applications. Studies of NaF and epithelial cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and periodontal cells have suggested the significant roles of fluoride treatment. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the biphasic functions of NaF that are related to both soft and hard periodontal tissues, multiple diseases, and clinical dentistry.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization has conceptualised the health and healthcare of older adults around the concept of healthy ageing. Healthy ageing is defined as "the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age". This functional ability is the sum of two key factors: intrinsic capacity and interacting environment. This concept of intrinsic capacity encompasses a wide spectrum of health characteristics including the physiological and psychological changes associated with the ageing process. In general, IC declines from a high and stable state to an impaired status as people age. Monitoring individuals for changes in intrinsic capacity in the context of their environment will provide a holistic method of tracking the functioning of older adults at both a population and individual level, providing an opportunity to address any reversible factors of decline. However, this would require a clear and objective conceptualisation of the concept of intrinsic capacity. Methodology: One hundred subjects were recruited via invitation by advertisement on the institute campus. Study participants underwent detailed physical examination and measurement of various physical and chemical biomarkers which were likely to represent intrinsic capacity as evidenced by the literature review. Outcomes measured were a decline in ADL, IADL, mortality and hospitalisation over a follow-up period of six months. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was done to obtain a clinical construct of the proposed entity of intrinsic capacity. Unpaired t-test and univariate logistic regression were used to check for the association between the composite score (IC) and its domains with the decline in ADL, IADL, mortality and hospitalisation. Results: One composite score (composite IC score) and eight subfactors emerged. The composite score and subfactor domains showed good construct validity. Composite intrinsic capacity score and subdomains of strength and cognition were significantly different among subjects with and without ADL and IADL decline. Univariate logistic regression showed that composite intrinsic capacity score was a predictor of decline in ADL and IADL even after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity status and education level of the subject with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. Subdomains of strength and cognition also predicted a decline in ADL and IADL independently. Conclusion: The development of an objective construct of the concept of intrinsic capacity, using commonly measured clinical and biochemical parameters, is feasible and predictive of the subsequent functionality of an individual.

TI  - A Modified Suturing Protocol for Tripod Stabilization of Connective Tissue Graft and Coronal Advancement of Tunnel Flap for Treatment of Isolated Gingival Recession
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PERIODONTICS & RESTORATIVE DENTISTRY
KW  - SURGERY
AB  - Preserving a sufficient blood supply and maintaining wound stability during the healing phase are the most crucial factors for success in root coverage procedures. Selecting the surgical technique and suturing protocol used to achieve these goals is therefore indispensable for predictable treatment outcomes. Tunneling flap procedures have evolved as a technical advancement in periodontal plastic surgery, particularly focusing on improving the vascular supply at the surgical site. Along with the development of newer flap designs for recession coverage, several suturing protocols for flap stability have been described. This paper illustrates the use of a modified suturing method for soft tissue graft stabilization in a coronally advanced tunnel flap procedure for the treatment of isolated gingival recession. It allows precise three-dimensional positioning and tripod stabilization of the graft in the tunnel as an independent step, differing from previously described techniques. A modified tissue-supported vertical mattress suture is then placed for coronal advancement and improved wound adaptation. The present authors have found that the proposed suturing protocol achieves successful integration of graft, maximum root coverage, excellent esthetic results, and limited postoperative morbidity. The suturing technique is described in detail with schematic illustrations and clinical cases, and its advantages and potential limitations are discussed.

AB  - Background: This exploratory study was meant to assess clinical and safety data with a novel fibroblast activation protein inhibitor-based targeted theranostics as a salvage treatment option in radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC) patients who had progressed on tyrosine kinase inhibitors.Methods: Patients with metastatic RR-DTC who progressed on sorafenib/lenvatinib were prospectively recruited. If [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan demonstrated moderate-to-excellent uptake in metastases, and patients had given informed consent, they received intravenous [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) as therapy at eight-weekly intervals. The primary endpoints were thyroglobulin (Tg) response and functional imaging response. The secondary endpoints were visual analog score (VAS) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. The grading of toxicities was performed by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEV5.0). The sequential images were acquired by a dual-headed gamma camera, and dosimetric calculations were performed by using OLINDA/EXM V2.1.Results: Fifteen patients were recruited [age: 55 +/- 9 years (range: 39-67)]. [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) had median whole-body Teff of 88.06 hours (interquartile range [IQR]: 86.6-99). The colon was identified as a critical organ. The whole-body effective dose was 1.62E-01 +/- 1.53E-02 mSv/MBq. A total of 45 cycles were administered, and the median cumulative administered activity was 8.2 +/- 2.7 GBq (range 5.5-14 GBq). The median absorbed doses to the tumor lesions were 1.08E+01 (IQR: 4.16E+00 to 8.97E+01) mSv/MBq per cycle. The Serum Tg level significantly decreased after treatment [(median Tg: baseline-10,549 ng/mL (IQR: 3066.5-39,450) versus at the time of assessment: 5649 ng/mL (IQR: 939.5-17,099), p = 0.0005)]. Molecular response assessment revealed no complete response; however, partial response was documented in four, and stable disease in three patients. The VASmax scores [pre-therapy: 9 (IQR: 8-10) versus follow-up: 6 (3-6) (p-0.0001)], and ECOG [3, (IQR: 2-3 vs. 2, (IQR: 2-3) (p-0.0078)] performance scores significantly improved after treatment. None of the patients experienced grade III/IV hematological, renal, or hepatotoxicity.Conclusion: These preliminary data suggest that the novel molecule [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) is safe, seems effective, and, most importantly, opens up a new avenue for the treatment of aggressive RR-DTC patients who have exhausted all standard line of treatments.

AB  - Osteosarcoma is a rare malignancy; however, it is still the most common primary bone tumor in adolescents and young adults. Chemotherapy improves survival indubitably in osteosarcoma; nevertheless, the concern is the stagnant progress since the last several decades. There are a handful of active agents and unresolved issues, especially in choosing the ideal chemotherapy regimen. The oncology community is in equipoise regarding the position of high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), mandatory or adjunct. The choice of therapy becomes widely relevant, including in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), where HDMTX administration brings additional complexities. Research into novel non-HDMTX-based protocols adapted to the available resources is pivotal in improving disease outcomes, especially in LMIC. The current review focuses on real-world challenges in decision-making and provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of treatment protocols in LMIC.

AB  - Objective: Suicidal behavior in pregnancy is a known fact worldwide. However, the published literature is still debating whether pregnancy is associated with an increase in the risk of suicide. Nonetheless, this is an important phenomenon that should not be ignored as the life of an unborn fetus is involved. The present study is a retrospective analysis of suicide death in pregnancy for the years 2011-2020 to study the different parameters.
   Methods: The cases were collected from the archives of the department with due permission from the authority. Data were analyzed according to the age of the victim, duration of pregnancy, and time and cause of death.
   Result: The commonest age group was 21-25 years, the time of death was mostly during the daytime, and most of the deaths were due to hanging. These findings are not unusual in comparison to the general population. The pregnancy duration of most of the cases was first and second trimester, and third-trimester pregnancy accounted for far less number. In contrast, some studies showed that suicidal ideation and depression were more common during the first trimester and third trimester. Most of the pregnant women were pregnant with male fetuses.
   Conclusion: Though suicidal ideation is more during the first and third trimester, suicide occurs mostly in the first and second trimester, with third-trimester suicide deaths being far less. Being pregnant with a male fetus might be a risk factor in comparison to having female fetuses. These are two aspects that need to be explored further.

AB  - A middle-aged woman presented with symptomatic complete heart block and underwent an uneventful dual chamber pacemaker implantation. Three weeks post procedure, she developed left arm pain and weakness, with neurological localization to the lower trunk of left brachial plexus. Possibilities of traumatic compression by the device/leads or postoperative idiopathic brachial plexopathy were considered. After ruling out traumatic causes, she was started on oral steroids, to which she responded remarkably. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this rare cause of brachial plexopathy following pacemaker implantation, because not only does an expedited diagnosis and medical treatment lead to prompt recovery with minimal neurological deficits, but it also circumvents an unnecessary surgical re-exploration.

TI  - Comparison of Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine and Clonidine Infusion to Produce Hypotensive Anesthesia in Patients Undergoing Orthognathic Surgery: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
KW  - BLOOD-LOSS
KW  - TRANSFUSION
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine (DEX) and clonidine (CLON) infusion to produce hypotensive anesthesia in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery.
   Material and Methods: The investigators designed a randomized controlled trial on patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. Patients were randomized into 2 groups (DEX and CLON group). The DEX group patients received loading dose of 1 ug/kg DEX over 10 minutes followed by 0.2 to 0.5 ug/kg/hour as maintenance dose Similarly, CLON group patients received 3 ug/kg loading dose followed by maintenance dose of 0.3 to 2 ug/kg/hour. Primary objectives were to compare the quality of surgical field, duration of surgery, amount of blood loss and secondary objectives were to compare total and rescue analgesia used, need for blood transfusion and associated adverse effects. The P value of G.05 was taken significant at confidence interval of 95%.
   Results: The study sample included 30 patients (15 in each group), (m:f = 1:1.1) requiring orthognathic surgery. Single jaw cases were 11 (DEX:CLON = 4:7) and bijaw cases were 19 (DEX:CLON = 11:8) in number. There was statistically insignificant difference in quality of surgical field between 2 groups (P = .15). Duration of surgery was 293.33 +/- 58.75 and 247 +/- 70.45 minutes in the DEX and the CLON group, respectively (P = .06). Blood loss was more in the DEX group (316.61 +/- 147.19 mL) than the CLON group (263.33 +/- 112.54 mL), (P = .71). Total drug used (P = .33) and rescue analgesia (P = .25) was less in the DEX group. Adverse effects were more in the CLON than the DEX group.
   Conclusion: The results of the present study showed no significant difference between the 2 groups for any parameter. It can be concluded that both dexmedetomidine and clonidine are effective and safe in achieving controlled hypotension and safe operative field visibility.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with glomerular disease experience symptoms that impair their physical and mental health while managing their treatments, diet, appointments and monitoring general and specific indicators of health and their illness. We sought to describe the perspectives of patients and their care partners on self-management in glomerular disease.
   Methods: We conducted 16 focus groups involving adult patients with glomerular disease (n = 101) and their care partners (n = 34) in Australia, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and United States. Transcripts were analyzed thematically.
   Results: We identified the following 4 themes: empowered in autonomy (gaining confidence through understanding, taking ownership of disease and treatment, learning a positive health approach); over-whelmed by compounding treatment burdens (financially undermined and depleted, demoralized by side effects and harms, frustrated by fragmented and inflexible care, fear of possible drug harms); striving for stability and normalcy (making personal sacrifices, maximizing life participation, attentiveness to bodily signs, avoiding precarious health states, integrating medicines into routines); and necessity of health-sustaining relationships (buoyed by social support, fulfilling meaningful responsibilities, sharing and normalizing experiences, seeking a trusting and respectful alliance).
   Conclusion: Patients with glomerular disease and their care partners value their capacity for autonomy and disease ownership, stability of their health, and relationships that support self-management. Strategies directed at strengthening these factors may increase self-efficacy and improve the care and outcomes for patients with glomerular disease.

AB  - Background: Esophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy. miR-335-5p is reported to possess both tumour suppressor and tumour promoter activities in different cancers. Objectives: We investigated the role of miR-335-5p in esophageal cancer by expression and functional studies. Materials and methods: The role of miR-335-5p in ESCC was evaluated using MTT assay, cell cycle analysis, colony formation assay, scratch assay, matrigel invasion, and migration assay. Results: Our expression studies showed a significantly decreased expression of tissue and circulating miR-335-5p in esophageal cancer. Our results herein report a key tumour suppressive role of miR-335-5p in esophageal carcinogenesis by inhibiting proliferation, migration, and invasion in ESCC cells. Using RNA-seq and Insilico analysis we found TTK to be a newly identified direct target and confirmed it by using luciferase assay. Conclusion: Overall, our expression and functional analysis results demonstrated herein point towards the potential role of miR-335-5p in esophageal tumorigenesis. Moreover, this is the first report showing TTK as a downstream target of miR-335-5p.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is playing an important role in the classification of breast tumors. MRI can be used to obtain multiparametric (mp) information, such as structural, hemodynamic, and physiological information. Quantitative analysis of mp-MRI data has shown potential in improving the accuracy of breast tumor classification. In general, a large set of quantitative and texture features can be generated depending upon the type of methodology used. A suitable combination of selected quantitative and texture features can further improve the accuracy of tumor classification. Machine learning (ML) classifiers based upon features derived from MRI data have shown potential in tumor classification. There is a need for further research studies on selecting an appropriate combination of features and evaluating the performance of different ML classifiers for accurate classification of breast tumors. The objective of the current study was to develop and optimize an ML framework based upon mp-MRI features for the characterization of breast tumors (malignant vs. benign and low- vs. high-grade). This study included the breast mp-MRI data of 60 female patients with histopathology results. A total of 128 features were extracted from the mp-MRI tumor data followed by features selection. Five ML classifiers were evaluated for tumor classification using 10-fold crossvalidation with 10 repetitions. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier based on optimum features selected using a wrapper method with an adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) technique provided the highest sensitivity (0.96 +/- 0.03), specificity (0.92 +/- 0.09), and accuracy (94% +/- 2.91%) in the classification of malignant versus benign tumors. This method also provided the highest sensitivity (0.94 +/- 0.07), specificity (0.80 +/- 0.05), and accuracy (90% +/- 5.48%) in the classification of low- versus high-grade tumors. These findings suggest that the SVM classifier outperformed other ML methods in the binary classification of breast tumors.

AB  - Background and objectives: Remarkable infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) is due to the rapid emergence of various strains which enable the virus to ruling the world. Over the course of SARS-CoV2 pandemic, the scientific communities worldwide are responding to newly emerging genetic variants. However, mechanism behind the persistent infection of these variants is still not known due to the paucity of study of these variants at molecular level. In this scenario, computational methods have immense utility in understanding the molecular and functional properties of different variants.
   Methods: The various mutants (MTs) of SpikeS1 receptor binding domain (RBD) of highly infectious SARS-CoV2 strains were manifested and elucidated the protein structure and binding strength using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and protein-protein docking approaches.
   Results: MD simulation study showed that all MTs exhibited stable structures with altered functional properties. Furthermore, the binding strength of different MTs along with WT (wildtype) was revealed that MTs showed differential binding affinities to host protein with high binding strength exhibited by V367F and V483A MTs.
   Conclusion: Hence, this study shed light on the molecular basis of infection caused by different variants of SARS-CoV2, which might play an important role in to cease the transmission and pathogenesis of virus and also implicate in rational designing of a specific drug.

AB  - Background: Carotid plaque morphology plays an important role in determining outcome of carotid artery stenting (CAS). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and its extension VH (Virtual Histology)-IVUS evaluate plaque characteristics in real time and guide decision making during stenting. To date, there is no consensus about indications of IVUS and its validated methods. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the clinical utility of IVUS in carotid artery interventions (CAS) and develop a future consensus for research and practice parameters. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed of the English literature articles published till February 2021. Studies reporting on IVUS parameters and findings and also its performance compared with other imaging modalities were included in review. Pooled prevalence with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated. The statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: A total of 2015 patients from 29 studies were included. Proportional meta-analysis was performed on 1566 patients from 11 studies. In 9 studies, stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) had a pooled prevalence of 4% (95% CI 3%-5%) while asymptomatic stroke had a pooled prevalence of 46% (95% CI 31%-62%) in 4 studies following IVUS. Two studies reported that IVUS detected more plaque protrusion compared with angiography (n=33/396 vs 11/396). IVUS led to stent type or size change in 8 of 48 cases which were missed on angiography in 3 other studies. Concordance between VH-IVUS and true histology was good at 80% to 85% reported in 2 studies. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis showed, though IVUS fared better to computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance (MR) angiography for better stent selection during CAS, with low to moderate risk of bias in the studies included. However, large scale, preferably randomized controlled studies are needed to predict its role in determining clinical outcome.

AB  - Background and objectives Outcomes reported in trials in adults with glomerular disease are often selected with minimal patient input, are heterogeneous, and may not be relevant for clinical decision making. The Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Glomerular Disease (SONG-GD) initiative aimed to establish a core outcome set to help ensure that outcomes of critical importance to patients, care partners, and clinicians are consistently reported. Design, setting, participants, and measurements We convened two 1.5-hour workshops in Melbourne, Australia, and Washington, DC, United States. Attendees were identified purposively with 50 patients/care partners and 88health professionals from 19 countries; 51% were female. Patients and care partners were from the United States, Australia, and Canada, and had experience of a glomerular disease with systemic features (n59), kidney-limited nephrotic disease (n59), or other kidney-limited glomerular disease (n58). Attendees reviewed the results of the SONG-GD Delphi survey and aims of the workshop and then discussed potential core outcomes and their implementation in trials among moderated breakout groups of eight to 12 people from diverse backgrounds. Transcripts of discussions were analyzed thematically. Results Three themes were identified that supported the proposed core outcomes: limiting disease progression, stability and control, and ensuring universal relevance (i.e., applicable across diverse populations and settings).The fourth theme, preparedness for implementation, included engaging with funders and regulators, establishing reliable and validated measures, and leveraging existing endorsements for patient-reported outcomes. Conclusions Workshop themes demonstrated support for kidney function, disease activity, death, life participation, and cardiovascular disease, and these were established as the core outcomes for trials in adults with glomerular disease. Future work is needed to establish the core measures for each domain, with funders and regulators central to the uptake of the core outcome set in trials.

TI  - Bone Mineral Density, Bone Microarchitecture and Vertebral Fractures in Male Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders
T2  - ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM
KW  - RISK PREDICTION
KW  - SCORE
KW  - MASS
AB  - Aim To investigate abnormalities in bone mineral density, trabecular bone score and vertebral fractures in male patients with alcohol use disorder to understand the impact on bone health.
   Methods The study subjects included 134 male patients. Controls were 134 age matched healthy males. Assessments were made of the bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular bone score (TBS) and vertebral morphometry (VFA) for vertebral fractures. Biochemical measurements included serum total T4, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25- Hydroxyvitamin D 25(OH) D.
   Results The mean BMD at total forearm, proximal forearm (or distal 1/3) and mid forearm was significantly higher in the alcohol use disorders (AUD) group than the controls (P < 0.01). Around 15% of patients with AUD had VFs compared with 9.0% of the healthy controls (P = 0.19). For each kg/m(2) gain in body mass index (BMI), lumbar spine and total hip BMD increased by 0.009 and 0.014 g/cm(2), respectively. Lumbar and hip BMD decreased by 0.002 and 0.003 g/cm(2) per year increase in duration of alcohol used. For every 5 years increase in age of the patients the odds of having VFs increased by 39% (odds ratio 1.393 [95% confidence interval = 1.031-1.881, P = 0.03]).
   Conclusion The findings of the current study suggest that persons with AUD in third and fourth decades of life, with BMI in normal range and with alcohol use disorder duration of around one decade might have no major alteration in BMD and TBS. Impact of alcohol use in this population was manifest by marginal increase in the prevalence of mild grade of vertebral fractures, mostly in the thoracic region.

AB  - Purpose To describe a realistic goat's eye model to aid in surgical training of ophthalmology residents for improvising skills in intraoperative gonioscopy and incisional goniotomy surgery. Methods This study provides a descriptive report explaining the step-by-step methodology for setting up a goat's eye model to train the ophthalmology residents in both intra-operative gonioscopy and incisional goniotomy. The goat's eyeball was prepared and mounted within the socket of a mannequin head. The mannequin head was tilted and microscope angulation was adjusted to allow adequate visualization of angle structures. Following intra-operative visualisation of angle structures through a Swan Jacob lens, incisional goniotomy was performed using a microvitreo-retinal blade on approximately 120 degrees nasal angle. The model was found to produce reproducible results when tested on 22 trained residents. Conclusion The Goniotomy on Goat's Eye (GOGE) model can provide a realistic and a relatively inexpensive tool for resident surgeons to develop bimanual coordination and enhance their surgical skills to perform effective intraoperative gonioscopy and incisional goniotomy surgery.

AB  - Purpose Corneal perforations are common corneal emergencies faced by ophthalmologists across the globe. There are multiple modalities of management, most of which require an eye bank support or availability of tissue adhesives. Tenons patch graft (TPG) is a technique that does not depend on these factors as the graft is harvested from the same eye of the patient. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the indications, technique, normal postoperative course, and management of complications. Methods After carrying out a literature search on "tenons capsule", "corneal patch graft", "tenons patch graft", "multilayered amniotic membrane" and "corneal perforations", 28 articles were included for this review. Results TPG graft can be performed in cases of small to moderate perforations without active suppuration. The procedure can also be combined with amniotic membrane grafting or tissue adhesives to provide additional tectonic support. Postoperatively, the epithelium heals over a course 2-3 weeks and restoration of a stable ocular surface with a corneal scar is completed by the third postoperative month. Complications following the surgical procedure are rare but can include graft displacement, melt and pseudoectasia. Subsequent visual rehabilitation with contact lenses or keratoplasties can be planned in these eyes that yields good visual outcomes. Conclusions Tenons patch graft is a simple yet viable option in management of small to moderate corneal perforations. The procedure does not necessitate the prior availability of specialized products and can be performed with routine equipment of an ophthalmic theatre, making it an attractive option in low resource settings.

AB  - The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are manifested as an increase in the level of oxidative stress and aggregation of the amyloid-fl protein. In vitro, in vivo, and in silico experiments were designed and carried out with multifunctional cholinergic inhibitor, F24 (EJMC-7a) to explore its neuroprotective effects in AD models. The neuroprotection ability of F24 was tested in SH-SY5Y cells, a widely used neuronal cell line. The pretreatment and subsequent co-treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with different doses of F24 was effective in rescuing the cells from H2O2 induced neurotoxicity. F24 treated cells were found to be effective in the reduction of cellular reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and Afl1-42 induced neurotoxicity, which validated its neuroprotective effectiveness. F24 exhibited efficacy in an in vivo Drosophila model by rescuing eye phenotypes from degeneration caused by Afl toxicity. Further, computational studies were carried out to monitor the interaction between F24 and Afl1-42 aggregates. The computational studies corroborated our in vitro and in vivo studies suggesting Afl1-42 aggregation modulation ability of F24. The brain entry ability of F24 was studied in the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay. Finally, F24 was tested at doses of 1 and 2.5 mg/kg in the Morris water maze AD model. The neuroprotective properties shown by F24 strongly suggest that multifunctional features of this molecule provide symptomatic relief and act as a disease-modifying agent in the treatment of AD. The results from our experiments strongly indicated that natural template-based F24 could serve as a lead molecule for further investigation to explore multifunctional therapeutic agents for AD management.

AB  - Objectives Mucosal fenestrations are infrequent and often challenging to treat depending on the extent of soft and hard tissue destruction. This article presents the successful management of a relatively larger mucosal fenestration associated with complete absence of buccal bone plate in a mandibular incisor secondary to trauma-induced periapical pathosis. Clinical considerations After non-surgical endodontic therapy, surgery was performed for debridement of the osseous defect, root resection/shaping, connective tissue graft (CTG) placement on the affected root surface and platelet rich fibrin (PRF) in periapical osseous defect rather than use of bone graft and/or barrier membrane. Healing was uneventful, however, a small mucosal defect remained at 2 weeks follow-up. After 3 months of primary surgery, a corrective surgery was performed utilizing an "incision-free" approach i.e. tunnel technique with CTG in contrast to the contemporary flap approach. At 18 months follow-up, complete closure of the mucosal defect with a thick gingival biotype, normal sulcus depth, and good esthetic outcome were achieved. No recurrence and any clinical signs of infection or inflammation were observed. Conclusions Based on the outcomes of present case, an early intervention utilizing the minimally invasive surgical therapy and autologous biomaterials may be considered a viable approach to treat such complex lesions. Clinical significance Endodontic therapy in combination with PRF and CTG appears to provide successful outcomes in treatment of a large mucosal fenestration with periapical osseous defect.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common malignancy globally. The etiology of HNSCC is multifactorial, including cellular stress induced by a tobacco smoking, tobacco chewing excess alcohol consumption, and human papillomavirus infection. The induction of stress includes autophagy as one of the response pathways in maintaining homeostatic equilibrium. We evaluated the expression of autophagy-related genes in HNSCC tissues from RNA sequencing datasets and identified 19 genes correlated with poor prognosis and 18 genes correlated with improved prognosis of HNSCC patients. Further analysis of independent gene expression datasets revealed that ATG12, HSP90AB1, and FKBP1A are overexpressed in HNSCC and correlate with poor prognosis, whereas the overexpression of ANXA1, FOS, and ULK3 correlates with improved prognosis. Using independent datasets, we also found that ATG12, HSP90AB1, and FKBP1A expression increased with an increase in the T-stage of HNSCC. Among all the datasets analyzed, FKBP1A was overexpressed in HNSCC and was strongly associated with lymph node metastasis in multiple in silico datasets. In conclusion, our analysis indicates dynamic alterations in autophagy genes during HNSCC and warrants further investigation, specifically on FKBP1A and its role in tumor progression and metastasis.

AB  - Identifying missing persons and unidentified dead bodies is a well-documented global problem in recent years. To curb this issue, countries such as the USA, UK, and Australia already have well-established DNA databases. Considering the alarming number of unidentified/unclaimed dead bodies reported in India every year, it is evident that the current practices are not sufficient to establish their identities. Forensic medicine professionals are ethically, morally, and dutybound to collect information about missing and unidentified persons and work with the government agencies to determine their identity. Concerning the social and public interest, we have developed the first-ever identification portal and DNA database of unidentified dead bodies autopsied at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. After the investigation officer's informed consent, biological samples from unidentified dead bodies and a detailed phenotypic description, anthropological data and other visual characteristics of the deceased are recorded at the time of autopsy. This information is uploaded on our database which is available for public access, and the genotypic information generated through STR analysis is only available for internal usage. Claimants (biological relatives) may browse through the URL (https://umid-aiims.icmr.org.in/), and if they wish to claim an unidentified dead body, they may approach as per the given guidelines. The DNA profiles generated include a total of 16 STRs (15 autosomal tetranucleotide microsatellite STRs and 1 Sex Chromosome Specific STR). The claimant's STR profile is run through the questioned database to look for a potential match. If positive, the investigating officer of that particular case is informed for further necessary action. Until December 2020, our database consisted the information of 255 individuals and two unidentified cadavers were identified. This project's success can also lead to a pioneering National DNA database of unidentified and missing persons in India.

AB  - Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is not frequent yet the incidence rate of it is increasing globally owing to the slow emergence of drift variants that pose a perpetual threat to vaccination strategies and have a greater propensity for disease reoccurrence. Long-term protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection relies on the induction of the innate as well as the adaptive immune response endowed with immune memory. However, a multitude of factors including the selection pressure, the waning immunity against SARS-CoV-2 over the first year after infection possibly favors evolution of more infectious immune escape variants, amplifying the risk of reinfection. Additionally, the correlates of immune protection, the novel SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC), the durability of the adaptive and mucosal immunity remain major challenges for the development of therapeutic and prophylactic interventions. Interestingly, a recent body of evidence indicated that the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is another important target organ for SARS-CoV-2 besides the respiratory system, potentially increasing the likelihood of reinfection by impacting the microbiome and the immune response via the gut-lung axis. In this review, we summarized the latest development in SARS-CoV-2 reinfection, and explored the untapped potential of trained immunity. We also highlighted the immune memory kinetics of the humoral and cell-mediated immune response, genetic drift of the emerging viral variants, and discussed the current challenges in vaccine development. Understanding the dynamics and the quality of immune response by unlocking the power of the innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity during SARS-CoV-2 reinfection would open newer avenues for drug discovery and vaccine designs.

AB  - Corticotrophin Releasing Factor (CRF) might be suitable as biological measure of stress as it is implicated directly in both central neurological and endocrine stress-response. The study aims to compare serum CRF levels and perceived stress in opioid-dependent subjects (n = 53) with non-using controls (n = 47) and to correlate them with general and instantaneous craving (in cases only). Perceived stress score and serum CRF levels were significantly higher among the users. No significant correlation with craving was found. The significant difference in serum CRF levels indicate feasibility of measuring CRF levels in peripheral fluids and asserts its role as biochemical measure of stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical symptoms of cervical spondylosis refer to symptoms other than the typical symptoms of cervical spondylosis and include headache, nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, blurred vision, tinnitus, hypomnesia, and palpitations. The role of cervical decompression in mitigating atypical symptoms of cervical spondylosis is still unclear. METHODS: A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve articles that studied the effect of cervical decompression on associated atypical symptoms. The data were analyzed to obtain pooled improvement in the various atypical symptoms after cervical decompression. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Our analysis showed that cervical decompression was associated with significant improvement in Neck Disability Index-Headache Component (standardized mean difference [SMD],-0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI],-0.94 to-0.74; P < 0.0001), visual analog scale (SMD,-1.47; 95% CI,-1.73 to-1.21; P = 0.0004) and cervicogenic headache (odds ratio [OR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.63; P = 0.01). Significant improvement was also observed in vertigo (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.100.77; P = 0.02), tinnitus (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.35-0.83; P = 0.02), and nausea (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.13-0.47; P = 0.006) after cervical decompression. Nonsignificant improvement was noticed in the rates of blurred vision, hypomnesia, giddiness, gastrointestinal discomfort, palpitations, and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that cervicogenic headache, tinnitus, and nausea were significantly relieved after cervical decompression. There was no significant effect of cervical decompression on blurred vision, hypomnesia, giddiness gastrointestinal discomfort, palpitations, and hypertension.

AB  - ■ BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, disrup-tion of surgical hands-on training has hampered the skills acquisition by budding neurosurgeons. Online and virtual classrooms have not been able to substitute the hands-on experience and learning via direct interaction with senior colleagues. To overcome these challenges, we organized a hybrid workshop where simulation-based learning modules, and direct and virtual interaction with surgeons during live surgeries or didactic lectures were utilized to help delegates in understanding the nuances of neurosurgery. ■ METHODS: A 3-day hybrid workshop was held in March 2021, which was attended by 133 delegates. A structured questionnaire was utilized to record their feedback. ■ RESULTS: An overwhelming majority of the respondents (94.1%, n = 64) found hybrid conferences to be better than an online conference. Most of the respondents (88.3%, n = 60) rated the utility of direct face-to-face interaction to be more satisfying as compared with online interaction with faculty during a webinar. Again, many the respondents (86.8%, n = 59) believed that similar hybrid events will be the new normal given the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic. A large majority (88.2%, n = 60) of the respondents reported that they will prefer a hybrid event over an online conference. ■ CONCLUSIONS: In this era of the COVID-19 pandemic, "hybrid" microneurosurgery workshops offer unique opportunities to enhance surgical skills acquisition by hands-on simulation-based learning and observing live surgical demonstrations, apart from 2-way interactions with experts under one roof. This may be a stepping stone for what lies ahead in the future of neurosurgical training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical pedicle screws (CPS) in the subaxial cervical spine (C3-C6) are faced with high incidence of perforating the lateral pedicular cortex endangering the vertebral artery (VA). The present study analyzes the pedicle width (PW) from C3 to C6 and defines the relation of VA with regard to pedicle and transverse foramen (TF) to determine the safety margin in cases of lateral pedicular breach.
   METHODS: Computed tomography angiograms of 500 patients were retrospectively studied to identify the pedicle width (PW), VA area, TF area, and the lateral pedicle to vertebral artery distance (LPVA). Occupancy ratio (OR; the percentage area of transverse foramen occupied by VA) and safety margin (SM; permissible displacement of VA in TF), along with LPVA were considered to be protective parameters against VA injury if lateral pedicle breach happens.
   RESULTS: PW was 4.7 nun at C3, 4.83 mm at C4, 5.26 nun at C5 and 5.41 mm at C6. Mean LPVA at different levels was between 0.97 mm and 1.15 mm, OR was around 20% at all levels, and mean SM was between 2.34 mm and 2.92 at various levels. Sex differences were statistically significant for PW but not for LPVA, SM, or OR.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study gives us an idea about the various parameters in placement of cervical pedicle screw in subaxial cervical spine and the probable reasons there are few vertebral artery injuries despite high incidence of cervical pedicle breach. LPVA, safety margin, and OR may explain why even very significant CPS misplacement does not lead to vascular injury or neurologic deficit.

AB  - In ophthalmology residency programs surgical training plays a vital role in creating confident and skillful surgeons. As almost all ophthalmic surgery needs microscope training, creating a well-taught environment for hand-eye coordination, ocular tissue handling, and anticipation of complications is essential. Wet lab training with animal or cadaver human eyes offers diverse possibilities. We conducted a thorough literature search on various databases to identify the existing literature on wet labs. The results revealed constructive efforts for training novice surgeons in all surgical ophthalmology subspecialties. Wet lab models were initially used only to practice cataract surgery; however, now various complex ocular procedures can be practiced. Ocular surface, corneal, iris, lenticular, scleral, vitreoretinal, extraocular, eyelid, and other adnexal surgeries were reproduced and mastered in many ways. Importantly, with repeated surgical practice, residents gained an increasing level of confidence with enhanced surgical accuracy. In addition, we propose a few novel techniques of various other procedures.

AB  - Introduction: This retrospective study analyzed the 12-month pulp sensibility (cold and electric) test response after mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) full pulpotomy in mature permanent teeth with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Methods: The records of 120 subjects from 3 completed and 1 ongoing clinical study on MTA full pulpotomy were retrieved. Ninety-six first and second mandibular molar teeth with a diagnosis of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis that underwent a single-visit MTA full pulpotomy and had completed a 12-month clinical, radiographic, and pulp sensibility (cold and electric) test follow-up were included. The data were analyzed using the Fisher exact test, the Pearson chi-square test, and the McNemar test. The significance level was predetermined at P < .05. Results: A higher percentage of teeth (94.7%) responded to the electric pulp test in comparison with the cold test (13.5%) (P .05). Sex-based responses to the electric pulp test (P .05). The tooth quadrant (left and right), the tooth (mandibular first and second molar), and the location of restoration (proximal or occlusal) did not influence the response of either the electric pulp test (P .05) or the cold test (P > .05). At the 1-year follow-up, all the teeth that were classified as clinically and radiographically successful responded to the electric pulp test; however, only 13 teeth responded to the cold test (P = .00). Conclusions: The majority (94.7%) of the teeth that underwent MTA full pulpotomy responded to the electric pulp test at a 1-year time interval. (J Endod 2022;48:80-86.)

AB  - Cell-free DNA(cfDNA) methylation profiling is considered promising and potentially reliable for liquid biopsy to study progress of diseases and develop reliable and consistent diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. There are several different mechanisms responsible for the release of cfDNA in blood plasma, and henceforth it can provide information regarding dynamic changes in the human body. Due to the fragmented nature, low concentration of cfDNA, and high background noise, there are several challenges in its analysis for regular use in diagnosis of cancer. Such challenges in the analysis of the methylation profile of cfDNA are further aggravated due to heterogeneity, biomarker sensitivity, platform biases, and batch effects. This review delineates the origin of cfDNA methylation, its profiling, and associated computational problems in analysis for diagnosis. Here we also contemplate upon the multi-marker approach to handle the scenario of cancer heterogeneity and explore the utility of markers for 5hmC based cfDNA methylation pattern. Further, we provide a critical overview of deconvolution and machine learning methods for cfDNA methylation analysis. Our review of current methods reveals the potential for further improvement in analysis strategies for detecting early cancer using cfDNA methylation. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) are malnourished because of poor dietary intakes and increased requirements. Energy requirements are higher due to increased resting energy expenditure. There are lacunae of nutrition recommendations for these infants. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine the effect of energy- and/or protein-dense feeds in postoperative CHD infants as compared with the standard feeding. An online literature search was performed on four databases by using different English-language keywords between 2000 and 2020. The inclusion criteria were peer reviewed journals and open access original articles on the feeding practices in infants undergoing congenital heart surgery. Exclusion criteria were editorials, commentaries, discussion papers, conference abstracts, reviews, duplicate studies, and articles on preterm infants and preoperative nutrition. A total of five studies matched the inclusion criteria. The standard mean difference (SMD) of energy intake (SMD = 13.40 kcal, P = 0.001), protein intake (SMD = 2.37 g, P = 0.001), and weight (SMD = 4.99 g, P = 0.001) was significantly higher in the intervention group. The SMD of ventilation duration (SMD = -0.18 h, P = 0.90), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS) (SMD = -0.25 d, P = 0.70), and hospital LOS (SMD = -0.20 d, P = 0.67) were not statistically significant between the two groups. Enriched enteral nutrition for the postoperative pediatric patients with cardiac disease helps in achieving energy and protein goals and improves the overall postoperative outcomes (ie, ventilation duration, maintenance of weight, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS).

AB  - With constantly emerging new information regarding the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), reviewing literature related to it has become increasingly complicated and resource-intensive. In the setting of this global pandemic, clinical decisions are being guided by the results of multiple pertinent studies; however, it has been observed that these studies are often heterogenous in design and population characteristics and results of initial trials may not be replicated in subsequent studies. The resulting clinical conundrum can be resolved by high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis with a robust and reliable methodology, encapsulating and critically appraising all the available literature relevant to the clinical scenario under scrutiny. It can condense the large volume of scientific information available and can also identify the cause of differences in the degree of effect under consideration across different studies. It can identify optimal diagnostic algorithms, assess efficacy of treatment strategies, and analyze inherent factors influencing the efficacy of treatment for COVID-19. The current review aims to provide a basic guide to plan and conduct a high-quality systematic review and meta-analysis pertaining to COVID-19, describing the main steps and addressing the pitfalls commonly encountered at each step. Knowledge of the basic steps would also allow the reader to critically appraise published systematic review and meta-analysis and the quality of evidence provided therein.

AB  - Introduction/Background: With the advent of TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) the ease of transoral procedures has been dramatically improved. TORS is already established for its feasibility, functional and oncological outcomes for selected lesions of oral cavity, oropharynx and laryngopharynx. This study reports on preliminary results with TransOral UltraSonic Surgery (TOUSS) for oncologic resections of oral cavity, oropharyngeal and supraglottic malignancies. Materials and methods: Eighteen patients with malignancies of oral cavity, oropharynx and supraglottis underwent TOUSS with simultaneous neck dissection and adjuvant therapy as indicated, from January 2018 to April 2019. Essential equipment included the FK-retractor (Gyrus Medical, Tuttilngen, Germany) for TransOral exposure, the Olympus ENDOEYE Flex 5 mm 2D/10 mm 3D deflecting tip video laparoscopes, and 35 cm long ultrasonic harmonic scalpel (Thunderbeat). Parameters evaluated include tumor staging, mouth opening, TOUSS setup time, TOUSS primary removal time, surgical margins, blood transfusions, tracheostomy, postoperative complications, enteral feeding and resumption of oral diet, duration of hospital stay, and survival outcomes. Results: Eighteen patients underwent complete TransOral UltraSonic Surgery (TOUSS), with simultaneous unilateral or bilateral neck dissection. No procedure was abandoned intraoperatively due to difficulty in extirpation of the tumor. Margins were negative for ten patients (55.6%), close in five (27.8%), and positive in three patients (16.7%). Average TOUSS set-up time was 22.5 min (range, 10-30 min) and average TOUSS primary tumor removal time was 35.3 min (range, 15-60 min). Patients started tolerating oral feeds even in the second post op day (mean 6 days), and transitioning to complete oral feeds with removal of the nasogastric tube was achieved in all (mean, 16 days). The average hospital stay was 7.4 days (range 2-16 days). Secondary hemorrhage occurred in two cases and required an emergency tracheostomy and ligation of lingual artery. Minor cervicopharyngeal fistula occurred in four cases and settled in all with conservative non-surgical treatment. Overall survival at 3 years was 70.5%, and disease-specific survival was 94.4%. Conclusion: TransOral UltraSonic Surgery (TOUSS) is a safe and sound alternative method of endoscopic surgical treatment of oral cavity, oropharynx and supraglottic neoplasms. Advantages of this technique include faster resection time, intraoperative assistance from Narrow Band Imaging, easy affordability compared to TORS, and excellent functional outcomes.

AB  - Objectives In ischemic stroke, reperfusion after thrombolysis is associated with secondary brain damage. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a flavonoid, has shown neuroprotective effects through anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. This study investigates the potential of DHM, given postreperfusion in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model of stroke in rats. Methods MCAo surgery was performed in male Wistar rats. Reperfusion was performed after 90 min of ischemia. DHM (50 and 100 mg/kg) was administered 10-15 min and 2 h postreperfusion followed by daily dosing for 2 more days. Neurobehavioral parameters and infarct size (TTC staining) were assessed after 72 h. The effective dose (100 mg/kg) was then used to study reduction in infarct size (measured by MRI) and effect on apoptosis (evaluated by protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL assay) in peri-infarct cortex. Furthermore, effects of DHM on neuronal damage and activation of astrocytes were studied by immunofluorescence. Results Poststroke DHM (100 mg/kg) administered for 3 days showed significant improvements in motor-coordination and infarct damage (TTC staining and MRI). MCAo-induced altered apoptotic proteins were normalized to a significant extent in peri-infarct cortex with DHM treatment. Data from TUNEL assay were complementary to the effects on apoptotic proteins. Additionally, DHM caused a significant reduction in the number of reactive astrocytes when compared with the MCAo group. Discussion This study demonstrated the efficacy of subacute DHM treatment in ischemia/reperfusion injury by modulating apoptosis and astrogliosis in the peri-infarct cortex. This suggests the potential of DHM in attenuating disease progression.

AB  - A panel of 30 chalcone derivatives, including 19 aldoxime-chalcone ethers (ACE), and 11 hydroxyl- chalcones (HC), previously synthesized using a Pd-catalyzed C-O cross-coupling method were evaluated for their inhibitory activities against monoamine oxidases (MAOs), cholinesterases (ChEs), and xe002;-secretase (BACE-1). HC6 was the most potent inhibitor of MAO-B with an IC 50 value of 0.0046 mu M and a selectivity index (SI) of 1,113. HC3 also potently inhibited MAO-B (IC 50 = 0.0067 mu M) and had the highest SI (1,455). ACE7 and ACE15 were also potent MAO-B inhibitors (IC 50 = 0.012 and 0.018 mu M, respectively), with SIs of 260 and 1,161, respectively. HC3 and HC6 were reversible competitive inhibitors of MAO-B, with K i values of 0.0036 and 0.0013 mu M, respectively. A structure-activity relationship revealed that methyl and fluorine substituents contributed to increasing both inhibition and selectivity. ACE7 was the most effective inhibitor of MAO-A (IC 50 = 1.49 mu M), followed by ACE3 (IC 50 = 3.75 mu M). No compounds effectively inhibited AChE, BChE, or BACE-1. A docking simulation showed that the ligand efficiency and docking scores of HC3 and HC6 toward MAO-B were consistent with the experimental IC 50 values. These results suggest that HC3 and HC6 can be considered promising candidates for the treatment of neurological disorders. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This multi-centric prospective study (InPOG-HL-15-01) assessed epidemiological, clinical and outcome data of advanced stage Hodgkin Lymphoma (IIB, III and IV) in children and adolescents (N = 262). Chemotherapy regimen was ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and radiotherapy (RT) was restricted to patients with bulky disease at diagnosis or with suboptimal response at early response assessment (ERA). ERA revealed complete response in 175 (68.1%), partial response in 77 (29.9%), stable disease in 2 (0.8%), and progressive disease in 3 (1.2%) patients. RT was administered to 111 (97 bulky disease, 14 suboptimal response) patients. Five-year event free (EFS) and overall survival for the whole cohort was 81.1% and 90.8% respectively. On multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant predictor of EFS was use of RT (89% versus 74.2%; p-value <0.001). This study reinforces the benefit of consolidative RT in bulky disease and in those with suboptimal response at ERA on an ABVD backbone.

AB  - 'Post-COVID-19 syndrome' refers to symptoms in the convalescent phase following initial COVID-19 infection. This term encompasses a wide array of presentation involving lungs, heart and the neuromuscular system. Pulmonary manifestations include post-COVID-19 fibrosis, which is akin to post acute respiratory distress syndrome fibrosis and may reflect the permanent damage to the lungs following an initial bout of infection. Cardiovascular system is often involved, and the presentation can be in terms of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis and heart failure. Clinical manifestations are often varied and non-specific, which entails a detailed workup and a multidisciplinary approach. Post-COVID-19 syndrome adds to the overall disease morbidity and leads to a prolonged hospital stay, greater healthcare utilisation and loss of productivity marring the country's dwindling economy. Thus, it is imperative that post-COVID-19 syndrome be prevented and identified early followed by a prompt treatment.

AB  - Human RNA-binding motif 3 protein (RBM3) is a cold-shock protein which functions in various aspects of global protein synthesis, cell proliferation and apoptosis by interacting with the components of basal translational machinery. RBM3 plays important roles in tumour progression and cancer metastasis, and also has been shown to be involved in neuroprotection and endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Here, we have solved the solution NMR structure of the N-terminal 84 residue RNA recognition motif (RRM) of RBM3. The remaining residues are rich in RGG and YGG motifs and are disordered. The RRM domain adopts a beta alpha beta beta alpha beta topology, which is found in many RNA-binding proteins. NMR-monitored titration experiments and molecular dynamic simulations show that the beta-sheet and two loops form the RNA-binding interface. Hydrogen bond, pi-pi and pi-cation are the key interactions between the RNA and the RRM domain. NMR, size exclusion chromatography and chemical cross-linking experiments show that RBM3 forms oligomers in solution, which is favoured by decrease in temperature, thus, potentially linking it to its function as a cold-shock protein. Temperature-dependent NMR studies revealed that oligomerization of the RRM domain occurs via nonspecific interactions. Overall, this study provides the detailed structural analysis of RRM domain of RBM3, its interaction with RNA and the molecular basis of its temperature-dependent oligomerization.

AB  - Background: The role of sodium benzoate, an NMDA receptor enhancer, in schizophrenia has been evaluated in a few clinical trials, but results are contradictory and inconclusive. The present meta-analysis has evaluated the efficacy and safety of add-on sodium benzoate for the treatment of schizophrenia.
   Methods: After performing a literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane databases and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data from four relevant articles. PRISMA guidelines were followed in the selection, analysis, and reporting of findings. The random-effect model was used to estimate effect size. Quality assessment was done using the risk of bias assessment tool, and sensitivity analysis was done in case of high heterogeneity.
   Results: Add-on sodium benzoate can improve positive symptoms of schizophrenia significantly (MD: -1.87; 95% CI: -3.25 to -0.48; p = 0.008) but had no significant favourable effect on negative symptoms (p = 0.84), general psychopathology (p = 0.49), and total PANSS score (p = 0.19) over the control. There was no significant improvement in GAF (p = 0.43), CGI (p = 0.58), cognitive function (p = 0.46) and quality of life (p = 0.73). Extrapyramidal symptoms were significantly higher (MD: 0.39; 95% CI:0.19-0.60; p = 0.0002) in the sodium benzoate group in comparison to the control group; however, there was no significant difference in respect to other adverse events.
   Conclusion: Sodium benzoate can improve the positive symptoms of schizophrenia without any beneficial effect on other symptomatology, cognition, quality of life and functioning. Further studies are needed to evaluate longterm efficacy, safety and use in specific subgroups of patients.

TI  - Media reporting on deaths due to suicide attributed to gaming in digital news: A case of misrepresentation and missed opportunities
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY
KW  - Suicide
KW  - Self harm
KW  - Gaming
KW  - ASSOCIATION
AB  - Introduction: We aimed to study the attributes of the digital media reports on death due to suicide attributed to gaming. We also aimed to assess the overlap between the 'gaming' and 'gambling' activities in these media reports.
   Material and methods: The online media reports on the theme of deaths due to suicides attributed to digital gaming in India were retrieved using the Google News online platform. The news reports were searched in the tor browser using the keywords "gaming suicide India" or "gaming death India".
   Results: Gaming was identified as the direct reason for death due to suicide in an overwhelming majority (94.8%) of news reports. A large proportion of the reports failed to report death due to suicide in a responsible manner following the guidelines for responsible media reporting of suicide given by the World Health Organization (WHO). Stakeholders' views and opinions mentioned in the news reports included parents, caregivers or friends (17.5%), other gamers (3.1%), gaming industry (8.3%), and mental health professionals (5.2%). Around 24 per cent reports advocated a ban on 'gaming'.
   Conclusions: Based on our observations we recommend responsible reporting on death due to suicide in the online news. Also, there should be a more rigorous and systematic attempt before reaching at the conclusion while attributing these deaths to gaming. Finally, the news reports should ensure that the boundaries between 'gaming' and 'gambling' do not get blurred.

AB  - Objective: We assessed the impact of a collaborative care intervention on anxiety symptoms among participants in India with comorbid depression, poorly controlled diabetes, and moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. Method: We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial conducted at four diabetes clinics in India. Participants received either collaborative care or usual care. We included only participants who scored > 10 on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) at baseline. We estimated the effect of the intervention on clinically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms; we considered several potential baseline moderators and mediation by anti-depressant use. Results: One hundred and seventy-two participants scored 10 or above on the GAD-7 at baseline. Collaborative care participants were more likely than control participants to achieve a clinically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms at 6 and 12 months (65.7% vs. 41.4% at 12 months, p = 0.002); these differences were not sustained at 18 or 24 months. There was little evidence of moderation by participant characteristics at baseline, and effects were not mediated by anti-depressant use. Conclusions: Collaborative care for the treatment of depression and type 2 diabetes can lead to clinically significant reductions in anxiety symptoms among patients with anxiety. Effects were notable during the active intervention period but not over the year post-intervention.

AB  - Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutational inactivation of a developmental pathway responsible for generation of tissues of ectodermal origin. The X-linked form accounts for the majority of HED cases and is caused by Ectodysplasin (EDA) pathogenic variants. We performed a combined analysis of 29 X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (XLHED) families (including 12 from our previous studies). In addition to the classical triad of symptoms including loss (or reduction) of ectodermal structures, such as hair, teeth, and sweat glands, we detected additional HED-related clinical features including facial dysmorphism and hyperpigmentation in several patients. Interestingly, global developmental delay was identified as an unusual clinical symptom in many patients. More importantly, we identified 22 causal pathogenic variants that included 15 missense, four small in-dels, and one nonsense, splice site, and large deletion each. Interestingly, we detected 12 unique (India-specific) pathogenic variants. Of the 29 XLHED families analyzed, 11 (38%) harbored pathogenic variant localized to the furin cleavage site. A comparison with HGMD revealed significant differences in the frequency of missense pathogenic variants; involvement of specific exons and/or protein domains and transition/transversion ratios. A significantly higher proportion of missense pathogenic variants (33%) localized to the EDA furin cleavage when compared to HGMD (7%), of which p.R155C, p.R156C, and p.R156H were detected in three families each. Therefore, the first comprehensive analysis of XLHED from India has revealed several unique features including unusual clinical symptoms and high frequency of furin cleavage site pathogenic variants.

AB  - Background Early evidence suggests good response to pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) in DYT-KMT2B. Objectives We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess outcomes and identify predictors of good outcome following GPi-DBS in DYT-KMT2B. Methods We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane and MDS-abstracts databases using the MeSH terms "KMT2B and DYT28". We included studies that reported objective outcomes following GPi-DBS in DYT-KMT2B. The BFMDRS-M (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale- Movement) total scores pre- and post-surgery were used to quantify outcomes. We calculated pooled effects using a random effects meta-analysis and used meta-regression to identify potential effect modifiers. Multiple linear regression using individual patient data was used to identify predictors of good outcome (>50% improvement from baseline on BFMDRS-M). Results Initial searches screened 132 abstracts of which 34 full-text articles were identified to be of potential interest. Ten studies reporting 42 individual patients, met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the final review. The mean age at onset was 6.4 +/- 5.7 years and 40% were male. The median follow-up was 12 months (range: 1-264 months). GPi-DBS resulted in median BFMDRS-M improvement of 42.7% (range: -103.5% to 95.9%) postoperatively. Pooled proportion of patients experiencing clinical improvement >50% on BFMDRS-M was 41% (95% CI: 27%-57%). Male gender [beta: 22.6, 95% CI: 8.0-37.3, P = 0.004), and higher pre-operative BFMDRS-M score [beta: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.36-0.87, P < 0.001) were independently associated with better outcome. Conclusion KMT2B-associated dystonia responds effectively to pallidal stimulation. The outcome is better in males and those with more severe dystonia at baseline.

AB  - Our goal was to explore the detrimental impacts of ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and tetracycline (TETRA) on human retinal Muller (MIO-M1) cells in vitro. Cells were exposed to 30, 60 and 120 mu g/ml of CPFX and TETRA. The cellular metabolism was measured with the MTT assay. The JC-1 and CM-H2DCFDA assays were used to evaluate the levels of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ROS (reactive oxygen species), respectively. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, along with gene expression levels associated with apoptotic (BAX, BCL2L13, BCL2, CASP-3 and CASP-9), inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1 beta, TGF-alpha, TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2) and antioxidant pathways (SOD2, SOD3, GPX3 and NOX4) were analyzed via Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). Bioenergetic profiles were measured using the Seahorse (R) XF Flux Analyzer. Cells exposed 24 h to 120 mu g/ml TETRA demonstrated higher cellular metabolism compared to vehicle-treated cells. At each time points, (i) all TETRA concentrations reduced MMP levels and (ii) ROS levels were reduced by TETRA 120 mu g/ml treatment. TETRA caused (i) higher expression of CASP-3, CASP-9, TGF-alpha, IL-1B, GPX3 and SOD3 but (ii) decreased levels of TGF-B2 and SOD2. ATP production and spare respiratory capacity declined with TETRA treatment. Cellular metabolism was reduced with CPFX 120 mu g/ml in all cultures and 60 mu g/ml after 72 h. The CPFX 120 mu g/ml reduced MMP in all cultures and ROS levels (72 h). CPFX treatment (i) increased expression of CASP-3, CASP-9, and BCL2-L13, (ii) elevated the basal oxygen consumption rate, and (iii) lowered the mtDNA copy numbers and expression levels of TGF-B2, IL-6 and IL-1B compared to vehicle-control cells. We conclude that clinically relevant dosages of bactericidal and bacteriostatic antibiotics can have negative effects on the cellular metabolism and mitochondrial membrane potential of the retinal MIO-M1 cells in vitro. It is noteworthy to mention that apoptotic and inflammatory pathways in exposed cells were affected significantly This is the first study showing the negative impact of fluoroquinolones and tetracyclines on mitochondrial behavior of human retinal MIO-M1 cells.

AB  - Objectives To elicit antibiotic prescribing patterns across Indian Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU) and assess attributes of the antibiotic stewardship programs. Methods A link to a web-based questionnaire was sent by email to pediatric intensivists across India. Results Responses were received from 62 PICUs. Majority of respondents were from private hospitals [49/62 (79.5%)]. The most commonly reported infection requiring PICU admission was community-acquired pneumonia [by 39 (62.9%) PICUs] followed by gastroenteritis [26 (41.9%)], and meningitis [15 (24.1%)]. The blood culture positivity rates varied among participating PICUs with 37 centers (59.6%) reporting low blood culture positivity yield (< 40%). Majority of the respondents acknowledged using a 7-d course of antibiotics even in culture-negative sepsis. Most common empiric antibiotics prescribed for community-acquired infections were beta-lactam monotherapy. The typical beta-lactam prescribed was ceftriaxone. However, for hospital-acquired infections (HAI), such as suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a higher number of respondents-39/62 (61.9%) and 33/62 (53.2%), respectively, prescribed combination antibiotics (beta-lactam + vancomycin). Forty-two units (67.7%) reported having an antibiotic stewardship program in their PICUs, while twenty-nine (45.1%) centers stated having formulary restrictions. Ten (16.1%) centers had pre-authorization policy for certain antibiotics. Conclusion A rather diverse pattern of prescribing and administration practices exists across different Indian PICUs. While antibiotic stewardship programmes are established in most centers, formulary restriction and pre-authorisation of antibiotic prescribing were reported by few units. Regular surveillance studies are needed to bring uniformity in antibiotic policy and select appropriate empiric therapy.

AB  - Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) derived Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) have emerged as an effective candidate for amelioration of liver fibrosis. However, the effect and the mechanisms of MSC-EVs in liver repair remains elusive. In this study, we have evaluated the differential regenerative efficacy of EVs derived from two different human tissue-specific MSCs (Adipose tissue; AD-MSC and Wharton's Jelly; WJ-MSC), in a murine model of chronic liver fibrosis. Mouse model of chronic liver injury was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injection, followed by administration of EVs via the tail vein. Both quantitative and qualitative assessment was done to evaluate the hepatic regenerative potential of tissue specific MSC-extracellular vesicles. EVs, regardless of their MSC source, were found to be effective in alleviating chronic liver fibrosis, as demonstrated by macroscopic alterations in the liver. According to the findings of the comprehensive study, there were subtle variations in the tissue specific MSCs-EVs mediated approaches. A greater anti-fibrotic impact was demonstrated by AD-MSC derived EVs through extracellular matrix alteration and hepatocyte proliferation. WJ-MSC EVs, on the other hand, have an anti-inflammatory effect, as evidenced by alterations in the expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, cargo profiling of these EVs revealed differences in the miRNA and protein expression, as well as the pathways that they were associated.

AB  - Undue heat production in surgical bone drilling leads to osteonecrosis and can be an important cause of failure of osteosynthesis, impaired healing, and loosening of implants following orthopedic surgery. The present work aims to minimize heat production below the critical temperature for thermal osteonecrosis (i.e., 47 degrees C) and obviate thermal bone damage due to drilling. A total of 20 samples from the shaft of the human femur were obtained at autopsies and drilling was performed at room temperature by an operation theater (OT) compatible rotary ultrasonic bone drilling (RUBD) machine. K-type thermocouples were used to measure the temperature rise during drilling and the physical changes of the bone samples were observed by infrared gama camera. Light microscopic and transmission electron microscopic studies were performed to evaluate the bone cell damage. The maximum temperature recorded in RUBD (40.6 +/- 1.3 degrees C) was much below the critical temperature for thermal osteonecrosis (p < .05) at the rotational speed of 2000 rpm. Light microscopic and ultrastructural studies also revealed that there was no appreciable damage to the bone cells. Conventional bone drilling (CD) on the other hand recorded much higher temperature (66.6 +/- 3.2 degrees C), tissue burn and bone cell necrosis. Hence, RUBD machine has a potentiality for its use in orthopedic surgery and may provide better results.

AB  - The Gallbladder Reporting and Data System (GB-RADS) ultrasound (US) risk stratification is proposed to improve consistency in US interpretations, reporting, and assessment of risk of malignancy in gallbladder wall thickening in non-acute setting. It was developed based on a systematic review of the literature and the consensus of an international multidisciplinary committee comprising expert radiologists, gastroenterologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and pathologists using modified Delphi method. For risk stratification, the GB-RADS system recommends six categories (GB-RADS 0-5) of gallbladder wall thickening with gradually increasing risk of malignancy. GB-RADS is based on gallbladder wall features on US including symmetry and extent (focal vs. circumferential) of involvement, layered appearance, intramural features (including intramural cysts and echogenic foci), and interface with the liver. GB-RADS represents the first collaborative effort at risk stratifying the gallbladder wall thickening. This concept is in line with the other US-based risk stratification systems which have been shown to increase the accuracy of detection of malignant lesions and improve management.

AB  - Covid-19 pandemic had affected transfusion services including recruitment of donors and blood donation camps activities. The blood donors may have concerns, confusion, and misleading rumours about blood donation during pandemic. People's priorities for blood donation may shift because of a dearth of necessities. It is important to identify factors which prevent or motivate blood donors during pandemic. This study was designed to understand blood donors' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions during the Covid-19 pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study to assess donor's knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding blood donation using self-administered 20 questions. The study duration was 4 months. A total 503 whole blood donors participated. The fear of infection and reduced blood donor motivation were observed to be the major deterrents of blood donation activity. Environment of blood donation area and travel to blood donation site were perceived two major sources of Covid-19 infection by participants. The top 3 motivational factor for blood donation were direct patient request to donate (30%), followed by family/ friends need and social media campaigns (26% each). Most donors (70.6%) were aware of importance of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour during current pandemic. The 67% donors felt that adequate Covid-19 preventive measures had been followed by the staff involved in blood collection. Based on the survey results, the inferences are that donors may harbour fear of infection and concerns for their safety, deterring blood donation. The direct appeal from a patient's relative to donate blood or a requirement in their family/friends and social media appeals emerge important factors to motivate donors. Travel facility arrangement may aide blood donation. Most of the donors are more than satisfied with the blood donation experience and are motivated to inform the transfusion services of any appearance of Covid-19 symptoms post donation. The donors were satisfied with the steps to reduce Covid-19 infection.

AB  - Larger breast tumors that are unsuitable for breast conservation surgeries are common in the developing world and are usually treated with mastectomy. This report showcases our experience with the muscle-sparing latissimus dorsi (MSLD) flap for breast reconstruction after wide local excision or partial mastectomy. This is a retrospective review of patients undergoing breast reconstruction with MSLD flap after wide local excision between February 2016 and June 2018. The study of the aesthetic and functional outcomes was the primary objective and postoperative morbidity (pain, seroma, flap necrosis) as secondary objective. The aesthetic outcome was assessed individually by the patient and doctor as satisfactory, fair, good, and excellent. Donor site appearance was graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Disability of the shoulder was assessed subjectively (limitation to perform activities involving overhead abduction at shoulder joint) and objectively by measuring the range of motion at shoulder joint. Ten patients (5 carcinoma, 5 phyllodes) were included. The mean tumor size at time of operation was 4.2 cm for breast cancer patients (assessable in 4 patients) and 6.5 cm (4-9.5 cm) for phyllodes. Skin island of flap had a mean size of 7.5 x 8 cm. Donor site was closed primarily. No donor site seroma was seen. Necrosis of flap margins occurred in one. The aesthetic outcome was good in two and excellent in eight; donor site was rated as satisfactory in all. No patient experienced disability of the shoulder on subjective assessment and objective assessment. MSLD flap offers a satisfactory aesthetic outcome with minimal functional arm compromise or donor site morbidity.

AB  - Impaired high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functions are associated with development of coronary artery disease. In this study, we explored the quantitative differences in HDL (i.e. HDL proteome and fatty acid profile of HDL phospholipids) underlying the functional deficits associated with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The relationship between HDL function and composition was assessed in 65 consecutive ACS patients and 40 healthy controls. Cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of HDL and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) activity were significantly lower in patients with ACS compared to controls. In HDL proteome analysis, HDL isolated from ACS individuals was enriched in apolipoprotein C2 (inhibitor of LCAT), apolipoprotein C4 and serum amyloid A proteins and was deficient in apolipoprotein A-I and A-II. The fatty acid profile of HDL phospholipids analyzed using gas chromatography showed significantly lower percentages of stearic acid (17.4 +/- 2.4 vs 15.8 +/- 2.8, p = 0.004) and omega-3 fatty acids [eicosapentaenoic acid (1.0 (0.6-1.4) vs 0.7 (0.4-1.0), p = 0.009) and docosahexaenoic acid (1.5 +/- 0.7 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5, p = 0.03)] in ACS patients compared to controls. Lower percentages of these fatty acids in HDL were associated with higher odds of developing ACS. Our results suggest that distinct phospholipid fatty acid profiles found in HDL from ACS patients could be one of the contributing factors to the deranged HDL functions in these patients apart from the protein content and the inflammatory conditions.

AB  - Purpose In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of (225)AC-DOTATATE targeted alpha therapy in advanced-stage paragangliomas (PGLs).
   Methods Nine (6 males and 3 females) consecutive patients with histologically proven PGLs were treated with Ac-225-DOTATATE targeted alpha therapy (TAT) and concomitant radiosensitizer, capecitabine, at 8-weekly intervals up to a cumulative activity of similar to 74 MBq. The primary endpoint included evaluating therapy response and disease control rate (DCR) using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Additional secondary endpoints comprised clinical response assessment using EORTC QLQ-H&N35 questionnaire, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG), analgesic score (AS), dose alterations of anti-hypertensive drugs (anti-HTN), and the safety and side-effect profile evaluation as per CTCAE criteria version 5.0.
   Results Following Ac-225-DOTATATE treatment, morphological response revealed partial response in 50%, stable disease in 37.5%, and disease progression in 12.5%, with a DCR of 87.5%. Similarly, the symptomatic response was remarkable, and anti-HTN drugs were stopped in 25% and reduced in 37.5%. Another significant finding in our study revealed a morphologic DCR of 66.6% (2/3) in patients who failed previous lutetium-177 peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (Lu-1(77)-PRRT). Regarding the KPS, ECOG, and AS performance scores, a notable improvement was observed post-Ac-2(25)-DOTATATE treatment. The QLQ-H&N35 symptom scores evaluated in seven H&N PGL patients showed significant improvement in all aspects. No improvement in sexual function was noted (P = 0.3559). Despite the significant reduction in the analgesic score post-treatment (P = 0 .0031) , the QLQ-H&N35 revealed only marginal significance concerning the intake of pain killers (P = 0.1723). No grade III/IV hematological, renal, and hepatological toxicities were noted.
   Conclusion The evidence from this study suggests Ac-225-DOTATATE therapy is effective and safe in the treatment of advanced-stage PGLs and also reports a clear benefit even in patient's refractory to the previous Lu-177-PRRT.

AB  - Background There is a lack of studies on cystic fibrosis (CF) outcomes in children from developing countries like India. Identifying risk factors for mortality may help identify the high-risk group and plan policy management of such patients. We aimed to determine the factors associated with mortality among Indian children with CF. Methods In this retrospective study, we extracted demography, clinical features, laboratory and outcome data from medical records of children with CF. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify variables associated with mortality. Results We enrolled 178 children, and there were 32 (18.0%) deaths. Median (IQR) z-score for body mass index (BMI) at last follow up was -1.5 (-2.7, -0.2) and -2.5 (-4.0, -1.6), p-value 0.039, in survived and deceased group respectively. Mean (SD) of % predicted of FEV1/FVC and FEV1 25-75 at the time of diagnosis in survived versus diseased group was 94.7 (24.1) versus 81.5 (19.1), p-value 0.063 and 56.1 (38.9) versus 45.7 (29.9), p-value 0.347, respectively. Significant factors associated with mortality included history of neonatal complications; hazard ratio (HR): 8.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0-23.9, p < 0.001), low Z-scores for BMI at the time of diagnosis; HR: 7.1 (95% CI: 2.3-22.0, p < 0.001), FEV1/FVC at the time of diagnosis; HR: 5.1 (95% CI: 1.65-15.4, p < 0.004), and FEV1 25-75; HR: 3.6 (95% CI: 1.1-11.8, p = 0.03). Conclusions Factors associated with increased mortality risk included neonatal complications, low BMI, and lower pulmonary function test results. Low BMI and low PFT indices can be improved upon by timely treatment of respiratory infections, better nutrition, early diagnosis, and treatment. A newborn screening program may help in early diagnosis and identification of the neonatal problem of CF.

AB  - Objectives To determine the variability in therapeutic apheresis (TA) and non-blood donor related apheresis practices, and the extent of expertise and knowledge of blood centre staff. Background Apheresis activity that was earlier limited to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and donor apheresis at few centres in India has seen remarkable surge involving many centres practising TA and non-blood donor related apheresis. The decentralised transfusion medicine practice in country has resulted in wide variability of knowledge and practice of TA. An online survey was conducted to achieve study objectives. Study design and methods A 22 questionnaire survey was sent to the 215 blood centres through e-mail link focussing on three aspects; basic information of the participating centres, details of TA procedures and education and training levels of the staff. Results Majority (71.9%) of centres were teaching institutions among analysed 57 centres. TPE (85.9%) and therapeutic cytapheresis (71.9%) were the most common TA procedures. The clinical haematology (68.4%) followed by neurology (64.9%) were the specialities utilising TA. The 64.9% centres used continuous flow cell separator and central venous access (52%) was preferred vascular access. A combination of normal saline, fresh frozen plasma and 5% albumin replacement fluid was first choice. Doctors involved in TA were trained in apheresis during their MD/DNB degree, but no structured training program existed for other category of staff. Conclusion There was a wide variability in TA practice in India and a dedicated training program for all categories of staff was emphasised by majority of participants.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. A significant number of breast cancer patients have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer with associated high-risk genetic mutations. The culmination of translational research has helped in streaming guidelines and integration of genetic testing and interventions in the mainstream practice of oncology, especially in western countries. There are challenges of awareness, access, acceptability, and affordability for genetic testing and interventions in low to middle-income countries (LMIC). Surgeons play a vital role in the overall management of breast cancer and should take an initiative to familiarize and integrate into practice genetic counseling, genetic testing, and risk-reducing aspects of multidisciplinary breast cancer management. Risk-reducing surgery (RRS) is a complex and rapidly evolving field and surgeons dealing with breast cancer should be familiar with various dimensions of managing such patients. Several ethical, legal, and social issues are involved with genetic counseling and testing. A combined effort is needed to facilitate mainstreaming of genetic testing and risk-reducing surgery fields in LMIC.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node can be identified in almost 97% patients by using dual dye technique. Radiocolloid with blue dye is the gold standard technique. However, indocyanine green (ICG) with blue dye has reported good results in recent studies. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rates with dual dye technique using ICG and methylene blue among node-negative early breast cancer (EBC) patients undergoing surgery. In EBC patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), the combination of ICG with methylene blue was used. The SLN outcome data using dual dye technique was studied. Sixty-four patients underwent SLNB in between April 2019 and July 2020. The sentinel lymph node identification rate using dual dye was 95.3%. This was higher than blue dye alone (87.5%) and ICG alone (92.2%) techniques. In post neoadjuvant therapy (NACT) subset, SLN identification rate using dual dye was 91%. Median SLN harvest using ICG was three. The SLN identification rates with ICG and blue dye are comparable to the gold standard radiocolloid and blue dye technique. In comparison to radiocolloid, ICG can be considered superior in terms of its safety, easy availability, and low cost.

AB  - Objective The aim of this cross-sectional study was to comprehensively assess bone health in women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus, including bone microarchitecture (TBS), bone mineral density (BMD, DXA) and bone turnover (osteocalcin). Design, Patients and Measurements Study participants underwent a detailed anthropometric, biochemical and hormone assessment, including insulin and osteocalcin measurement. BMD was measured at lumbar spine, femur neck and total hip using DXA and TBS derived from lumbar spine DXA images using TBS iNsight software. Results A total of 240 women (mean age: 33.3 +/- 5.0 years; median postpartum duration: 34 [interquartile range 13.0-54.5] months were evaluated. At the current visit, 115 (47.9%) and 36 (15%) women had prediabetes and diabetes, respectively. Women with dysglycemia (diabetes/prediabetes) had a higher BMD at all three sites, compared to those with normoglycemia; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Women with dysglycemia had a significantly lower TBS (1.32 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.35 +/- 0.09; p = .038). In the fully adjusted model, the odds ratio for association between diabetes and low TBS was 2.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.20, 7.08; p = .018). Women with dysglycemia had significantly lower serum osteocalcin levels (18.6 +/- 8.5 ng/ml vs. 21.5 +/- 9.7 ng/ml; p = .018). HOMA-IR (r = -.285, p < .001) was negatively correlated, while Matsuda index (r = .274, p < .001) and disposition index (r = .159, p = .016) were positively correlated with serum osteocalcin levels. Conclusions Bone health is affected early in the natural history of diabetes and is associated with an overall low bone turnover state.

AB  - Asthma is a chronic airway inflammatory disease that results from a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. There is no cure for asthma, and the management is usually as per published guidelines. As in many chronic diseases conditions, various alternative or complimentary therapies have been tried. Of these, yoga and pranayama have gained wider attention in recent years. While the term yoga is a complex term encompassing eight limbs as per Patamjai in the yoga sutras, in simple terms, yoga is described as a combination of 'asana' (physical exercises) and 'pranayama' (breathing exercise). The term "asthma" has been derived from the Greek word "panting,", which indicates a rapid and shallow breathing. The main aim of yoga and pranayama in asthma is to synchronize and control breathing, thus decreasing hyperventilation. Besides this, they also decrease the stress/strain/anxiety, change in behavior, boost immunity, and improve strength/endurance of respiratory muscles that are helpful in any subject with asthma. There have been a good number of studies including clinical trials in children with asthma that have found some beneficial effects. In the present review, the physiology of yoga and pranayama, rationale for their use in children with asthma along with a summary of various studies conducted till date, have been discussed. These are followed by recommendations regarding their incorporation in the standard of care of children with asthma.

AB  - Penttinen type of premature aging syndrome is an extremely rare progeroid disorder, caused by activating variants in the receptor tyrosine kinase domain of the PDGFRB gene. Only eight individuals have been previously reported worldwide, with a consistent phenotype of prematurely aged appearance, lipoatrophy, hypertrophic skin lesions, proptosis, malar hypoplasia, and marked acro-osteolysis. We report the first patient of Penttinen syndrome from India, with novel radiographic findings of terminal phalangeal tufting, thereby expanding the phenotypic spectrum of Penttinen syndrome.

AB  - Urothelial carcinoma of bladder (UBC), a highly prevalent urological malignancy associated with high mortality and recurrence rate. Standard diagnostic method currently being used is cystoscopy but its invasive nature and low sensitivity stresses for identifying predictive diagnostic marker. Autophagy, a cellular homeostasis maintaining process, is usually dysregulated in cancer and its role is still enigmatic in UBC. In this study, 30 UBC patients and healthy controls were enrolled. Histopathologically confirmed tumor and adjacent normal tissue were acquired from patients. Molecular expression and tissue localization of autophagy-associated molecules (HMGB-1, RAGE, beclin, LC-3, and p62) were investigated. Serum HMGB-1 concentration was measured in UBC patients and healthy controls. ROC curves were plotted to evaluate diagnostic potential. Transcript, protein, and IHC expression of HMGB-1, RAGE, beclin, and LC-3 displayed upregulated expression, while p62 was downregulated in bladder tumor tissue. Serum HMGB-1 levels were elevated in UBC patients. Transcript and circulatory levels of HMGB-1 showed positive correlation and displayed a positive trend with disease severity. Upon comparison with clinicopathological parameters, HMGB-1 emerged as molecule of statistical significance to exhibit association. HMGB-1 exhibited optimum sensitivity and specificity in serum. The positive correlation between tissue and serum levels of HMGB-1 showcases serum as a representation of in situ scenario, suggesting its clinical applicability for non-invasive testing. Moreover, optimum sensitivity and specificity displayed by HMGB-1 along with significant association with clinicopathological parameters makes it a potential candidate to be used as diagnostic marker for early detection of UBC but requires further validation in larger cohort.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (1.11.1.7, LPO) is a mammalian heme peroxidase found in the extracellular fluids of mammals including plasma, saliva, airway epithelial lining fluids, nasal lining fluid, milk, tears, gastric juices, and intestinal mucosa. To perform its innate immune action against invading microbes, LPO utilizes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to convert thiocyanate (SCN-) and iodide (I-) ions into the oxidizing compounds hypothiocyanite (OSCN-) and hypoiodite (IO-). Previously determined structures of the complexes of LPO with SCN-, OSCN-, and I- show that SCN- and I- occupy appropriate positions in the distal heme cavity as substrates while OSCN- binds in the distal heme cavity as a product inhibitor. We report here the structure of the complex of LPO with IO- as the first structural evidence of the conversion of iodide into hypoiodite by LPO. To obtain this complex, a solution of LPO was first incubated with H2O2, then mixed with ammonium iodide solution and the complex crystallized by the addition of PEG-3350, 20% (wt/vol). These crystals were used for X-ray intensity data collection and structure analysis. The structure determination revealed the presence of four hypoiodite ions in the substrate binding channel of LPO. In addition to these, six other hypoiodite ions were observed at different exterior sites. We surmise that the presence of hypoiodite ions in the distal heme cavity blocks the substrate binding site and inhibits catalysis. This was confirmed by activity experiments with the colorimetric substrate, ABTS (2,2 '-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-sulfonic acid)), in the presence of hypoiodite and iodide ions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the presence of angle dysgenesis on ASOCT (anterior segment optical coherence tomography) (ADoA) as a predictive factor in determining outcomes of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT).
   DESIGN: A prospective clinical cohort study.
   SUBJECTS: Patients with juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) without angle dysgenesis on gonioscopy.
   METHOD: JOAG patients with uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP), who were to undergo SLT, were evaluated for the presence or absence of ADoA, which was defined as the absence of Schlemm's canal (SC) and/or presence of a hyperreflective membrane (HM) over the trabecular meshwork, as identified on ASOCT before the SLT procedure. Furthermore, the number of ASOCT B-scans in which SC was identified as present, were then quantified. Success of SLT was defined as a reduction of IOP by 20% or more from pre-laser value at 6-month follow-up without any further IOP-lowering medication or surgery. Only 1 repeat SLT was admissible for defining SLT success over the 6-month period. A successful reduction in IOP at 6-month follow-up was correlated with the extent of ADoA.
   RESULTS: In comparison to pre-SLT IOP, 57.1% eyes (20/35) showed more than 20% reduction in IOP at 6 months with a mean reduction of 7.6 +/- 1.8 mm Hg (29.6%). When all 3 observers agreed, SC was identified in 90% eyes (18/20) with success vs 26.6% eyes (4/15) with failure (P < .001). All eyes (5/5) with presence of HM showed failure (P < .001). All eyes (19/19) in which SC was present in > 50% ASOCT B scans (> 25/50 scans/eye) showed success (P < .001). On a bias-reduced regression analysis, the identification of SC on any 2 consecutive scans increased the chances of success at 6 months by 8.3 times, whereas the identification of SC in > 50% of ASOCT scans was associated with a 21.4 times greater chance of success.
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of SC on ASOCT is a strong predictor for successful IOP reduction after SLT in JOAG eyes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The presence of membranous immunopositivity of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumors serves as a key determinant of response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, there are very limited studies on the evaluation of the PD-L1 mRNA expression and immunopositivity and their correlation with therapeutic response and survival outcomes, especially in Indian lung cancer patients. In this prospective study, conducted between 2017 and 2020, we collected biopsies and surgically resected tumors from 173 lung cancer patients. PD-L1 immunopositivity and mRNA expression were determined by immunohistochemistry using SP263 assay and qRT-PCR, respectively. PD-L1 expression was correlated with various clinicopathological variables, response to therapy, and survival outcomes using appropriate statistical methods. The median age was 60 years (range 33-81 years) with the majority of patients being male (86.5%) and smokers (83%). Histologically, the majority of patients were non-small cell lung cancer (89.4%) and of squamous cell carcinoma histology (64.3%). PD-L1 immunopositivity in tumor cells (tumor proportion score (TPS) >= 1%) was detected in 37.6%, while high immunopositivity (TPS >= 50%) was detected in 16.8% of lung cancer patients. Almost 76% of lung cancer patients with PD-L1 TPS >= 50% belonged to PD-L1 mRNA high-expression group. PD-L1 mRNA expression and immunopositivity did not correlate with response to therapy and survival outcomes. We conclude that PD-L1 immunopositivity and mRNA expression do not seem to serve as a prognostic biomarker for lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. More prospective studies should be planned to evaluate the predictive and prognostic relevance of PD-L1 expression in Indian lung cancer patients being treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

AB  - In the study, quantitative analysis was done to identify the interaction among cardiac, vascular and respiratory signals for 6-degree head-down tilt (HDT) microgravity analogue. This HDT shifts the blood volume towards the thoracic cavity of the human body. The linear and non-linear domain analyses are based on coherence techniques that are used to analyse these cardiovascular responses. But they lack to measure the information flow and coupling changes that occurred during HDT. The present study applied an information domain approach for the investigation of non-linear causality to the heart rate variability, systolic blood pressure and respiration measured during HDT. It was hypothesized that the HDT will demonstrate alteration in cardiac, vascular and respiratory parameters. Twenty healthy subjects were inspected each for 10 min at supine rest and HDT. The responses were significant for cardiac and vascular but not for the respiratory system during HDT. It was observed that during HDT, the parasympathetic nervous system activated and increased the effect of vascular on the cardiac. The effect of respiration on either vascular or cardiac was not significant, therefore the variation and coupling observed in the vascular and cardiac systems are solely because of HDT. The results of this study support the hypothesis and revealed that the HDT altered the autonomic function parameters. It can be concluded that the HDT increases the parasympathetic activity and cardiovascular interaction as well as confirmed the usefulness of conditional entropy for coupling analysis.

AB  - Background Pierre Robin Sequence (PRS) affects approximately 1 per 8500 to 14000 new-borns worldwide. Although the clinical entity is well de?ned, the pathogenesis of PRS is debated. The present study aims to understand the contribution of genomic imbalances and genetic variants in patients clinically diagnosed of PRS. Methodology A total of 7 independent patients with nonsyndromic PRS thoroughly evaluated by a medical geneticist at a tertiary care hospital, were included in the study. Blood samples were collected from these patients and their family members. Array CGH was performed on all 7 patients and their respective family members for detection of underlying cytogenetic defects. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 5 families to capture single nucleotide variants or small indels. Results Cytogenetic analyses did not detect any previously reported gross chromosomal aberrations for PRS in the patient cohort. However, copy number variations (CNVs) of size de novo deletions at 7p14.1 locus in PRS patients: further validating the candidate loci susceptibility in oral clefts. WES data identified LOXL3 as candidate gene, carrying novel deleterious variant, which is suggestive of the role of point mutations in the pathogenesis of PRS. Conclusion The present study offered considerable insight into the contribution of cytogenetic defects and novel point mutation in the etiology of nonsyndromic PRS. Studies comprising large number of cases are required to fully elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying the PRS phenotype.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of intractable epilepsy where hyperactive glutamate receptors may contribute to the complex epileptogenic network hubs distributed among different regions. This study was designed to investigate the region-specific molecular alterations of the glutamate receptors and associated excitatory synaptic transmission in pilocarpine rat model of TLE. We recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from pyramidal neurons in resected rat brain slices of the hippocampus, anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and neocortex. We also performed mRNA and protein expression of the glutamate receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and GLUR1-4) by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. We observed significant increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSCs in the hippocampal and ATL samples of TLE rats than in control rats. Additionally, the magnitude of the frequency and amplitude was increased in ATL samples compared to that of the hippocampal samples of TLE rats. The mRNA level of NR1 was upregulated in both the hippocampal as well as ATL samples and that of NR2A, NR2B were upregulated only in the hippocampal samples of TLE rats than in control rats. The mRNA level of GLUR4 was upregulated in both the hippocampal as well as ATL samples of TLE rats than in control rats. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the number of NR1, NR2A, NR2B, and GLUR4 immuno-positive cells were significantly higher in the hippocampal samples whereas number of NR1 and GLUR4 immuno-positive cells were significantly higher in the ATL samples of the TLE rats than in control rats. This study demonstrated the region-specific alterations of glutamate receptor subunits in pilocarpine model of TLE, suggesting possible cellular mechanisms contributing to generation of independent epileptogenic networks in different temporal lobe structures.

AB  - Background Caudal block is a common regional anesthesia technique in pediatrics with landmark method predominantly being practiced. Ultrasound-guided technique provides real-time visualization of the structures and injection while performing caudal block. We performed this meta-analysis to determine the utility of ultrasound in caudal blocks in children over the landmark-based technique. Methods Randomized controlled trials comparing ultrasound-guided caudal blocks and landmark technique in pediatrics were searched from databases-PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL from inception until August 2020. The primary objective was success rate between the two techniques and secondary objectives included time to perform the block, first puncture success, and complications. Results Five trials with 904 participants were included for this meta-analysis. There was no difference in success rate between the two techniques (Risk ratio-1.07; 95% CI [0.97, 1.18]; p = .15). Time to perform the block was similar (Mean difference-8.88 s; 95% CI [-21.64, 39.40; p = .57) while first puncture success was higher with ultrasound-guided technique (Risk ratio-1.31; 95% CI [1.15, 1.49]; p = .0001). Complications like vascular puncture and needle misplacement were lower in the ultrasound group, and no serious complications were seen in any patient. Needle visualization and sacral canal distension were seen in 82% and 97.5% of the cases, respectively, in ultrasound group. Conclusion Ultrasound-guided caudal injection does not improve the success rate or time to perform the block but results in higher first puncture success and lower incidence of complications compared to landmark technique.

AB  - Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most common malignant tumor of the nasopharynx. Although NPC is not endemic in India, higher incidences were observed in its North-Eastern regions particularly Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur, and Mizoram. Early detection of NPC is difficult because the nasopharynx is not readily amenable to clinical examination and symptoms of NPC are nonspecific. The development of suitable biomarkers for early diagnosis of NPC as well as accurate monitoring of treatment response is needed urgently. In this exploratory pilot study, we have investigated the clinical significance of assessing plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA load at diagnosis and during treatment. We found that EBV DNA is detectable at diagnosis in the majority of patients with nonendemic NPC and the absolute copy number of circulating EBV DNA per milliliter increases progressively with the stage of the disease. The viral load declined significantly with induction chemotherapy and definitive chemoradiation but showed a sharp rise at relapse. Patients with EBV DNA levels >= 1500 copies/ml had a higher risk of disease progression or relapse when compared with patients who had EBV DNA <1500 copies/ml at baseline. Estimation of plasma EBV DNA may serve as an excellent noninvasive tool to monitor disease extent, response to therapy, and for better prediction of future relapse or progression-free survival in a nonendemic NPC patient population.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Rheumatic heart disease affects more than 40.5 million people worldwide and results in 306,000 deaths annually. Echocardiographic screening detects rheumatic heart disease at an early, latent stage. Whether secondary antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in preventing progression of latent rheumatic heart disease is unknown.
   METHODS
   We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of secondary antibiotic prophylaxis in Ugandan children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age with latent rheumatic heart disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either injections of penicillin G benzathine (also known as benzathine benzylpenicillin) every 4 weeks for 2 years or no prophylaxis. All the participants underwent echocardiography at baseline and at 2 years after randomization. Changes from baseline were adjudicated by a panel whose members were unaware of the trial-group assignments. The primary outcome was echocardiographic progression of latent rheumatic heart disease at 2 years.
   RESULTS
   Among 102,200 children and adolescents who had screening echocardiograms, 3327 were initially assessed as having latent rheumatic heart disease, and 926 of the 3327 subsequently received a definitive diagnosis on the basis of confirmatory echocardiography and were determined to be eligible for the trial. Consent or assent for participation was provided for 916 persons, and all underwent randomization; 818 participants were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis, and 799 (97.7%) completed the trial. A total of 3 participants (0.8%) in the prophylaxis group had echocardiographic progression at 2 years, as compared with 33 (8.2%) in the control group (risk difference, -7.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -10.2 to -4.7; P<0.001). Two participants in the prophylaxis group had serious adverse events that were attributable to receipt of prophylaxis, including one episode of a mild anaphylactic reaction (representing <0.1% of all administered doses of prophylaxis).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Among children and adolescents 5 to 17 years of age with latent rheumatic heart disease, secondary antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of disease progression at 2 years. Further research is needed before the implementation of population-level screening can be recommended.

AB  - Background The expression pattern of micro-RNAs (miRNA) has been implicated in the pathomechanism of various bone disorders, and has a role in differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The purpose of the study was to investigate the differential miRNA profiles of osteoporotic hip fractures compared to young patients with hip fractures. Methods Blood samples from ten osteoporosis patients and ten young, healthy patients, presenting with acute hip fractures were collected and subjected to an initial miRNA profiling to detect those miRNAs with significant variations between the two groups based on polymerase chain reactions performed in duplicate. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based analysis was then performed for validation of specific miRNAs that were significantly different between the two groups. Results A total of 182 miRNAs were analyzed. Thirty-nine of them showed significant differences between the two groups in the initial miRNA profiling. The validation results suggested that five miRNAs related to bone metabolism had significantly different expression among the osteoporotic hip fracture group compared to the young, healthy group: miR-23b-3p and miR-140-3p were up-regulated; miR-21-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-125b-5p were down-regulated. Conclusions Differential expression of selected miRNAs in patients with osteoporotic hip fracture suggests a possible role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers in prevention or timely prediction of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism of their involvement in osteoporosis.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate by meta-analysis the diagnostic accuracy of non-contrast quiescent-interval-single-shot (QISS) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) as reference standard. Methods This study was performed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines. A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus was done for studies reporting the diagnostic accuracy of QISS in PAD published up to 31 May 2021. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of QISS were calculated on a per-segment basis for the entire arterial tree. Results Seventeen studies including 459 patients were found eligible for the meta-analysis. There was significant heterogeneity among studies as depicted by chi-square test (p = 0.02) and moderate heterogeneity by I-2 statistic (I-2: 69 [95% CI: 30-100]). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of QISS on a per-segment basis with DSA/CE-MRA as reference standard was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.91) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.92-0.96) respectively. The area under hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic reflected a high accuracy of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.98). There was a low likelihood of publication bias as indicated by Deeks' funnel plot. Conclusions The present meta-analysis has consolidated the evidence that QISS has high accuracy for identifying as well as excluding arterial stenosis/occlusions in patients with symptoms of PAD. It can thus be considered the test of choice in patients with renal failure and in "at-risk patients" including pregnant women and patients with contrast allergy.

AB  - Objective To compare the effect of myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in combination (MI + DCI) with combined hormonal contraceptive (CHC) on menstrual cycle regulation in young Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods Seventy young women with PCOS aged 15-24 years with delayed cycles were randomized into two groups and were treated for 6 months with MI + DCI (550 + 150 mg, 3.6:1 ratio) twice a day and CHC (ethinyl estradiol 20 mu g + drospirenone 3 mg) once a day. Results Spontaneous menses resumed in 28 (84.85%) young women on MI + DCI, compared with withdrawal bleeding in 34 (100%) on CHC. The mean cycle length reduced with both MI + DCI (124.54 +/- 8.08 to 57.75 +/- 3.00 days, P < 0.001) and CHC (105.88 +/- 7.96 to 30.53 +/- 2.95 days, P < 0.001). Regular menstrual cycles were established in 9 (27.27%) young women with MI + DCI (P = 0.001) and 30 (88.23%) with CHC (P < 0.001). Three months after stopping the treatment, 24 young women (85.71%) on MI + DCI and 25 (73.53%) on CHC continued to have spontaneous cycles. Anti-Mullerian hormone decreased with both the drugs (P = 0.001), whereas luteinizing hormone (P = 0.001) and testosterone (P = 0.04) decreased with CHC and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (P < 0.001) with MI + DCI. Conclusion Myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in combination (3.6:1 ratio) are effective in regularizing menstrual cycles and improving insulin resistance.

AB  - Background Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a less common but devastating complication of COVID-19 disease. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the most common CT imaging features of AMI in COVID-19 and also provide an updated review of the literature on symptoms, treatment, histopathological and operative findings, and follow-up of these patients.
   Methods A systematic literature search of four databases: Pubmed, EMBASE, WHO database, and Google Scholar, was performed to identify all the articles which described abdominal CT imaging findings of AMI in COVID-19.
   Results A total of 47 studies comprising 75 patients were included in the final review. Small bowel ischemia (46.67%) was the most prevalent abdominal CT finding, followed by ischemic colitis (37.3%). Non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI; 67.9%) indicating microvascular involvement was the most common pattern of bowel involvement. Bowel wall thickening/edema (50.9%) was more common than bowel hypoperfusion (20.7%). While ileum and colon both were equally involved bowel segments (32.07% each), SMA (24.9%), SMV (14.3%), and the spleen (12.5%) were the most commonly involved artery, vein, and solid organ, respectively. 50% of the patients receiving conservative/medical management died, highlighting high mortality without surgery. Findings on laparotomy and histopathology corroborated strikingly with CT imaging findings.
   Conclusion In COVID-19 patients with AMI, small bowel ischemia is the most prevalent imaging diagnosis and NOMI is the most common pattern of bowel involvement. Contrast-enhanced CT is a powerful decision-making tool for prompt diagnosis of AMI in COVID-19, thereby potentially improving time to treat as well as clinical outcomes.

AB  - Aim: To estimate acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) in critically ill children and association of its severity with mortality.
   Methods: In a prospective cohort study, critically ill children (1 month-18 years) were enrolled. Gastrointestinal symptoms over the first week of admission were classified into AGI grades 1 through 4, using a paediatric adaptation of European Society of Intensive Care Medicine AGI definitions. Performance of AGI grades in predicting 28-day mortality was evaluated.
   Results: Of 151 children enrolled, 71 (47%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 38.9-55.3%) developed AGI, with AGI grades 1, 2, 3 and 4 in 22.5%, 15.9%, 6.6% and 2%, respectively. The 28-day mortality progressively increased with AGI grade 0 (15%), 1 (35%), 2 (50%), 3 (70%), through 4 (100%), P < 0.001. Association of AGI grades with 28-day mortality was significant even after adjustment for disease severity, age and nutritional status (odds ratio (OR) = 2.152, 95% CI: 1.455, 3.184). Among AGI grades, and paediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 score components, cardiovascular (OR = 1.525, 95% CI: 1.142, 2.037) and haematological (OR = 1.719, 95% CI: 1.067, 2.772) components of paediatric logistic organ dysfunction-2 score and AGI grades (OR = 1.565, 95% CI: 1.001, 2.449) showed significant association with 28-day mortality.
   Conclusions: Nearly half of the critically ill children developed AGI. AGI grades were independently associated with increased mortality, and mortality progressively increased with AGI grade.

AB  - Background and Objective: Although the mechanism of stroke in cervical artery dissection (CAD) has been hypothesized to be embolization rather than hemodynamic compromise, there are a limited number of studies supporting this hypothesis. Detection of micro-embolic signals (MESs) using transcranial Doppler (TCD) helps in understanding the mechanism in these patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to estimate the prevalence of MES and its association with stroke outcomes in patients with acute stroke/TIA secondary to dissection. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies before January 26, 2021, in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies were identified that used TCD to detect MES in stroke/TIA patients secondary to CAD. Pooled prevalence was calculated. Entire statistical analysis was conducted in R version 3.6.2. Results: Eleven studies involving 112 patients (50 MES+, 62 MES-) were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of MES among acute stroke/TIA patients secondary to dissection was 46.0% (95% CI 26.0-67.0%). The presence of MES was associated with an increased risk of early ischemic recurrence in patients with CAD. We could not estimate the functional outcome and mortality associated with the presence of MES due to the scarcity of data. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed 46% prevalence of MES in the studies which looked at acute stroke/TIA secondary to CAD using TCD. This finding supports the assumption that embolism may be a major cause of stroke in patients with dissection although this could be determined only in a small population.(c) 2021 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Purpose Late-onset atrial fibrillation (LOAF) after valve surgery for degenerative mitral valve disease often with underlying mitral valve prolapse is a known phenomenon. However, there is no similar data for postoperative rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients. We sought to assess the incidence and predictors of LOAF during postoperative follow-up in RHD patients.
   Methods This single-center retrospective case-control study included a total of 384 RHD patients with normal sinus rhythm (NSR) who underwent rheumatic valve surgery between 1st July 2008 and 30th June 2013. Patients detected with de novo persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) after 2 months of valve surgery were diagnosed as having LOAF. Presurgical demographic and echocardiographic parameters were compared between the LOAF and NSR groups to identify risk factors for LOAF.
   Results The incidence of de novo LOAF after rheumatic valve surgery was 9.63% at an average of 2.67 +/- 1.32 years follow-up. Age >= 32 years [OR 2.4 (95% CI 1.2-5.1); P = 0.01] and left atrial (LA) size >= 51 mm [OR 5.9 (95% CI 2.8-12.4); P < 0.0001] were the most significant and independent predictors of LOAF. Moreover, significant mitral valve disease was associated with a higher risk of LOAF than significant aortic valve disease (P = 0.037). LA size >= 51 mm at surgery showed a fair discriminative power [AUC = 0.75; sensitivity = 68%, specificity = 70%] to identify patients at high risk for LOAF.
   Conclusions Late-onset AF develops in almost a tenth of the RHD patients postoperatively following corrective valve surgery. Preoperative LA size can be used to identify patients at high risk for LOAF.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Scientometrics is a subfield of bibliometrics that statistically analyzes publications trends. The aim of this initial study was to investigate trends in the 6 major neurosurgical journals from the last 10 years. METHODS: We searched Web of Science and Scopus for articles published in Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine , Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics, Operative Neurosurgery, and World Neurosurgery from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020. Statistically analyzed parameters included national and continental distribution of articles, population density, density of neurosurgeons per 100,000 inhabitants, national per capita GDP, and national literacy rates. Bibliometric parameters assessed included total number of articles, H-indices, absolute/average number of citations per article, and article types. RESULTS: A total of 39,239 articles were published in the 6 journals. Journal of Neurosurgery and Neurosurgery had the strongest source impact. The most productive year was 2019 with 6811 published articles. Corresponding authors from the USA, China, Japan, Western Europe, and Turkey were the most productive. Articles published by authors from the USA received the majority of citations. Publication numbers increased in proportion with increases in country population, literacy rate, per capita GDP, and neurosurgeon density. The highest -umber of articles were published in 2016, and the fewest were published in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic trends in the diversity of neurosurgical publications sustained its steady increase in most developed counties. Simultaneously, the publication gap between developed and developing countries has remained stagnant.

AB  - Asthma is common in children and exacerbations are usually triggered by respiratory viruses. There was considerable concern about the impact of COVID-19 on children with asthma. It was expected that children with asthma would fare poorly during the pandemic. However, the reported effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric asthma including acute asthma admissions, does not appear to be significant, but this needs careful follow-up. The socioeconomic effects of the pandemic and reduced healthcare access could potentially impact on ongoing delivery of health care in chronic respiratory conditions including asthma, especially in resource-poor settings. Children with chronic asthma need to be treated as per internationally published guidelines with innovative models of disease monitoring and ongoing care during the pandemic. During the pandemic, children with acute asthma need to be managed carefully based on local guidelines and using strict infection control policies. The use of technology such as telehealth and various tools of asthma management including questionnaires and digital monitoring will play an important role in asthma management during the pandemic. Medical professionals, healthcare administrators, and governments should be sensitive to the evolving needs of the community and work closely to continue to provide services in a challenging yet unresolved pandemic.

AB  - Purpose: VEGF and HIF-1 alpha are important regulators of angiogenesis, overexpressed in various tumors. Lacrimal gland Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a malignant tumor whose angiogenic properties remain unexplored. This study was designed to evaluate the expression of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in lacrimal gland ACC.
   Methods: VEGF and HIF-1 alpha immunoexpression was undertaken in 30 lacrimal gland ACC cases. mRNA expression of VEGF and HIF-1 alpha was analysed in 17 cases by quantitative real time PCR. The results obtained were correlated with clinicopathological features and survival of the patients to determine the prognostic significance.
   Results: Immunoexpression of HIF-1 alpha and VEGF was seen in 36.6% and 46.6% ACC cases. HIF-1 alpha expression showed significant association with advanced T-stage (P = 0.001) and VEGF with intracranial extension (P = 0.014) and solid histological pattern (P = 0.045). HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression was seen in 29.4% cases and showed significant association with perineural invasion (P = 0.027). Recurrence occurred in 60%, distant metastasis in 20% and death in 20% cases. Survival analysis revealed that patients with HIF-1 alpha, VEGF immunoexpression, solid histological pattern, perineural invasion, bone erosion, intracranial extension, metastasis, advanced Tstage, and exenteration had poor survival. On multivariate analysis VEGF immunoexpression (hazard ratio, 16.785; 95% confidence interval, 1.872-150.495; P = 0.012) was the most significant poor prognostic factor.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that VEGF is a potential predictor for poor clinical outcome in lacrimal gland Adenoid cystic carcinoma.

AB  - Background There is scanty evidence on the impact of bariatric surgery on urinary incontinence (UI) in the Asian population. Methodology Patients who underwent bariatric surgery from June 2018 to June 2019 were screened using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence-Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) questionnaire. Patients having UI were identified and followed until 1 year of surgery using the ICIQ-UI-SF. These were classified as having stress, urge, or mixed type of UI. The prevalence, change in scores, and the number of pads used were compared at baseline and at follow-up. Results A total of 148 patients underwent bariatric surgery of whom, 41 patients (M = 2, F = 39) had UI. Stress incontinence was seen in 70.7%, 19.5% had urge incontinence, and rest had the mixed type. Using logistic regression, it was found that female gender was the most important predictor of having UI (OR: 8.33). The prevalence of UI decreased from 27.7% at baseline to 8.1% at 6 months and 3.4% at 12 months. The mean ICIQ-UI-SF score improved from 8.76 (SD = 3.2) at baseline to 0.66 (SD = 2.1) at 12 months of follow-up. The proportion of patients with UI using any number of pads decreased from 92.7% at baseline to 9.8% at 12 months. There was a decrease in the number of patients having moderate to very severe UI from 35 (85.4%) at baseline to 2 (4.9%) at 12 months. Proportion of patients showing resolution was highest among the stress incontinence group at 96.5%. Presence or absence of comorbidities did not significantly influence the ICIQ-UI-SF scores. Conclusion Bariatric surgery leads to profound improvement in UI in obese individuals which is well sustained until 1 year of follow-up. Resolution rates might be higher in Asian population.

AB  - Diagnosis of osteoarticular tuberculosis (OATB) exhibits serious challenges owing to paucibacillary nature of specimens and localization of disease at sites that are difficult to access. We recently developed indirect immuno-PCR (I-PCR) and real-time I-PCR (RT-I-PCR) assays for the detection of mycobacterial antigen 85 complex (Ag85) in OATB patients. Detection limits for the purified Ag85 protein were found to be 1 and 41 fg ml(-1) by I-PCR and RT-I-PCR, respectively, which were at least 10(5)-fold lower than respective ELISA. While spiking synovial fluids of non-TB control subjects with the purified Ag85 protein, LODs of 100 and 120 fg ml(-1) were obtained by I-PCR and RT-I-PCR, respectively, thus demonstrating the sample matrix effect. Sensitivities of 87 center dot 5 and 70 center dot 5% were observed in bodily fluids of confirmed (n = 8) and clinically suspected (n = 51) OATB cases, respectively, by I-PCR, with a specificity of 93 center dot 9% (n = 33). Markedly, the sensitivities obtained by I-PCR/RT-I-PCR were significantly higher (P < 0 center dot 05-0 center dot 01) than ELISA and GeneXpert assay (n = 30). However, no substantial difference in sensitivity was observed between the I-PCR and RT-I-PCR assays. After further improving the accuracy of I-PCR, this test may lead to development of an attractive diagnostic kit.

AB  - The literature on B-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in India is restricted to individual hospital data. The study aimed to evaluate the epidemiology and outcome of B-NHL in our country. One hundred and ninety-one patients of B-NHL from 10 centers diagnosed between 2013 and 2016 were analyzed retrospectively. B/T lymphoblastic lymphoma and patients with inadequate data were excluded. The median age was 88 months (IQR: 56, 144) with an M:F ratio of 5.6:1. Undernourishment and stunting were seen in 36.5% and 22%. Primary site was abdomen in 66.5%. Hypoalbuminemia was noted in 82/170 (48.2%). Histological subtypes: Burkitt lymphoma (BL): 69.6%, Burkitt-like: 10.4%, and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL): 13.6%, unclassified and others (6.4%). Stage distribution: I/II, 33 (17.3%), III, 114 (59.7%), and IV, 44 (23%). One-eighty-six patients took treatment. Protocols used were LMB and BFM in 160/186 (86%). At a median follow-up of 21.34 (IQR: 4.34, 36.57) months, the disease-free-survival (DFS) was 74.4% and event-free-survival (EFS) was 60.7%. Treatment-related mortality (TRM), relapse/progression and abandonment were 14.3%, 14.5%, and 8.4%, respectively. Bone marrow positivity, stage IV disease, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) > 2,000 U/l predicted inferior EFS. Stage IV disease, LDH > 2,000 U/l, bone marrow positivity, tumor lysis syndrome and low albumin predicted TRM; LDH retained significance on multivariate analysis for EFS and TRM [OR: 4.54, 95% CI: 1.14-20, p 0.03; OR 20, 95%CI: 1.69-250, p 0.017]. BL was the main histological subtype. High TRM and relapse/progression are hampering survival. An LDH > 2,000 U/l was adversely prognostic. These data demonstrate a need to develop a national protocol that balances toxicity and potential for cure.

AB  - -BACKGROUND: Acta Neurochirurgica (ANCH) and World Neurosurgery (WN), are 2 journals of significant importance in the neurosurgical community and have been associated with international federations. These journals carry a similar impact factor. The difference is the years they have been active (ANCH starting publication in 1973 and WN in 2010). This factor allows for a unique opportunity to delve deep into comparative, scientometric parameters, to understand the evolution of neurosurgical research. -METHODS: A title-specific search of the Web of Science database using the keywords "Acta Neurochirurgica," "Acta," "Neurochirurgica," "World Neurosurgery," "World," and "Neurosurgery" was performed and arranged according to number of citations. The title of the articles, authors, corresponding authors, country of origin, journal of publication, year of publication, citation count. and journal impact factor were assessed. -RESULTS: The average citation for ANCH was 170.1 citations, most being original articles (83/100). The articles of WN garnered nearly 70.48 citations, averaging 8.3 citations per publication. Most corresponding authors in ANCH originated from Germany with neuro-oncology, followed by neurotrauma and vascular as subjects. In contrast, the United States followed by China were the most common countries of origin for WN, with endoscopy and skull base being the topics achieving high impact. -CONCLUSIONS: Neurotrauma and consensus guidelines have been shown to have maximal citations for ANCH whereas endoscopy and skull base lesions garnered the most for WN. Author subspecialization and increased collaboration across specialties with more articles on refinement of technique and outcome have emerged as recent trends.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to microgravity causes physiological deconditioning in humans. Herein, a novel designed countermeasure gravitational load modulation bodygear has been developed to deal with the ill effects of the microgravity environment. The bodygear is designed to provide the wearer an axial loading from the shoulder to the feet that simulate Earth's gravity. The present study aims to evaluate the effect of bodygear on cardiac, vascular and respiratory systems during head-down tilt (HDT) microgravity analogue. In this, 30 healthy male subjects have volunteered and their average age, height and weight were 24.56 +/- 3.87 yr, 168.4 +/- 9.17 cm and 65.9 +/- 10.51 kg respectively. The physiological signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP) and respiration were recorded non-invasively using Biopac MP100. The signals were sampled at 1,000 Hz and processed using MATLAB 2018b. The signals were analysed in linear well as non-linear domains. The ECG and BP were used to derive R-R interval (RRI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). The respiration time series (RSP) was derived by extracting R-peaks from the ECG signal and using these peaks to find the respiration amplitude. The non-linear domain analysis was used for the detection and quantification of information flow among the recorded signals. Repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-hoc paired t-test was used for statistical analysis with the p < 0.05. The experimental results show that the 6-degree HDT activates the parasympathetic system and decreased the RRI effect on SBP (p = 0.005). Interestingly with the bodygear usage, the sympathetic system activated, mean RRI decreased (p = 0.018) and blood pressure increased (p = 0.031) as compared to baseline. Further, it was also observed that the effect of RRI on SBP (p = 0.029) and SBP on RRI (p = 0.012) was increased with bodygear as compared to HDT without bodygear. The conditional entropy technique aided in analyzing the effect of bodygear on information flow variation in the cardiovascular system of the human body.

AB  - The mammalian lactoperoxidase system, consisting of lactoperoxidase and the H2O2-producing enzyme duox, is our first line of defence against airborne microbes. This system catalyses the production of hypoiodite and hypoiodous acid in the presence of sufficient iodine. These products are highly efficient at destroying the H1N1 virus and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Japan has not been affected as much as other nations during the COVID-19 pandemic (death rate about 10% of the United States), and we think this is due to a diet high in iodine. With this in mind, we suggest four actions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections. First, health professionals should study the preventative effect of increasing iodine in the diets of the aged, institutionalized, diabetics andsmokers. Second, the recommended daily intake (RDI) for iodine should be significantly increased, to at least double, the current RDI. Governments should encourage the use and distribution of cheap iodized salts, kelp and seaweed. Third, more research should be done around the physiology and the protective effects of the lactoperoxidase system. Finally, the degradation products of the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle by hypoiodite and hypoiodous acid should be characterized; portions of the damaged particle are likely to elicit stronger immunity and better vaccines.

AB  - The present review attempts to critically examine and evaluate research findings on mushrooms as sources of vitamin D and other nutraceuticals. Recently, there is a growing concern about diseases associated with the deficiency of vitamin D in humans. As people tend to stay indoors, in present times, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vitamin D levels are further affected. Research indicates vitamin D as a promising defensive or therapeutic agent against COVID, making this review more crucial. Mushrooms, as a rich source of vitamin D along with various bioactive compounds, perform a significant role in resolving health issues. Robust analyses of various strategies for enhancing vitamin D content in mushrooms holds significance in this study; moreover, this will help stakeholders of the mushroom industry in enriching the overall mushroom quality and human health. Mushroom-based medicinal formulations and functional foods serve to deliver vitamins and nutrients to humans, thus helping to combat malnutrition and other health problems, especially in developing countries. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical analyses suggests that vitamin D-2 bioavailability in mushrooms is comparable with vitamin D from other sources. The review also emphasises molecular findings from mushrooms related to genes responsible for morphology and metabolic production of pro-vitamin-D-2.

AB  - Background Epidemiological studies have shown an increased prevalence and incidence of hypertension as well as a higher incidence of stroke among patients suffering from RLS. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RLS among patients with resistant hypertension (RH) and compare the clinical characteristics of these patients with patients of stroke pre-existing RLS and with patients with primary RLS presenting to the Sleep clinic.
   Methods Consecutive patients with RH (without any identifiable cause on extensive work up) and consecutive in-patients with stroke were enrolled over a 3-year-period. Patients with RH fulfilling revised-IRLSSG-criteria for RLS comprised group 1 and those with stroke and RLS formed group 2. These were compared with patients diagnosed to have idiopathic RLS (iRLS) (Group 3). Prevalence of RLS in groups 1 and 2 and RLS characteristics in all groups were compared.
   Results Sixteen out of 56 RH patients (29%) formed group 1 and 43 out 346 of stroke patients (12%) formed group 2, while 43 consecutive iRLS patients were included in group 3. Age was significantly higher, with male dominance in group 2. Median age at symptom onset was significantly lower in group 1. Positive family history was similar in RH and iRLS patients and was significantly less common in stroke patients. Asymmetrical/unilateral distribution of symptoms was significantly more common in stroke group, compared to RH and iRLS groups.
   Conclusion This study demonstrated a high prevalence of RLS among patients with resistant hypertension. RLS characteristics are different from those in patients with stroke, and very similar to primary RLS.

AB  - The increased multidrug resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) to the present-day known antibiotics has stimulated academic and industrial efforts globally for the development of novel antibacterial agents. Natural compounds as potential drug leads are gaining significant attention due to their less toxic and more tolerant nature. In the current study, the natural product-based compounds were explored as probable inhibitors of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine:D-glutamate (MurD) ligase from A.baumannii (AbMurD) to provide a new class of drug leads. The prepared natural library of 3,16,714 compounds from ZINC database was screened into the active site of AbMurD using in silico high-throughput virtual screening which resulted in 100 compounds having high binding affinities. Further screening through flexible molecular docking yielded four potential compounds selected on the basis of estimated binding affinity (DG) and favorable protein-ligand interactions. MD simulation of these four compounds under physiological conditions and free binding energy calculations using MM/ PBSA (molecular mechanics with Poisson- Boltzmann and surface area solvation) approach revealed three compounds ZINC08879777, ZINC30726863, and ZINC95486217 as potential binders of AbMurD. The calculated physicochemical and ADME properties of these compounds revealed that they can be exploited and modified to improve their binding affinity with the enzyme. Two compounds were purchased and tested against bacterial cell cultures of A. baumannii, Salmonella Typhi, and Staphylococcus aureus to determine their broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. The results suggest that the identified compounds can be exploited as potential herbal leads to target both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.

AB  - Background In an era of targeted therapies, patients with cancer in resource-constraint countries continue to struggle to find affordable care. Methods The present study is a multicenter prospective single-arm study. Patients with expected delay in surgery, unresectable or metastatic cancers, and patients not suitable for surgery or conventional chemotherapy were included. Oral methotrexate 15 mg/m(2) once a week and oral celecoxib 200 mg twice daily was used for metronomic therapy. Results At 8 weeks, a clinically complete response was seen in 2.5%, partial response in 46.6%, stable disease in 39.8%, and disease progression in 11%. Size less than 4 cm, alveolobuccal subsite, and well-differentiated histology were significantly associated with no disease progression. Conclusion Constraint-adapted approach of using methotrexate and celecoxib is economical with good compliance, minimal toxicity, and good efficacy. It is feasible for use in diverse settings. Individualized selection of patients based on response predictors may maximize metronomic therapy's benefit.

AB  - Pathogenic RNA viruses are emerging as one of the major threats and posing challenges to human community. RNA viruses have an exceptionally shorter generation time and easy to adapt in host cells. The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2, a long RNA virus, has shown us how difficult it is to overcome this kind of pandemic without understanding the viral infection and replication mechanisms. It is essential to comprehend replications of the viral genome, including RNA polymerization and the final capping process. The mRNAs of SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses are protected at their 50-ends by cap structure. The cap-like system plays a significant role in viral translational process, viral RNA stability, and scatting in detecting innate immune recognition in host cells. Two coronavirus enzymes, Nsp14 and Nsp16, critically help in the formation of capping and are considered as potential drug targets for antiviral therapy. Natural and herbal medicines have a past record of treating various acute respiratory diseases. In this work, we have exploited 56000 natural compounds to screen potential inhibitors against NSP16. In silico virtual screening, docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation studies were performed to understand how these potential inhibitors are bound to NSP16. We observed that the most highly screened compound binds to protein molecules with a high dock score, primarily through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, as previously reported for NSP16. Compound-13 (2hydroxy-N-(f1-[2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]piperidin-3-ylgmethyl)-5-methylbenzamide) and compound-51 (N-(2-isobutoxybenzyl)-N,2-dimethyl-2,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decane-3-carboxamide) occupied in active site along with good pharmokinetices properties. In conclusion, the selected compounds could be used as a novel therapeutic against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the role of cardiac enzymes N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin-I (CTnI) as predictors of outcomes in patients with sepsis. 78 cases with a diagnosis of sepsis were enrolled over a 2-year period. Baseline demographic, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation-II (APACHE-II), Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II (SAPS-II), hematologic and biochemical parameters were noted. Serum NT-proBNP and CTnI were evaluated at 24 and 72 hours of admission along with echocardiography. Patients were prospectively followed up until death or discharge. Mean APACHE-II score was 19.8 +/- 9.6 and SAPS-II was 44.8 +/- 17.2. Survival rate in the study was 47.5% (36 of 78 patients). NT-proBNP was significantly higher in non-survivors with values over 4300 pg/mL at 24 hours and 5229 pg/mL at 72 hours associated with poor outcomes (p<0.05). CTnI was higher among non-survivors than in survivors, but the difference was not significant. APACHE-II score combined with NT-proBNP predicted a poor outcome in 51.2% cases compared with 14.6% cases with APACHE-II alone (p<0.05), while SAPS-II combined with NT-proBNP predicted a poor outcome in 53.6% cases as compared with 9.6% cases with SAPS-II alone (p<0.05). SAPS-II greater than 45 and NT-proBNP values at 72 hours were independent predictors of mortality in patients with sepsis. NT-proBNP is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with sepsis and its combination with APACHE-II and SAPS-II improves the predictive values of the scoring systems.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to establish a methodology for the design and development of patient-specific elbow implant with an elastic modulus close to that of the human bone. One of the most preferred implant material is titanium alloy which is about 8 to 9 times higher in strength than that of the human bone and is the closest than other metallic biomedical materials. Design/methodology/approach The methodology begins with the design of the implant from patient-specific computed tomography information and incorporates the manufacturing of the implant via a novel rapid prototyping assisted microwave sintering process. Findings The elastic modulus and the flexural strength of the implant were observed to be comparable to that of human elbow bones. The fatigue test depicts that the implant survives the one million cycles under physiological loading conditions. Other mechanical properties such as impact energy absorption, hardness and life cycle tests were also evaluated. The implant surface promotes human cell growth and adhesion and does not cause any adverse or undesired effects i.e. no cytotoxicity. Practical implications Stress shielding, and therefore, aseptic loosening of the implant shall be avoided. In the event of any trauma post-implantation, the implant would not hurt the patient. Originality/value The present study describes a methodology for the first time to be able to obtain the strength required for the medical implant without sacrificing the fatigue life requirement.

AB  - Introduction: Three-dimensional (3D), high-definition (HD), and ultra-high-definition (4K HD) are recent additions over regular HD technology for laparoscopic surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the learning pattern of these systems on standardized phantom tasks.
   Methodology: Forty-five stereo-enabled resident doctors were randomly assigned into three groups. They performed three validated tasks, precision touch on flat surface, precision touch on uneven surface, surgical knot on rubber tube using either two-dimensional (2D) HD, 3D HD, or 4K HD Endovision systems. Each task was repeated 20 times. Data from four consecutive repetitions were pooled to make five blocks. Split group analysis by comparing the consecutive blocks in execution time and errors were made to see the learning pattern. A significant difference was accepted as continuous learning while no significant difference was accepted as learning stabilization.
   Result: Operating time was stabilized in two tasks after third block in 2D HD, one task after fourth block in 4K HD. There was continuous learning in all tasks with 3D HD. The 3D HD group was significantly faster than 2D HD and 4K HD in most of the tasks on fifth block. The error scores were similar between the consecutive blocks in 4K HD. It was stabilized after second block in 2D HD group and third block on 3D HD.
   Conclusion: The 3D HD Endovision system has more potential of faster execution of a task, but need more practice to reach similar safety profile. The 4K HD reached the safety plateau with minimal repetitions.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate and compare the prevalence of high-risk HPV and low-risk HPV types in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) and healthy controls. Materials and methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital on the patients of CRSwNP undergoing surgical management. All patients underwent preoperative endoscopic evaluation and radiological assessment using NCCT of the nose and paranasal sinuses. The severity of the disease was graded using the Lund-Mackay score on NCCT. All patients underwent endoscopic polypectomy and the sample of tissues was sent for HPV DNA detection using Hybrid Capture II (R) technique. The clinicopathological characteristics of HPV positive and negative patients were compared. Results: Sixty cases and 20 controls were included in the study. All controls were negative for HPV DNA. 27 patients (45%) had the presence of HPV DNA, out of which 23 had only LR-HPV and 1 had only HR-HPV types. Three patients had both HR-HPV and LR-HPV subtypes. There was a significant difference between the cases and controls for the presence of HPV DNA (p < 0.001). However, the patients with HPV-positive DNA in the nasal specimen did not differ significantly from HPV-negative patients in age, gender, or severity of the disease. Conclusions: Human papillomaviruses may play a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of CRSwNP, however, do not impact the degree of sinus involvement.

AB  - This study describes the clinical, biochemical, and molecular characteristics of Indian children with 46,XY DSD and suspected androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). Fifty children (median age 3.0 years, range 0-16.5 years) with 46,XY DSD and a suspected diagnosis of AIS were enrolled. Sanger sequencing was performed to identify pathogenic variants in the androgen receptor (AR) gene and to study genotype-phenotype correlations. All 5 (100%) patients with CAIS and 14/45 (31%) patients with PAIS had pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the AR gene (overall, 14 different variants in 19 patients; 38.8%). There was no significant difference in clinical (cryptorchidism, hypospadias, or external masculinizing score) or biochemical parameters (gonadotropins and testosterone) between patients with or without pathogenic variants. However, patients with AIS were more likely to have a positive family history, be assigned female gender at birth, and present with gynaecomastia at puberty. Three novel pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, including one splice donor site variant c.2318+1G>A, one frameshift variant p.H790Lfs*40, and one missense variant p.G821E, were identified in 3 patients with CAIS. The missense variant p.G821E was predicted as deleterious, damaging, disease-causing, and likely functionally inactive by in silico analysis and protein modelling study. Two previously not reported pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, including p.R386H and p.G396R, were identified in patients with PAIS. This study contributes in expanding the spectrum of pathogenic variants in the AR gene in patients with AIS. Only 31% patients with a provisional diagnosis of PAIS had pathogenic variants in the AR gene, suggesting other possible mechanisms or candidate genes may be responsible for such a phenotypic presentation.

AB  - Introduction Wilms tumor is the most common renal malignancy in children and difficult to differentiate from other paediatric abdominal tumors radiologically, necessitating an invasive procedure for diagnosis. Previous studies have shown the potential role of miRNA as biomarkers for diagnosis, histological subtyping and prognosis. In this study, we are exploring the role of miRNA in the histological subtyping of Wilms tumor in the Indian population. Materials and methods A total of 15 cases of Wilms tumor were evaluated for global miRNA expression analysis by microarray. Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen tumor and miRNA expression analysis was performed using Agilent platform. Unsupervised clustering was done to analyse the data. Results Using unpaired student T test, top 10 significantly differentially expressed miRNA were selected which could differentiate among different histological subtypes by unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. The presence of necrosis, heterologous differentiation led to change in miRNA expression profile and led to a distinct cluster formation. Conclusions A panel of 5 miRNAs (miR1, 133b, 299-3p, 499a-5p, 491-3p) could differentiate among different histological subtypes of Wilms tumor, thus avoiding an invasive procedure in children, however, further confirmation using real time PCR analysis will be needed.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early phase of cognitive decline signalling the beginning of severe neurological diseases. Carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) has shown some correlation with MCI development. This study was conducted to investigate the impact of elevated cIMT on the risk of MCI in adults. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Google Scholar and CINAHL databases till 30 July 2021, with keywords: ('Carotid Intima-Media Thickness' OR 'cIMT' OR 'IMT' AND 'Cognitive Impairment' OR 'Cognition' OR 'Cognitive Decline' AND 'Mild Cognitive Impairment' OR 'MCI'). Pooled standardized mean difference (SMD)/odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were determined for factor-disease association using either fixed (when I-2 <50%) or random effect (when I-2 >50%) models. Eight studies involving 1,585 MCI cases and 6,700 normal subjects were included in our meta-analysis which showed no significant association of increased cIMT with the risk of MCI [SMD 1.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 2.42]. However, sensitivity analysis revealed an outlier study significantly affecting the effect size. On omitting the outlier study, the re-evaluated meta-analysis revealed a significant association of cIMT with the risk of MCI [SMD 0.52, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78]. This significant association was also observed during subgroup analysis in Caucasian population [SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.18] but not in Asian population [SMD 0.39, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.79]. Elevated cIMT poses a potential risk for MCI. However, more population-based studies are required to corroborate these findings.

AB  - Background: The neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLR) has emerged as a potential prognostic tool for different diseases. In the current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the NLR may be a useful tool for risk scarification and the optimal utilization of limited healthcare resources. However, there is no consensus regarding the optimal value of NLR, and the association with disease severity and mortality. Thus, this study aims to systematically analyze the current evidence of the utility of baseline NLR as a predictive tool for mortality, disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Methods: A compendious screening of electronic databases up to June 15, 2021, was done after enlisting the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42020202659). Studies evaluating the utility of baseline NLR in COVID-19 are included for this review as per the PRISMA statement. Results: We retrieved a total of 13112 and 12986 COVID-19 patients for survivability and severity over 90 studies. The expired and critically sick patients had elevated baseline NLR on admission, in comparison to survivors and noncritical patients. (SMD = 3.82; 95% CI: 2.79-4.85; I-2 = 100% and SMD = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.22-1.63; I-2 = 95%, respectively). The summary receiver operating curve analysis for mortality (AUC = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.86-0.87; I-2 = 94.7%), and severity (AUC = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.80-0.84; I-2 = 79.7%) were also suggestive of its significant predictive value. Conclusions: The elevated NLR on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with poor outcomes.

AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains of Candida albicans has become a global threat mostly due to co-infection with immune-compromised patients leading to invasive candidiasis. The life-threatening form of the disease can be managed quickly and effectively by drug repurposing. Thus, the study used in silico approaches to evaluate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs against three drug targets-TRR1, TOM40, and YHB1. The tertiary structures of three drug targets were modeled, refined, and evaluated for their structural integrity based on PROCHECK, ERRAT, and PROSA. High-throughput virtual screening of FDA-approved drugs (8815), interaction analysis, and energy profiles had revealed that DB01102 (Arbutamine), DB01611 (Hydroxychloroquine), and DB09319 (Carindacillin) exhibited better binding affinity with TRR1, TOM40, and YHB1, respectively. Notably, the molecular dynamic simulation explored that Gln45, Thr119, and Asp288 of TRR1; Thr107 and Ser121 of TOM40; Arg193, Glu213, and Ser228 of YHB1 are crucial residues for stable drug-target interaction. Additionally, it also prioritized Arbutamine-TRR1 as the best drug-target complex based on MM-PBSA (-52.72 kcal/mol), RMSD (2.43 angstrom), and radius of gyration (-21.49 angstrom) analysis. In-depth, PCA results supported the findings of molecular dynamic simulations. Interestingly, the conserved region (>70%) among the TRR1 sequences from pathogenic Candida species indicated the effectiveness of Arbutamine against multiple species of Candida as well. Thus, the study dispenses new insight and enriches the understanding of developing an advanced technique to consider potential antifungals against C. albicans. Nonetheless, a detailed experimental validation is needed to investigate the efficacy of Arbutamin against life-threatening candidiasis.

AB  - Background Several studies have reported short and medium-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) in patients with class I obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, literature on outcomes beyond three years is scarce. The present study discusses the 5-year results of a previously reported cohort of 20 patients with class I obesity and T2DM, who had undergone LSG between March 2012 and March 2015.
   Materials and Methods Patients were followed up in the bariatric clinic at yearly intervals as per institute protocol. Primary outcome was proportion of patients with a glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level of 6.5% or less, 5 years after LSG. Secondary outcomes were percentage total weight loss (%TWL), excess weight loss (EWL), weight regain and complications.
   Results Out of 20 patients, 9 (45%) were male and 11 (55%) were female. Mean age was 41.6 +/- 9.5 years. Mean pre-operative weight and BMI were 94.8 +/- 14.4 kg and 33.4 +/- 1.2 kg/m(2), respectively. Median duration of diabetes was 42 months. Mean pre-operative fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and HbA1c were 171.1 +/- 56.8 mg/dL and 8.7 +/- 1.6%, respectively. Of the 17 patients available for follow-up at 5 years, 9 (52.9%) achieved HbA1c < 6.5% without medication, while 7 (41.2%) patients had improvement of their glycaemic status. One patient had recurrence of diabetes after initial remission. Mean %TWL and %EWL were 18% and 65.1%, respectively.
   Conclusion Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is a reasonable option as a metabolic procedure for patients with T2DM and class I obesity.

AB  - To study the clinical, laboratory characteristics and outcomes of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) temporally related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a resource-limited setting. All children meeting the World Health Organization case definition of MIS-C were prospectively enrolled. Baseline clinical and laboratory parameters were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Enrolled subjects were followed up for 4-6 weeks for evaluation of cardiac outcomes using echocardiography. The statistical data were analyzed using the stata-12 software. Thirty-one children with MIS-C were enrolled in an 11-month period. Twelve children had preexisting chronic systemic comorbidity. Fever was a universal finding; gastrointestinal and respiratory manifestations were noted in 70.9% and 64.3%, respectively, while 57.1% had a skin rash. Fifty-eight percent of children presented with shock, and 22.5% required mechanical ventilation. HSP like rash, gangrene and arthritis were uncommon clinical observations.The median duration of hospital stay was 9 (6.5-18.5) days: four children with preexisting comorbidities succumbed to the illness. The serum ferritin levels (ng/ml) [median (IQR)] were significantly higher in non-survivors as compared to survivors [1061 (581, 2750) vs 309.5 (140, 720.08), p value = 0.045]. Six patients had coronary artery involvement; five recovered during follow-up, while one was still admitted. Twenty-six children received immunomodulatory drugs, and five improved without immunomodulation. The choice of immunomodulation (steroids or intravenous immunoglobulin) did not affect the outcome. Most children with MIS-C present with acute hemodynamic and respiratory symptoms.The outcome is favorable in children without preexisting comorbidities.Raised ferritin level may be a poor prognostic marker. The coronary outcomes at follow-up were reassuring.

AB  - Objective Several factors have been suggested to mediate pain in patients with chronic pancreatitis. However, it is unknown whether these factors are overlapping and if they have cumulative effects on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).
   Design We performed a multicentre cross-sectional study of 201 prospectively enrolled subjects with definitive chronic pancreatitis. All subjects underwent evaluation for pancreatic duct obstruction, abnormalities in pain processing using quantitative sensory testing, and screening for psychological distress (anxiety, depression and pain catastrophising) based on validated questionnaires. Abnormality was defined by normal reference values. PROs included pain symptom severity (Brief Pain Inventory short form) and quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire). Associations between pain-related factors and PROs were investigated by linear trend analyses, multiple regression models and mediation analyses.
   Results Clinical evaluation suggestive of pancreatic duct obstruction was observed in 29%, abnormal pain processing in 23%, anxiety in 47%, depression in 39% and pain catastrophising in 28%; each of these factors was associated with severity of at least one PRO. Two or more factors were present in 51% of subjects. With an increasing number of factors, there was an increase in pain severity scores (p<0.001) and pain interference scores (p<0.001), and a reduction in quality of life (p<0.001). All factors had independent and direct effects on PROs with the strongest effect size observed for psychological distress.
   Conclusion Pain-related factors in chronic pancreatitis are often present in an overlapping manner and have a cumulative detrimental effect on PROs. These findings support a multidisciplinary strategy for pain management.

AB  - Bronchial artery (BA) pseudoaneurysm is an uncommon vascular complication of tuberculosis (TB), and early diagnosis is crucial due to risk of rupture and life-threatening hemorrhage. Immediate intervention is warranted in massive hemoptysis due to high mortality. Various causes of massive hemoptysis are TB, bronchiectasis, aspergilloma, lung abscess, lung cancer, necrotizing pneumonia, and cystic fibrosis. Active pulmonary TB as well as chronic pulmonary TB can manifest with massive hemoptysis. Hemoptysis in active TB occurs due to ulceration in bronchiolar wall, eroding the wall of the adjacent BA or pulmonary artery, and in chronic TB due to hypertrophied bronchial arteries, or bronchiectasis, or aspergilloma. Herein, we report a case of pulmonary TB causing intrapulmonary BA pseudoaneurysm in a young male patient who presented with acute massive hemoptysis. The BA pseudoaneurysm as well as other hypertrophied bronchial arteries were embolized using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles.

AB  - Introduction/Aims Corticosteroids prolong ambulation and improve muscle power among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, the optimal steroid regimen remains unclear. Hence, this study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of daily- versus intermittent-steroid regimens in ambulatory boys with DMD. Methods In this single-center, open-label randomized trial, 72 children were randomized to receive either daily prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day) or intermittent prednisolone (0.75 mg/kg/day, for first 10 days of every month). The primary outcome measure was the difference in average score on manual muscle testing (MMT) at baseline and after 6 mo of steroids. A difference of >0.2 was hypothesized to be significant. Secondary outcomes included changes in timed functions, muscular dystrophy-specific functional-rating scale score, peak torque, average power, and pulmonary function. Results In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean (SD) change in MMT scores was 0.17 (0.15) and 0.08 (0.10) for the daily and intermittent steroid groups, respectively. The mean difference between the two interventions was 0.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.04-0.16; P = .003), which although significant was less than the predefined value of 0.2. Statistically significantly improvements were observed with daily-steroid regimen in the Gowers time (P = .01), nine-metre walk test (P = .02) and average power (P = .02) as compared to intermittent-steroid regimen. A total of 19/32 (52.8%) children in the daily-steroid group and 8/29 (27%) children in the intermittent-steroid group experienced some form of adverse effect (P = .02). Discussion Over a short-term period, the intermittent-steroid regimen was non-inferior to the daily-steroid regime in preserving muscle strength among children with DMD. However, better improvement of functional measures was observed with daily-steroid administration. The frequency of individual side effects was similar between the two groups.

AB  - Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, public health measures to encourage social distancing have been implemented, including cancellation of outdoor activities, organized sports, and schools/colleges. Neglected hindfoot fractures have emerged as a consequence with increased frequency. Similarly, complex ankle and pilon fractures that require staged management, prolonged hospital stay, and soft-tissue care have emerged as a potential concern as prolonged exposure to healthcare setting adds to risk of acquiring as well as transmitting COVID-19 infection. The authors present their experience with expanding these indications for hindfoot arthrodesis as they encounter a greater number of neglected ankle and hindfoot trauma. Methods This was a retrospective observational study of collected data from the trauma unit of our hospital. Inclusion criteria included all trauma classified by the AO/OTA as occurring at locations 43, and who underwent subtalar and ankle arthrodesis. This included distal tibia, malleolar, talus, and calcaneus fractures. These patients were followed up to at least 6 months till complete fracture union. Results A total of 18 patients underwent arthrodesis of either the ankle or subtalar joint between March and October 2020. Mean age of patients undergoing arthrodesis of the hindfoot was 69.2 years (43-84 years). Indications for the procedure included Displaced and comminuted intra-articular distal tibia fractures in elderly (6 patients), Malunited ankle fractures (2 patients), Neglected Ankle fractures managed conservatively (3 patients), Calcaneus fractures (5 patients), and neglected Talus body fracture (2 patients). All patients were followed up to at least 6 months and everyone went onto successful painless union between 3 and 6 months of the arthrodesis procedure without any significant complications. Conclusion In summary, COVID-19 pandemic has led to a change in paradigm of trauma management and foot and ankle management is no different than other musculoskeletal trauma systems. The authors propose an expansion of indications for hindfoot arthrodesis in managing complex hindfoot trauma in pandemic situation.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
AB  - For the young breast cancer population in India, the burden of hereditary breast cancer is not well defined. Moreover, genetic testing criteria (National Comprehensive Cancer Network and Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics (MCG) plus) have never been validated for the Indian population. Therefore, this study tested 236 consecutive breast cancer patients for germline pathogenic mutations using next-generation sequencing and reflex Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification (MLPA). The findings showed a high prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations (18.64%), with 34% mutations in non BRCA genes. The sensitivity of the testing criteria was inadequate (88.6% for NCCN and 86.36% for MCG plus criteria), reiterating the need to expand the criteria. The uptake of cascade testing was low (10% of eligible previvors), highlighting this as an area of unmet need. Multicentric studies to validate these data and provide further insight into the hereditary cancer burden in India are the need of the hour.

AB  - Purpose We planned this prospective study to evaluate PSMA expression in recurrent high-grade gliomas (rHGG), including anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma using Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)-[Ga-68 (HBED-CC)]- (Ga-68 PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET), with its theranostic potential in mind. Methods This was a prospective study enrolling patients with clinical and MRI evidence of rHGG on follow-up. Three treated cases of HGG with RN on MRI were also included as negative controls. Abnormal tracer accumulation in the brain parenchyma, more than the contralateral hemisphere was interpreted as positive study. For semiquantitative analysis, a 3D spherical region of interest (ROI) was drawn around the site of the abnormal Ga-68 PSMA uptake, and the ratio of SUVmax of tumor (T) to SUVmax of the contralateral corresponding area (TBR) was calculated. Each patients' PSMA brain PET was fused to the corresponding MRI and reviewed for concordance. Results Thirty patients were included in the study, a total of 49 lesions were detected on MRI, and fused PET/MR images showed increased Ga-68 PSMA uptake in all these lesions. Multifocal lesions were better appreciated on fused PET-MR images, and concordance between MRI and PET was 100 % for patient and lesion-wise detection. Recurrent glioma lesions showed SUVmax and SUVmean values (median and IQR) 6.0 (4.4-8.2) and 3.3 (2.8-3.7), respectively. Lesions labeled as radiation necrosis on MRI did not show tracer accumulation. Conclusion Ga-68 PSMA has potential utility for evaluating recurrence in HGG and its potential for theranostics would encourage its use in the evaluation of these patients.

AB  - Objectives The lateralised vocal fold of unilateral vocal fold paralysis (ULVFP) is unphysiological for expiration wherein vocal folds normally adduct to increase expiratory resistance and prevent small airway collapse. ULVFP may therefore impair ventilatory function and ventilatory volume. This study seeks to test whether vocal fold medialisation improves forced vital capacity (FVC). Design Prospective inception cohort intervention study. Setting Academic Tertiary Care Institution. Participants Twenty-five patients of ULVFP with a phonatory gap ranging from 2 to 6 mm. Main outcome measures Vocal fold medialisation was undertaken with autologous fat injection. Forced vital capacity (FVC) assessments by spirometry were undertaken pre-treatment and 1-month post-treatment. Results Improvement in FVC was noted in all patients with the quantum of improvement ranging from 0.1 to 0.6 litres. Mean FVC improved from 3.10 L pre-injection to 3.45 L post-injection. (p < .001). A moderate correlation was noted between the degree of medialisation and improvement in FVC (r = .33, Pearson's correlation coefficient). Conclusions Objective improvement in FVC is consistently noted in post vocal fold medialisation for ULVFP and is probably mediated by increased glottic expiratory resistance and consequent improvement in intrinsic PEEP.

AB  - A study from rural northern India shows a 6.4% prevalence of myopia, a strong inverse association with time spent outdoors, higher prevalence in privately funded schools and 75% unmet need of spectacles.
   Background To assess the prevalence of myopia and its risk factors in rural school children. Methods Children in classes 4-7 of eight randomly selected schools (five government and three private) in rural Haryana, with unaided vision <6/9.5 were screened, their cycloplegic refraction is done, myopes were identified. A questionnaire-based assessment of risk factors was done for myopes and compared with 10% of randomly selected children with normal vision (controls). The prevalence of myopia and its association with risk factors were assessed. Results Children screened were 1486 (89.5% coverage). The mean age of children was 11.2 +/- 1.5 years with 861 (57.9%) boys. Prevalence of myopia was 6.4% (95% Confidence intervals [CI]: 5.2%, 7.8%). Prevalence was higher among private schools (10.1%) compared to government schools (1.4%) (p < 0.001), and among girls 7.2% (45/625) compared to boys 5.8% (50/861) (p = 0.2786). The mean spherical equivalent refractive error was -1.61D +/- 1.32D. The prevalence of high myopia was 1.1% (1/95). There was a 75% unmet need for spectacles. Studying in private school was positively associated with myopia as per our multivariate analysis (p = 0.016). An inverse association was found for time spent outdoors (p = 0.009). Watching television, indoor time, screen time, age, or gender were not found to be statistically significant as risk factors. Conclusion The prevalence of myopia is increasing among children of rural areas, especially those in private schools with a strong inverse association with time spent outdoors. Regular screening, lifestyle modification and awareness about modifiable risk factors are essential.

KW  - PHOTOGRAPHY
AB  - Background Regular screening for retinopathy and timely intervention reduces blindness from diabetes by 90%. Screening is currently dependent on the interpretation of images captured by trained technicians. Inherent barriers of accessibility and affordability with this approach impede widespread success of retinopathy screening programs. Herein, we report our observations on the potential of a novel approach, Selfie Fundus Imaging (SFI), to enhance diabetic retinopathy screening. Methods The study was undertaken over a two-month period during COVID 19 lockdown. 60 diabetic patients participated in the study. Retinal images were captured using three different approaches, handheld smartphone-based photographs captured by patients themselves after a short video-assisted training session (SFI group), and smartphone-based photographs captured by a trained technician and photographs taken on desktop conventional digital fundus camera (Gold standard). Sensitivity and kappa statistics was determined for retinopathy and macular oedema grading. Findings Mean age of the study participants was 52.4 years +/- 9.8 years and 78% were men. Of 120 images captured using SFI, 90% were centred-gradable, 8% were decentred-gradable and 2% were ungradable. 82% patients captured the image within a minute (majority by 31-45 s). The sensitivity of SFI to detect diabetic retinopathy was 88.39%. Agreement between SFI grading and standard fundus photograph grading was 85.86% with substantial kappa (0.77). For the detection of diabetic macular oedema, the agreement between SFI images and standard images was 93.67, with almost perfect kappa (0.91). Conclusion Fundus images were captured by patients using SFI without major difficulty and were comparable to images taken by trained specialist. With greater penetrance, advances, and availability of mobile photographic technology, we believe that SFI would positively impact the success of diabetic retinopathy screening programs by breaking the barriers of availability, accessibility, and affordability. SFI could ensure continuation of screening schedules for diabetic retinopathy, even in the face a highly contagious pandemic.

AB  - Objective We studied the rate of remission of LN in an international cohort of 248 children and adolescents with biopsy-proven LN. Five different definitions from scientific studies and the definitions recommended by the ACR and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes were used. Methods Anonymized clinical data in patients with biopsy-proven LN class >= III (International Society of Nephrology/Royal Pathology Society) diagnosed and treated in the last 10 years in 23 international centres from 10 countries were collected. We compared the rate of patients in complete and partial remission applying the different definitions. Results The mean age at diagnosis was 11 years and 4 months, and 177 were females. The number of patients in complete and partial remission varied a great deal between the different definitions. At 24 months, between 50% and 78.8% of the patients were in full remission as defined by the different criteria. The number of patients in partial remission was low, between 2.3% and 25%. No difference in achieved remission was found between boys and girls or between children and adolescents (P > 0.05). Patients with East Asian ethnicity reached remission more often than other ethnicities (P = 0.03-0.0008). Patients treated in high-income countries showed a higher percentage of complete remission at 12 and 24 months (P = 0.002-0.000001). Conclusion The rate of children and adolescents with LN achieving remission varied hugely with the definition used. Our results give important information for long-awaited treatment studies in children and young people.

AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led the Indian government to announce a nationwide lockdown on March 23, 2020. This study aimed to explore the impact of the pandemic on the accessibility of care for children with cancer and to view strategies adopted by hospitals for service delivery. Methods Weekly average of childhood cancer (<= 18 years) patient registrations during pre-lockdown period (January 1 to March 23, 2020) were compared with post-lockdown period (March 24 to May 31, 2020). The effect on the scheduled treatment was investigated for post-lockdown period. A survey of health care providers was conducted to determine centers' adopted strategies. Results In 30 participating centers, 1146 patients with childhood cancer (797 pre-lockdown period and 349 post-lockdown period) were registered. The weekly average registration was 67.3 and 35.5 patients during pre-lockdown and post-lockdown respectively (decline of 47.9%). Although most centers experienced this decline, there were 4 that saw an increase in patient registrations. The distribution of patients registered post-lockdown was found significantly different by age (lesser older age, P = .010) and distance (lesser travel distance, P = .001). 36.1% of patients, who were scheduled for any of the treatment modalities (chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) during the post-lockdown period, experienced delays. Centers adopted several strategies including modifications to treatment protocols, increased use of growth factors, and increased support from social organizations. Conclusions This multicenter study from India suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown impacted 2 out of 3 children with cancer. The effect of this on survival is yet to be established.

AB  - Haemoglobin (Hb) has well-documented inflammatory effects and is normally efficiently scavenged; clearance mechanisms can be overwhelmed during erythrocyte lysis. Whether Hb is preferentially inflammatory in lupus and triggers broad anti-self responses was assessed. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from SLE patients secreted higher levels of lupus-associated inflammatory cytokines when incubated with human Hb than did PBMCs derived from healthy donors, an effect negated by haptoglobin. Ferric murine Hb triggered the preferential release of lupus-associated cytokines from splenocytes, B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells isolated from ageing, lupus-prone NZM2410 mice, and also had mitogenic effects on B cells. Pull-downs, followed by mass spectrometry, revealed interactions of Hb with several lupus-associated autoantigens; co-incubation of ferric Hb with apoptotic blebs (structures that contain packaged autoantigens) revealed synergies-in terms of cytokine release and autoantibody production in vitro-that were also restricted to the lupus genotype. Murine ferric Hb activated multiple signalling pathways and, in combination with apoptotic blebs, preferentially triggered MAP kinase signalling specifically in splenocytes isolated from lupus-prone mice. Infusion of murine ferric Hb into lupus-prone mice led to enhanced release of lupus-associated cytokines, the generation of a spectrum of autoantibodies and enhanced-onset glomerulosclerosis. Given that the biased recognition of ferric Hb in a lupus milieu, possibly in concert with lupus-associated autoantigens, triggers inflammatory responses and the generation of lupus-associated cytokines, and also stimulates the generation of potentially pathogenic lupus-associated autoantibodies, neutralization of Hb could have beneficial effects.

AB  - Background: Surgical trainees often resort to operative videos on the internet during preparation for surgery; YouTube is the most commonly explored video source by them. However, the quality of these videos is often questioned. This study was performed to assess the quality of available YouTube videos on laparoscopic pyloromyotomy (LP).
   Materials and Methods: The term "laparoscopic pyloromyotomy" was searched on YouTube on June 2, 2021, and 20 most-viewed videos on LP were included. A reference video on LP from WebSurg was also selected. The laparoscopic surgery video educational guidelines (LAP-VEGaS) tool was utilized for quality assessment of these videos. Descriptive variables, including the surgeon's details; year of video upload; duration of the video; view, like, and dislike counts; number of ports used; and instruments used for pyloromyotomy, were recorded and their relationship with video quality was studied.
   Results: The majority of videos were from the United States and India, and a surgeon could be identified in 90% of them. The median (range) video duration and view, like, and dislike counts were 2.89 (0.68-8.80) minutes, 2308 (1102-23,682), 5 (0-59), and 0 (0-11), respectively. The LAP-VEGaS score of the reference video was 17. In contrast, the scores of YouTube videos ranged from 1 to 14. The quality of these videos was poor in 5/9 domains. None of the descriptive variables showed a significant association with high video quality.
   Conclusion: Compared with the reference video, the overall quality of YouTube videos on LP was poor. Therefore, until a screening tool is available for selection of high-quality YouTube videos, trainees must resort to peer-reviewed video platforms.

AB  - Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) regulate cell fate during development and mediate cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the role of BMP4 in proliferation, anoikis resistance, metastatic migration, and drug resistance of breast cancer cells. We utilized breast cancer cell lines and clinical samples representing different subtypes to understand the functional effect of BMP4 on breast cancer. The BMP pathway was inhibited with the small molecule inhibitor LDN193189 hydrochloride (LDN). BMP4 signaling enhanced the expression of stem cell genes CD44, ALDH1A3, anti-apoptotic gene BCL2 and promoted anoikis resistance in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. BMP4 enhanced self-renewal and chemoresistance in MDA-MB-231 by upregulating Notch signaling while LDN treatment abrogated anoikis resistance and proliferation of anoikis resistant breast cancer cells in the osteogenic microenvironment. Conversely, BMP4 downregulated proliferation, colony-forming ability, and suppressed anoikis resistance in MCF7 and SkBR3 cells, while LDN treatment promoted tumor spheroid formation and growth. These findings indicate that BMP4 has a context-dependent role in breast cancer. Further, our data with MDA-MB-231 cells representing triple-negative breast cancer suggest that BMP inhibition might impair its metastatic spread and colonization.

AB  - Background Reconstruction following resection of sarcomas of the upper extremity with methods described in the prevalent literature may not be possible in few selected cases. We describe surgical phocomelia or phoco-reduction as a method of limb salvage in such cases of extensive sarcomas of the upper limb with its functional and oncological outcomes. Methods Evaluation of functional and oncological outcomes was performed for 11 patients who underwent surgical phocomelia or phoco-reduction for extensive sarcomas of the upper limb between 2010 and 2019. Results The mean follow-up period in the study was 27.8 months. Five patients required a segmental resection including the entire humerus while six patients underwent segmental resection around the elbow with a mean resection length of 21.5 cm. Mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 score was 22 depicting a good functional outcome. Mean handgrip strength on the operated side was 62% of the contralateral side with preservation of useful hand function. Meantime to humeroulnar union was 6.7 months. Radial nerve palsy and implant failure occurred in one patient each. No patient developed local recurrence while three patients died of metastasis. Conclusion Surgical phocomelia is a prudent alternative to severely incapacitating amputations in situations where other reconstruction methods are not feasible.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The plant, Calotropis procera, has been used for treating various gastrointestinal disorders and cancer. Some of these medicinal properties have been attributed to the latex produced by the plant.
   Aim of the study: To evaluate the efficacy of methanol extract of air-dried latex (MeDL) of C. procera in the rat model of colorectal cancer (CRC).
   Materials and methods: CRC was induced in the rats by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) and the effect of MeDL was evaluated at two doses (50 and 150 mg/kg). MeDL and reference drug aspirin (60 mg/kg) were administered orally starting from 1 h before injecting DMH till 8 weeks after the second dose of DMH. The study also included experimental and normal control groups. Microscopic analysis was carried out to determine the count for aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and histology score whereas enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunohistochemical analyses were performed for markers of carcinogenesis and angiogenesis. Other parameters that were evaluated include deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fragmentation, laddering, Bcl(2) and Bax immunoreactivity, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) positivity.
   Results: Subcutaneous injection of DMH induced pre-neoplastic changes in the colon of rats with the appearance of ACF with multiple crypts (1-3, 4-6 or >6). In the experimental control group, total ACF count was 3.49 +/- 0.23/cm of the colon length and the median histology score was 2.0 for architectural abnormalities, 2.0 for dilatation of crypts and 1.5 for hyperplasia/dysplasia against 1.0 for all the characteristics in normal rats. Oral administration of MeDL similar to aspirin, led to a reduction in ACF count and histology score of CRC concomitant with a decrease in the levels of markers of carcinogenesis-beta-catenin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA); markers of angiogenesis-matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and an increase in apoptotic DNA fragmentation.
   Conclusion: MeDL confers protection in the rat model of CRC and the study suggests its therapeutic potential in this condition.

AB  - Background The burden of hereditary breast cancer in India is not well defined. Moreover, genetic testing criteria (National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN] and Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics [MCG] Plus) have never been validated in the Indian population. Methods All new female breast cancer patients from 1st March 2019 to 28th February 2020 were screened. Those providing informed consent and without previous genetic testing were recruited. Multigene panel testing (107 genes) by next-generation sequencing was performed for all patients. The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations between patients qualifying and not qualifying the testing criteria was compared and their sensitivity was computed. Results Overall, 275 breast cancer patients were screened and 236 patients were included (median age 45 years); 30 patients did not consent and 9 patients previously underwent genetic testing. Thirty-four (14%) women had a positive family history and 35% had triple-negative breast cancer. P/LP mutations were found in 44/236 (18.64%) women; mutations in BRCA1 (22/47, 46.8%) and BRCA2 (9/47, 19.1%) were the most common, with 34% of mutations present in non-BRCA genes. Patients qualifying the testing criteria had a higher risk of having a P/LP mutation (NCCN: 23.6% vs. 7.04%, p = 0.03; MCG plus: 24.8% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.01). The sensitivity of the NCCN criteria was 88.6% (75.4-96.2) and 86.36% (72.65-94.83) for MCG plus. More than 95% sensitivity was achieved if all women up to 60 years of age were tested. Cascade testing was performed in 31 previous (16/44 families), with 23 testing positive. Conclusions The frequency of P/LP mutations in India is high, with significant contribution of non-BRCA genes. Testing criteria need modification to expand access to testing.

AB  - Constant oxygen supply is inevitable for cardiac tissue function and survival. Myocardial infarction (MI) leaves heart tissue in a state of oxygen deficiency, causing oxidative stress and irreversible death of cardiomyocytes. Although vital in treating MI, restoration of oxygen supply and attenuation of oxidative stress has not been successfully utilized as a therapeutic strategy. Herein, we developed and evaluated an oxygen releasing antioxidant nanofibrous bi-layered cardiac patch (PUAO-CPO-Collagen) supplemented with adipose derived stem cell exosomes (ADSC-EXO) to promote heart repair. Antioxidant polyurethane was synthesised and calcium peroxide (CPO) was incorporated as an oxygen releasing material. The bilayered cardiac patch consists of an oxygen releasing antioxidant polyurethane, electrospun over a porous collagen scaffold and supplemented with adipose derived stem cell exosomes. The patch demonstrated sustained release of oxygen and exosomes. Under in-vitro conditions, bilayered patch and ADSC exosomes illustrated proliferative, pro-angiogenic and pro-survival effect. In an in-vivo rat MI model, the bi-layered patch demonstrated enhanced cardiac function, reduced scar formation, significantly attenuating adverse cardiac remodelling through improved angiogenesis and decreased oxidative stress. Our study demonstrated an innovative and promising cell free biomaterial approach for delivering oxygen, promoting angiogenesis, and attenuating oxidative stress for enhanced heart regeneration after myocardial infarction.

AB  - Aim To report on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values among individuals with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) at different age groups, using data acquired from a large national survey in India. Materials and methods Data on glycaemic parameters at different age groups were obtained from the Indian Council of Medical Research-INdia DIABetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study, in adults aged >= 20 years representing all parts of India. Age-wise distribution of HbA1c was assessed among individuals with NGT (n = 14,222) confirmed by an oral glucose tolerance test using the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Results were validated in another large epidemiological study (n = 1077) conducted in Chennai, India. Results Among NGT individuals, HbA1c increased gradually with age from 5.16 +/- 0.71% (33 mmol/mol) in the age group of 20-29 years to 5.49 +/- 0.69% (37 mmol/mol) in those aged 70 + years. In the validation study, conducted in another study population, HbA1c was 5.35 +/- 0.43% (35 mmol/mol) in age group of 20-29 years and 5.74 +/- 0.50% (39 mmol/mol) in those aged 70 and above. In the INDIAB study, for every decadal increase in age, there is a 0.08% increase in HbA1c and this increase was more significant in females (females: 0.10% vs. males: 0.06%) and in urban (urban: 0.10% vs. rural: 0.08%) population. Conclusions HbA1c levels increase steadily with age. This suggests that age-specific cutoffs be used while utilizing HbA1c to diagnose diabetes and prediabetes, so as to minimize the risk of overdiagnosis and unnecessary initiation of treatment in elderly people who could have physiological increase in HbA1c levels.

AB  - Objective To study the effects of myoinositol (Myo) in comparison to metformin (Met), in reducing the risk of OHSS and improving ART outcome in PCOS women undergoing IVF. Design Double-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2018/05/014196). Setting ART Clinic, AIIMS, New Delhi patients: 102 infertile PCOS women undergoing IVF cycles were enrolled after evaluating for eligibility and allotted as 50 in group 1 (Myo) and 52 in group 2 (Met) after randomization. Interventions Recruited patients received Myo 2 g twice daily (group 1) and Met 850 mg twice daily (group 2). Pre- and post-treatment clinical (menstrual pattern, BMI), hormonal profile (LH, FSH, testosterone, prolactin [PRL], and AMH), biochemical parameters (HOMA IR, fasting glucose, and insulin), ovarian with antral follicle count (AFC) and side effect profile were assessed. After 3 months of therapy, patients were recruited for IVF cycle by antagonist protocol was involving controlled ovarian stimulation, cycle monitoring, oocyte recovery, insemination of oocytes and follow up with fertilization, cleavage, transfer of good grade cleavage embryos, or blastocysts pregnancy outcomes and OHSS incidence and medications was continued until the day of OPU. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was OHSS and clinical pregnancy rate including spontaneous, IVF, and cumulative pregnancy rate including FET. Secondary outcome was ART outcomes and the change in biochemistry and hormonal profile between groups and inter group after medications at 12 weeks. Results Incidence of OHSS (Myo 5 (10.0) (n = 50), Met 10 (20.0) (n = 50) p .07) was not statistically different between groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (Myo 18 (36.0) (n = 50), Met 9 (18.0) (n = 50) p .04) cumulative pregnancy rate including FET (Myo 16 (43.2) (n = 37) vs. Met 10) 22.7) (n = 44) p .05) and spontaneous conception (prior to IVF) Myo 13 (26.0) (n = 50), Met 6 (12.0) (n = 50) p .07) was significantly high in Myo group. No between group difference in ovarian stimulation outcomes including duration and dosage of gonadotropins, E2, P4 levels, number of follicles >14 mm on day of trigger. Number of oocytes retrieved and grade of maturity were similar between groups. Fertilization, cleavage and number of good grade embryos were significantly higher in Myo group. However, implantation rate and number of embryos for freezing were similar between groups. Myo had improvement in fasting insulin, HOMA, Sr.AMH, and SHBG suggesting decreased insulin resistance Conclusions Myo is equally beneficial as Met in reducing the risk of OHSS and has better ART outcome in PCOS women undergoing antagonist cycles.

AB  - Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the chief cause of renal involvement in diabetic patients. It is primarily a clinical diagnosis. Non-diabetic kidney disease (NDKD) may be missed if they are not biopsied. In this study, we describe the spectrum of NDKD and evaluate the predictors considered for planning a biopsy in diabetic patients with kidney disease. Methods In a retrospective cohort study, diabetic patients who underwent kidney biopsy at our centre between May 2006 and July 2019 were evaluated for NDKD. Results 321 diabetic patients who underwent kidney biopsy were analyzed. Mean age was 49.3 +/- 12.4 years and 71% were males. 75.8% patients had hypertension and 25.2% had diabetic retinopathy. Based on the kidney biopsy, patients were classified as DKD-127 (39.6%), NDKD-179(55.8%) and combined DKD + NDKD-15(4.7%). Overall, the most commonly diagnosed pathology was membranous nephropathy-MN (17%), followed by IgA nephropathy (16.0%) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis-FSGS (14.9%). In patients with DKD + NDKD, IgA nephropathy (53.3%) was predominant. 165 (51.4%) patients had a diagnosis potentially amenable to a specific therapy. On multivariate analysis, female gender [OR 2.07 (1.08-3.97), p = 0.02], absence of diabetic retinopathy [OR 7.47 (3.71-15), p < 0.001] absence of hypertension [OR 3.17 (1.56-6.45), p = 0.001] and duration of diabetes <= 24 months [OR 3.67(1.97-6.84), p < 0.001], were independent predictors for NDKD while the absence of nephrotic range proteinuria [OR 1.73 (0.98-3.05), p 0.05] showed a trend towards significance. Conclusion Astute use of kidney biopsy can detect potentially treatable NDKD in a large number of diabetic patients with glomerular diseases being the predominant diagnosis. A combination of risk factors needs to be considered to guide the need for kidney biopsy in diabetic patients.

AB  - Background Though invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a well known complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, indolent forms of aspergillosis have been rarely described. Methods We prospectively collected the clinico-radio-microbiological data of 10 patients of subacute invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (SAIA), who presented to our hospital with recent history of COVID-19 pneumonia along with cavitary lung disease, positive IgG (against Aspergillus) with or without positive respiratory samples for Aspergillus spp. Result The mean age of presentation of SAIA was 50.7 +/- 11.8 years. All the patients had recently recovered from severe COVID-19 illness with a mean duration of 29.2 +/- 12 days from COVID-19 positivity. Cough was the predominant symptom seen in 8/10 (80%) patients followed by haemoptysis. 7/10 (70%) patients were known diabetic. While serum galactomannan was positive in 5/9 patients (55.5%), fungal culture was positive in 2/7 patients (28.5%) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Aspergillus was positive in three patients. Eight (80%) patients presented with a single cavitary lesion; pseudoaneurysm of pulmonary artery was seen in two patients and post-COVID-19 changes were seen in all patients. All patients were treated with voriconazole, out of which four (40%) patients died during the follow-up period. Conclusion SAIA should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cavitating lung lesions in patients with recent history of COVID-19 in the background of steroid use with or without pre-existing diabetes.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the TOP-PRO-study, a double-blind randomized controlled trial, was to assess the efficacy (non-inferiority) and tolerability of propranolol compared to topiramate for the prevention of chronic migraine.
   Background: Except for topiramate, oral preventive treatment for chronic migraine lacks credible evidence.
   Methods: Chronic migraine patients aged above 18 years and less than 65 years of age, not on any preventive treatment were randomly allocated to receive topiramate (100 mg/day) or propranolol (160 mg/day). The primary efficacy outcome was the mean change in migraine days per 28 days at the end of 24 weeks from baseline. A mean difference of 1.5 days per four weeks was chosen as the cut-off delta value. Multiple secondary efficacy outcomes and treatment emergent adverse events were also assessed.
   Results: As against the planned sample size of 244, only 175 patients could be enrolled before the spread of the corona virus disease-2019 pandemic and enforcement of lockdown in India. Of the 175 randomized patients, 95 (topiramate 46 and propranolol 49) completed the trial. The mean change in migraine days was -5.3 +/- 1.2 vs -7.3 +/- 1.1 days (p = 0.226) for topiramate and propranolol groups respectively. Propranolol was found to be non-inferior and not superior to topiramate (point estimate of -1.99 with a 95% confidence interval of -5.23 to 1.25 days). Multiple secondary outcomes also did not differ between the two groups. Intention to treat analysis of 175 patients and per-protocol analysis of 95 patients yielded concordant results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Propranolol (160mg/day) was non-inferior, non-superior to topiramate (100mg/day) for the preventive treatment of chronic migraine and had a comparable tolerability profile.

AB  - Pediatric handlebar injuries are a separate subset of unintentional injuries that need to be treated with a high degree of suspicion. They can be associated with varying underlying injuries which are often underestimated and cannot be predicted based on the external sign alone, thus leading to delayed diagnosis with missed injuries. In case 1, a 7-year-old boy presented a day after falling from his bicycle. Examination revealed a handlebar sign in the hypogastrium with guarding. Laparotomy revealed a jejunal perforation. In case 2, a 13-year-old boy presented with pain abdomen after being rammed by a bicycle handle. Examination revealed a handlebar sign in the lower part of the abdomen. He did not have any signs of peritonitis and was conservatively managed. In case 3, a 13-year-old boy with a history of fall from a bicycle sustained an abdominal handlebar injury. An impression of the handlebar was noted along with periumbilical tenderness and absent bowel sounds. Midline laparotomy revealed a walled-off collection of pus around a grade 3 duodenal laceration in the anterolateral aspect of the third part of the duodenum. In case 4, an 8-year-old boy presented after a fall while driving his bicycle with a handle imprint over the right upper quadrant. As the primary and secondary survey was normal, the child was managed conservatively. Handlebar injuries are apparently minor looking injuries with significant underlying impact on the underlying organs. These injuries must always be evaluated, and a low threshold must be kept for radiological investigations. Such children should be kept under observation for evolving signs of injury despite being seemingly normal.

AB  - Cytology specimens play an important role in the diagnosis and predictive testing of lung cancer. While morphological characterisation of small cell and non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC) on cytology is possible, further subtyping of NSCLC into adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma morphology is also mandatory in the current era of personalised medicine. Notably, cytology specimens in different forms (fine needle aspiration, exfoliative, and cell block) with or without immunocytochemistry are reliable sources for accurate diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma as evidenced by numerous studies present in the literature. However, there are instances where subtyping of NSCLC based on morphology alone is challenging on cytology samples, especially non-cell block preparations. In this paper, we will discuss current concepts, advances, and challenges of subtyping NSCLC in cytology specimens.

AB  - Background Crown fractures restored by fragment reattachment are liable to re-fracture, which may cause fragment dislodgement. There is a paucity of literature regarding management of fragment reattachment cases following a further fracture. Hence the aim of the present in-vitro study was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of three different management protocols for such scenarios. Methodology Eighty maxillary bovine incisors without structural deformity and with similar dimensions were fractured as per the standard protocol. They were subjected to drying for 24 hours and the fragments were rehydrated by placing them in a humidification chamber for 15 minutes. They were then reattached by using flowable light-cured composite resin. The teeth (n=20) were fractured again by fixing them in a mechanical frame and using a mallet. They were randomly allocated to three experimental groups. (Group I mechanical abrasion and fragment reattachment, Group II mechanical abrasion, humidification and reattachment, Group III mechanical abrasion and composite restoration, and Group IV positive control with no re-fracture). The samples were thermocycled and the force required to fracture was tested by using a universal testing machine (Instron-3360, USA). This was done by applying a tangential load with a speed of 1 mm/min to the teeth with a 500-kg load cell. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using ANOVA and the independent t-test. Results The highest force required to fracture was reported in Group IV (333.26 +/- 66.69N) while the lowest was in Group II (254.86 +/- 105.23N). The forces in Group I and Group II were 258.36 +/- 65.78N and 298.02 +/- 97.94N, respectively (p=0.016, F=3.68). The independent t-test between the groups revealed a significant difference between Group I and Group IV (p= 0.001) and Group II and Group IV (p=0.009). Conclusion The force required to fracture was significantly lower in the groups involving attachment of the re-fractured fragments. Among the experimental groups, the group with composite restoration required the highest force to fracture.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - TEP repair of inguinal hernia
KW  - 3D anatomically shaped large pore polypropylene mesh
KW  - Lightweight polypropylene mesh
AB  - Minimally invasive surgery has taken over the hernia surgeries in popularity in many countries. Laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal (TEP) hernia with meshplasty is one of the techniques. A lot of new meshes for laparoscopic hernia surgery have been developed over years. Polypropylene mesh that has been traditionally used has been compared head to head with 3D anatomically shaped large pore polypropylene mesh (3D mesh) and is an emerging alternative that needs no or minimal fixation. We performed a randomised controlled trial enrolling 50 patients with inguinal hernia, randomising 25 patients to receive laparoscopic totally extra-peritoneal repair (TEP) of inguinal hernia using 3D mesh (3DM) and 25 patients to receive laparoscopic TEP repair of inguinal hernia using light weight polypropylene mesh (LWPM). The end points of the study were mesh placement time, postoperative pain, seroma formation, hospital stay, chronic groin pain, sensory impairment and recurrence. We followed up the patients for 3 months. We found that 3DM had less mesh fixation time 12.72 min (p = 0.0001) and less postoperative pain which was statistically significant, but postoperative seroma formation, chronic groin pain, duration of hospital stay, and sensory impairment had no significant difference as compared to LWPM. We also found no recurrence rate in both mesh repair techniques at end of 3-month follow-up. The use of 3D mesh for laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair provides advantages in terms of less fixation time and easy manipulation and conformation of the mesh at the hernia site.

AB  - Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC), is a rare lysosomal storage disorder, which has a variable presentation based on the age of onset. We describe five adult/adolescent-onset NPC cases presenting with a range of movement disorders along with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy as part of the clinical presentation. A diagnostic delay of 4-17 years from the symptom onset was found in this case series. A high index of clinical suspicion in adult/adolescent patients presenting with vertical supranuclear gaze palsy along with various movement disorder phenomenology can help in the early diagnosis of NPC.

AB  - Emerging evidence shows co-infection with atypical bacteria in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Respiratory illness caused by atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila may show overlapping manifestations and imaging features with COVID-19 causing clinical and laboratory diagnostic issues. We conducted a prospective study to identify co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria in an Indian tertiary hospital. From June 2020 to January 2021, a total of 194 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were also tested for atypical bacterial pathogens. For diagnosing M. pneumoniae, a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and serology (IgM ELISA) were performed. C. pneumoniae diagnosis was made based on IgM serology. L. pneumophila diagnosis was based on PCR or urinary antigen testing. Clinical and epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 and atypical bacteria-positive and -negative patient groups were compared. Of the 194 patients admitted with COVID-19, 17 (8.8%) were also diagnosed with M. pneumoniae (n = 10) or C. pneumoniae infection (n = 7). Confusion, headache, and bilateral infiltrate were found more frequently in the SARS CoV-2 and atypical bacteria co-infection group. Patients in the M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae co-infection group were more likely to develop ARDS, required ventilatory support, had a longer hospital length of stay, and higher fatality rate compared to patients with only SARS-CoV-2. Our report highlights co-infection with bacteria causing atypical pneumonia should be considered in patients with SARS-CoV-2 depending on the clinical context. Timely identification of co-existing pathogens can provide pathogen-targeted treatment and prevent fatal outcomes of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic.

AB  - Childhood asthma poses significant health and psychological burden on children and parents alike. Care of children with asthma requires a firm partnership and understanding between parents and physicians with regular medications and outpatient visits. Though asthma is less common in the developing world, it is more commonly associated here with severe symptoms. Environmental and economic factors, and lack of education adversely affect efficient care of children with asthma. Poor education and understanding of disease, inadequate trained pediatricians, and lack of resources for pulmonary function testing in children hamper early diagnosis of asthma in children. Hence, children frequently receive symptomatic management for acute episodes instead of long-term preventive therapy. Misconceptions regarding side effects and possible dependence on inhaled medications are frequently seen in the caretakers. This leads to abundant use of alternative medicines. Increasing ambient air pollution due to rapid urbanization and industrial growth in developing countries also adversely affects the pulmonary health of children with asthma. Community-wide campaigns are needed to improve the awareness of parents about childhood asthma and safety of inhaled medications. States should make efforts to improve infrastructure needs of children with asthma.

   Methods We retrospectively reviewed the presentation and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with CKD followed at any of the four pediatric nephrology centers in New Delhi from April 2020 to June 2021. Outcomes, including cardiopulmonary and renal complications, were reported in relation to underlying disease category and illness severity at presentation.
   Results Underlying illness in 88 patients included nephrotic syndrome (50%), other CKD stages 1-4 (18.2%), CKD 5D (17%), and CKD 5T (14.8%). Thirty-two of 61 patients with symptomatic COVID-19 and 9/27 asymptomatic patients were admitted for median 10 (interquartile range 7-15) days. Seventeen (19.3%) patients developed moderate or severe COVID19. Systemic complications, observed in 30 (34.1%), included acute kidney injury (AKI, 34.2%), COVID-19 pneumonia (15.9%), unrelated pulmonary disease (2.3%), and shock (4.5%). Nineteen (21.6%) had severe complications (AKI stage 2-3, encephalopathy, respiratory failure, shock). Eight (11%) of twelve (16.4%) patients with severe AKI required dialysis. Three (3.4%) patients, two with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome in relapse and one with CKD 1-4, died due to respiratory failure. Univariate logistic regression indicated that patients presenting with nephrotic syndrome in relapse or moderate to severe COVID-19 were at risk of AKI (respective odds ratio, 95%CI: 3.62, 1.01-12.99; 4.58, 1.06-19.86) and/or severe complications (respective odds ratio, 95%CI: 5.92, 1.99-17.66; 61.2, 6.99-536.01).
   Conclusions Children with CKD presenting with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 or in nephrotic syndrome relapse are at risk of severe complications, including severe AKI and mortality.

TI  - To Assess the Technical Feasibility of Ultrasound Lumbar Sympathetic Block with Electrical Stimulation Needle in Out-of-Plane Needle Orientation: A Prospective Interventional Study
T2  - PAIN MEDICINE
KW  - Ultrasound
KW  - Lumbar Sympathectomy
AB  - Objective We describe the technical feasibility of a new technique of ultrasound lumbar sympathectomy validated by fluoroscopy. Design Prospective interventional study. Setting Pain block area. Subjects Thirty patients with peripheral arterial disease with pain at rest (numerical rating score [NRS] >= 3) were recruited. Methods In the lateral position, a curved probe (FUJIFILM SonoSite Edge, Bothell, WA, USA, 2-5 MHz) was placed transversely at the iliac crest. An electrical stimulation needle was inserted out of plane, below the lower pole of the kidneys, directed anterior to the vertebral body below. When the needle tip was not visualized, a current of 2.0 A was applied. Patients' quadriceps contractions, ultrasound psoas contractions, and bone contact guided needle placement, which was confirmed on fluoroscopy. Other parameters noted were the number of needle insertions, vertebral level, pain NRS at baseline and at 4 hours, 24 hours, 1 week, and 2 weeks after block, temperature rise, and any other complications. Results In all patients, the needle tip was correctly placed in one to three attempts. In 73% of patients, the needle tip was at L3. Baseline pain NRS was 8 (interquartile range 7-8), which decreased to 2 (interquartile range 2-3) at 1 week after the procedure, and it was maintained in this range until 2 weeks later. A temperature rise of >2oC was noted in all patients. Conclusion Ultrasound lumbar sympathectomy can be performed safely in patients with peripheral arterial disease by an out-of-plane approach in the lateral patient position with an electrical stimulation needle. Before injection of the drug, aspiration of blood should be ruled out in view of the possibility of aortocaval injection.

AB  - Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) which causes varicose veins and venous ulcers, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the general population. The last several years have witnessed many revolutionary developments in the realms of minimally invasive techniques (both thermal and non-thermal) to treat CVI. Moreover, multiple newer societal recommendations have been published over the past one year on the basis of the current evidence. In this article, we will briefly summarise the imaging for varicose veins and review the existing evidence in literature as well as the current guidelines and recommendations for the management of varicose veins, especially focusing on the various superficial ablation technologies.

AB  - Background While celiac disease (CeD) is considered to affect primarily the small intestine, pathological changes in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) are also known to occur. IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase-2 antibody (anti-TG2 Ab) deposits at the site of involvement is one of the methods to establish CeD-related tissue pathology. Aims To explore the utility of IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits in pan-gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies as evidence of CeD-related pathologies. Methods Forty-two treatment-naive patients with CeD and 45 patients with irritable bowel syndrome were included as cases and controls, respectively. Mucosal biopsies were collected from the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and rectosigmoid regions at baseline from cases and controls, and additionally after 6-months of gluten-free diet in cases. All biopsies were evaluated for histological changes and subjected to dual-color immunohistochemical staining for identifying IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits. Results Significantly higher number of patients with CeD had lymphocytic esophagitis (9.7% vs. 0%, P = 0.05), lymphocytic gastritis (35% vs. 8.8%, P < 0.01) and lymphocytic colitis (17.4% vs. 0%, P < 0.05) than that in controls. IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits were observed in significantly more numbers in esophagus (30.9% vs. 6%, P < 0.001), stomach (62.2% vs. 9.3%, P < 0.01), duodenum (88.5% vs. 0%, P < 0.001) and rectum (17.4% vs. 0%, P < 0.05) than that in controls. There was a decline, but not statistically significant, in severity of lymphocytosis and intensity of IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits in follow-up biopsies. Conclusion Significantly higher number of patients with CeD had evidence of lymphocytic infiltration and IgA anti-TG2 deposits along GIT suggesting that CeD affects other parts of GIT.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the possibility of complex strabismus surgical simulation on goat eyes.
   Methods: The goat eyes were procured from local slaughterhouse with retained extra ocular muscle tissues. The obtained eyes were inspected for globe integrity, muscle quality, muscle length, and the surrounding teno-conjunctival layers. The included eyes were then segregated for surgical simulation based on their insertion and orientation (as oblique or recti), and they were mounted on a mannequin head, with a fixation suture at free end to simulate the resting tension. Additionally, as per necessary, extra muscles were also transplanted along desired sites to simulate human extra ocular muscle anatomy.
   Results: The inferior oblique, superior oblique, and all other four recti were successfully simulated in varying proportions in more than 50 eyes. Primarily, by simulating the lateral rectus, inferior rectus, and the inferior oblique muscle, staged weakening procedures of inferior oblique were successfully practiced (Fink's recession, Park's recession, Elliot and Nankin procedure, total anterior positioning, and antero-nasal trans-position or Stager's procedure). Similarly, by simulating superior rectus, inferior rectus, lateral rectus, and the medial rectus muscles, half width transposition, full width transposition, and other complex procedures were practiced (Knapp's procedure, augmented Knapp's, Nishida's procedure, Faden operation, and Y splitting procedure). Furthermore, by simulating superior oblique and the superior rectus muscles, superior oblique tuck, posterior tenectomy, loop tenotomy, and Harada Ito procedures were successfully practiced.
   Conclusions: On goat eyes, the complex strabismus surgical procedures can be successfully simulated and practiced after re-organizing the existing muscles in different patterns.

AB  - Sleep disorders are common in children and adolescents. Polysomnography is the gold-standard diagnostic method; however, it is a tedious procedure. The objective of the study was to develop a screening questionnaire for sleep problems based on International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3 in children and adolescents, and validate it with clinical evaluation and polysomnography. A questionnaire was developed in English and Hindi with content validation by eight multidisciplinary experts. Respondents were parents of children and adolescents, aged 2-18 years, recruited from a public school and a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India. A subset of these children and adolescents underwent overnight polysomnography and detailed clinical evaluation within 4 weeks of applying the questionnaire. The questionnaire, named Childhood and Adolescent Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire, contains primary questions covering all subgroups of disorders under International Classification of Sleep Disorders-3, and secondary questions on sleep hygiene and comorbidities. The questionnaire was filled by 750 respondents, out of which 100 cases underwent polysomnography and clinical evaluation. The internal consistency in the form of Cronbach's alpha was 0.8 for the questionnaire. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values for the questionnaire in identifying those with sleep problems compared with detailed clinical and polysomnographic evaluations were 85%, 100%, 100% and 62.5%, respectively. For individual subgroups of disorders, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values varied between 72.7% and 100%, 88.9% and 100%, 62.5% and 100% and 81.6% and 100%, respectively. The Childhood and Adolescent Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire has good psychometric properties, moreover, its simplicity and translatability make it ideal for use at the community and hospital settings.

AB  - External ventricular drain (EVD) is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. EVD can be associated with high rates of complications like misplacement, iatrogenic hemorrhage, and CSF infection. Several modifications have been proposed in the EVD insertion techniques to decrease the risk of these complications. Bolt-connected EVD, one of these modifications which involves insertion of a bolt in the burr hole, has been proposed to have better chances of optimal placement of EVD tip, lesser risk of CSF infection, and accidental pullout. A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve studies comparing the bolt-connected EVD with tunneled EVD and meta-analysis was done. Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta- analysis. Our analysis revealed that bolt-connected EVD is associated with significantly better chances of optimal placement than traditional tunneled EVD (MH OR-1.65, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.40, p = 0.008). We also observed that bolt-connected EVD is associated with significantly decreased risk of CSF infection (MH OR-0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, p = 0.026), EVD malfunction (MH OR-0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58, p = 0.0003), and accidental disconnection (MH OR-0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26, p < 0.0001) as compared to traditional tunneled EVD. The difference between the two techniques was not statistically significant for complications, multiple punctures done for insertion of EVD, iatrogenic intracranial, and need of reoperation. Bolt-connected external ventricular drain is associated with significantly more chances of optimal placement and lesser chances of accidental discontinuation and CSF infection than tunneled EVD. There was no statistically significant difference noted between the two techniques for multiple punctures done for insertion of EVD, iatrogenic intracranial hemorrhage and need of reoperation. However, most of the included studies were retrospective. Thus, the results from the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution as further prospective high-quality studies are needed.

AB  - Data pertaining to risk factor analysis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is confounded by the lack of data from an ethnically diverse population. In addition, there is a lack of data for young adults. This study was conducted to assess risk factors predicting COVID-19 severity and mortality in hospitalized young adults. A retrospective observational study was conducted at two centers from China and India on COVID-19 patients aged 20-50 years. Regression analysis to predict adverse outcomes was performed using parameters including age, sex, country of origin, hospitalization duration, comorbidities, lymphocyte count, and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) score at admission. A total of 420 patients (172 East Asians and 248 South Asians) were included. The predictive model for intensive care unit (ICU) admission with variables NEWS2 Category II and higher, diabetes mellitus, liver dysfunction, and low lymphocyte counts had an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.930 with a sensitivity of 0.931 and a specificity of 0.784. The predictive model for mortality with NEWS2 Category III, cancer, and decreasing lymphocyte count had an AUC value of 0.883 with a sensitivity of 0.903 and a specificity of 0.701. A combined predictive model with bronchial asthma and low lymphocyte count, in contrast, had an AUC value of 0.768 with a sensitivity of 0.828 and a specificity of 0.719 for NEWS2 score (5 or above) at presentation. NEWS2 supplemented with comorbidity profile and lymphocyte count could help identify hospitalized young adults at risk of adverse COVID-19 outcomes.

AB  - Background: Prognostic disclosure to patients with advanced cancer facilitates treatment decisions and goals of care discussions. However, the perspectives of patients, families and physicians differ in this regard across different cultures. Non-disclosure of cancer diagnosis or prognosis is commonly observed in family-centric cultures such as India. Aim: To assess the prevalence of and factors associated with cancer patients' awareness of advanced disease status; and its with quality of life and psychological distress. Methods: Patients for this cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey were recruited from oncology and palliative medicine clinics at a tertiary cancer hospital in India from January 2017 to June 2018. Patients aged >= 21 years, aware of cancer diagnosis and receiving oncology treatment for Stage IV solid cancer were included in the study after obtaining written informed consent. Results: Two hundred patients were enrolled, of which 146 (73%) were not aware of the stage of their malignancy and 9 (4.5%) believed that their disease was at stage I, II or III. Those who were aware of their advanced cancer stage had more years of education (9.9 years vs 8.1 years, p = .05) and had poorer spiritual wellbeing in the faith domain (adjusted difference -1.6, 95% confidence interval -3.1 to -0.1, p = .03) compared to those who were unaware. Conclusion: It is recommended that future studies may explore prognostic understanding in Indian patients according to their socio-cultural, spiritual and educational background.

AB  - A 40-year-old man with old neglected, non-union, pelvic ring injury right side was surgically treated with open reduction and internal fixation. In the immediate postoperative day, the patient had a large blister adjacent to the surgical site at the right inguinal region which complicated with eschar formation, and later split skin grafting was done. Accidental burns in operation theatre are very unusual. Burns due to electro-cautery and use of alcohol-based antiseptics are well documented in the literature. Iatrogenic burns due to prolonged operating light exposure are very rare and can cause severe damage in sensitive areas like the inguinal region.

KW  - REMOVAL
AB  - Tattoos with blue/black ink show good lightening of pigment after treatment with 1064 nm Q-switched (QS) neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. In this randomized trial, we compared the efficacy of a novel three pass, one session procedure (R15 method) with a conventional method for treating blue/black tattoos in darker skin types. Tattoos were treated with 1064 nm QS Nd:YAG Laser with a spot size of 4 mm, fluence of 5 J/cm(2) and frequency of 5 Hz. The tattoo pigment lightening was comparable with both methods. Thread-like tattoos had significantly better pigment lightening with fewer side effects than the broad band-like tattoos. We would like to recommend the R15 method of the QS Nd:YAG laser for thread-like tattoos, which can save patients' time, cut short the frequency of their hospital visits and, more importantly, decrease the cost involved in it.

AB  - Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive tool to assess the retino-choroidal vasculature in vivo. It tracks the red blood cell movement and maps the vasculature in quick succession. In routine, diabetic retinopathy, age related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, and others are commonly being studied to unveil its clinic role. On the other hand, amblyopia is a condition where the visual acuity is subnormal due to non-organic causes in the eye. But the OCTA studies till now have shown variable changes along retino-choroidal vasculature. Hence, to comprehend the existing literature knowledge, a systematic literature search was carried out and the original works describing novel findings in amblyopic eyes on OCTA were included. Upon detailed assessment, firstly, the disturbed vasculature along superficial retinal plexus, deeper retinal plexus, and choroidal plexus were evident in most untreated amblyopic eyes. However, such changes were not uniform, which is due to noted heterogenic patient profile, small sample size, biometric biases, non-uniform algorithms, and other factors. And to note, even in presence of such diverse changes, almost all the authors stated a plausible explanation for their notable changes. Secondly, the utility of OCTA in identifying vascular changes with standard treatments and segregation of visual beneficiaries from non-beneficiaries were possible. Hence, to conclude, OCTA is a valuable tool which can provide valuable useful insights into the amblyopic eyes during pre and post treatment periods. However, to gather more concrete evidence for clinical benefits, systematic, homogenous, and better structured clinical studies are mandated.

AB  - Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in the ongoing context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR), has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. The current systematic review explores the utility of PLR as a prognostic predictor of COVID-19 patients. We screened the electronic databases until May 15, 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42021220269). Studies evaluating the association between PLR on admission and outcomes in terms of mortality and severity among COVID-19 patients were included. We retrieved 32 studies, with a total of 2768 and 3262 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher PLR levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (mean differences [MD] = 66.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.75-84.44; p < 0.00001 and MD = 86.74; 95% CI: 67.7-105.7; p < 0.00001, respectively). A higher level of PLR on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the evidence is of low quality and further studies regarding the cut-off value of PLR are the need of the hour.

AB  - Purpose: To demonstrate a training technique on the mammalian eye for optimum Cyanoacrylate Tissue adhesive application in cases of perforated corneal ulcers. Methods: A full-thickness defect simulating a perforation was created on the goat's eye cornea to teach the technique of cyanoacrylate glue application in cases of corneal perforations to novice surgeons. Results: This training model on the mammalian eye was tested by 10 residents at our centre. All the 10 candidates involved in our series were newly joined Cornea fellows with proficient skill in cataract surgeries and minor ophthalmic procedures such as suture removal, chalazion excision, pterygium removal and administration of an intravitreal injection. None of the candidates had prior experience of corneal surgeries. Each resident made an average of 4.4 attempts to seal the corneal defect, obtain a regular corneal surface and form the anterior chamber. Conclusion: This training model helps in mastering one of the skills of corneal surgeries.

AB  - In view of the COVID-19 surge, the construction of the Burns and Plastic Surgery Block at AIIMS, New Delhi was expedited at war footing level and converted into a COVID-19 Emergency response Centre (ERC). Engineering works were completed in a speedy manner and various patient care areas were equipped as deemed necessary for providing tertiary care to COVID-19 patients. A highly spirited team comprising of Emergency Medicine Specialists, Anesthesia and Critical Care specialist, Hospital Administrators and Nursing Officers was formed. Effective segregation of patient care areas into clean, contaminated, and intermediate zones was done using physical barriers and air conditioning modifications. The screening area for patients suspected of having COVID-19 was created in addition to a 2-step process i.e., Triage 1 and Triage 2, thereafter, patients requiring admission would be referred to the emergency area. An in-house designed and fabricated sampling booth was created to bring down the use of PPEs and for better infection control. The ERC has a general ward and state of the art intensive care units. Mobilizing resources (machinery, manpower, consumables etc.) during the lockdown required commitment from top leadership, motivated teams, expeditious procurement, coordination with multiple agencies working on site, expediting statutory clearances, coordination with police services, transportation of labor etc.

AB  - Health systems built on the foundation of primary healthcare (PHC) are essential to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). To adequately respond to the needs of people with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and enable optimal management in primary care settings, changes are needed at many levels. PHC levers recommended in the UHC framework as the cornerstone of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) goals by strengthening the primary care system include strategic and operational levers. Experience from hypertension control programs across 18 countries has shown that rapid scale-up can be achieved through systematic improvement of the PHC system brought about by political commitment, financial support, and high-quality people-centred primary care. As countries are gripped with the pandemic the importance of an appropriate and resilient health system fit for the country is emerging as a priority for building preparedness. While there are general principles, each country must learn by doing and scale up models relevant to the national context.

AB  - Background Melanoma is associated with poor prognosis in its advanced stages. Potential influence of estrogen and its metabolites on melanoma growth has been suggested. Aims The objective of this review was to provide an overview on the evidence related to estrogen in malignant melanoma. Materials and Methods Literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar and relevant cross-references of the retrieved articles was performed to review relevant published articles related to estrogen and its effects in malignant melanoma. Results Effect of estrogen signaling on a tissue largely depends on the relative expression of estrogen receptors (ER) alpha and beta. Gender differences in melanoma may be explained by the difference in expression of these receptors. ER beta is the principal ER in melanoma. Discussion Although there is uncertainty about role of estrogen in pathogenensis and progression of melanoma, evidence suggests that its growth and metastasis are influenced by estrogen stimulation. Role ER on the proliferation of melanoma cells is well described. Conclusion There is a need of safe and effective therapy for melanoma, especially for advanced cases. After the establishment of specific role of estrogen and its receptor, analysis of specific genetic mutation can be performed for proper utilization of targeted therapies.

AB  - Monogenic disorders of hypertension are a distinct group of diseases causing dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and are characterized by low plasma renin activity. These can chiefly be classified as causing (i) excessive aldosterone synthesis (familial hyperaldosteronism), (ii) dysregulated adrenal steroid metabolism and action (apparent mineralocorticoid excess, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, activating mineralocorticoid receptor mutation, primary glucocorticoid resistance), and (iii) hyperactivity of sodium and chloride transporters in the distal tubule (Liddle syndrome and pseudohypoaldosteronism type 2). The final common pathway is plasma volume expansion and catecholamine/sympathetic excess that causes urinary potassium wasting; hypokalemia and early-onset refractory hypertension are characteristic. However, several single gene defects may show phenotypic heterogeneity, presenting with mild hypertension with normal electrolytes. Evaluation is based on careful attention to family history, physical examination, and measurement of blood levels of potassium, renin, and aldosterone. Genetic sequencing is essential for precise diagnosis and individualized therapy. Early recognition and specific management improves prognosis and prevents long-term sequelae of severe hypertension.

AB  - Environmental mutagens are chemical and physical substances in the environment that has a potential to induce a wide range of mutations and generate multiple physiological, biochemical, and genetic modifications in humans. Most mutagens are having genotoxic effects on the following generation through germ cells. The influence of germinal mutations on health will be determined by their frequency, nature, and the mechanisms that keep a specific mutation in the population. Early prenatal lethal mutations have less public health consequences than genetic illnesses linked with long-term medical and social difficulties. Physical and chemical mutagens are common mutagens found in the environment. These two environmental mutagens have been associated with multiple neurological disorders and carcinogenesis in humans. Thus in this study, we aim to unravel the molecular mechanism of physical mutagens (UV rays, X-rays, gamma rays), chemical mutagens (dimethyl sulfate (DMS), bisphenol A (BPA), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 5-chlorocytosine (5ClC)), and several heavy metals (Ar, Pb, Al, Hg, Cd, Cr) implicated in DNA damage, carcinogenesis, chromosomal abnormalities, and oxidative stress which leads to multiple disorders and impacting human health. Biological tests for mutagen detection are crucial; therefore, we also discuss several approaches (Ames test and Mutatox test) to estimate mutagenic factors in the environment. The potential risks of environmental mutagens impacting humans require a deeper basic knowledge of human genetics as well as ongoing research on humans, animals, and their tissues and fluids.

AB  - A positive association between oxidative stress and hyper-thyroid conditions is well established. Vitamin E (VIT-E) and curcumin (CRM) are considered as potent antioxidant small molecules. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2(NRF-2) is known to bind with antioxidant response element and subsequently activate expression of antioxidant enzymes. However, the activation of NRF-2 depends on removal of its regulator Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(NRF-2). In the current study, an attempt is made to demonstrate whether effects of VIT-E and CRM are due to direct interaction with the target proteins (i.e. NRF-2, NRF-2, SOD, catalase and LDH) or by possible interaction with the flanking region of their promoters by in silico analysis. Further, these results were corroborated by pretreatment of H9C2 cells (1 x 106 cells per mL of media) with VIT-E (50 lM) and/or CRM (20 lM) for 24 h followed by induction of oxidative stress via T4 (100nm) administration and assaying the active oxygen metabolism. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) indicated that T4 has a definite role in increasing oxidative stress as evidenced by induction of ROS generation, increase in mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated lipid peroxidation (LPx). Pretreatment with the two antioxidants have ameliorative effects more so when given in combination. The decline in biological activities of the principal antioxidant enzymes SOD and CAT with respect to T4 treatment and its restoration in antioxidant pretreated group further validated our in silico data.

AB  - Objective To compare the growth of Indian children with Down syndrome (DS), with typically developing Indian children. The effect of comorbidities on their physical growth was also evaluated, so that factors affecting growth can be identified early and timely interventions be planned. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from June 2015 to June 2017. Children with karyotype-proven DS within age group of 3 mo to 5 y were enrolled as study subjects. Children with DS having mosaic karyotype were excluded. Anthropometry and associated comorbidities were assessed. Results Hundred and eight children with DS were enrolled, mean WHO z scores were-WAZ: -2.31 (SD 1.44), HAZ: -2.51 (SD 1.47), BAZ: -1.07 (SD 1.8), and HCZ: -2.79 (SD 1.21). Congenital heart disease (in 44.5% children), hypothyroidism (in 27.7%), and anemia (in 50%) were the common comorbidities. Growth parameters of children with and without any comorbidity were significantly different, mean WHO z scores were WAZ -2.61 vs. -1.09 (p = 0.005), HAZ -2.43 vs. -2.41 (p = 0.3), BAZ -1.49 vs. -0.38 (p = 0.001), and HCZ -3.13 vs. -2.33 (p = 0.001). Conclusion Growth of Indian children with DS is significantly less compared to normally growing children. Weight was affected maximum during infancy, length was more affected as the age progressed, head circumference was affected similarly in all age groups, whereas BMI showed almost progressive increase with age. Children with severe heart disease had significantly lower BMI whereas children with treated hypothyroidism had better growth. There is a need for a large longitudinal study on Indian children with DS to construct Indian DS-specific growth charts.

AB  - Objectives We sought to clarify the variations in the anatomy of the superior cavoatrial junction and anomalously connected pulmonary veins in patients with superior sinus venosus defects using computed tomographic (CT) angiography. Methods CT angiograms of 96 consecutive patients known to have superior sinus venosus defects were analysed. Results The median age of the patients was 34.5 years. In seven (7%) patients, the defect showed significant caudal extension, having a supero-inferior dimension greater than 25 mm. All patients had anomalous connection of the right superior pulmonary vein. The right middle and right inferior pulmonary vein were also connected anomalously in 88 (92%) and 17 (18%) patients, respectively. Anomalous connection of the right inferior pulmonary vein was more common in those with significant caudal extension of the defect (57% vs 15%, p=0.005). Among anomalously connected pulmonary veins, the right superior, middle, and inferior pulmonary veins were committed to the left atrium in 6, 17, and 11 patients, respectively. The superior caval vein over-rode the interatrial septum in 67 (70%) patients, with greater than 50% over-ride in 3 patients. Conclusion Anomalous connection of the right-sided pulmonary veins is universal, but is not limited to the right upper lobe. Not all individuals have over-riding of superior caval vein. In a minority of patients, the defect has significant caudal extension, and anomalously connected pulmonary veins are committed to the left atrium. These findings have significant clinical and therapeutic implications.

AB  - Objective To study the factors associated with waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) among school children aged 5-15 y and its association with hypertension. Methods In this cross-sectional study, data on background characteristics, socioeconomic status (SES), anthropometric parameters, and blood pressure were obtained from school children from three states of India. WHtR >= 0.5 was defined as obesity and hypertensives were defined based on Fourth Report criteria. Descriptive statistics were applied and multiple linear regression was done to identify factors associated with WHtR. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictive ability of WHtR to predict hypertension Results The mean WHtR among the 12,068 students was 0.40 (+/- 0.05) and it showed a U-shaped distribution with age with trough at 10 y of age for both genders. Mean WHtR was higher among residents of Manipur, among boys and hypertensives. WHtR was positively associated with weight > 30 kg, male gender, schools with high SES, Manipur and Goa region, and negatively associated with age > 10 y. The area under the ROC curve of WHtR for diagnosis of hypertension was low 0.544 (95% CI 0.532, 0.556). Conclusion There is a nonlinear relation between age, gender, and WHtR, which varies by geographical region and HT. This would need to be kept in mind while using it to identify obesity in children, though its discriminant value for hypertension is low.

AB  - Rectourethral fistula (RUF) is a rare surgical condition, the management of which remains a surgical challenge as is evident by the numerous procedures described in the literature; none of them gaining widespread acceptance. We describe our experience in the management of RUF using gracilis muscle flap interposition. This study is a case series analysis of three patients with RUF treated at our center between 2016 and 2020. The information recorded was etiology, clinical presentation, prior surgeries, diagnostic workup, operative details, complications, and follow-up. One patient had RUF following pelvic fracture, one developed RUF following multiple blind metallic dilations, while the third patient developed RUF following ether installation to rupture Foley's catheter balloon. All the patients had double diversion in the form of suprapubic cystostomy and colostomy prior to definitive surgical repair to 6 months later. The surgical technique used was excision of the fistula and repair of the rectal and urethral defects with interposition of the right gracilis muscle flap. The operative times were 320, 300, and 210 min, and the blood loss was 400, 300, and 250 ml. One patient had a surgical site infection and one had hematoma at the flap harvest site which were managed accordingly. The follow-up periods for the three patients were 23, 45, and 49 months. All the patients have been dry and continent. Gracilis muscle flap interposition is a safe and viable approach in the management of difficult to deal RUFs with good outcomes and an acceptable morbidity profile.

AB  - Exposure to higher levels of arsenic is a serious threat affecting human health worldwide. We investigated the protective role of betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) against sodium arsenite-induced renal dysfunction in rats. Sodium arsenite (5 mg/kg, oral) was given to rats for 4 weeks to induce nephrotoxicity. Betaine (125 and 250 mg/kg, oral) was administered in rats for 4 weeks along with sodium-arsenite feeding. Arsenic-induced renal dysfunction was demonstrated by measuring serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urea, uric acid, potassium, fractional excretion of sodium, and microproteinuria. Oxidative stress in rat kidneys was determined by assaying thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, superoxide anion generation, and reduced glutathione levels. Furthermore, hydroxyproline assay was done to assess renal fibrosis in arsenic intoxicated rats. Hematoxylin-eosin and picrosirius red staining revealed pathological alterations in rat kidneys. Renal endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression was determined by immuno-histochemistry. Concurrent administration of betaine abrogated arsenic-induced renal biochemical and histological changes in rats. Betaine treatment significantly attenuated arsenic-induced decrease in renal eNOS expression. In conclusion, betaine is protective against sodium arsenite-induced renal dysfunction, which may be attributed to its anti-oxidant activity and modulation of renal eNOS expression in rat kidneys.

AB  - Background Knee assessment with and without load using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information on knee joint dynamics and improve the diagnosis of knee joint diseases. Performing such studies on a routine MRI-scanner require a load-exerting device during scanning. There is a need for more studies on developing loading devices and evaluating their clinical potential. Purpose Design and develop a portable and easy-to-use axial loading device to evaluate the knee joint dynamics during the MRI study. Study Type Prospective study. Subjects Nine healthy subjects. Field Strength/Sequence A 0.25 T standing-open MRI and 3.0 T MRI. PD-T-2-weighted FSE, 3D-fast-spoiled-gradient-echo, FS-PD, and CartiGram sequences. Assessment Design and development of loading device, calibration of loads, MR safety assessment (using projectile angular displacement, torque, and temperature tests). Scoring system for ease of doing. Qualitative (by radiologist) and quantitative (using structural similarity index measure [SSIM]) image-artifact assessment. Evaluation of repeatability, comparison with various standing stances load, and loading effect on knee MR parameters (tibiofemoral bone gap [TFBG], femoral cartilage thickness [FCT], tibial cartilage thickness [TCT], femoral cartilage T-2-value [FCT2], and tibia cartilage T-2-value [TCT2]). The relative percentage change (RPC) in parameters due to the device load was computed. Statistical Test Pearson's correlation coefficient (r). Results The developed device is conditional-MR safe (details in the manuscript and supplementary materials), 15 x 15 x 45 cm(3) dimension, and <3 kg. The ease of using the device was 4.9/5. The device introduced no visible image artifacts, and SSIM of 0.9889 +/- 0.0153 was observed. The TFBG intraobserver variability (absolute difference) was 0.9. Loading resulted in RPC of 1.5%-11.0%, 7.9%-8.5%, and -1.5% to 13.0% in the TFBG, FCT, and TCT, respectively. FCT2 and TCT2 were reduced in range of 1.5-2.7 msec and 0.5-2.3 msec due to load. Data Conclusion The proposed device is conditionally MR safe, low cost (material cost < INR 6000), portable, and effective in loading the knee joint with up to 50% of body weight.

AB  - Introduction Acinar cystic transformation (ACT) of the pancreas is characterized by multiple cysts lined by dual ductal and acinar-type of epithelium. ACT is typically a disease of adulthood and has not been described in a neonate. Case report: Autopsy of this term 3-day old male demonstrated cystic transformation of the entire pancreas measuring 42 mm in its largest dimension. The main pancreatic duct was patent. The numerous variable-sized cysts were lined by both ductal (CK7-positive) and acinar (trypsin-positive) epithelium. Congenital hemochromatosis of the liver, complete proximal jejunal atresia, gangrene of the post-atretic jejunum, and subglottic stenosis were associated features. Discussion/Conclusion: ACT may occur in the neonate in association with other abnormalities.

AB  - Oral cancer is among the most common cancers in India. Tobacco, its primary risk factor, is widely consumed across the country, in both smoked and smokeless forms. The current study assessed the prevalence of tobacco use and associated oral lesions in a section of the New Delhi population. Population-based cross-sectional survey was used. House visits in urban Delhi within 15 km radius of a tertiary care teaching hospital were conducted. The basic demographic details, tobacco and alcohol history (on a standardized questionnaire) were elicited from 71,022 individuals, followed by an oral examination (inspection and digital palpation) for detecting oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) and oral cancer. Ever tobacco users comprised 22.2% while 16.1% of individuals were current tobacco users; tobacco use was higher among men than women. Bidi was the most commonly used smoked tobacco product (both genders). Regarding smokeless tobacco, gutkha and khaini use was common among men, while the majority of women consumed betel quid with tobacco. Alcohol use was found in 4% of individuals. OPMDs were detected in 3.4% of individuals. Tobacco abuse is very common in our urban community. Community-based oral health education and oral checkup by trained health care workers should be carried out to reduce the burden of tobacco use and ill effects of tobacco.

AB  - Background: Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a multicausal disease involving both acquired as well as genetic factors. Nitric oxide is an influential endogenous factor having its role in the development of deep vein thrombosis. It maintains the vascular integrity and any alterations in its levels may lead to a thrombotic event. It may also modulate homocysteine metabolism to cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which is a prominent risk factor for thrombosis. The objective of the study was to study if endothelial nitric oxide gene polymorphisms, 894G/T, and 2479G/A alter the plasma nitric oxide and homocysteine levels which may eventually increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis. Methods: One hundred Doppler ultrasonography and computerized tomography confirmed (for cerebral venous thrombosis), non-related DVT patients (M:F = 58:42; age range = 18 to 61 years) served as the study population. Two hundred hospital staff and their relatives or unrelated attendants of the patients served as the controls. Nitric oxide levels were determined by measuring its metabolites (NOx), and EIA was used to measure homocysteine levels. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for detecting the eNOS polymorphisms 894G/T and 2479G/A. Results: In total, DVT subjects have 25% higher plasma levels of homocysteine and 37% lower levels of NOx in their circulation when compared to controls. In tertile analysis of nitric oxide and homocysteine levels, 894G/T and 2479G/A polymorphisms were associated with plasma nitric oxide and homocysteine levels. The increased risk of deep vein thrombosis was associated with endothelial nitric oxide gene polymorphisms and nitric oxide levels, but homocysteine levels were not a risk for deep vein thrombosis. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that 894G/T and 2479G/A polymorphisms interact with lower levels of nitric oxide and higher levels of homocysteine that may possess the risk of deep vein thrombosis.

AB  - Background Workplace violence (WPV) includes verbal abuse, physical violence, bullying or mobbing, assault and sexual harassment. The area has been well researched in the developed and high-income countries among nurses and healthcare professionals, but in the case of the low and upper-middle-income countries, there remains a paucity of comprehensive data on the prevalence of WPV and its contributing factors. Aims To estimate the prevalence and determinants of WPV among nurses working in the South-East Asian Region and Western Pacific Regions. Design Systematic review and Meta-analysis. Method A comprehensive search was done to retrieve articles based on a PRISMA compliant protocol registered in PROSPERO: CRD 42020223605. Study selection, quality assessment and data abstraction were independently done by the team members and discrepancies addressed through mutual consensus. Random-effect meta-analysis, I2 statistics and subgroup analysis were done. Results The review included 41 studies conducted among 42,222 nurses from 13 countries. The pooled prevalence of WPV, verbal abuse, physical violence, threatening behaviour, physical assault, sexual harassment and bullying/mobbing were 58% (CI 51%-64%), 64% (CI 59%-70%), 23% (CI 14%-34%), 30(CI-11%-52%), 21% (CI 8%-38%), 12% (CI 7%-17%) and 25% (17%-33%), respectively. The various determinants of WPV included attributes related to the patient, nurses and organisation. Moreover, the impact of WPV included physical, psychological repercussions on nurses and the various measures used to manage it. Conclusion Nurses encounter a high level of WPV especially verbal abuse in their workplace settings. Nursing councils and professional nursing organisations should put in their effort towards the formulation and implementation of occupational safety legislation in their respective countries through appropriate political lobbying. Relevance to clinical practice. Our review highlights the emerging need to focus on the prevention of WPV among nurses working in lower, middle and upper-middle-income countries. Legislation changes and organisational commitment are vital for ensuring effective policies to combat WPV.

AB  - Context Consumption of high-energy food has increased globally, thereby leading to an increase in many diseases. One strategy for addressing this is to make people aware of their energy intake through energy and fat labels. However, the effectiveness of this remains debatable. Objective This review aims to pool the mixed outcomes of recent studies assessing the effect of energy and fat content labeling on food consumption pattern. Data Sources Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Randomized controlled and quasi-experimental controlled trials published from 2014 to 2019 were included. Data Extraction Two reviewers screened 413 abstracts independently. Qualitative and quantitative data was extracted from 10 articles; meta-analysis was carried out on 6 of those studies. Results The majority of the included papers were conducted in the regions of America, the Western Pacific, and Europe. Overall, the 6 studies claimed that labeling did not reduce the consumption of energy or fat. However, meta-analysis showed that fat and energy content labeling of food had a statistically significant effect on consumption. Subgroup analysis showed no difference with respect to types of labels, ie, context labeling vs traffic-light labeling, but energy content labels seemed to be more effective than fat content labels in influencing healthy food choices. Conclusion Energy and fat content labeling were shown to reduce the consumption of each significantly. However, the outcome was influenced by the study setting and the population concerned. There is a need for research in other regions in order to assess the global effectiveness of nutrition labels on food consumption. Systematic Review Registration PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020172675.

AB  - Background There is limited information about the incidence of metabolic acidosis (MA) after renal transplantation. This single centre prospective study aimed to delineate the incidence and risk factors of MA in the first 6 months after renal transplantation (RTX). Design, setting, participants and measurements Patients who underwent RTX between November 2018 and July 2020 were monitored with weekly measurement of serum bicarbonate level for 6 months and those who were diagnosed with MA were evaluated further to characterize the type of MA. Results One hundred and twenty-five patients were included in the study, 89 (71.2%) of whom developed MA. Seventy-two patients developed MA in the first month, 11 during the 2-3 months and 6 between 4 and 6 months after transplantation. Of the 89 patients, 55(61.8%) had type 1 renal tubular acidosis (T1RTA), 27 (30.3%) had type 2 RTA (T2RTA) and 7 (7.9%) type 4 RTA (T4RTA). Two patient who had T1RTA, subsequently developed high anion gap MA following severe graft rejection. On stepwise multivariate regression analysis, serum creatinine at time of diagnosis of MA [OR (95% CI): 12.02 (1.79 to 80.59), p = .01] and high tacrolimus C0 levels [OR (95% CI): 2.43 (1.0 to 5.90), p = .049], were independent risk factors for MA. Conclusion There is a high incidence of MA in the initial 6 months post-transplant with serum creatinine and high tacrolimus C0 levels being independent risk factors.

AB  - Background: Traumatic globe luxation is a rare event that leads to profound vision loss due to injury of the ipsilateral optic nerve and rarely a visual field defect in the contralateral eye. Through this communication, we report similar case scenarios and intend to hypothesize the mechanism that results in the occurrence of the contralateral visual field defect. Methods: It is a retrospective, observational study. All cases with traumatic globe luxation were enrolled. Visual field analysis of the contralateral normal eye was main outcome measure. Results: Four patients with traumatic globe luxation and optic nerve injury were studied. There was complete loss of vision in the traumatised eye in all the patients. One patient had complete transection of the optic nerve, whereas in three patients, the course of the optic nerve was intact, on imaging. Three patients had quadrantanopia in the contralateral normal eye for which oral steroids were given. At 1-month follow-up, there was complete recovery of the visual field defect in two patients. We noticed that all the three patients with an intact course of the ipsilateral optic nerve had quadrantanopia in the contralateral normal eye. Conclusion: We hypothesize that in scenarios where globe luxation is associated with incomplete transection or no transection of the optic nerve, a continuous long standing stretch on the optic nerve, transmits the pulling force to the chiasma which might result in a contralateral field defect as compared to those associated with the complete transection of the optic nerve.

AB  - Objective To identify controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) based cutoffs for diagnosing and grading hepatic steatosis in adolescents with overweight/obesity, using magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as the reference method. Methods Adolescents with overweight/obesity were included. Fasting glucose, insulin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase were estimated. Hepatic steatosis (S) was assessed by MRI-PDFF, and graded as S0, S1, S2, and S3 with fat fraction cutoffs of < 6.0%, >= 6.0% to < 17.5%, >= 17.5% to < 23.3%, and >= 23.3%, respectively. CAP and liver stiffness measure (LSM) were assessed using FibroScan. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to estimate the CAP scores predicting various grades of hepatic steatosis. Results A total of 108 adolescents aged 12.4 +/- 1.9 y, with mean BMI of 26.7 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2) were included. S0, S1, S2, and S3 steatosis by MRI-PDFF was identified in 15, 70, 13, and 10 adolescents, respectively. A moderate positive correlation was observed between CAP score and MRI-estimated hepatic fat (r = 0.528, p < 0.001). The optimal CAP cutoffs for identifying >= S1, >= S2, and S3 steatosis were 271 [area under ROC (AUROC) 0.745 (0.630-0.859)], 296 [AUROC 0.820 (0.728-0.911)], and 309 dB/m [AUROC 0.836 (0.729-0.944)], respectively. Conclusion CAP score had a good discriminative ability to diagnose fatty liver in adolescents with overweight or obesity.

A major conceptual pivot is establishment of pachychoroid and its spectrum of clinical disorders: pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, pachychoroid neovasculopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy/aneurysmal type 1 neovascularization, peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome, and focal choroidal excavation. However, considerable overlaps in manifestations and therapeutics of these disorders make differentiation amongst them difficult. This review is focused on pathogenesis and clinical aspects of pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV). Since PNV was defined as a separate entity around 5 years ago, there have been numerous contrasting observations surrounding it. We review and summarize these studies, and also compare PNV with other disorders of the pachychoroid spectrum in detail. There are important differences between etiologies of neovascular age related macular degeneration and PNV. Yet the current treatment strategies for PNV have been extrapolated from the trials for the former. Future research needs to validate this assumption with long-term results.

AB  - Abernethy malformation is a rare entity. We report a 5-year-old boy presenting with severe pulmonary hypertension in whom Abernethy malformation and inferior caval vein interruption were diagnosed by CT angiography. In addition, the iliac veins were thrombosed with multiple venous collateral drainage. This abnormal venous anatomy caused difficulty in device closure of the Abernethy malformation, which was successfully closed using a vascular plug.

AB  - Despite recent advances in therapeutic approaches, patients with MLL-rearranged leukemia still have poor outcomes. Here, we find that the RNA-binding protein IGF2BP3, which is overexpressed in MLL-translocated leukemia, strongly amplifies MLL-Af4-mediated leukemogenesis. Deletion of Igf2bp3 significantly increases the survival of mice with MLL-Af4-driven leukemia and greatly attenuates disease, with a minimal impact on baseline hematopoiesis. At the cellular level, MLL-Af4 leukemia-initiating cells require Igf2bp3 for their function in leukemogenesis. At the molecular level, IGF2BP3 regulates a complex posttranscriptional operon governing leukemia cell survival and proliferation. IGF2BP3-targeted mRNA transcripts include important MLL-Af4-induced genes, such as those in the Hoxa locus, and the Ras signaling pathway. Targeting of transcripts by IGF2BP3 regulates both steady-state mRNA levels and, unexpectedly, pre-mRNA splicing. Together, our findings show that IGF2BP3 represents an attractive therapeutic target in this disease, providing important insights into mechanisms of posttranscriptional regulation in leukemia.

AB  - Microsurgical skills are essential for plastic surgeons in the modern times. Chicken wing model for microsurgery training offers an easy and cost-effective alternative to the traditional live rat model. A prospective study was conducted over a period of 6 months. Fifteen resident doctors in the department of plastic surgery were enrolled. Each of them underwent one session of microsurgery training on chicken wings (ulnar artery) every week for 15 weeks. The pre-training and post-training microvascular anastomosis were recorded and analyzed by two blinded investigators using a modification of the Structured Assessment of Microsurgery Skills (SAMS) tool. The pre- and post-training scores were compared. Twelve residents completed the requisite number of training sessions and were included in the final analysis. The mean diameter of the chicken wing ulnar artery was 1.04 mm (SD:0.11). All trainees demonstrated an improvement in the total scores. There was significant improvement in the mean scores (Pre-training: 33.46 vs. post-training: 41.42, p = 0.002). There was also a significant decrease in the total number of errors (Pre-training: 6.75 vs. post-training: 4.79, p = 0.012). However, there was no significant improvement in the average time taken to perform anastomosis (Pre-training: 58.03 mins vs. post-training: 52.51 mins, p = 0.182). We concluded that chicken wing is a useful training model for microsurgery. It helps in improving the overall microsurgical skill as well as reducing the average number of errors. This model is cost-effective, easily available, and easy to set-up. The wide assortment of vessels with varying diameters provides opportunities for training of microsurgeons of different skill levels.

AB  - Background and Aims Low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have a disproportionately higher alcohol-attributable disease burden, in conjunction with a minimal focus on primary prevention. Screening and brief interventions can be a promising approach to address this problem. This systematic review aimed to perform a qualitative and quantitative synthesis of studies of brief interventions for harmful and hazardous alcohol use in LMIC. Methods Systematic review of randomized controlled trials of brief interventions for harmful and hazardous alcohol identified from four electronic databases, conducted in any country identified as LMIC as per the World Bank. We measured differences in intervention and control groups on risk-scores using standard screening instruments, the frequency of heavy drinking, the drinking risk-level, or quality of life and other mental health-related outcomes. Results A total of 14 studies were included, seven of them from South Africa. On standardized screening instruments, the brief intervention (BI) group had significantly lower scores than controls at 3 months (Hedges' g = - 0.34, P = 0.04), but the effects did not persist at 6- and 12-month follow-up (g = - 0.06, P = 0.68 and g = 0.15, P = 0.41, respectively). There was little evidence to suggest that BIs led to changes in the frequency of heavy drinking or change in the risk level of alcohol use. Surprisingly, a single session (g = -0.55, P < 0.001) fared better than multiple sessions (g = -0.03, P = 0.85). A nurse delivered brief intervention (g = -0.44, P = 0.02) showed better results than BIs delivered by others (g = -0.14, P = 0.66), whereas the outcomes were similar for young adults and middle-age people. Conclusion Brief interventions for alcohol use show some promise in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, a single session, nurse-delivered brief intervention for harmful and hazardous alcohol use appears to show a small but significant positive effect in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is an extremely dangerous multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative pathogen which poses a serious life-threatening risk in immunocompromised patients. Phosphopantothenoyl cysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between L-cysteine and phosphopantothenic acid (PPA) to form 40- Phosphopantothenoylcysteine during Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. CoA is a crucial cofactor for cellular survival and inhibiting its synthesis will result in cell death. Bacterial PPCS differs from eukaryotic PPCS in a number of ways like it exists as a C-terminal domain of a PPCDC/PPCS fusion protein whereas eukaryotic PPCS exists as an independent protein. This difference makes it an attractive drug target. For which a conventional iterative approach of SBDD (structure-based drug design) was used, which began with three-dimensional structure prediction of AbPPCS using PHYRE 2.0. A database of FDA-approved compounds (Drug Bank) was then screened against the target of interest by means of docking score and glide energy, leading to the identification of 6 prominent drug candidates. The shortlisted 6 molecules were further subjected to all-atom MD simulation studies in explicit-solvent conditions (using AMBER force field). The MD simulation studies revealed that the ligands DB65103, DB449108 and DB443210, maintained several H-bonds with intense van der Waals contacts at the active site of the protein with high binding free energies: -11.42 kcal/mol, -10.49 kcal/mol and -10.98 kcal/mol, respectively, calculated via MM-PBSA method. Overall, binding of these compounds at the active site was found to be the most stable and robust highlighting the potential of these compounds to serve as antibacterials.

AB  - Purpose Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR), on the surface of normal parathyroid cells, is essential for maintaining serum calcium levels. The normal pattern of CaSR immunostaining remains undefined and is presumptively circumferential. Given the physiological variation in serum calcium, we postulated that CaSR expression could not be uniformly circumferential. Also, cytoplasmic expression has not been evaluated either in normal or pathological tissues. We studied normal parathyroid tissues derived from forensic autopsies and those rimming parathyroid adenomas for membranous and cytoplasmic CaSR immunoexpression. Results were compared with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) to look for any pathogenetic implications. Materials and methods We evaluated 34 normal parathyroid tissues from 11 autopsies, 30 normal rims, 45 parathyroid adenoma, 10 hyperplasia, and 7 carcinoma cases. Membranous expression was categorized complete/incomplete and weak/moderate/strong; scored using Her2/Neu and Histo-scores; predominant pattern noted. Cytoplasmic expression was categorized negative/weak/moderate/strong; predominant intensity noted. Results Normal autopsy-derived parathyroid tissues were Her2/Neu 3 + , but incomplete membranous staining predominated in 85%. Their immune-scores were significantly more than the cases (p < < 0.05). The mean histo-score of normal rims was intermediate between the two (p < < 0.05). Cytoplasmic expression was strong in all autopsy-derived tissues, weak/negative in hyperplasia (100%), moderate in 16% adenomas, and 43% carcinomas. Conclusions Normal autopsy-derived parathyroid tissues showed strong but predominantly incomplete membranous expression. Surface CaSR expression decreased in PHPT and is probably an early event in parathyroid adenoma, seen even in normal rims. Whether there is a defect in CaSR trafficking from the cytoplasm to the cell surface in adenoma and carcinoma needs further evaluation.

AB  - Background Glycemic control has remained an enigma despite a large number of anti-diabetic drugs being available. Clinical practice and guidelines have focussed largely on optimal and rational use of anti-diabetes drugs to achieve care goals. This study aims to delineate factors impacting glycemic control from real-world data. Methods Retrospective, cross-sectional data comprising 15,689 prescriptions from 4647 people living with diabetes and attending an endocrine clinic over a 5-year period was extracted from EMR (electronic medical records) of the clinic. Data pertaining to drugs prescribed, glycemic control attained and patient behavioral factors like diet, drug and exercise adherence was analysed to delineate the contribution of patient or care team-dependent factors towards glycemic control. Results Factors related to patient behavior affected glycemic control linearly with statistically lower HbA1c in people with better adherence to diet, medications and exercise. People who did any self-monitoring of blood glucose at home had significantly better glycemic control. On the other hand, a number of medications were negatively associated with glycemic control. Hypoglycemia had no impact on glycemic control. A number of visits to treating physician were positively associated with glycemic control but impact plateaued after 6 visits. Conclusion Patient behavior and activation-related factors are predominant drivers of glycemic control.

AB  - Monogenic lupus is a subset of lupus caused by single-gene disorders, integrating the paradoxical combination of autoimmunity and immunodeficiency. Pulmonary manifestations with recurrent pneumonia and bronchiectasis have rarely been described as the predominant presentation of juvenile lupus and may suggest an alternate differential like primary immunodeficiency, especially in early childhood. We describe a case of 10-year girl who presented with a history of recurrent pneumonia, arthritis, alopecia, and poor weight gain for the past 2 years. On examination, she had respiratory distress, bilateral diffuse crackles and arthritis of the small joints of hands. Lab investigations showed pancytopenia, low complement levels and high titers of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with juvenile lupus. Imaging studies revealed evidence of multiple lobar collapse and consolidation with bronchiectasis. She was started on steroids, HCQ and supportive measures for bronchiectasis. The child reported relief in initial symptoms of lupus on follow-up but developed recurrent thrombocytopenia requiring IVIG and escalating the doses of oral steroids. The young age and atypical presentation prompted a screening for monogenic lupus, and clinical exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous missense variation in exon 20 of the C4Agene with clinically reduced C4 levels, consistent with the diagnosis of C4A deficiency.

AB  - Background This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the influence of genetic polymorphism in two renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-candidate genes on urinary trefoil family factor 3 (TFF3) levels in children with congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT).
   Methods The study included fifty children with CAKUT (PUV, VUR, and PUJO) and twenty age-matched controls. Urinary TFF3 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Detection of genetic polymorphisms in two genes, i.e., I/D polymorphism (SNP at rs4340) in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and A/T polymorphism in the angiotensin II receptor type-2 (AT2R) due to point mutation at rs3736556 was performed by polymerase chain reaction. Progressive deterioration in kidney function was defined as fall in GFR to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and/or progressive scarring.
   Results In our cohort, the genotypic distribution of patients and controls showed no difference. Progressive functional deterioration was significantly associated with the presence of D allele (p = 0.0004), A allele (p = 0.005), and both (p < 0.0001) in patients. Significantly raised TFF3 levels were detected in the urine of children having D allele (D/D > I/D > I/I; p < 0.0001) and A allele (A/A > A/T > TT; p < 0.0001). Also, children with both D/D and A/A allelic genotypes had significantly elevated urinary TFF3 compared to those having either of them.
   Conclusions The presence of D allele and/or A allele is significantly associated with progressive functional deterioration and elevated urinary TFF3 levels. These findings support the role of angiotensin II-AT2R-NF-kappa B interaction in progressive deterioration of kidney function and subsequent TFF3 expression in CAKUT.

AB  - Background Patients with celiac disease (CeD) can commonly present with symptoms of dyspepsia. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the present literature to assess the prevalence of CeD in patients diagnosed with dyspepsia. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for the keywords: celiac disease, coeliac disease, anti-gliadin, tissue transglutaminase antibody, anti-endomysial antibody, dyspepsia and functional gastrointestinal disorder. All the studies published from January 1991 till May 2021 were included. Diagnosis of CeD was based on the European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition guidelines. A random-effects model was used to pool the data. Results Twenty-one studies screening 10,275 patients with dyspepsia were included. The pooled seroprevalence of CeD based on a positive anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody and/or anti-endomysial antibody was 4.8% (95% CI [2.8, 6.7%], I-2 = 87.7%). The pooled biopsy-confirmed CeD prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI [1.0, 1.9%]; I-2 = 59.8%) in these patients. Both seroprevalence (Odds ratio: 1.8; 95% CI [0.8, 4.0%]; I-2 = 0%) and prevalence of biopsy-confirmed CeD (Odds ratio: 1.4; 95% CI [0.8, 2.4]; I-2 = 0%) were not higher in patients with dyspepsia compared to controls. There was a moderate risk of selection bias and significant heterogeneity in the pooled results. Conclusions The pooled prevalence of CeD in patients with dyspepsia was 1.5% and it was not significantly higher than the general population. These results do not support screening of patients with dyspepsia for CeD.

AB  - Background More than 50% of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have uncontrolled hypertension, increasing their long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and progression to kidney failure. Children receiving medications or dialysis may also experience acute blood pressure fluctuations accompanied by debilitating symptoms. We aimed to describe the perspectives of children with CKD and their parental caregivers on blood pressure to inform patient-centered care. Methods Secondary thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative data from the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Children and Adolescents initiative, encompassing 16 focus groups, an international Delphi survey and two consensus workshops. We analyzed responses from children with CKD (ages 8-21 years) and caregivers (of children ages 0-21 years) pertaining to blood pressure. Results Overall, 120 patients and 250 caregivers from 22 countries participated. We identified five themes: invisibility and normalization (reassured by apparent normotension, absence of symptoms and expected links with CKD), confused by ambiguity (hypertension indistinguishable from cardiovascular disease, questioning the need for prophylactic intervention, frustrated by inconsistent messages and struggling with technical skills in measurement), enabling monitoring and maintaining health (gaging well-being and preventing vascular complications), debilitating and constraining daily living (provoking anxiety and agitation, helpless and powerless and limiting life activities) and burden of medications (overwhelmed by the quantity of tablets and distress from unexpected side effects). Conclusions For children with CKD and their caregivers, blood pressure was an important heath indicator, but uncertainty around its implications and treatment hampered management. Providing educational resources to track blood pressure and minimizing symptoms and treatment burden may improve outcomes in children with CKD.

AB  - There are several controversies in the management of head and neck cancer (SCCHN). Although combined modality treatment is standard in locally advanced SCCHN (LA-SCCHN), the optimal timing of chemotherapy has been debated. Toxicity concerns with chemoradiation (CRT) using high dose cisplatin have prompted use of less intensive approaches. Weekly cisplatin and targeted therapies have been explored in randomized trials. Benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in LA-SCCHN is debated due to lack of impact on overall survival, however, it remains a viable option in the Indian setting where many patients are not eligible for upfront surgery or definite CRT due to advanced stage and poor performance status (PS). The complexity of data of immune check point inhibitors (ICPi) in metastatic setting needs cautious interpretation till an ideal biomarker for their benefit is identified. Their significant cost and promising data of oral metronomic therapy has made the treatment landscape of metastatic SCCHN even more complex. To address these burning issues, we did a critical review of evidence of systemic therapy in SCCHN.

AB  - Objective To study the perinatal outcomes in women with complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing selective fetal reduction using radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods This retrospective study included 44 patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies, between 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, who underwent RFA for selective fetal reduction. Perinatal and maternal outcomes and procedure-related complications were analyzed. Results The procedure was technically successful in all 44 cases. Indications for selective fetal reduction included twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (52.3%), twin reversed arterial perfusion (20.5%), twins discordant for anomaly (15.9%), and selective fetal growth restriction (11.4%). Median gestational age at procedure was 22(2/7) weeks (range 14-26(6/7)). Live birth rate was 77.3% with three neonatal deaths; so overall survival was 70.5%. Median procedure-to-delivery interval was 12(3/7) weeks (range 2(4/7)-23). There were eight losses before 24 weeks of pregnancy, which included two co-twin deaths. Median gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks (interquartile range 32(1/7)-37 weeks). The preterm delivery rate was 66.7% (24/36) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurred in 22.7% (10/44) of patients. Conclusion Selective fetal reduction using RFA is safe and effective in complicated monochorionic pregnancies. However, the rates of PPROM and preterm delivery remain high.

AB  - Background High-quality Basic Life Support (BLS), the first step in the Utstein formula for survival, needs effective education for all kinds of population groups. The feasibility of BLS courses for refugees is not well investigated yet. Methods We conducted BLS courses including automated external defibrillator (AED) training for refugees in Austria from 2016 to 2019. Pre-course and after course attitudes and knowledge towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) were assessed via questionnaires in the individuals' native languages, validated by native speaker interpreters. Results We included 147 participants (66% male; 22 [17-34] years; 28% <18 years) from 19 countries (74% from the Middle East). While the availability of BLS courses in the participants' home countries was low (37%), we noted increased awareness towards CPR and AED use after our courses. Willingness to perform CPR increased from 25% to 99%. A positive impact on the participants' perception of integration into their new environment was noted after CPR training. Higher level of education, male gender, age <18 years and past traumatizing experiences positively affected willingness or performance of CPR. Conclusion BLS education for refugees is feasible and increases their willingness to perform CPR in emergency situations, with the potential to improve survival after cardiac arrest. Individuals with either past traumatizing experiences, higher education or those <18 years might be eligible for advanced life support education. Interestingly, these BLS courses bear the potential to foster resilience and integration. Therefore, CPR education for refuge should be generally offered and further evaluated.

AB  - Introduction Flexible flat foot is one of the most common foot conditions found amongst any age group across the world. One very important reason for this condition is the incongruency or partial dislocation of one or more joints within the talo-tarsal mechanism. This flexible talo-tarsal malalignment is termed as recurrent talo-tarsal joint dislocation (RTTJD). Materials and Methods Between 2016 and 2018, 32 patients were advised Extra osseous talo-tarsal stabilization (EOTTS) as a standalone procedure for RTTJD following detailed clinical examination including foot posture index (FPI) scoring and weight-bearing radiographic evaluation. Subjective assessment was done through Maryland Foot Score (MFS) questionnaire. Radiological parameters like talar declination angle, talar second metatarsal angle and tibio-calcaneal valgus angle were assessed for preoperative and postoperative comparison. 15 patients (20 feet) underwent surgery and rest 17 patients (25 feet) became our control group. A retrospective record analysis of longitudinal data was done over a period of 4 years. The purpose of this study is to depict the short-term results of EOTTS procedure in terms of functional and radiological improvement and compare it with the non-surgical group. Result Significant improvement was seen in MFS from 67.31 +/- 16.04 to 95.47 +/- 4.36 over a mean follow-up period of 30.66 +/- 7.09 months. Total FPI improved by 96.83 +/- 4.80% at final follow-up of EOTTS group. Radiologically, maximum correction achieved was in coronal plane (93.07 +/- 30.05%). Conclusion EOTTS, as a standalone procedure improved the foot radiological angles and restored the normal foot biomechanics significantly in presence of competent spring ligament and posterior tibial tendon. This procedure resulted in excellent patient satisfaction score as assessed by MFS questionnaire.

AB  - Amblyopia is a cause of significant ocular morbidity in pediatric population and may lead to visual impairment in future life. It is caused due to formed visual deprivation or abnormal binocular interactions. Several risk factors in pediatric age group may lead to this disease. Author groups have tried managing different types of amblyopia, like anisometropic amblyopia, strabismic amblyopia and combined mechanism amblyopia, with optical correction, occlusion therapy, penalization, binocular therapy and surgery. We review historical and current management strategies of different types of amblyopia affecting children and outcomes in terms of visual acuity, binocularity and ocular deviation, highlighting evidence from recent studies. Literature searches were performed through Pubmed. Risk factors for amblyopia need to be identified in pediatric population as early in life as possible and managed accordingly, as visual outcomes in amblyopia are best if treated at the earliest. Although, monocular therapies like occlusion or penalization have been shown to be quite beneficial over the years, newer concepts related to binocular vision therapy are still evolving.

AB  - In the present study, we have explored the prognostic value of HuR gene as well as protein in breast cancers. Furthermore, we have also investigated the HuR therapeutic relevance in TNBCs, which is an aggressive breast cancer subtype. Using an online meta-analysis tool, we found that HuR protein overexpression positively correlates with reduced overall survival of TNBC patients (p = 0.028). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TNBC breast cancer cell lines i.e., MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 are good model systems to study HuR protein, as they both exhibit a significant amount of cytoplasmic HuR (active form). Quercetin treatment significantly inhibited the cytoplasmic HuR in both TNBC cell lines. By using specific HuR siRNA, we established that quercetin-mediated inhibition of adhesion and migration of TNBC cells is dependent on HuR. Upon analyzing adhesion proteins i.e., beta-catenin and CD44, we found that quercetin mediated effect on TNBC adhesion and migration was through the HuR-beta-catenin axis and CD44, independently. Overall, the present results demonstrate that elevated HuR levels are associated with TNBC progression and relapse, and the ability of quercetin to inhibit cytoplasmic HuR protein provides a rationale for using it as an anticancer agent for the treatment of aggressive TNBCs.

AB  - Background The burden of stroke is increasing in India; stroke is now the fourth leading cause of death and the fifth leading cause of disability. Previous research suggests that the incidence of stroke in India ranges between 105 and 152/100,000 people per year. However, there is a paucity of available data and a lack of uniform methods across published studies. Aim To identify high-quality prospective studies reporting the epidemiology of stroke in India. Summary of review A search strategy was modified from the Cochrane Stroke Strategy and adapted for a range of bibliographic databases from January 1997 to August 2020. From 7717 identified records, nine studies were selected for inclusion; three population-based registries, a further three population-based registries also using community-based ascertainment and three community-based door-to-door surveys. Studies represented the four cities of Mumbai, Trivandrum, Ludhiana, Kolkata, the state of Punjab, and 12 villages of Baruipur in the state of West Bengal. The total population denominator was 22,479,509 and 11,654 (mean 1294 SD 1710) people were identified with incident stroke. Crude incidence of stroke ranged from 108 to 172/100,000 people per year, crude prevalence from 26 to 757/100,000 people per year, and one-month case fatality rates from 18% to 42%. Conclusions Further high-quality evidence is needed across India to guide stroke policy and inform the development and organization of stroke services. Future researchers should consider the World Health Organization STEPwise approach to Surveillance framework, including longitudinal data collection, the inclusion of census population data, and a combination of hospital-registry and comprehensive community ascertainment strategies to ensure complete stroke identification.

AB  - Objective The study aimed to apply convolutional neural network (CNN) to score periapical lesion on an intraoral periapical radiograph (IOPAR) based on the periapical index (PAI) scoring system. Materials and methods A total of 3000 periapical root areas (PRA) on 1950 digital IOPAR were pre-scored by three endodontists. This data was used to train the CNN model-"YOLO version 3." A total of 450 PRA was used for validation of the model. Data augmentation techniques and model optimization were applied. A total of 540 PRA on 250 digital IOPAR was used to test the performance of the CNN model. Results A total of 303 PRA (56.11%) exhibited true prediction. PAI score 1 showed the highest true prediction (90.9%). PAI scores 2 and 5 exhibited the least true prediction (30% each). PAI scores 3 and 4 had a true prediction of 60% and 71%, respectively. When the scores were dichotomized as healthy (PAI scores 1 and 2) and diseased (PAI score 3, 4, and 5), the model achieved a true prediction of 76.6% and 92%, respectively. The model exhibited a 92.1% sensitivity/recall, 76% specificity, 86.4% positive predictive value/precision, and 86.1% negative predictive value. The accuracy, F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient were 86.3%, 0.89, and 0.71, respectively. Conclusion The CNN model trained on a limited amount of IOPAR data showed potential for PAI scoring of the periapical lesion on digital IOPAR.

AB  - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding. Mild to moderate thrombocytopenia can be seen with thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism. This study was conducted to assess prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in ITP and impact on treatment and outcomes. This prospective study included patients more than 12 years old, diagnosed as ITP. Serum Thyroxine (T4) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone levels and anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies were done by electro- chemiluminescence immunoassay. A total of 168 patients were enrolled, with thyroid function tests available in 146 patients. Mean age was 30.6 years, with 67.8% females (n = 114). Sixty percent patients had chronic ITP and 25% had persistent ITP. Overall prevalence of thyroid disease was 25.7% in the study population, with overt hypothyroidism seen in 21 (16.4%) patients, subclinical hypothyroidism in 9 (7.0%) patients and subclinical thyrotoxicosis in 3 (2.3%) patients, while no patient had overt thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid status of the patients did not correlate with duration of ITP or response to treatment. Presence of anti TPO antibodies was associated with abnormal thyroid function and chronic ITP. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is increased in ITP patients. Many such cases have anti TPO antibodies, suggesting autoimmune pathology. Role of glucocorticoids, estrogens and systemic illness in these findings must be further studied before firm conclusion can be drawn about their routine inclusion in diagnostic work up.

AB  - Thoracic ultrasound is radiation-free, easily available, portable modality with added advantage of real-time assessment. It is useful in mediastinal lesions and peripheral lung, pleural and chest wall masses. Not only is it a valuable modality in differentiating solid from cystic lesion, it can also depict internal architecture without the use of contrast material. The added advantages of its use in children are the lack of ionizing radiation, and no need for sedation or general anesthesia in most cases. Although it has its limitations with a longer learning curve, it can act as a second-line modality to chest radiograph and adjunctive modality to CT in cases of a thoracic mass in a child.

AB  - Objectives To study the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of oral nitrazepam in children with resistant West syndrome (WS). Methods This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in North India from January 2019 to October 2020. Children with WS resistant to standard therapy were enrolled within 7 d of initiation of nitrazepam and prospectively followed-up for cessation of spasms and adverse events. Results Forty-one children with resistant WS initiated on nitrazepam therapy were evaluated. The median age at onset of spasms was 6 mo (Q1, Q3: 4, 8). There was a preponderance of male gender (71%) and structural causes (78%). More than half of the enrolled children had failed four or more antiseizure medications (ASM) for epileptic spasms. The study participants had a long lead-time-to-treatment (LTTT) for the initial standard therapy (median: 2 mo; Q1, Q3: 1, 5) and nitrazepam (median: 11 mo; Q1, Q3: 8, 16). Nitrazepam was instituted as monotherapy in 7 (17%) children and as an adjunct in the rest. Twenty-one (51%) children achieved persistent cessation of epileptic spasms. However, the electroclinical response was observed in 17 (42%) children. Drowsiness, sialorrhea, and decreased appetite were the most commonly observed adverse events. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and did not require dose reduction or change of medication. There was no significant difference between the responders and nonresponders in terms of LTTT, age at onset, or etiology. Conclusions Nitrazepam is a safe and feasible treatment alternative in children with resistant WS resulting in persistent cessation of spasms and electroclinical response in nearly half of patients.

AB  - Background Rising obesity epidemic and dyslipidemia majorly contribute to cardiovascular disease burden. Emerging evidence has reported an increasing trend of metabolic disorders among rural tribal populations in developing countries. Hence, the present study attempts to estimate the prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia and explore their association among Bhil tribal population from India. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study consisting of 277 adults recruited through household survey. Data on socio-demographic and lifestyle variables were collected and obesity was determined using anthropometric measurements. Biochemical assay was done using fasting blood samples. Logistic regression was employed to identify obesity variables associated with dyslipidemia. Results Almost 40% of the population had generalized obesity (high BMI) while abdominal obesity was found to be relatively higher in terms of WHR (76.9%) followed by WHtR (59.2%) and WC (44.8%). Dyslipidemia in form of low HDL-C was found to be highest (52.3%) followed by high TG (40.8%), TC (7.9%), and LDL-C (6.5%). Sex-wise distribution of obesity and dyslipidemia variables revealed women were significantly more obese and dyslipidemic (low HDL-C) as compared to men. Logistic regression analysis after controlling for confounders revealed a significant association of abdominal obesity with all abnormal lipids except for high TG. Conclusion The observed high prevalence of obesity and dyslipidemia, particularly low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridemia, warrants a public health concern. This study emphasizes the need for population-specific disease documentation to highlight underlying mechanisms of risk factors and to set forth a targeted approach to disease treatment and management.

AB  - One major obstacle in designing a successful therapeutic regimen to combat COVID-19 pandemic is the frequent occurrence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 resulting in patient to patient variations. Out of the four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 namely, spike, envelope, nucleocapsid and membrane, envelope protein governs the virus pathogenicity and induction of acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome which is the major cause of death in COVID-19 patients. These effects are facilitated by the viroporin (ion-channel) like activities of the envelope protein. Our current work reports metagenomic analysis of envelope protein at the amino acid sequence level through mining all the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the GISAID and coronapp servers. We found majority of mutations in envelope protein were localized at or near PDZ binding motif. Our analysis also demonstrates that the acquired mutations might have important implications on its structure and ion-channel activity. A statistical correlation between specific mutations (e.g. F4F, R69I, P71L, L73F) with patient mortalities were also observed, based on the patient data available for 18,691 SARS-CoV-2-genomes in the GISAID database till 30 April 2021. Albeit, whether these mutations exist as the cause or the effect of co-infections and/ or co-morbid disorders within COVID-19 patients is still unclear. Moreover, most of the current vaccine and therapeutic interventions are revolving around spike protein. However, emphasizing on envelope protein's (1) conserved epitopes, (2) pathogenicity attenuating mutations, and (3) mutations present in the deceased patients, as reported in our present study, new directions to the ongoing efforts of therapeutic developments against COVID-19 can be achieved by targeting envelope viroporin.

AB  - Background: Nature and intensity of physical activity may influence cognition, coping mechanisms and overall personality of an individual. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare cognition, coping styles and vedic personality among individuals practicing different lifestyle.
   Methods: Thirty-nine healthy young adults of both gender (27.63 +/- 4.04 years) were recruited and cate-gorized into three groups; i.e. yoga, physical activity or sedentary lifestyle groups. Participants were as-sessed on cognition, coping styles and Vedic personality inventory (VPI). Verbal-n-back and Stroop tasks were performed using 3 Tesla MRI scanner. Task Based Connectivity (TBC) analysis was done using CONN toolbox in SPM.
   Results: There were no significant differences in the cognitive domains across the groups. The planning (p = 0.03) and acceptance domain (p = 0.03) of the Brief COPE scale showed difference across the groups. Post-hoc analysis revealed that planning and acceptance scores were distinctly higher in the physical activity group, however, there was no difference between physical activity group and yoga practition-ers. Similarly, in the VPI, Sattva (p = 0.003), Rajas (p = 0.05) and Tamas (p = 0.01) were different across the groups, and the post hoc analysis showed superiority in Sattva scores in Yoga group, meanwhile, both Rajas and Tamas were higher in the physical activity group. Yoga practitioners preferentially recruited left Superior Frontal Gyrus in relation to the physically active group and precuneus in relation to the sedentary lifestyle group.
   Conclusion: The study revealed that yoga practitioners had a distinct higher sattva guna and preferentially recruited brain areas associated with self-regulation and inhibitory control. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine.

AB  - Purpose To examine the association between near work, screen time including TV and outdoor time with myopia in children from the Sunflower Myopia Asian Eye Epidemiology Consortium (AEEC).
   Methods We analysed AEEC cross-sectional data (12 241 children) on risk factors (near work, screen time including TV and outdoor time) and myopia of six population-based studies (China, Hong Kong and Singapore). Cycloplegic refraction and axial length (AL) measurements were included. Risk factors were determined using questionnaires. Data were pooled from each study, and multivariable regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between risks factors and myopia, spherical equivalent (SE) and AL.
   Results Among the included children, 52.1% were boys, 98.1% were Chinese and 69.7% lived in urban areas. Mean +/- standard deviation (SD) for age was 8.8 +/- 2.9 years, for SE was -0.14 +/- 1.8 D and for AL was 23.3 +/- 1.1 mm. Myopia prevalence was 30.6%. In multivariate analysis, more reading and writing (OR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.11-1.24), more total near work (OR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09) and less outdoor time (OR = 0.82, 95% CI, 0.75-0.88) were associated with myopia (p's < 0.05). These factors were similarly associated with SE and AL (p's < 0.05), except for total near work and AL (p = 0.15). Screen time including TV was not significantly associated with myopia (p = 0.49), SE (p = 0.49) or AL (p = 0.83).
   Conclusion In this study, increased reading and writing and decreased outdoor time were associated with myopia. Screen time may be a surrogate factor of near work or outdoor time, but further research is needed to assess its role as an independent risk factor for myopia.

AB  - Lactational breast abscess results from inadequate or partially treated mastitis. Recently, needle aspiration or catheter suction drainage is being adopted in place of incision and drainage. We planned to evaluate the effectiveness of needle aspiration versus vacuum suction drainage in resolution of puerperal breast abscess. One-hundred-twelve mothers with lactational breast abscess were randomized to either ultrasound-guided needle aspiration or vacuum suction drainage. These patients were followed up on alternate days and assessed for complete resolution of breast abscess, pain in the breast on Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 0-10, day of return to normal breast feeding, number of aspirations needed, recurrence of abscess and total cost of care. In the suction drain group, 98% of mothers enjoyed complete resolution within 10 days as compared to 87% of mothers treated with needle aspiration. Mean VAS at first follow-up was 2.89 in aspiration group and 2.62 in suction group. The VAS reduced to 0.74 in aspiration group and 0.53 in suction drainage group, at the last follow-up. The mean day of recovery was 7 days for aspiration and 5.73 days for suction. Most patients required 3 aspirations. The mean drainage time was 4.5 days. Vacuum suction drainage is the more effective method for achieving resolution of lactational breast abscess and offers greater patient satisfaction compared to needle aspiration.

AB  - Neuro-ophthalmic features are a known association in tuberculosis, especially common in central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS-TB). They are mostly the result of the visual pathway and/or ocular motor and other cranial nerve involvement. Furthermore, toxic optic neuropathy and paradoxical response to anti-tubercular drugs (ATT) are also not uncommon. The etiopathogenesis is by the complex interplay of various factors like exudates, vasculitis, arachnoiditis, presence of tuberculomas, hydrocephalus, brain infarcts and/or immune-mediated reaction. The entity often poses a diagnostic dilemma for the ophthalmologists/neuro-ophthalmologists and may lead to irreversible vision loss. The presence of neuro-ophthalmic features not only affect the visual outcome but are also predictors of systemic morbidity of the disease. Therefore, understanding and knowledge about this entity are necessary for the comprehensive management of the disease. While various forms of TB including CNS-TB have been well-dealt with in literature, little is discussed specifically about the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of tuberculosis. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to highlight current understanding of the types of neuro-ophthalmic involvement in tuberculosis, its etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and management.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the presence of developmental dental anomalies, like microdontia, hypodontia, abnormally shaped teeth (AST), and developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in childhood cancer survivors and compare it with the healthy controls. Methods This cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 2 groups: childhood cancer survivors (CCS) group including children (> 12 y, m/f) who had undergone anticancer therapy (ACT) before 8 y of age and healthy control group (> 12 y, m/f) without any systemic disease. Pearson chi-square test was used to analyze the difference between the CCS group and the control group for microdontia, hypodontia, AST, DDE and for intragroup analysis in CCS group. Odds ratio was also calculated. Results A total of 120 and 121 children were included in CCS and control group, respectively. The prevalence of microdontia, hypodontia, abnormally shaped teeth, and DDE was 17.5% (21), 5% (6), 8.33% (10), and 37.5% (45), respectively in CCS group. It was 8.2% (10), 2.5% (3), 1.65% (2), and 22.3% (27), respectively in the control group. A statistically significant difference was seen in microdontia (p = 0.032), abnormally shaped teeth (p = 0.017) and DDE (p = 0.01). Higher prevalence was seen when ACT began at an early age. Conclusion An association between developmental dental anomalies and anticancer therapy (ACT) exists with significantly higher difference in microdontia, abnormally shaped teeth and DDE among survivors of childhood cancer as compared to healthy population. These known adverse effects of ACT on developing teeth should be considered during treatment planning of the children having cancers.

AB  - In this study, Rhodococcus pyridinivorans cells containing hyperactive acyltransferase was immobilized on various macromolecules based-polymeric matrices and used to improve acetohydroxamic acid production. The calcium-alginate-based matrix retained the maximum residual activity up to 97.8% as compared to free cells (576 U/mg of dry cell weight). After immobilization, cells exhibited a significant improvement in their tolerance towards pH, temperature, and metal ions as potent enzyme inhibitors. Immobilized cells showed 25.5-fold higher thermal stability at 60 degrees C to control (free cells). Compared to free cells, immobilized cells exhibited a high bioconversion of acetamide and hydroxylamine-HCl to acetohydroxamic acid up to 96% molar conversion. Repeated bench-scale production at 3-L culture, immobilized cells showed 9.5-fold higher residual conversion as compared to control (100%), after five cycles of reuses. The product characterization achieved high purity (97%) of acetohydroxamic acid. This finding showed high feasibility to achieve efficient conversion that can be scaled up to the industrial level for biotechnological application.

AB  - Background States which reduce foetal oxygen delivery are associated with impaired intrauterine growth. Hypoxia results when barometric pressure falls with ascent to altitude, and with it the partial pressure of inspired oxygen ('hypobaric hypoxia'). birthweight is reduced when native lowlanders gestate at such high altitude (HA)-an effect mitigated in native (millennia) HA populations. Studying HA populations offer a route to explore the mechanisms by which hypoxia impacts foetal growth. Methods Between February 2017 and January 2019, we prospectively studied 316 pregnant women, in Leh, Ladakh (altitude 3524 m, where oxygen partial pressure is reduced by 1/3) and 101 pregnant women living in Delhi (low altitude, 216 m above sea level). Results Of Ladakhi HA newborns, 14% were small for gestational age (<10th birthweight centile) vs 19% of newborn at low altitude. At HA, increased maternal body mass index, age, and uterine artery (UtA) diameter were positively associated with growth >10th weight centile. Conclusions This study showed that Ladakhi offspring birthweight is relatively spared from the expected adverse HA effects. Furthermore, maternal body composition and greater UtA size may be physiological HA adaptations and warrant further study, as they offer potential mechanisms to overcome hypoxia-related growth issues.

   Reduced foetal oxygen delivery seen in native lowlanders who gestate at HA causes foetal growth restriction-an effect thought to be mitigated in native HA populations. We found that greater maternal body mass and UtA diameter were associated with increased offspring birthweight in a (Ladakh) HA population. This supports a role for them as physiological mediators of adaptation and provides insights into potential mechanisms that may treat hypoxia-related growth issues.

AB  - To develop a semi-automatic framework for quantitative analysis of biochemical properties and thickness of femur cartilage using magnetic resonance (MR) images and evaluate its potential for femur cartilage classification into asymptomatic (AS), early osteoarthritis (OA), and advanced OA groups. In this study, knee joint MRI data (fat suppressed-proton density-weighted and multi-echo T2-weighted images) of eight AS-volunteers (data acquired twice) and 34 OA patients including 20 early OA (16 Grade-I and 4 Grade-II), 14 advanced-OA (Grade-III) were acquired at 3.0T MR scanner. Modified Outerbridge classification criteria was performed for the clinical evaluation of data by an experienced radiologist. Cartilage segmentation, T2-mapping, 2D-WearMap generation, and subregion analysis were performed semi-automatically using in-house developed algorithms. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were computed for testing the reproducibility of T2 values. One-way analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer post hoc test was performed for evaluating the differences among the groups. The performance of individual T2 and thickness, as well as their combination using logistic regression, were evaluated with receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The interscan agreement based on the ICC index was 0.95 and the CV was 2.45 +/- 1.33%. T2 mean of values greater than 75th percentile showed sensitivity and specificity of 94.1% and 81.3% (AUC = 0.93, cut-off value = 47.9 ms) in differentiating AS volunteers versus OA group, while sensitivity and specificity of 90.0% and 81.3% (AUC = 0.90, cut-off value = 47.9 ms) in differentiating AS volunteers versus early OA groups, respectively. In the differentiation of early OA versus advanced-OA group, ROC results of combination (T2 and thickness) showed the highest sensitivity and specificity of 85.7%, and 70.0% (AUC = 0.79, cut-off value = 0.39) compared with individual T2 and thickness features, respectively. A computer-aided quantitative evaluation of femur cartilage degeneration showed promising results and can be used to assist clinicians in diagnosing OA.

AB  - Objectives To detail the spectrum of movement disorders (MD) among children with cerebral palsy (CP) and assess impact on functional status. Methods In this cross-sectional study, children with CP were recruited and examined for various MDs. Tone abnormality was assessed using Hypertonia Assessment Tool (HAT), functional status using Gross Motor Function Classification System Expanded and Revised (GMFCS E&R), Manual Ability Classification System (MACS), and Communication Function Classification System (CFCS). These scores were classified into mild-moderate (level I-III)/severe (level IV-V) categories. Results A total of 113 children (mean age 4.9 +/- 3.4 y, 66.4% boys) were enrolled. MDs were noted in 52 (46%) children; the most frequent were dystonia (28%), chorea (14%), choreoathetosis (8%). Of 64 children with quadriparetic CP, 27 (42.2%) demonstrated MDs. Of 19 children with hemiparetic CP, 2 (10.5%) had MDs. Of 16 children with dyskinetic CP, 15 (93%) had MDs. Children with dyskinetic CP had significantly higher frequency of MDs (p = 0.001). There was no difference in occurrence of all MDs or dystonia aloneamongst the two categories (mild-moderate/severe) of GMFCS E&R levels, CFCS levels or MACS levels. Conclusion Although diverse MDs occur frequently in CP, these do not correlate with the broad functional status of the child. The study is limited by small sample size.

AB  - The red blood cell distribution width (RDW), an indicator of anisocytosis has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in this ongoing context of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the utility of RDW in the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. A comprehensive screening of electronic databases was performed up to 30th April 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42020206685). Observational studies or interventional studies, evaluating the impact of RDW in COVID-19 outcomes (mortality and severity) are included in this meta-analysis.Our search retrieved 25 studies, with a total of 18,392 and 3,446 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher RDW levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.31-0.71; I-2 = 88% and SMD = 0.46; 95%CI 0.26-0.67; I-2 = 60%, respectively). In a sub-group analysis of 2,980 patients, RDW > 14.5 has been associated with increased risk of mortality (OR = 2.73; 95%CI 1.96-3.82; I-2 = 56%). However, the evidences is of low quality. A higher level of RDW on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, further studies regarding the cut-off value of RDW are the need of the hour.

AB  - Ultrasonography (US) forms the mainstay of imaging in children; however, in the chest, its use has traditionally been limited to evaluation of pleural pathology. US techniques such as endobronchial and endoscopic ultrasound, which are commonly used for detection of mediastinal lymphadenopathy are invasive, aerosol generating, and often require sedation. Transcutaneous mediastinal sonography (TMUS) offers a useful alternative, which is easier to perform and overcomes these limitations. In this review, we summarize the technique, as well as imaging appearances of lymph nodes on TMUS. We also list common problems faced by operators and suggest troubleshooting methods for these.

AB  - Several scoring scales for the assessment of microsurgical skills have been established and validated with the same basic parameters. The study aims to review the existing scales to highlight those parameters, which can be utilized uniformly across all neurosurgical training centers. An online search was conducted and all the surgical scores pertinent to microsurgical suturing were reviewed. The scales were compared to identify parameters, which were important for skill development and assessment in neurosurgical trainees. Seven assessment scales were identified which assessed the trainee's proficiency in microsurgical suturing. The objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) and Northwestern Objective Microanastomosis Assessment Tool (NOMAT) were identified as the most widely used and validated assessment scales. The newer scales University of Western Ontario microsurgical skills acquisition/assessment (UWOMSA) and structured assessment of microsurgery (SAMS) were notable for the division of the skills. The knot strength, suture separation, and suture intervals were the most important parameters in all scales. Each scale has its strength in the assessment of the microsurgical proficiency of neurosurgical trainees. However, a more uniform scale that can be applied as per the level of the neurosurgical trainee is necessary.

AB  - Objective To implement an advanced spatial penalty-based reconstruction to constrain the intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM)-diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) model and investigate whether it provides a suitable alternative at 1.5 T to the traditional IVIM-DKI model at 3 T for clinical characterization of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Materials and methods Thirty-two patients with biopsy-proven PCa were recruited for MRI examination (n = 16 scanned at 1.5 T, n = 16 scanned at 3 T). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 13 b values (b = 0 to 2000 s/mm(2) up to 3 averages, 1.5 T: TR = 5.774 s, TE = 81 ms and 3 T: TR = 4.899 s, TE = 100 ms), T2-weighted, and T1-weighted imaging were used on the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI scanner, respectively. The IVIM-DKI signal was modeled using the traditional IVIM-DKI model and a novel model in which the total variation (TV) penalty function was combined with the traditional model to optimize non-physiological variations. Paired and unpaired t-tests were used to compare intra-scanner and scanner group differences in IVIM-DKI parameters obtained using the novel and the traditional models. Analysis of variance with post hoc test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to assess the ability of parameters obtained using the novel model (at 1.5 T) and the traditional model (at 3 T) to characterize prostate lesions. Results IVIM-DKI modeled using novel model with TV spatial penalty function at 1.5 T, produced parameter maps with 50-78% lower coefficient of variation (CV) than traditional model at 3 T. Novel model estimated higher D with lower D*, f and k values at both field strengths compared to traditional model. For scanner differences, the novel model at 1.5 T estimated lower D* and f values as compared to traditional model at 3 T. At 1.5 T, D and f values were significantly lower with k values significantly higher in tumor than BPH and healthy tissue. D (AUC: 0.98), f (AUC: 0.82), and k (AUC: 0.91) parameters estimated using novel model showed high diagnostic performance in cancer lesion detection at 1.5 T. Discussion In comparison with the IVIM-DKI model at 3 T, IVIM-DKI signal modeled with the TV penalty function at 1.5 T showed lower estimation errors. The proposed novel model can be utilized for improved detection of prostate lesions.

AB  - Background During flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy through the nasal route, anaesthesia of the nasal passage is achieved by lignocaine gel application by a slip-tip syringe or with the help of a cotton tip swab. No studies in existing literature have compared the two techniques in terms of efficacy. Methods 137 consecutive patients undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were recruited over a 2-year period. The patients underwent BAL after nasal anaesthesia-either by slip-tip syringe or by cotton tip swab smeared with 2% lignocaine gel. Patients were monitored for intraprocedural epistaxis, discomfort and improvement in operator visibility of nasal passage. Results 67 patients were randomised to cotton swab and 70 patients to the gel instillation group. There were no significant differences in terms of epistaxis, 29.9% in the cotton tip swab (95% CI 19.3% to 42.3%) versus 24.3% in the gel instillation group (95% CI 14.8% to 36%) or detection of nasal blocks, 7.5% in the cotton tip swab (95% CI 2.5% to 16.6%) versus 10% in the gel instillation group (95% CI 4.1% to 19.5%) in the two groups, although a significant difference was there in terms of visibility, 73.1% in the cotton tip swab (95% CI 60.9% to 83.2%) versus 42.9% in the gel instillation group (95% CI 31.1% to 55.3%). There was no difference in the mean pain score across the two groups either during the procedure or 1 hour after it. A short systematic review of existing literature on the topic has been provided for comparison. Conclusion Application of 2% lignocaine gel by slip-tip syringe and cotton tip swab are equivalent in terms of observed and narrated pain experienced by patients, frequency of epistaxis and nasal blocks. Vision was better preserved in the cotton tip swab group.

AB  - There is paucity of evidence regarding relative performance of antibiotic-medicated (AM), silver-medicated (SM) and non-medicated (NM) ventricular catheters in controlling infection rate. We aim to quantitatively synthesize the current evidence after addition of the three-armed British Antibiotic and Silver Impregnated Catheters for ventriculoperitoneal Shunts (BASICS) trial, understand the need for further evidence using trial sequential analysis (TSA) and incorporate the indirect evidence using network meta-analysis (NMA). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing AM, SM and NM ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) or external ventricular drain (EVD) were included. Antibiotic-medicated VPS show a significantly lower infection rate as compared to non-medicated VPS (RR 0.44; 95% CI: 0.27-0.73; p = 0.001), however, TSA reveals need for further evidence. SM including both EVD as well as VPS were found to be inferior to AM while no significant difference was found in comparison to the NM catheters. In NMA for VPS, the AM were found to be significantly better than SM (RR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.22-0.75) as well as NM (RR 0.42; 95% CI: 0.25-0.71) with a SUCRA of 99.8% and a mean rank of 1. However, antibiotic medicated shunts did not show a statistically significant association with reoperation rate (RR 0.99; 95% CI:0.81-1.20; p = 0.9) with no further need for evidence as per TSA.

AB  - Objective Liver biopsy is still needed for fibrosis staging in many patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aims of this study were to evaluate the individual diagnostic performance of liver stiffness measurement by vibration controlled transient elastography (LSM-VCTE), Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4) and NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) Fibrosis Score (NFS) and to derive diagnostic strategies that could reduce the need for liver biopsies. Design Individual patient data meta-analysis of studies evaluating LSM-VCTE against liver histology was conducted. FIB-4 and NFS were computed where possible. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) were calculated. Biomarkers were assessed individually and in sequential combinations. Results Data were included from 37 primary studies (n=5735; 45% women; median age: 54 years; median body mass index: 30 kg/m(2); 33% had type 2 diabetes; 30% had advanced fibrosis). AUROCs of individual LSM-VCTE, FIB-4 and NFS for advanced fibrosis were 0.85, 0.76 and 0.73. Sequential combination of FIB-4 cut-offs (<1.3; >= 2.67) followed by LSM-VCTE cut-offs (<8.0; >= 10.0 kPa) to rule-in or rule-out advanced fibrosis had sensitivity and specificity (95% CI) of 66% (63-68) and 86% (84-87) with 33% needing a biopsy to establish a final diagnosis. FIB-4 cut-offs (<1.3; >= 3.48) followed by LSM cut-offs (<8.0; >= 20.0 kPa) to rule out advanced fibrosis or rule in cirrhosis had a sensitivity of 38% (37-39) and specificity of 90% (89-91) with 19% needing biopsy. Conclusion Sequential combinations of markers with a lower cut-off to rule-out advanced fibrosis and a higher cut-off to rule-in cirrhosis can reduce the need for liver biopsies.

AB  - A 45-year-old male presented with a slowly progressive, painless swelling in his right eye for the past 6 months. He had undergone an open globe injury repair 10 years back and an eventful cataract surgery 5 years back. The presenting visual acuity in the affected eye was perception of light with inaccurate projection of rays. The intraocular pressure was 44 mm Hg with advanced glaucomatous cupping. The swelling was identified to be a communicating sub-tenon cyst secondary to scleral wound dehiscence from secondary angle closure glaucoma. Wound re-suturing, cyst excision and diode laser cyclophotocoagulation was performed in a single sitting, with explained poor visual prognosis.

AB  - Majority of the studies from the Indian subcontinent have focused on the analysis of surgical training from the mentor's point of view, i.e. a top-down approach. In the present pilot study, we analysed the quality of Surgical Gastroenterology program at two of the most reputed teaching hospitals of the country by the means of feedback from the residents. The study was conducted using an objective questionnaire through the SurveyMonkey portal. The responses were objectively assessed on a Likert scale and analysed using the Z test of significance. There were a total of 113 participants from both the institutes (Male: 110; Female: 3). Majority of the residents reported overall satisfaction with the training program at both the institutes (Median score: 4-5 for most parameters). There was a higher level of satisfaction with hands-on training in the public sector (71 vs 46%; p < 0.01) and a greater level of satisfaction with research and publications noted in the private sector (87 vs 72%; p = 0.04). A higher preference to diversify into liver transplantation was noted in the residents trained from the private sector compared to the public sector. Lack of exposure to minimally invasive surgeries was a drawback noted in both private and public sector. Even though the results cannot represent the entire surgical gastroenterology training fraternity of India, the results could be used to improve other programmes. Areas of potential improvement could be hands-on exposure for residents in the private sector and wider exposure to advanced minimal access surgery and liver transplantation in the public sector.

TI  - Combined Frozen Section and Imprint Smear Assessment of Sentinel Node Improves Accuracy and Reduces False Negative Rates in Breast Cancer: A Prospective Study
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - Breast cancer
KW  - Sentinel lymph node
KW  - Axillary status
KW  - Intra-operative assessment
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard of care for clinically negative operable breast cancer. However, the best technique for intra-operative assessment of SLN still remains a matter of research. Accuracy of frozen section (FS), which is widely used for detecting metastasis in SLN varies from 79 to 89% with false negative rate being 5.5 to 43%. This study was hence done to evaluate if combined intraoperative FS and imprint cytology (IC) evaluation improves accuracy and reduces false negative rate for SLN evaluation in breast cancer. In this prospective cohort study, patients with operable breast cancer with negative axillary lymph node status (N0) were included. SLNB was done using combination technique with a radionuclide tracer and blue dye. Smears were prepared from SLNs for imprint cytology evaluation and excised SLNs were then sent for frozen section. Diagnostic indices of frozen section, imprint cytology, and combined technique were assessed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, likelihood ratios, false negative rate, and overall accuracy with 95% confidence intervals taking final histopathology as "gold standard." Eighty-one cases of SLNB in which both FS and IC reports were available were included for analysis. Sensitivity (93.8%; CI 69.8-99.8%), specificity (100%; CI 89.3-100%), positive predictive value (100%; CI 66.3-100%), negative predictive value (98.4%; CI 91.6-100%), false negative rate (6.25%), and overall diagnostic accuracy (98.7%) of combined evaluation were superior as compared to either of the techniques. Combination of frozen section and imprint cytology has better diagnostic accuracy and reduced false negative rate as compared to either of them alone.

AB  - Surgery remains the cornerstone in management of breast lumps. Breast conservation surgery (BCS) entails removal of disease with negative histopathological margins and satisfactory cosmesis. The adoption of mammoplasty techniques amongst surgeons have enabled them to improve the number of patients deemed suitable for BCS without having obvious breast asymmetry and unsightly scars. We herein describe our experience with round block technique (RBT). This is retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with carcinoma breast and benign fibro-epithelial lesions (fibroadenoma and benign phyllodes) operated by RBT from September 2016 to January 2020. Patients with lesions in retroareolar, peri-areolar region, and close to skin were excluded. The study evaluated adequacy of surgical resection as assessed by negative margins on histopathology and post-operative cosmesis. Post-operative cosmesis was assessed on a Likert scale (incorporating breast ptosis and symmetry) by patient and doctor independently at 1 month post-surgery. During the study period, 20 patients (15 patients carcinoma breast and 5 benign fibroepithelial lesion) underwent BCS by RBT. All 20 patients achieved adequate resection with negative margins on histopathology. Patient-reported outcomes for cosmesis were excellent 4 patients, good 15 patients, fair none, and poor 1 patient. The same as done by doctor was excellent in 4 patients, good in 14, and fair and poor in 1 each. Correlation coefficient between outcomes rated by the patient and doctors was 0.945. No nipple-areola necrosis was seen. Round block technique is safe and versatile option for patients wanting BCS with good post-operative cosmetic outcome with satisfactory oncological outcome.

AB  - Background/objectives: The conventional modality for management of advanced invasive ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) (AJCC grade T4 and T3 with fornicial involvement) is surgical excision which is not only challenging in terms of ability to achieve tumor free margins and tissue reconstruction but also has high morbidity. We describe the use of systemic neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in cases of advanced invasive OSSN. Subjects/methods: This is a retrospective case series. Five cases of histopathologically proven advanced OSSN that were challenging to manage with surgical excision or required exenteration were treated with NAC. Demographic details, previous treatment history, location and extent of tumor, imaging findings, number of cycles and duration of NAC, response to treatment, and final outcome on follow-up were noted. Results: A remarkable response to NAC was seen in 4/5(80%) cases. Complete regression was seen in 2/5, partial regression in 2/5, and no response in 1/5 cases. In 75% (3/4) cases who showed response to NAC, minimal or no surgery was required. Exenteration was avoided in 2/3 cases with orbital extension. Conclusion: NAC appears to be an exciting option for management of surgically challenging cases of invasive OSSN and may be helpful in avoiding orbital exenteration. However, more studies are required to explore this treatment option.

KW  - Bowel obstruction
AB  - Intestinal lymphoma, although rare, is the second most common extra-nodal site of lymphoma, following stomach. It is usually secondary to systemic involvement and is predominantly of non-Hodgkin's subtype. In addition to the risk factors for lymphomas occurring elsewhere, certain risk factors are specific for intestinal lymphoma. These include enteropathies such as celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Imaging is the cornerstone in the management of intestinal lymphoma. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography or positron emission tomography-computed tomography are the preferred modalities for diagnosis, staging, monitoring response to treatment, and for follow-up evaluation. Bowel lymphomas can have various morphological patterns on imaging; however, certain characteristic features, if present, may prove invaluable in its diagnosis. Hence, it is imperative to be acquainted with the myriad of imaging findings in bowel lymphoma and its complications which may not only help in vivo distinction from other commoner bowel lesions but alter the management accordingly.

AB  - Purpose There is paucity of data regarding T-cells in paediatric AML patients. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate trend of T-cell subset during disease course of paediatric AML patients and to see its correlation with patient characteristics and survival outcome. Methods T-cell subsets (CD3, CD4 and CD8) were evaluated by flow-cytometry at diagnosis, post-induction, post-treatment completion, at 3 months and 6 months post-treatment completion, and relapse in 29 pediatric AML patients. Trend of T-cells was plotted between group A (those in continuous remission) and group B (those who relapsed) patients. Results Patients with high WBC count had significantly higher number of CD3, CD4 and CD8 cell. Baseline Tcell subsets did not affect CR, EFS and OS; however, higher than median CD4 count predicted improved DFS [58% vs 25%; HR = 0.306 (0.10-0.93); P = 0.037]. On serial follow-up from post-induction till 3 months after completion of therapy, there was no difference in the absolute values of T cell subsets between group A and B patients. Conclusion Our study demonstrated T cell subsets are increased in AML subjects with high WBC count. CD4 cells have a positive impact on DFS. Serial follow-up has no impact on T cell subsets. Further studies in larger patient cohorts are needed to evaluate if CD4 population may serve as an immune biomarker for AML.

AB  - Presence of hardware in juxta-articular location poses challenge during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). When present in distal femur, it precludes the use of an intramedullary femoral jig during TKA often necessitating removal of hardware leading to prolonged surgery, higher risk of complications, and inferior results. We conducted a case-control study to assess the outcome of TKA among patients with post-traumatic arthritis using a handheld navigation system to perform bone cuts allowing retention of hardware in situ. In 15 patients with post-traumatic arthritis and hardware around the knee (Group A), none or part(s) of hardware were removed while performing TKA. These patients were matched to 15 patients who underwent TKA with handheld navigation for primary OA knee (Group B). The perioperative outcomes assessed were operative time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, complications, and 30 days reoperation rate. Clinical outcomes were assessed by using Knee Society Score (KSS) and radiological outcomes using mechanical axis and coronal and sagittal component angles. Mean age of patients at surgery were 65.67 years (Group A) and 66.73 years (Group B). Mean operative time and blood loss were significantly higher in Group A as compared with Group B. At the mean follow-up of 34 months, KSS significantly improved in both the groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the clinical and radiological outcomes between the two groups. One patient in Group A developed wound dehiscence and had to undergo debridement and flap coverage within 30 days. The use of navigation helps surgeons in gaining proper limb alignment and implant positioning without complete removal of hardware.

AB  - Microvillous inclusion disease (MVID), also known as congenital microvillus atrophy remains an important differential diagnosis of intractable secretory diarrhea in neonatal period. The condition is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder with no sex predilection and more commonly reported in those tribes with consanguineous marriages. The pathognomonic electron microscopic findings includes villous atrophy with the formation of intracellular microvillous inclusions. Definite treatment includes either isolated small bowel or combined small bowel and liver transplantation. Herein, we are describing a case of intractable diarrhea in a preterm neonate with MVID phenotype presented on second day of life with intractable diarrhea. The diagnosis was established by classical electron microscopic findings in the intestinal biopsy sample.

KW  - TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - Background: India's National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP) provides free diagnosis and treatment services but does not monitor TB-related costs. This study aimed to estimate the direct and indirect costs borne by adult patients with newly diagnosed TB.
   Methods: A longitudinal study in Ballabgarh block, Haryana (North India) was conducted. A total of 110 patients were interviewed and data regarding costs were collected at three points of time (after diagnosis, at the end of intensive phase and at the end of the treatment) using a semistructured questionnaire. The total direct (out-of-pocket expenses) and indirect (income lost) costs before and during treatment were calculated for patients who completed the treatment.
   Results: We enrolled 110 patients with drug-sensitive TB; 6 patients could not complete the treatment. The TB-related median total cost was US$150 (IQR 65-335). The median prediagnosis and postdiagnosis costs were US$42 (IQR 19-313) and US$63 (IQR 10.2-190), respectively. The median direct and indirect costs were US$75 (IQR 36-148) and US$16 (IQR 0-197), respectively. A catastrophic cost was experienced by 18% (95% CI 12 to 27%) of households.
   Conclusion: Despite free diagnosis and treatment services, there is a substantial TB-related cost for TB care under the NTEP. Accelerated efforts are needed to achieve the target of zero catastrophic cost.

AB  - The lack of consensual measures to monitor core change in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or response to interventions leads to difficulty to prove intervention efficacy on ASD core symptoms. There are no universally accepted outcome measures developed for measuring changes in core symptoms. However, the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale) is one of the outcomes recommended in the EMA Guideline on the clinical development of medicinal products for the treatment of ASD. Unfortunately, there is currently no consensus on the response definition for CARS among individuals with ASD. The aim of this elicitation process was to determine an appropriate definition of a response on the CARS2 scale for interventions in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An elicitation process was conducted following the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF). Five experts in the field of ASD and two experts in expert knowledge elicitation participated in an 1-day elicitation workshop. Experts in ASD were previously trained in the SHELF elicitation process and received a dossier of scientific evidence concerning the topic. The response definition was set as the mean clinically relevant improvement averaged over all patients, levels of functioning, age groups and clinicians. Based on the scientific evidence and expert judgment, a normal probability distribution was agreed to represent the state of knowledge of this response with expected value 4.03 and standard deviation 0.664. Considering the remaining uncertainty of the estimation and the available literature, a CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points has been defined as a threshold to conclude to a response after an intervention. A CARS-2 improvement of 4.5 points could be used to evaluate interventions' meaningfulness in indivudals. This initial finding represents an important new benchmark and may aid decision makers in evaluating the efficacy of interventions in ASD.

AB  - Despite achieving remarkable success in understanding the cellular, molecular and pathophysiological aspects of stroke, translation from preclinical research has always remained an area of debate. Although thousands of experimental compounds have been reported to be neuro-protective, their failures in clinical setting have left the researchers and stakeholders in doldrums. Though the failures described have been excruciating, they also give us a chance to refocus on the shortcomings. For better translational value, evidences from preclinical studies should be robust and reliable. Preclinical study design has a plethora of variables affecting the study outcome. Hence, this review focusses on the factors to be considered for a well-planned preclinical study while adhering to guidelines with emphasis on the study design, commonly used animal models, their limitations with special attention on various preventable attritions including comorbidities, aged animals, time of dosing, outcome measures and physiological variables along with the concept of multicentric preclinical randomized controlled trials. Here, we provide an overview of a panorama of practical aspects, which could be implemented, so that a well-defined preclinical study would result in a neuro-protectant with better translational value.

AB  - Being an author of a scientific publication has academic, social, and financial implications. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICJME) guidelines that are followed by various biomedical journals clearly state the criteria for considering a researcher as an author for a scientific publication. As per this understanding, all authors of a research work have equal contribution towards the publication. The Medical Council of India, however, credits only the first three authors and the corresponding author for academic progression. The present view highlights this irony and suggests that all authors in a manuscript should be considered equal irrespective of their position in the authorship list.

AB  - Extraglottic airway devices (EAD) have revolutionized the perioperative airway management. The accuracy of clinical tests to identify malposition has been questioned by recent studies where fibreoptic evaluation identified various malpositions that were undiagnosed by a clinical test. Ultrasound (USG) has evolved to guide various airway interventions. However, USG is under-evaluated in the assessment of the EADs position. Our study aimed to compare clinical versus USG assessment of optimal placement of ProSeal laryngeal mask airway (PLMA). This randomized control trial was done in 212 consenting patients undergoing onco-surgery with PLMA as an airway device. Patients were randomized in Group CL (n-107) and US (n-105). Following primary assessment-using clinical tests and USG evaluation using a scoring system, fibreoptic evaluation of the placement of PLMA was done and then assessed for optimal position. The accuracy of each technique for optimal placement was compared statistically. We found that the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical evaluation were 98.77% and 34.62% with a diagnostic accuracy of 83.18% when compared with fibreoptic evaluation. While USG evaluation using the scoring system has sensitivity and specificity of 95.45% and 29.41% with a diagnostic accuracy of 84.76%. It was noted that USG assessment has a higher positive predictive value (87.5%) as compared to clinical assessment (82.47%). The incidence of rotation was higher in the clinical group. There was no difference in airway related morbidity. USG is comparable to clinical tests for evaluation of the optimal placement of PLMA. However, USG has various advantages over clinical assessment as it is quick and identifies the unacceptable placement of PLMA where the tip of PLMA may not lie over the tip of the esophagus, thereby, avoiding unnecessary mucosal injury during forceful or repeated attempts for gastric drainage tube insertion.

AB  - Introduction Injury to the pancreas may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. We aim to assess pancreatic endocrine and exocrine functions and evaluated morphological regenerations of pancreas following partial pancreatectomy in patients with pancreatic trauma. Methods The study was performed between June 2016 and December 2017. Endocrine functions were assessed at the time of admission and at 6 months follow-up with 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), serum insulin and C-peptide levels and HbA1c estimation and exocrine functions were assessed with fecal elastase test. Pancreatic volumetry was done with imaging scan at 1 month and 6 months post discharge. Results Twenty patients were studied with a median age of 30 years (range18-48) at the time of injury. All the patients were normoglycemic on admission; only one patient who underwent pancreatic resection developed diabetes mellitus at follow-up. Eight patients (40%) were found to be prediabetic by American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria. Eleven patients (55%) had pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Pancreatic volume increment, from the mean pancreatic volume of 48.65 to 54.29 cm(3), was noted in patients who underwent partial pancreatectomy. Conclusions Patients with pancreatic trauma may develop biochemical endocrine and exocrine insufficiencies following pancreatic resection. Pancreatic volume increment requires further research in a larger study.

AB  - Background:
   About 18%-65% of Arterio-Venous fistula (AVF) made to facilitate haemodialysis in end stage renal disease patient fail to mature. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of clinical parameters and vascular haemodynamics on maturation of AVF on Indian patients.
   Material and methods:
   This was a prospective observational study. Eligible patients' clinical profiles and vascular haemodynamics by Doppler ultrasonography were noted. All patients underwent radio-cephalic AVF on the non-dominant arm under local anaesthesia. Clinical definition was used to assess success rate of AVFs which is defined as successful six settings of satisfactory dialysis. Data were analysed using Stata/12.0 software. Independent t-test, chi-square test, logistic regression analysis and multivariate analysis were used. The p-value of Results:
   A total of 205 patients were enrolled and analysed. Among clinical factors, age, sex, serum creatinine, hypertension had no significant association with failure (p = 0.5, 0.08, 0.76 and 0.74). Patient's BMI and presence of diabetes had significant impact on outcome (p < 0.001 and 0.02 respectively). Among vascular haemodynamics, radial vein diameter of >2.5 mm and radial artery flow rate >40 ml/min had no significant association with failure (p = 0.12 and 0.28). Diameter of radial artery (>2 mm) and intra-operatively immediate thrill were independent predictor of success (p = 0.002 and <0.001).
   Conclusion:
   In the present study rate of fistula, maturation was 73.2% without any post-operative radiological intervention. Radial artery diameter >2 mm and presence of immediate thrill post-operatively were significantly associated with successful cannulation.

AB  - The modified radical mastectomy is still the standard of care for breast cancer management. While performing mastectomy, it behoves on us to make every effort to extirpate maximum amount of ducto-lobular tissue containing terminal ducto-lobular units (TDLUs) as most cases of breast carcinoma arise from TDLU. This is possible if we follow the concept of premammary fascia. It is a thick white distinct fascia and demarcates the plane between subcutaneous tissue and the actual ducto-lobular breast tissue. The technique described by us stress on elevation of skin flap superficial to the white fascial plane. This technique ensures removal of maximum amount of ducto-lobular tissue.

AB  - Introduction
   Soft tissue sarcoma(STS) is a rare and heterogeneous group of disorders with dismal outcomes in metastatic setting. Pazopanib and oral metronomic chemotherapy (OMT) have been evaluated as therapeutic options in this cohort.
   Materials and methods
   We conducted a retrospective, single center study evaluating 45 patients with unresectable and/or metastatic STS, who received pazopanib or oral metronomic regimen as per instituitonal protocol between January 2013 and December 2019. An informal cost minimisation analysis was conducted for both OMT and pazopanib arms, considering equivalent outcomes for both (PFS and OS).
   Results
   Median PFS in OMT and Pazopanib groups was 4.13 months and 3.53 months,respectively (HR1.31, 95% CI:0.68-2.51, p = 0.41) Only one patient in the OMT group achieved an objective response (partial response) and no objective response was noted in the pazopanib group. The incidence of grade III/IVtoxicities was higher with pazopanib than with OMT (p = 0.08). There were no toxicity related deaths noted in either arm.
   Conclusions
   Our study demonstrates that OMT have a similar progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic STS. This study raises the possibility that OMT might be an equally efficacious and less toxic alternative to pazopanib, without compromising survival outcome especially in LMIC.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), a new coronavirus has emerged in Wuhan city of China, December 2019 causing pneumonia named Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), which has spread to the entire world. By January 2021, number of confirmed cumulative cases crossed similar to 104 million worldwide. Till date, no effective treatment or drug is available for this virus. Availability of X-ray structures of SARS-CoV2 main protease (M-pro) provides the potential opportunity for structure-based drug designing. Here, we have made an attempt to do computational drug design by targeting main protease of SARS-CoV2. High-throughput virtual screening of million molecules and natural compounds databases were performed followed by docking. After that, the protein-ligand complexes were optimized and rescoring of binding energies were accomplished through molecular dynamics simulation and Molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area approaches, respectively. In addition, conformational effect of various ligands on protein was also examined through essential dynamics simulation. Three compounds namely ZINC14732869, ZINC19774413, and ZINC19774479 were finally filtered that displayed better binding affinities than N3 (known) inhibitor and formed conformationally stable complexes. Hence, the current study features the potential novel inhibitors against main protease of SARS-CoV2 which might provide an effective therapeutic strategy against COVID-19.

AB  - Objective To assess the role of shear wave elastography (SWE) in characterizing different endometrial and subendometrial pathologies.
   Methods Seventy-three women with pathologically proven endometrial and subendometrial pathologies were enrolled in this prospective study and assessed with transvaginal SWE. The elasticity values (in kiloPascals), and the ratio of mean elasticity of the endometrial lesion to myometrial elasticity (E/M ratio) were compared in different pathologies.
   Results There was a statistically significant difference (P <.001) in the mean, minimum, and maximum elasticity of the pathologies as well as the E/M ratio (P <.00001). In the analysis of the subgroups, the mean elasticity of endometrial polyp was statistically significantly lower than other subgroups (P <.01), while submucosal leiomyoma and focal adenomyoma had significantly higher values than other subgroups (P <.01). No statistically significant difference was noted in the mean elasticity of carcinoma and hyperplasia (P-.19).
   Conclusion SWE is a potential adjunct to ultrasound that provides an additional paradigm to characterize endometrial and subendometrial masses.

AB  - Background Experimental work comparing 3-Dimensional (3D) and 4K ultra-high-definition endovision system (4K) indicates that the latter with double the resolution of standard 2D high-definition systems may provide additional visual cues to compensate for the lack of stereoscopic vision. There is paucity of studies comparing 3D and 4K system in clinical settings. This randomized study compares 3D and 4K systems in three laparoscopic procedures of increasing complexity. Methods 139 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (60 patients), transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) repair (49 patients) and laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with anti- reflux procedure (30 patients) between May 2018 and February 2020 were randomized to undergo surgery using either 3D or 4K systems. Primary objective was to measure total operative time. Secondary objectives were to compare workload perceived by surgeons using SURG-TLX and surgeon satisfaction score. Timings of key surgical steps and peri-operative course of the patients was also recorded. Data were analyzed using Stata Corp. 2015. Results Patients undergoing surgery with 3D and 4K systems were comparable in their clinical and demographic profiles. The mean total operative time in 3D and 4K groups was comparable in cholecystectomy (52.7 vs 56.2, p = 0.50), TAPP (63.8 vs 69.6, p = 0.25) and Heller's cardiomyotomy (124.7 vs 143.3, p = 0.14) with faster hiatal dissection in 3D group (8 min, p = 0.02). Operative time was better in patients undergoing Heller's myotomy with Angle of His accentuation with 3D by 28 min (p = 0.03). Total workload was similar in 3D and 4K groups in all the procedures but mental & physical demand was lower in 3D group in Heller's cardiomyotomy (p = 0.03, p = 0.01), Surgeon satisfaction score was comparable in all three procedures. Conclusion Overall, 3D HD and 4K systems are comparable in performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy, TAPP and Heller's Cardiomyotomy. Hiatal dissection time, mental and physical task load was better with 3D in Heller's Cardiomyotomy.
