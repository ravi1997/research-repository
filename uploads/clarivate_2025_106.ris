AB  - PurposePerioperative metabolic acidosis negatively affects patient outcomes. Perioperative fluid therapy has a clinically significant effect on acid-base balance. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of isotonic sodium bicarbonate infusion (ISB) versus balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) on perioperative acid-base balance, in terms of postoperative base excess, among patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis.MethodsThis prospective, randomized, single-center, double-blinded study was conducted in a tertiary hospital from October 2021 to November 2022. A total of 90 patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis were randomly assigned to receive either isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) or Ringer's Lactate as a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS) for perioperative maintenance fluid therapy. The primary outcome was to compare the base excess (BE) at the end of surgery. The secondary outcomes were to compare the postoperative clinical outcomes, including the requirement of vasopressors, duration of mechanical ventilation, HDU/ICU stay, the incidence of AKI within seven days, the incidence of re-exploration, and in-hospital mortality. Additionally, pH, PaCO2, HCO3, BE, and lactates intraoperatively and up to 24 h postoperatively were also compared.ResultsThe median base excess (BE) values at the end of surgery were significantly better in the ISB group - 4.80 [- 6.80, - 4.10] as compared to the BCS group - 7.30 [- 8.50, - 6.30]. The ISB group had a lower incidence of postoperative AKI (9% ISB versus 24% BCS) and requirement of vasopressors (18% ISB versus 44% BCS). However, there was no major difference between the incidence of re-exploration, length of ICU/HDU stay, and in-hospital mortality.ConclusionInfusing isotonic sodium bicarbonate (ISB) for intraoperative maintenance fluid therapy in patients undergoing emergency laparotomy for perforation peritonitis significantly improves perioperative acid-base balance with better postoperative clinical outcomes compared to a balanced crystalloid solution (BCS).

AB  - IntroductionDiffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas are associated with dismal survival outcomes. Conventional fractionation radiation to a dose of 60 Gy is the standard of treatment. This retrospective review aims to compare survival and toxicity outcomes of patients treated with conventional fractionation (CF) and hypofractionation (HF) radiotherapy.Materials and methodsTreatment-na & iuml;ve diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma patients undergoing radical radiation were analyzed. CF was delivered to a dose of 50-60 Gy in 25-30 fractions, while HF was delivered as 38-40 Gy in 12-15 fractions. All patients were planned via the volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) technique.ResultsA total of 64 patients were eligible for analysis. The median age of presentation was 10 years. Motor deficit was the most common presenting complaint in 51.6% of the patients, with a median symptom duration of 2 months. The pons was the most frequent site of disease epicenter in 71.8% of the patients. After a median follow-up of 9.45 months (range 0.23-72.63 months), 23 patients died, and 28 patients experienced disease progression. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for death in patients treated with HF as compared to CF was 1.330 (95% CI 0.522-3.386) (p-value 0.550, by Cox regression analysis). The median OS for the entire cohort was 13.9 months, while it was 9.7 months (95% CI 5.65-13.74) and 15.1 months (95% CI 9.02-21.18) (p-value = 0.547) with CF and HF, respectively. On multivariate analysis, disease epicenter in the pons was the only significant factor associated with PFS. Hypofractionation was associated with a significantly higher aspiration rate and Ryle's tube requirement (p-value 0.027).ConclusionHypofractionated radiation can be considered for diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma with optimum supportive care.

AB  - Cerebral hydatid disease, caused by Echinococcus granulosus, is uncommon in children but presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its potential to mimic malignancy. Only a handful of cases with such a dilemma have been reported yet in the literature. We report a case of a 12-year-old female presenting with progressive headache and seizures, initially suspected to be a pilocytic astrocytoma. However, histopathological evaluation following surgical excision of the lesion rendered an unexpected diagnosis of a cerebral hydatid cyst. This emphasizes the importance of considering parasitic infections in the differential diagnosis of cystic brain lesions, particularly in endemic regions. Surgical removal without rupture is critical to prevent recurrence and complications. This case highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the clinical, imaging, and histopathological assessments to ensure accurate diagnosis and timely appropriate intervention to improve outcomes of such rare intracranial pathologies mimicking malignancy in children.

AB  - Background and objectives Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) is a malignant round-cell tumor arising from the bone and soft tissue. It is a disease of children and young adults. EWS affecting the central nervous system (cranial and spinal column) is relatively rare with an annual incidence of approximately one case per million in the Western population. Due to their rarity, very few studies are available in the literature. We present our experience of managing 21 such cases, highlighting their clinical, and radiological findings, treatment strategy, and surgical outcomes in patients with primary EWS affecting the central nervous system. Materials and methods We retrospectively collected hospital records of patients with primary EWS affecting the CNS (cranial and spinal column), who had been surgically treated in our Neuroscience Center between 2015 and 2023. Patients' demographics, presentation, radiological findings, treatment strategy including surgery and biopsy followed by adjuvant therapy, and outcome at discharge, and the latest follow-up were analyzed from our database. Results There were sixteen male and five female patients with a mean age of 18.22 +/- 12.73 years (ranging from 6 months to 59 years). The commonest presentation was headache and vomiting in cranial lesions (5/13 patients, 38.46%), and back pain in spinal lesions (4/8 patients, 50%). The site of lesions was cranial in thirteen patients (61.9%) and spinal column in eight patients (38.1%). The commonest site was the frontal region in the cranial group (6 patients, 46.15%) and the lumbar region in the spinal group (4 patients, 50%). All patients underwent surgical intervention [tumor resection (18) and biopsy (3)]. Tumor resection was achieved in 18 patients (85.71%). The extent of resection was gross-total excision in 9 patients (42.86%), near-total excision in 5 patients (23.8%), and tumor decompression in 4 patients (19%). Four patients underwent spinal instrumentation. Fifteen patients (71.42%) received multiagent chemo-radiotherapy according to institute protocol. Five patients (23.8%) with poor KPS expired within 6 months of surgery and could not receive adjuvant therapy. Two patients (9.52%) improved symptomatically, and nine patients (42.86%) remained asymptomatic at a mean follow-up of 25.1 +/- 29 months. One patient (4.76%) after receiving 2 cycles of adjuvant therapy had initial improvement but expired later due to disease progression. Four patients after adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (19%) expired due to systemic spread. Conclusion Primary EWS affecting the central nervous system is a rare variety. A detailed radiological assessment can aid in adequate planning for safe maximal resection. Timely tissue diagnosis is essential for initiating early treatment. Radical excision followed by adjuvant therapy offers a favorable outcome. Postoperative adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy aids in optimal disease control and surgical outcome. With the current treatment strategy, good surgical outcomes can be achieved. However, metastasis is not uncommon and should be evaluated regularly.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of circumferential gonioscopy-assisted transluminal trabeculotomy (GATT) vs hemi-GATT in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). center dot DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial. center dot METHODS: This study included children with PCG having corneal diameters < 14 mm and relatively clear cornea. The eyes included were randomized to undergo either circumferential GATT (360-GATT) or hemiGATT (180-GATT). The intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, requirement for glaucoma medications after surgery, need for repeat surgery, and the incidence and type of complications in each group were analyzed. Surgical success was defined as absolute when IOP <= 18 mm Hg (criterion A) and <= 15 mm Hg (criterion B) was achieved without medications and qualified when the same was achieved with pressure-lowering medications. Eyes with an IOP > 18 mm Hg on maximum medications, those with IOP < 6 mm Hg, or need for further intervention for IOP control were considered failures. center dot RESULTS: Fifty-two eyes of children with PCG were randomized into either the 360-GATT group (22 eyes) or the 180-GATT group (30 eyes) and followed up for at least 1 year. The median follow-up duration was 22.5 months (range: 12-30 months). IOP fell by 49% and 20.5% with 360-GATT and 180-GATT, respectively, with the final IOP being significantly lower in the former group (P = .0003). For absolute success, the cumulative survival was superior with 360-GATT for both criterion A and B at 1 year (P = .009). Average cup-to-disc ratio, corneal diameter, and axial length reversal were significant in the 360-GATT group but not in the 180-GATT group. center dot CONCLUSIONS: This study reinforces the superior efficacy of circumferential GATT for IOP control in eyes with congenital glaucoma.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects motor function due to the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. It presents significant challenges, impacting millions worldwide with symptoms such as tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, leading to decreased quality of life and increased morbidity. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is multifaceted, involving complex interactions between genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and aging, with oxidative stress playing a central role in neuronal degeneration. Glutathione S-Transferase enzymes are critical in the cellular defense mechanism against oxidative stress, catalysing the conjugation of the antioxidant glutathione to various toxic compounds, thereby facilitating their detoxification. Recent research underscores the importance of Glutathione S-Transferase in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, revealing that genetic polymorphisms in Glutathione S-Transferase genes influence the risk and progression of the disease. These genetic variations can affect the enzymatic activity of Glutathione S-Transferase, thereby modulating an individual's capacity to detoxify reactive oxygen species and xenobiotics, which are implicated in Parkinson's disease neuropathological processes. Moreover, biochemical studies have elucidated the role of Glutathione S-Transferase in not only maintaining cellular redox balance but also in modulating various cellular signalling pathways, highlighting its neuroprotective potential. From a therapeutic perspective, targeting Glutathione S-Transferase pathways offers promising avenues for the development of novel treatments aimed at enhancing neuroprotection and mitigating disease progression. This review explores the evident and hypothesized roles of Glutathione S-Transferase in Parkinson's disease, providing a comprehensive overview of its importance and potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Diploid mammalian genome has paired alleles for each gene; typically allowing for equal expression of the two alleles within the cell/tissue. However, genetic regulatory elements and epigenetic modifications can disrupt this equality, leading to preferential expression of one allele. Examining high-confidence allele-specific expression (ASE) is vital for understanding genetic variations and their impact on major diseases like cancers and diabetes. ASE analysis not only aids in disease prognosis and diagnosis but also helps to identify regulatory mechanisms operating within the genome. While advances in sequencing technologies have greatly improved our understanding of ASE, challenges remain in estimating it accurately. In this article, we reviewed methods for detecting ASE using both bulk RNASeq and single-cell RNASeq data to provide deeper insights beyond the mere prediction of ASE genes. Fundamentally, ASE detection methods are data-driven and can be classified according to type of data used. Some methods utilize both, DNA genotyping information and RNASeq while others rely solely on RNASeq data. This article offers a comparative analysis of these methods and compilation of repositories providing valuable insights.

AB  - Purpose:To describe the use of crescentic autograft as a graft salvage technique for inadvertently undersized donor lenticules in superficial anterior lamellar keratoplasty (SALK).Methods:A prospective interventional study included 5 eyes of 4 patients who underwent SALK and had an inadvertently undersized donor lenticule. The described technique involves the preparation of a crescent-shaped graft from the host lenticule itself that is matched to fit into the remaining bare recipient stromal bed.Results:At 6-week follow-up, the crescentic autograft was uniformly epithelized along with the donor tissue. There were no incidences of graft dehiscence, rejection, or infection.Conclusions:Crescentic autograft from the host lenticule offers a simple, easy-to perform, and unique technique to manage cases of undersized donor lenticules in SALK with no additional risks.

AB  - Objective: Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC), commonly called pink eye, saw an alarming increase in incidence from July to September 2023 in different parts of India. Pink eye occurrences had reportedly increased three to four times more than in prior years, raising concerns among the community and healthcare professionals. This study aimed to identify the aetiological agent associated with AHC in 2023, genetically characterize the agent and describe the clinical presentation. Methods: From July to September 2023, 300 ocular and throat swab samples were collected from patients with AHC across various regions of India, including Maharashtra, Daman & Diu, Delhi, Lucknow, and Hyderabad. These samples represented a diverse geographic spread of the condition. The swabs were examined for qRT-PCR analyses, to detect adenovirus and enterovirus. Following this, conserved regions within the enteroviral 5 '-UTR and VP2/3 C gene were further investigated for serotype identification. Results: Enterovirus was found in 52.6 % (158 out of 300) of the patients. Among the enterovirus-positive samples, coxsackievirus-A24 was present in every positive sample. Conclusion: The rise in AHC cases in India in 2023 was attributed to the Coxsackievirus-A24 strain GIV C5. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Innate Lymphoid cells (ILCs) are innate counterparts of helper T cells. Although low in number, they have proven to play major roles in many autoimmune diseases. In Pemphigus Vulgaris (PV), the gaps in the knowledge of functional role of ILCs remain. To bridge the gap, our study investigated the phenotype along with the functional determinants of ILCs involved in PV immunopathogenesis. Our data suggested augmentation in overall ILC population in circulation of PV patients. Specifically, ILC1 and ILC3 subtypes were significantly increased in peripheral circulation of PV patients compared to healthy controls. We observed no changes in ILC2 population. mRNAs from ILC enriched population showed significant upregulation in transcription factors- ID2, T bet and ROR gamma t and a downregulation in GATA3 and ROR alpha. The mRNA levels of ILC related cytokines- IFN gamma and IL17 were significantly upregulated while no change was observed in the levels of IL13, IL 22, AHR. The levels of autoantibodies against desmoglein (Dsg) 3 which is the characteristic of PV pathogenesis were also checked in the serum which confirmed significant upregulation in PV patients. The levels of proinflammatory- IFN gamma, IL 17 and IL 15 were elevated and anti-inflammatory cytokines- IL10 was downregulated in the serum of PV patients. The results of this study offer insights into the functional attributes of ILCs and related cytokines, potentially contributing to the development of future therapeutic interventions.

AB  - center dot PURPOSE: To assess apposition of posterior capsule (PC) to intraocular lens (IOL) optic in ultraviolet (UV)/ozone surface modified IOL and its impact on neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy rate and visual quality. center dot DESIGN: Prospective interventional case series. center dot METHODS: The study enrolled 100 eyes implanted with UV/ozone surface modified hydrophobic acrylic IOL during phacoemulsification. The primary outcome measure was PC-optic apposition on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT). Secondary outcomes were Nd:YAG capsulotomy and visual quality (ray-tracing aberrometry). Follow-up was performed on postoperative day (POD) 1, at 1, 3, and 6 months, and 1 and 2 years. center dot RESULTS: Complete PC-optic apposition was observed in 4% of cases on POD1, which increased to 75% at 2 years. PC configuration in cases with PC-optic non- apposition was smooth (34.4%) or wavy (65.6%) on ASOCT; initial smooth PC was associated with significantly higher incidence of PC-optic apposition at 2 years (p = 0.028). At 2 years, visual quality was significantly better in cases with complete PC-optic apposition in terms of Strehl ratio ( P = .029), modulation transfer function (MTF) ( P = 0.016), root mean square (RMS) aberrations ( P = .024) and higher order aberrations (HOAs) ( P = 0.043). A significant positive correlation was observed between height of interface fluid and total RMS (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.221; P = .027) and HOAs (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.198; P = .048). PCO developed in 7% of cases (7/100); of these, 6 cases had persistent PC-optic non- apposition. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy was required in 3% (3/100) cases; all of these cases had persistent PC- optic non-apposition. center dot CONCLUSIONS: Long-term complete PC-optic apposition was observed in 75% of patients implanted with UV/ozone surface-modified IOLs. Complete PC-optic apposition is associated with lower Nd:YAG capsulotomy rate and superior visual quality. (Am J Ophthalmol 2025;270: 113-119. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is intricately tied to the impairment of neurons, crucial for neurological functions. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying AD development remains elusive due to its multifaceted aetiology. Vitamin deficiency has emerged as a notable contributor to AD onset and progression, exerting a significant influence on brain function. To explore this link, we conducted a thorough review using PubMed, Web of Science and MEDLINE databases to gather literature on average vitamin concentrations in people with AD and healthy controls. Applying frequentist network meta-analysis techniques, we calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) in vitamin concentrations between AD and control groups, both directly and indirectly. Our analysis, based on 67 articles, revealed statistically significant findings for various vitamins. Notably, vitamin C displayed the most substantial difference in average concentration between AD and control groups, supported by a high p-score of 0.92. Other vitamins that showed significant differences included vitamin D, folate, vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin B12. Moreover, by considering alternative reference groups of vitamins, we derived indirect estimates, which further emphasised the role of vitamins in AD pathology. The ranking of vitamins based on their discrepancy in concentration between AD and control groups underscored the importance of vitamin C, followed by vitamin D, vitamin E, folate, vitamin A and vitamin B12. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis highlights the potential significance of vitamin levels in understanding AD pathology. This underscores avenues for further research and potential therapeutic interventions targeting vitamin deficiencies in people with AD, potentially offering new strategies for managing the disease.

AB  - Machine learning and its specialized forms, such as Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks, are increasingly being used for detecting and managing gastrointestinal conditions. Recent advancements involve using Artificial Neural Network models to enhance predictive accuracy for severe lower gastrointestinal (LGI) bleeding outcomes, including the need for surgery. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI)-guided predictive models have shown promise in improving management outcomes. While much literature focuses on AI in early neoplasia detection, this review highlights AI's role in managing LGI and small bowel disorders, including risk stratification for LGI bleeding, quality control, evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease, and video capsule endoscopy reading. Overall, the integration of AI into routine clinical practice is still developing, with ongoing research aimed at addressing current limitations and gaps in patient care.

AB  - Undoubtedly, Acinetobacter baumannii is a major ESKAPE pathogen that poses a significant threat to public health, causing severe nosocomial infections with high mortality rates in healthcare settings. Due to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance, only a limited number of antibiotics remain effective against infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The discovery of new class of antibiotic molecules still lags behind the rate of growing worldwide burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To expedite the discovery of new therapeutic molecules, we have focused on HisC from A. baumannii (AbHisC), a crucial enzyme involved in the seventh step of histidine biosynthesis. This pathway is absent in humans. We have employed the advanced computational techniques to target this promising drug target. AbHisC was cloned, overexpressed, and purified. Three distinct sets of libraries containing similar to 60,000 natural compounds from ZINC database were screened against AbHisC using Schrodinger's glide module software. Based on the docking score and glide energy, top 25 hits were further subjected to induced fit (IF) docking. Top four out of the twenty five compounds from IF docking were subjected to 100ns molecular dynamics simulations, and it was observed that salvianolic acid B (SA-B) (a naturally occurring compound) complex with AbHisC, was found to be extremely stable. The glide energy and docking score of SA-B were -88.59 kcal/mol and -10.4 kcal/mol. SA-B was also found to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine indicating its binding to the target. The dissociation constant calculated using Surface Plasmon Resonance was found to be 3.4x10(-9) M. Based on these results we can conclude that SA-B can serve as the potential inhibitor of AbHisC that can further form the basis of structure based drug design against this deadly pathogen.

AB  - Xylose, a key constituent of the heterogeneous hemicellulose polymer, occurs in lignocellulosic biomass and forms xylan polymers through /3-1,4 glycosidic linkages. The /3-1,4-xylosidase enzyme was isolated from Pseudopedobacter saltans (PsGH43) to find an effective enzyme with enhanced activity to depolymerize xylooligosaccharides. /3-1,4-xylosidase belongs to the GH431 family as classified in the Carbohydrate-Active Enzyme Database (CAZy). PsGH432 was found to be active only on xylose-based substrate, 4NPX3, with maximum activity occurring at a pH 7 and 30 degrees C (Km 1.96 +/- 0.2 mM and Vmax 0.43 mM/min). The study also confirms the influence of Ca2+ ions on enzymatic activity and thermal stability. Subsequently, native PsGH43 was crystallized at optimum conditions and the structure was determined at 2.5 & Aring; resolution. Crystallographic analysis revealed an asymmetric unit containing eight monomers and 16 calcium ions wherein a tetramer constituted the functional unit. Each monomer exhibits a characteristic GH43 N-terminal /3-propeller fold that serves as a catalytic domain accommodating one calcium ion in the centre, while the C-terminal /3-sandwich fold associated with the CBM64 family preserves another calcium ion. Our study reveals a novel tetrameric arrangement of /3-1,4-xylosidase which unravels its functional indispensability. This study opens newer avenues to engineer a potential enzyme for biofuel and bioethanol industry.

AB  - A series of semisynthetic noscapine-urea congeners (7a-7h) as potential tubulin-binding agents are being developed by integrating a urea pharmacophore at the C-9 position of the noscapine scaffold. Their binding affinity to tubulin was predicted through molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and the MMPBSA approach. These molecules were subsequently chemically synthesized and assessed using breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). Both the docking score and the predicted binding free energy ( Delta G bind,pred ) revealed that urea congeners had a stronger affinity towards tubulin than noscapine and effectively inhibited the proliferation of all cancer cell types without affecting normal healthy cells. The results indicated that compound 7g exhibited the most promise and was chosen for further studies. Moreover, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 7g at its IC50 concentration showed morphological changes such as membrane blebbing, fragmented nuclei, and the presence of apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis induction was further confirmed by flow cytometry. Moreover, the tubulin binding assay revealed a greater binding affinity with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 42 +/- 2.4 mu M for compound 7g . The number of MCF-7 cells engrafted as breast tumors in nude mice was found to be reduced significantly without any adverse effects. Noscapine is already in clinical trials, but the urea noscapine congener offers an advantage because of its increased potency without impacting the nontoxic profile of noscapine.

AB  - Background: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) significantly contributes to increased morbidity, reduced life expectancy, and higher healthcare costs due to the burden of comorbidities. This study assessed the prevalence of comorbidities in PsA patients in India and explored the influence of age and disease duration on these comorbidities. Methods: The prospective, multicenter observational study was conducted across seven centers in India, utilizing data from the Indian Rheumatology Association. Data were collected using expert-validated proformas, with comorbidities classified according to the ICD-10 Charlson Comorbidity Index. Participants were divided into two age groups: <40 years and >= 40 years. Results: The study included 533 participants (median age: 50 years, range: 17-81). Comorbidities were more common among older patients (median age: 54 years, range: 41-79). About 38% had at least one comorbidity, with hypertension (17.07%) and diabetes (15.19%) being most prevalent, followed by thyroid disorders (10.13%) and hyperlipidemia (3.94%). Comorbidities were significantly more common in patients >= 40 years (45.04%) compared to those < 40 years (18.57%) (P < 0.001). The older group also had higher rates of hyperlipidemia (4.83% vs. 0.71%, P = 0.035) and hypertension (22.14%). Logistic regression revealed a significant association between age and the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid disorders (P = 0.003). Among patients over 40, 44.27% had at least one comorbidity. Conclusion: The study underscores the significant association between age and the prevalence of comorbidities in PsA patients, particularly in those over 40 years. These findings highlight the importance of targeted screening and management in older PsA patients.

AB  - Aluminium is a common metallic toxicant that easily penetrates the brain and exerts severe pathological effects e.g., oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegeneration. Eugenol is a natural phenolic compound possessing numerous therapeutic properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective. The compound has also been reported to interfere with important transcription factors like STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B. Thus, the present study intended to explore the therapeutic potential of eugenol in aluminium neurotoxicity. Rats were administered AlCl3 (100 mg/kg b. wt., orally) and eugenol (200 mg/kg b. wt., orally) alone or in combination for 45 days. The results revealed that AlCl3 administration increases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, lipid peroxidation (LPO), and protein oxidation (PO) along with decreasing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities, and glutathione (GSH) content in the cortex and hippocampus regions of the brain. Moreover, AlCl3 induces neuronal loss and astroglial activation in both brain areas. The study further revealed that AlCl3 also increases the expression of transcription factors STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B in neurons and astrocytes of the cortex and hippocampus. However, co-administration of eugenol with AlCl3 restored the enzymatic activities of AChE, SOD and CAT, and GSH content, and rescued the cortex and hippocampus from LPO, PO, neuronal loss and astroglial activation. Furthermore, the study reported that eugenol reverses the expression pattern of STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B in AlCl3-intoxicated rats. In conclusion, the study suggests that eugenol ameliorates oxidative stress, neuronal loss and reactive astrogliosis in aluminium-induced neurotoxicity by inhibiting signalling molecules, STAT3 and NF-& kcy;B.

AB  - Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy has revolutionized the treatment of various hematological malignancies. Recently, CAR-T has been used in refractory auto-immune diseases with initial encouraging results. In this systematic review, we examined the safety and efficacy of CAR-T in patients with refractory auto-immune diseases. PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus search revealed 1552 articles, of which 24 were included for the final analysis. 80 patients with autoimmune diseases received CAR-T cell therapy, of which 52 patients had systemic lupus erythematosus, 16 patients had systemic sclerosis, 7 patients had idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, 2 patient had anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome, 2 patients had rheumatoid arthritis, and 1 patient had Sjogren's disease. 44 patients got CD-19 CAR-T and 36 patients got BCMA/CD-19 compound CAR-T. All the patients achieved an immunosuppression-free state at the last follow-up. Of the 47 patients with follow-up data, 79 patients developed cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and 4 patients developed neurotoxicity. None of the patients had fatal adverse events with CAR-T cell therapy. CAR-T appears to be safe and effective in patients with refractory autoimmune diseases. Future studies are crucial to further validate these findings, explore long-term outcomes, and refine the treatment protocols to enhance efficacy and safety.

AB  - User satisfaction with Assistive Technology (AT) is one of the crucial factors in the success of any AT service. The current study aimed to estimate satisfaction with AT and the reasons for dissatisfaction and unsuitability among persons with functional difficulties in India. Using the WHO Rapid Assistive Technology Assessment tool, a cross-sectional study was conducted in eight districts, representing four zones of India. Multi-stage cluster random sampling and probability proportional to size techniques were used to select smaller administrative units from the larger ones. Satisfaction was reported in terms of assistive products and service delivery. In total, 8486 participants were surveyed out of which 8964 individuals were enumerated with a response rate of 94.6%. Around 22.2% (1888) of participants had functional difficulties and reported using AT, out of which 3.9% (74) were dissatisfied with their products. The assistive products, assessment and training, and repair and maintenance-related services were reported to be satisfied by approximately 92.2% (1740), 88.4% (1669), and 85.2% (1609) of respondents, respectively. Further, 3.2% (61) and 3.7% (70) of respondents reported that their AT was not suitable for home and public environments, respectively. According to 2.8% (53) respondents, their AT did not assist them in executing daily living activities. Discomfort (56.6%), poor fitting (37.7%), low quality of service (20.7%), and poor aesthetic values (18.9%) were identified as reasons for dissatisfaction. Satisfaction was good for AT received from friends and family but was poor for those received from the public sector. The study shows that overall satisfaction and suitability with AT were high among users with functional difficulties, but few have reported barriers to effective device use and facing challenges in accessing repair and follow-up services.

AB  - Survival outcomes of patients with heart failure (HF) based on their disease etiology are not well described. Here, we provide one-year mortality outcomes of 10850 patients with HF (mean age = 59.9 years, 31% women) in India. Ischemic heart disease (71.9%), dilated cardiomyopathy (17.3), rheumatic heart disease (5.4), non-rheumatic valvular heart disease (1.9), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (0.8), congenital heart disease (0.7), peri-partum cardiomyopathy (0.5), restrictive cardiomyopathy (0.4), and infective endocarditis (0.1) were the main disease etiologies. Mortality rate per 100-person years of follow-up varied from 13.8 (95% CI: 6.2-30.7) in peri-partum cardiomyopathy to 92.9 (46.5-185.9) in infective endocarditis. Compared to ischemic heart disease, the mortality was two to five times higher in rheumatic heart disease (HR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.6-2.4), congenital heart disease (2.9; 1.9-4.2), and infective endocarditis (4.8; 2.4-9.8). The wide variations in mortality rate in HF patients may bring possible clinical applicability of risk stratification.

AB  - PurposeEarly diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (PC) are crucial for effective management and improved patient outcomes. Newer imaging modalities like prostate-specific membrane antigen PET have shown superior diagnostic performance in detecting PC and clinically significant PC (csPC). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence on the diagnostic performance of PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy in detecting PC and csPC.Patients and MethodsThe study followed the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. Using a predefined search strategy, 3 databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were systematically searched using appropriate keywords. A meta-analysis was conducted using diagnostic accuracy parameters of the included studies. Risk of bias assessment was done using the QUADAS-2 tool.ResultsOut of 378 articles, 20 were assessed for full-text screening and 10 articles with 874 patients were finally included. Eight studies reported a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.90 (95%confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.95), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.57-0.99), 12.3 (95% CI, 1.5-98.9), 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05-0.20), and 117 (95% CI, 12-1178), respectively, for detecting PC using PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.92-0.96). Similarly, 6 studies reported a pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.94), 0.65 (95% CI, 0.49-0.79), 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6-4.1), 0.17 (95% CI, 0.09-0.31), and 15 (95% CI, 6-41), respectively, for detecting csPC using PSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy with area under summary receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.88).ConclusionsPSMA PET-guided prostate biopsy has a high diagnostic accuracy in detecting PC and csPC in patients with clinical suspicion of PC, and provides a 1-stop solution for early diagnosis and staging of PC.

AB  - Introduction: Solute carrier family transporters (SLCs), crucial for nutrient and trace element uptake in the placenta, play a significant role in fetal growth and development. Their dysregulation is associated with various pregnancy disorders. However, a comprehensive understanding of their role and regulation in placental function and pregnancy complications is still a largely unexplored area, making this study novel and significant. Methods: We performed a rigorous meta-analysis of publicly available NCBI GEO microarray and RNA-Seq datasets followed by bioinformatics analysis of differentially expressed SLCs in PE and IUGR. The identified SLCs were then validated using qPCR on PE placental samples, ensuring the reliability and validity of the findings. Results: Bioinformatics analysis of preeclampsia (PE) and Intrauterine Growth restriction (IUGR) datasets revealed significant associations between specific SLC transporters with disease pathology, identified by studying differentially expressed SLCs. Subsequent validation using qPCR on placental samples confirmed considerable downregulation of SLC6A8, SLC16A10, SLC25A3, and SLC29A3, highlighting their dysregulation in the pathogenesis of PE and IUGR. Discussion: The significant downregulation of SLC6A8, SLC16A10, SLC25A3, and SLC29A3 observed by bioinformatics analyses and validated by qPCR indicates atypical expression of these SLCs in gestational disorders. Our findings underscore the potential contribution of multiple SLC gene families to the development of placental pathologies associated with diverse pregnancy complications.

AB  - Intussusception in adults represents 1% of bowel obstructions and up to 0.02% of all hospital admissions. Amongst these, colo-colic intussusception of the descending colon forms the rarest of causes due to the fixed nature of the descending colon. Most of adult intussusceptions follow a lead point and are commonly due to colonic malignancy which may get missed on pre-operative evaluation. Surgery is usually warranted as these patients are usually symptomatic and at risk of vascular compromise, leading to perforations and obscure malignancies. We present a case of laparoscopic limited hemicolectomy and primary anastomosis in a middle-aged male who presented with colo-colic intussusception, which appeared to be following a malignant mass on imaging and lipoma on colonoscopic biopsy done twice. Keeping in mind the possibility of a malignant lead point, no attempt was made to reduce the intussusception and a vessel first approach with 5 cm margin on either side was performed.

AB  - Introduction: Heavy metals exposure is a known carcinogen in humans. The impact of heavy metals in the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is unclear with scant available literature. Though previous studies have evaluated the role of heavy metals in RCC, majority of those studies have evaluated either single or few heavy metals in urine. None of the prior studies have evaluated an extensive panel of heavy metals in blood, urine, and tissue in the same patient along with the serum oxidation status and gene expression to establish a cause- and-effect relationship. This study aims to evaluate the role of extensive panel of heavy metals, oxidative status, and gene expression in RCC. Methodology: This observational study recruited RCC patients who visited our tertiary care centre from 2019 to 2023. Age matched healthy volunteers were included as controls. Blood, urine, and tissue samples (tumor and adjacent normal tissue) were collected from RCC patients. Levels of arsenic, copper, manganese, selenium, cadmium, lead, and mercury were measured in each of the samples. Serum oxidative stress markers like glutathione peroxidase (GPX), lipid peroxidase (LPO), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Genetic expression of Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD]), and glutathione peroxidase ( GPX] ) genes were measured in the tumor tissue and adjacent normal parenchyma. Results: 150 cases and 150 age matched controls were enrolled. RCC cases had elevated blood levels of arsenic (P = 0.02), copper (P = 0.01), manganese (P < 0.001), cadmium (P < 0.001), lead (P < 0.001), and mercury (P = 0.02) compared to controls. Urine levels of selenium (P = 0.02), mercury (P = 0.03), and lead (P = 0.04) were higher in cases. Reduced levels of serum GPx (P = 0.02) and higher levels of LPO (P = 0.04) were detected in cases. Elevated levels of copper (P = 0.03), manganese (P = 0.002), selenium (P < 0.001), and cadmium (P < 0.001) were found in the adjacent normal parenchyma compared to the tumor tissue. VHL (P = 0.03) and oxidative stress gene expressions were lower in the tumour tissue compared to the normal parenchyma. Conclusion: Elevated levels of heavy metals in the blood, urine, tissue, and imbalance in the serum oxidative status along with downregulated tumor suppressor VHL and oxidative stress genes in the tumor tissues likely explain the carcinogenic role of heavy metals in RCC. Environmental exposure is the main cause of heavy metal toxicity. Mitigating the environmental exposure of heavy metals and thereby their toxicity might play a role in cancer prevention.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the efficacy of scleral buckling in the hands of vitreo-retina (VR) fellows under training in eyes with retinal detachment associated with retinal dialysis and analyze the patient and retinal characteristics in these eyes. Methods: We carried out a retrospective consecutive case review at a tertiary eye care center in North India. Records of all the patients who had undergone scleral buckling (SB) for retinal dialysis-associated rhegmatogenous retinal detachment by VR fellows (with less than 2 years' experience) between January 2017 and January 2020 were reviewed. Results: Fifty-three eyes of 53 patients with a mean age of 20.77 years were analyzed. Of the patients, 73.58% were males. History of eye trauma was present in 71.69% patients. A total of 21 residents operated these 53 eyes. SB was able to achieve retinal attachment in a single surgery in 84.9% (45/53) eyes. Mean preoperative best corrected visual acuity was 1.9 +/- 1.05 log of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), which improved postoperatively to 1.07 +/- 0.72 logMAR (P < 0.001). Surgical success rate was 85.71% (24/28) in eyes with no proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), 66.66% (2/3) in eyes with PVR-A, 91.66% (11/12) in eyes with PVR-B, and 80% (8/10) in eyes with PVR-C1. Fifty-two eyes had a single dialysis and one eye had two separate dialysis. Six eyes had giant retinal dialysis (dialysis greater than 3 clock hours) and all were due to trauma. Five patients had retinal dialysis in the fellow eye and were diagnosed with bilateral idiopathic retinal dialysis. Conclusion: Scleral buckling is a safe and effective management for retinal dialysis retinal detachment even in the hands of VR fellows under training.

AB  - Introduction:Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy was first described by Gagner M et al. Here, we present our experience of more than two decades of laparoscopic adrenalectomy performed in a single surgical unit at a tertiary care centre.Patients and Methods:A prospectively collected database of patients undergoing laparoscopic adrenalectomy from December 1994 to May 2020 was analysed retrospectively. The demographic profile, details of clinical workup and laboratory parameters were recorded in a pre-structured pro forma. Functional workup and anatomical imaging were performed for all the patients. Patients were taken up for surgery after adequate pre-operative optimisation using a multidisciplinary approach. All the patients were operated by a single surgical team of experienced laparoscopic surgeons.Results:A total of 158 patients underwent laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy. The majority patients were females (64.5%). The median tumour size was 5 cm (range, 1-18 cm). The diagnosis in the majority of the patients was pheochromocytoma (56.3%). The mean operative time was 80 min (range: 45-210 min). The most common complication was bleeding in 6 (3.7%) patients, which required laparotomy. The median duration of post-operative hospital stay was 3 days (range: 1-13). There was no 30-day mortality. The mean follow-up period was 15 months (range: 6-72 months), during which two patients developed local recurrence.Conclusion:The advantages of laparoscopic surgery are well established and have been extensively explored for the management of adrenal lesions. A multidisciplinary approach to management, consisting of endocrinologists, surgeons and anaesthesiologists is preferred. Pre-operative evaluation, optimisation and accurate selection of patients are crucial for successful laparoscopic adrenalectomy.

AB  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is not just caused by neuromuscular abnormalities; it is also a result of an impaired sensory system. Since there is not a standardized measure to evaluate sensory processing of children with spastic CP, therefore an in-depth assessment of sensory processing deficits in children with spastic CP would require an understanding of the validity and reliability of the Child Sensory Profile-2 (CSP-2) in children with spastic CP. The sample of this study included 230 children with spastic CP aged 3 to 14 years who referred to different paediatric rehabilitation centres of Delhi-NCR from April 2021 and September 2023 by using the snowball sampling procedure. To collect the data, the CSP-2 caregiver questionnaire was used. For validity, face and content validity were determined. For reliability, internal consistency of all the responses was examined using Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient. For validity, experts involved in the study reported that the organization and design of the questionnaire would be appropriate for the children with spastic CP. All the items of the CSP-2 questionnaire were simple and easy to understand. Internal consistency was also calculated for total items (N = 86) and found to be 0.898 which indicates that all items of the questionnaire are internally consistent and reliable. Conclusion: According to the findings of our study, the CSP-2 is a valid and reliable measure for evaluating sensory processing in children with spastic CP. Additionally, it may be an appropriate tool for accurately assessing this population's sensory processing deficits. What is Known: center dot Sensory processing deficits commonly concur with motor deficit in children with CP. Overall prevelance of sensory processing deficit was 83% in children with CP. What is New: center dot Child Sensory Profile-2 is a reliable and valid tool for measuring sensory processing abilities in children with CP.

AB  - Background: Financial toxicity is the detrimental impact of health care costs that must be mitigated to achieve universal health coverage. Catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) is widely used to measure financial toxicity but does not capture patient perspectives of unaffordable health care costs. Financial hardship (FH), a patient-reported outcome measure, is currently underutilized but may be an important adjunct metric. The authors compare CHE to FH as metrics evaluating financial toxicity. Methods: A prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted across 3 public and private tertiary-care hospitals in India. Adult surgical trauma inpatients in plastic and orthopedic surgery departments were assessed. The development of CHE, health expenditures >10% of annual income, and FH, the patient-reported impact of financial toxicity in the form of asset liquidation, debt acquisition, and job loss, were compared by the health system and using logistic regression models. Results: Among 744 surgical trauma patients, low income, longer hospital stays, and increased injury severity were significantly associated with the likelihood of incurring CHE and FH (P<0.05). Only FH was significantly associated with lack of insurance (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 1.14-2.71). Public hospitals had higher rates of FH than CHE (55% versus 23%). Private hospitals had more CHE than FH (53% versus 32%). Conclusions: FH is an important metric of financial toxicity that provides important adjunct information to CHE for at-risk populations. FH is particularly informative for public institutions with low direct medical costs. Nuanced utilization of CHE and FH provides a more comprehensive, patient-oriented approach to evaluating unaffordable health care costs that can help shape financial risk protection policy.

AB  - Objective: The antifungal audit aimed to evaluate antifungal usage in a tertiary care center. It focused on patient profiles, the appropriateness of antifungal use, associated adverse drug reactions, reasons for suboptimal usage, and the economic burden caused by prolonged non-optimal antifungal use. Methodology: Conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India from January 2019 to December 2020, the study evaluated systemic antifungal use in 100 hospitalized adults with invasive fungal infections. Data collected included patient characteristics, evidence of disease, antifungal agents used, drug ADRs, appropriateness, and economic impact. Antifungal use was assessed using a predefined score (score <10 considered non-optimal), and ideal therapy duration was calculated based on treatment guidelines (IDSA & ECIL). Results: Optimal antifungal use was observed in 66.0 % of cases. Common reasons for non-optimal use included alternate drug selection (18 %), inappropriate dosage (12 %), lack of adjustment after microbiological results (14 %), and incorrect therapy duration (16 %). Targeted antifungal therapy was observed in 39 out of 100 patients, while pre-emptive antifungal therapy was used in 32 out of 100 patients. Voriconazole (35.1 %), caspofungin (23.1 %), and liposomal amphotericin B (20.1 %) were commonly prescribed. Liposomal amphotericin B had the highest adverse reaction rate (81.4 %). The total cost of antifungal therapy for 100 patients was Indian Rupee67,06,840 (approximately 80,350 $), with non-optimal prolonged therapy leading to an additional economic burden of Indian Rupee1,149,191 (approximately 13,841 $). Overall, 748 (39.7 %) day of therapy were non-optimal, contributing to 17.1 % of the total cost of antifungal therapy. Conclusion: We observed non-optimal use of antifungal agents in 34 % of the study participants. The study results show that the antifungal audit enhances stewardship by pinpointing causes of non-optimal use, ensuring adherence to prescribing standards, optimizing clinical outcomes, and minimizing drug-related toxicities in tertiary care centres.

AB  - Introduction: The left atrium (LA) dilates and its function decreases as a chronic secondary change in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). LA strain is a more sensitive measure of LV filling pressure than LA volume and can be used to predict the functional capacity in HCM. Objective: To analyze LA strain in patients with HCM and its correlation with exercise tolerance. Methods: A total of 113 patients with HCM were enrolled. All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation, 24-h Holter monitoring, exercise stress testing, two-dimensional echocardiography with LA strain analysis using speckle tracking imaging. Assessment of functional capacity was done in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs). HCM patients with METS >6.0 were included in Group A while those with METS <= 6.0 were included Group B. Correlation of various parameters of LA strain (left atrial reservoir strain [LASr], left atrial conduit strain [LAScd], and left atrial contraction strain [LASct]) was done with functional capacity. Results: The mean age of the study population was 47 +/- 10.77 years with the majority of them being males (71.9%). Group B patients had significantly lower LASr (12.95% +/- 8.61% vs. 22.16% +/- 16%; p < 0.001), LAScd (-7.28% +/- 6.29% vs. -12.74% +/- 8.40%; p < 0.001), and LASct (-7.44 +/- 4.46 vs. -11.19 +/- 6.53; p < 0.001). Multivariable linear regression analysis reported LASr to be an independent predictor of METs and had a quadratic relationship with log-odds with negative linear and positive quadratic coefficients. LASr was the strongest echocardiographic predictor of reduced METS with an AUC of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.88), sensitivity of 71.8%, and specificity of 82.9%. Conclusion: LA strain parameters are associated with functional capacity in patients with HCM with lower LA strain values being associated with poor functional capacity.

AB  - ObjectivesPain is the foremost complication of chronic pancreatitis (CP), affecting about 70% of patients. However, the pathophysiological understanding and management of CP-related pain are complex, likely as patients have diverse "pain phenotypes" responding differently to treatment. This study aims to develop a bedside test panel to identify distinct pain phenotypes, investigate the temporal evolution, and determine whether they can be used to predict treatment response.MethodsThe INPAIN study is an international, multicenter, observational, longitudinal cohort study consisted of 4 substudies. The studies will prospectively enroll 400 CP patients (50 without pain and 350 with pain) and 50 control subjects, conducting biannual observations for 4 years. The test panel is consisted of comprehensive subjective and objective assessment parameters. Statistical analysis strategies differ across the substudies. A model to predict treatment efficacy will be developed using various machine learning techniques, including an artificial intelligence approach, with internal cross-validation. Trajectories in pain parameters will be characterized by graphical analysis and mixed effect models.DiscussionThe INPAIN study aims to comprehensively understand pain in CP through a test panel developed for routine clinical use. This tool has the potential to personalize treatments, improve clinical practice, enhance patient care, improve quality of life, and minimize treatment side effects.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the corneal biomechanical parameters, visual outcome, and epithelial remodeling after small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) for low to moderate myopia. Design: Prospective, interventional, randomized, comparative study. Methods: Eighty eyes of 40 patients undergoing bilateral SMILE or PRK for low to moderate myopia (<-5 D SE) were included. They were divided into two groups based on the planned refractive surgery. Visual acuity, corneal biomechanics using Corvis-ST, epithelial mapping via anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and higher-order aberrations were recorded both preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 months and compared. Results: At 6 months follow-up, the corrected distance visual acuity as well as the postoperative spherical equivalent of both the groups were comparable (P = 0.13 and P = 0.32, respectively). The biomechanical parameters like deformation amplitude ratio (P < 0.01), inverse concave radius (P = 0.006), integrated ratio (P < 0.01), stress-strain index (P < 0.01), Ambrosio's relational thickness (ArTH) (P < 0.01), and corneal biomechanical index-laser vision correction (P = 0.02) were altered more in the SMILE group than in the PRK group, while the biomechanically corrected intraocular pressure (P = 0.16) was comparable. Epithelial remodeling (P = 0.59), higher-order aberrations (P = 0.53), and stromal keratocyte loss (P = 0.16) in both the groups were comparable. Conclusion: Both SMILE and PRK are comparably effective procedures for correction of low to moderate myopia in terms of visual outcomes; however, the corneal biomechanical stability in PRK is superior than that in SMILE.

AB  - Angioid streaks are irregular breaks in the brittle Bruch's membrane and commonly present as pigmented linear lines radiating from the optic disc. They may be associated with systemic disease in up to 50% of the patients. Systemic diseases such as pseudoxanthoma elasticum, Paget's disease, and hemoglobinopathies are commonly associated with angioid streaks. However, they may be idiopathic in a small number of cases. Patients may be asymptomatic until complications such as choroidal neovascular membrane and subretinal hemorrhage involving the fovea develop. Due to the brittle nature of Bruch's membrane, even minor trauma could lead to subretinal hemorrhage in these eyes. Diagnosis is commonly made through clinical examination and investigations such as fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography. Treatment consists of management of the choroidal neovascular membrane commonly through intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injections. In this review, we provide an overview of angioid streaks right from their epidemiology to their management.

AB  - Objective: Diastolic dysfunction (DD) is defined as impaired left ventricular (LV) relaxation, caused by structural or functional heart diseases. We sought to assess the role of cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) as a tool to evaluate LV DD in patients with normal EF using the diastolic expansion index (DEI), as compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) as the gold standard. Methods: Patients presenting with atypical chest pain with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) and having a normal LV ejection fraction on TTE underwent CCTA using a dual source CT scanner. Assessment of diastolic function on CCTA was done using DEI, and it was compared with TTE-derived diastolic function as per standard ASE/EACVI guidelines. DEI was measured using a dedicated postprocessing software (Syngo.via VB20, Siemens Healthcare, Germany) and was calculated as a ratio of maximum LV volume (in LV end-diastole) to maximum left atrial (LA) volume (in LV end-systole), with the mean value of readings from three independent readers taken for each calculation. Results: The study included 141 patients (60 male; mean age 50.82 +/- 10.20 years; mean heart rate 84.90 +/- 16.15 beats per minute). CCTA-derived mean indexed LA volumes correlated well with TTE measurements but were larger when compared to TTE (r = 0.53, p < 0.0001). A progressive increase in LA volume index was noted with worsening DD grades. Excellent inter-observer correlation was seen between the three observers for LA volume index (intra-class correlation coefficient: 0.999 [95% CI: 0.999-0.999] and for DEI 0.996 [95% CI: 0.995-0.997]). A normal LV diastolic function was predicted by a DEI > 1.57 with a specificity and sensitivity of 88.3% and 81.6%, respectively (area under curve (AUC)-0.87), whereas an abnormal LV diastolic function was predicted by DEI <1.46 with a specificity and sensitivity of 84.8% and 62.5%, respectively (AUC-0.848). There was a significant correlation between the presence of obstructive CAD and an increase in calcium score with DD grade (p = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: CCTA-derived DEI is a reliable metric for assessing LV diastolic dysfunction in patients with suspected CAD with normal ejection fraction. The presence of obstructive CAD and an increase in calcium score correlated with worsening DD grade.

AB  - The disturbances in thyroid hormones lead to altered brain metabolism, function, and cognition. Neuroimaging studies have shown structural and functional changes in hypothyroidism. Present study investigates the neurometabolite changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and associated decline cognitive function in hypothyroid patients before and after thyroxine treatment. We performed neuropsychological test and 1H MRS in hypothyroid patients (n = 25) and controls (n = 30). In addition, followup data was also collected from 19 patients treated with levo-thyroxine for 32 weeks. The concentration of the neurometabolites were calculated using LCModel. MRS data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with age and gender as covariates. A paired t-test was conducted to compare the baseline hypothyroid with the follow-up. Partial correlations were utilised to assess possible associations between neuropsychological scores and neurometabolites with age and gender as covariates. Spearman correlation was performed between thyroid hormone levels and neurometabolites. Hypothyroid patients showed an impairment in delayed recall, immediate recall of semantic, visual retention, recognition of objects memory, attention, and motor function at baseline, which improved significantly after thyroxine therapy. At baseline, patients with hypothyroidism exhibited significantly higher levels of choline compounds (GPC + PCh) [Cho]. No significant normalization of Cho levels was observed, despite achieving euthyroidism with thyroxine treatment. Cho levels showed a positive correlation with TSH in PPC and a negative correlation with T4 in DLPFC and PCC. Cho levels also showed negative correlations with delayed recall, immediate recall of semantic, visual retention memory and MMSE scores. The MRS findings show increased levels of Cho in hypothyroid patients compared to healthy controls. These Cho levels are not reversible within 32 weeks of treatment, suggesting that a longer follow-up may be needed to see if levels can be normalized.

AB  - Purpose:The management of idiopathic macular holes (iMH) has evolved over time with various modifications in surgical approach. The study aimed to survey the surgeons' preferences in the management of iMH in current times. Design:Cross-sectional descriptive survey. Methods:A 12-item questionnaire addressing the key aspects of iMH management was sent, between October 2022 to November 2022, by personal correspondence to 104 vitreoretinal specialists, actively practicing and performing iMH surgeries at various institutes in India. The responses were gathered till January 2023 and analyzed as per appropriate statistical methods. Results:Ninety-one retina specialists responded to the survey (response rate of 87.5%) with a median annual surgical load of 30 cases (range: 5-150). Most respondents had similar views on patient selection, combined phaco-vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane (ILM) staining, ILM peel initiation and propagation, tamponade, postoperative positioning, and prognostic factors. The preferred approach for peel initiation was "pinch and peel," but "scrape and peel" was equally recommended for beginners. Most respondents considered iMH >600 microns in size as large and used additional surgical maneuvers for large and failed cases such as ILM flap, large flap, macular detachment, platelet-rich plasma application, and amniotic membrane graft. The three most important visual prognostic factors were duration, preoperative vision, and MH size. Conclusions:The practice of surveyed surgeons performing iMH surgery was uniform in several aspects. There is a need to create consensus on the preferred ILM peel technique among trainee surgeons, revisit the iMH size classification, and standardize the surgical approach as per hole size and characteristics.

AB  - Synovial sarcoma (SS) is a rare genitourinary malignancy with a specific SS18::SSX 1/2 gene fusion in majority of the instances. The paratesticular location of this neoplasm is extremely rare and only 4 cases are reported in the literature. Herein, we describe the clinicopathologic features and molecular profile of paratesticular SS in the largest case series to date and to the best of our knowledge, and the only series to use novel SS18-SSX antibody for immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical (IHC), molecular, treatment, and follow-up data of the patients were analyzed. There were 14 patients, ranging from 15 to 47 years (mean: 30 y). The tumor size ranged from 4 to 15 cm. The tumors were unilateral, solid, and homogeneous tan-white with monomorphic spindle cell histology. All 14 tumors expressed SS18-SSX and TLE1 IHC and harbored SS18 rearrangement. In addition, the tumor with multifocal SS18-SSX expression had lower break-apart signals in the FISH assay (38% of the tumor cells; range: 29% to 85%). Radical orchiectomy was performed in all 14 patients and adjuvant chemotherapy was administered in 9 patients. Follow-up was available in 9 patients. The follow-up duration ranged from 5 to 24 months (median=10 mo). Four patients died of metastatic disease (range: 5 to 16 mo) and 2 patients who are alive had metastatic disease at the last follow-up. Based on our experience with the largest series to date and aggregate of the published data, paratesticular SS has a poor prognosis despite aggressive therapy. Owing to its rarity, the differential diagnosis is wide and requires a systematic approach for ruling out key morphologic mimics aided with SS18-SSX IHC and molecular confirmation because this distinction carries important therapeutic and prognostic implications. Due to the excellent concordance of SS18-SSX IHC results with FISH results as observed in our study, we would like to suggest inclusion of SS18-SSX in the diagnostic immunohistochemistry panel of all spindle cell sarcomas where synovial sarcoma is considered as a morphologic differential. SS18-SSX-positive staining may be used as a surrogate for FISH assay in a resource-limited setting where molecular assay is not available. Furthermore, IHC has a fairly shorter turn-around-time, is less complex, and of low cost.

TI  - A new guide for basic psychological support for persons affected by neglected tropical diseases: A peer support tool suitable for persons with a diagnosis of leprosy and lymphatic filariasis
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
AB  - Background People with disabilities due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), such as leprosy and lymphatic filariasis (LF), often encounter situations of stigma and discrimination that significantly impact their mental wellbeing. Mental wellbeing services are often not available at the peripheral level in NTD-endemic countries, and there is a need for such services. Basic psychological support for persons with NTDs (BPS-N) from peers is an important potential solution for addressing mental wellbeing problems. As there was no written document advising delivery of such support, NLR India brought experts together to develop a new guide. This paper describes the process used in developing the guide and provides information about its content.Methods As a qualitative and participatory methodology, more than 10 meetings and workshops were held to consider the suitability of existing guides for chronic stress in NTDs and develop a new guide through consensus and adaptations; attendees included both technical experts and affected persons. The first meeting was a 3-day virtual workshop held on 9-11 June 2020, followed by other online meetings. The BPS-N guide development happened during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The Psychological First Aid (PFA) package of WHO was selected as a suitable basic model for adaptation. Aspects of the Rights-Based Counselling intervention were also integrated into the new guide. Two teams were formed for drafting and reviewing the guide.Results All suggested changes were discussed, and a consensus reached for developing the document. The affected persons contextualized the content for ensuring its relevance and practicality. The new BPS-N guide was simple, professionally sound, ethical, adequate, and appropriate. The guide promotes knowledge, skills, compassion, and action among peer supporters.Conclusion The new guide, through regular trainings, behavior change, and action principles will likely provide much-needed services. It is important that the new guide be now tested, and modifications made if needed.

AB  - Neuromyotonia or Isaacs syndrome is a rare neuromuscular disorder secondary to hyperexcitable peripheral nerves which fire continuously causing motor unit activation and manifests clinically as cramps, muscle twitches, or visible muscle contraction associated with impaired muscle relaxation. Clinical suspicion and subsequent diagnostic work-up, including electrophysiology, aid in the diagnosis. However, when contractions are not appreciated clinically, there is a high possibility of misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis may also be attributable to a lack of knowledge of symptoms among physicians and a paucity of diagnostic modalities, hence additional tools have been sought. Here we present the case of 15-year-old girl who presented to us with complaints of painful posturing and stiffness of both hands, which was initially diagnosed and managed as dystonia without symptomatic relief. We suspected the diagnosis of neuromyotonia only after we performed neuromuscular ultrasound, which became the main guiding light to reach the diagnosis.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of self-reported delayed adverse events (DAEs), major AEs, and flares following COVID-19 vaccinations among patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases (AIRDs) in Malaysia. Methodology: An electronically validated survey from the COVID-19 vaccination in autoimmune diseases (COVAD) study group was distributed in July 2021 to patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy controls (HCs). The survey collected data on DAEs (any AE that persisted or occurred after 7 days of vaccination), any early or delayed major adverse events (MAEs), and flares following COVID-19 vaccination. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models were performed to determine the factors associated with repeated events of DAEs, MAEs, and flares. Results: A total of 556 vaccines were administered to 204 subjects (150 AIRDs and 54 HCs), with 72.1% completing 3 doses. In multivariate GEE analysis, there was a greater frequency of minor DAEs among AIRDs versus HCs (OR 5.65, p = 0.052). The occurrence of MAEs was higher in AIRDs versus HCs (4.9% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.052), but it was no longer significant in the GEE model. In the AIRDs group, the BNT162b2 vaccine increased the risk for minor DAEs (OR4.68, p = 0.02) while patients with autoimmune multimorbidity showed a greater risk for MAEs (OR 8.25, p = 0.007). The rate of flare was 10.6% and multivariate GEE analysis revealed that The rate of flare was 10.6% and multivariate GEE analysis revealed that systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (OR0.31, p = 0.03) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (OR 0.16, p < 0.001) were protective against flare. Conclusion: The rates of minor DAEs, major AEs, and flares were comparable with other reported studies. Different types of vaccines, underlying AIRDs, and treatments may influence the symptoms of AEs and flares postvaccination against COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lifitegrast 5% versus carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) 0.5% in adult patients with dry eye disease (DED).Methods:A total of 370 eligible patients with DED were randomized equally to receive twice-daily doses of a single drop in each eye of either lifitegrast 5% or CMC 0.5% for 12 weeks. Follow-up at weeks 2, 6, and 12 evaluated changes from baseline in primary [eye dryness score (EDS), ocular discomfort score (ODS), ocular surface disease index (OSDI), and tear film break-up time (TFBUT)] and secondary [Schirmer tear test (STT) score and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score] endpoints. Global improvement, safety, and tolerability were also assessed.Results:At week 2, values of ocular discomfort score, OSDI, and conjunctival redness were significantly more favorable in patients treated with lifitegrast compared to CMC. At week 6, values of all study variables were better in patients treated with lifitegrast compared to CMC; differences between the groups were statistically significant for all except photophobia. This trend was also maintained at week 12. Global improvement and tolerability were found to be better with lifitegrast than with CMC. No serious safety concerns were reported in any treatment group.Conclusion:To our knowledge, this is the first active-controlled trial informing on the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lifitegrast 5%. Significantly more favorable values for EDS (except photophobia), ODS, OSDI, TFBUT, STT score, CFS score, and conjunctival redness score were achieved at week 12 with lifitegrast 5% compared to CMC 0.5%.

AB  - Purpose:To compare the visual outcomes of implantable Collamer lens (ICL) with small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) in cases of moderate-high myopia.Methods:A prospective comparative study was conducted on 60 eyes of 30 patients with moderate-high myopia (-3D to -8D with astigmatism <= 1 D) at a tertiary eye care center. Patients underwent either SMILE or ICL in both eyes and had a postoperative follow-up of 1 year.Results:The manifest refractive spherical equivalent was -5.22 +/- 1.05 D and -5.4 +/- 1.17 D in the SMILE and ICL groups, respectively (P = 0.53). The mean sphere and cylinder were comparable between the groups. The mean uncorrected visual acuity improved from 1.18 +/- 0.19 logMAR to 0.03 +/- 0.07 logMAR in SMILE and 1.14 +/- 0.25 logMAR to 0.011 +/- 0.04 logMAR in the ICL group. The efficacy for SMILE was 83.3% and that for ICL was 93.3%. Safety and predictability (+/- 0.5D) for both was 100%. A significant increase was observed in ocular aberration with a decrease in modular transfer function in the eyes that underwent SMILE, whereas no significant change in the eyes that underwent ICL. A significant difference was observed in all parameters of ocular aberration except corneal trefoil, corneal astigmatism, and PSF between the two groups at the final follow-up. The contrast sensitivity at final follow-up was higher in ICL cases when compared to SMILE. The quality of vision (QoV) score suggested a better QoV with ICL; however, the difference was not statistically significant.Conclusion:Both SMILE and ICL are safe in patients with moderate-high myopia. The efficacy, contrast sensitivity, and postoperative ocular aberration profile are better in cases undergoing ICL.

AB  - Background: The complex interaction between the gut and urinary microbiota underscores the importance of understanding microbial dysbiosis in pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the literature on the gut-urinary axis in pediatric UTIs is limited. This systematic review aims to summarize the current literature on the roles of gut and urinary dysbiosis in pediatric UTIs. Methods: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed across four databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. All studies published between January 2003 and December 2023 utilizing 16S rRNA sequencing to profile the gut or urinary microbiome in children with UTIs were included. Heat map visualization was used to compare microbial profiles between UTI and control cohorts. The methodological quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Results: Eight studies were included in this review. While five studies compared the microbiota signatures between patients and controls, three studies focused solely on the UTI cohort. Also, the gut and urinary microbiome profiles were investigated by four studies each. The consistent loss of microbiome alpha-diversity with an enrichment of specific putative pathobiont microbes was observed among the included studies. Escherichia coli consistently emerged as the predominant uropathogen in pediatric UTIs. In addition to this, Escherichia fergusonii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Shigella flexneri were isolated in the urine of children with UTIs, and enrichment of Escherichia, Enterococcus, Enterobacter, and Bacillus was demonstrated in the gut microbiota of UTI patients. On the contrary, certain genera, such as Achromobacter, Alistipes, Ezakiella, Finegoldia, Haemophilus, Lactobacillus, Massilia, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ureaplasma, were isolated from the controls, predominantly in the fecal samples. The methodological quality of the included studies was variable, with total scores (NOS) ranging from 5 to 8. Conclusions: The enrichment of specific pathobionts, such as Escherichia coli, in the fecal or urinary samples of the UTI cohort, along with the presence of core microbiome-associated genera in the non-UTI population, underscores the critical role of the gut-urinary axis in pediatric UTI pathogenesis. These findings highlight the potential for microbiome-based strategies in pediatric UTIs. Further studies with larger cohorts, standardized healthy controls, and longitudinal profiling are essential to validate these observations and translate them into clinical practice.

AB  - Purpose:The primary objective was to evaluate the clinical response of refractory cases of fungal keratitis to topical 1% posaconazole therapy.Methods:Prospective longitudinal non-randomized open label dual-cohort study of 70 eyes of refractory fungal keratitis, 35 were recruited as posaconazole treatment (PCZ) group for topical 1% posaconazole therapy and compared to 35 eyes on conventional antifungal therapy. Study parameters included demographic and treatment details, visual acuity, comprehensive slit-lamp biomicroscopy, clinical photography, ASOCT at recruitment and weekly (week 1, 2, 3 and 4 after treatment initiation). Clinical assessment included keratitis severity grade, time of healing, and healing response. Anti-fungal susceptibility testing was performed.Results:The mean age of 35 patients recruited in the PCZ treatment group was 45 +/- 17.32 years and that for the conventional treatment group was 43.22 +/- 15.04 years. Culture isolation was possible in 25 eyes (71.4%) in the PCZ treatment group, with Fusarium and Aspergillus spp. being the most common cornea pathogenic mycotic organisms. The mean healing time in the PCZ group was 27.13 +/- 5.8 days and in the conventional treatment group was 26.41 +/- 4.81 days. Healing response in the PCZ treatment showed that 27 eyes (77.14%) had healed, 3 (8.5%) had delayed healing, and 5 (14.28%) required therapeutic keratoplasty, whereas in the conventional treatment group, 26 (74.28%) healed, 2 (5.7%) had delayed healing, and 7 (20%) needed keratoplasty (P = 0.65, 0.72, 0.54, respectively). Topical 1% PCZ therapy of chronic mycotic keratitis was helpful in resolution in 85.7% of cases (30 eyes) with five eyes needing surgical intervention, which was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic therapy cohorts. Fusarium isolates showed greater susceptibility to natamycin in our study per MIC50 values, with susceptibility to the common antimycotic agents varying between the Aspergillus spp. in both PCZ treatment and conventional treatment groups. All isolates showed minimal values of MIC-50 with PCZ. Antifungal susceptibility testing in our study recruits showed that about 90% of the Fusarium spp. isolates to be best responsive to natamycin and PCZ, whereas Aspergillus niger isolates were sensitive to voriconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, and PCZ, Aspergillus flavus to voriconazole and PCZ, Aspergillus fumigatus to both polyenes and triazoles. Cladosporium spp. were best sensitive to natamycin and PCZ, Penicillium spp. to natamycin and azoles. Alternaria keratitis isolates were sensitive to voriconazole and PCZ, whereas Rhizopus isolate was best sensitive to PCZ.Conclusion:Topical 1% PCZ therapy in refractory fungal keratitis was comparable to that of conventional antimycotic agents, with lower MIC-50 against the common pathogenic fungi as compared to natamycin, amphotericin B, and voriconazole.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Intraoperative aberrometry
KW  - refractive optimization
KW  - SFIOL
AB  - Scleral-fixated intraocular lens (SFIOL) is a widely used technique for IOL implantation in patients where capsular support is insufficient. Most surgeons have shifted away from sutured to sutureless SFIOL techniques where haptics of a multifocal IOL are inserted in scleral tunnels/flaps. Large-scale publications have shown wide variation in the refractive status of eyes post-SFIOL even in the best of the hands. This is because even slight variations in the site of scleral flap/tunnel formation and tension on haptics due to the variable length of haptics placed in scleral flaps/tunnels can alter the effective lens position and induce significant residual refractive error, especially cylindrical astigmatism due to IOL tilt. Our technique aims to reduce residual refractive error after SFIOL implantation. This is achieved by using intraoperative aberrometry and adjusting haptics accordingly to achieve minimal refractive error intraoperatively.

AB  - Rationale & Objective: Growth failure is a common problem among children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Reduced height is associated with psychosocial burden, social stigma, and impaired quality of life. This study describes the aspects of growth impairment that are most impactful from the perspectives of children with CKD, their parents, and health professionals. Study Design: Qualitative study. Settings & Participants: 120 children with CKD (aged 8-21 years), 250 parents, and 445 health professionals from 53 countries who participated in 16 focus groups, 2 consensus workshops, and a Delphi survey. Analytical Approach: A thematic analysis of all qualitative data concerning growth from the Standardized Outcomes in Nephrology-Children and Adolescents (SONG-Kids) initiative. Results: We identified 5 themes: diminishing psychological well-being (compared to and judged by peers, tired of explaining to others, damaging self-esteem), constrained life participation and enjoyment (deprived of normal school experiences, excluded from sports or competing at a disadvantage, impaired quality of life in adulthood); grappling with impacts of symptoms and treatment (difficulty understanding short stature and accessing help, lack of appetite, uncertainty regarding bone pains, medication side effects, burden of growth hormone treatment); facilitating timely interventions and optimizing outcomes (early indicator of disease, assessing management, maximizing transplant outcomes, minimizing morbidity); and keeping growth and health priorities in perspective (quality of life and survival of utmost priority, achieved adequate height). Limitations: Only English-speaking participants were included. Conclusions: Impaired growth may diminish psychological well-being, self-esteem, and participation in daily activities for children with CKD. Balancing different treatments that can affect growth complicates decision making. These fi ndings may inform the psychosocial support needed by children with CKD and their caregivers to address concerns about growth.

AB  - Purpose:Utilization of multimodal imaging techniques to diagnose cases of mucolipidosis type IV (ML-IV) and report a new genetic variant.Methods:This study is a case report.Results:Case 1 involves a 4-year-old boy with corneal haziness and global developmental delay who showed an increased reflectivity of the corneal epithelium on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). In addition, neurologic evaluation was suggestive of ML-IV. Further genetics evaluation confirmed ML-IV. Histology of the button revealed a thickened epithelial basement membrane. Case 2, the younger sibling, showed a milder corneal haze with similar changes on AS-OCT prompting us to further evaluate for ML-IV by genetics (positive MCOLN1 gene mutation). Both instances highlighted varied ML-IV presentations, but a persistent feature was hyperreflective epithelium.Conclusions:Our study emphasizes AS-OCT's role in screening ML-IV and advocates the role of genetic counseling of affected parents. We present 2 South-Asian siblings with ML-IV with a new genetic variant, emphasizing the utility of detailed ophthalmic and neurologic assessments using multimodal imaging.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily driven by the protein Alpha Synuclein (A-Syn) accumulation. Synphilin-1 protein, encoded by the SNCAIP gene, which co-localizes with A-Syn is a known risk factor for PD. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), is a cluster of retinal degenerative disorders, and Cyclic Nucleotide Gated channel subunit Alpha 1 (CNGA1) is one of the initial genes associated with RP. Patients with PD can have various kinds of visual dysfunction as a non-motor manifestation, but to date, CNGA1 mutation and RP as a PD associated visual symptom has not been reported. We report a mutation in the SNCAIP gene in a PD patient, not reported earlier, and its co-occurrence with RP-associated CNGA1 gene mutation. Method: Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the patient DNA sample and in-silico protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis performed to find out proteins interacting with SNCAIP relevant concerning reported mutation of SNCAIP and further, CNGA1 interaction with SNCAIP. Result: We are reporting, a missense mutation (p.Thr64Ser) at the SNCAIP gene, co-occurring with a missense variation (p.Gly509Arg) in the CNGA1 gene. In silico PPI analysis suggests SIAH1 as an important protein affected by SNCAIP mutation. LGALS4 and SNCA (gene encoding A-Syn) are common interactors between SNCAIP and CNGA1. Conclusion: The current study has determined the co-occurrence of RP and PD, whole exome sequencing ascertains the mutations in SNCAIP and CNGA1 genes, which could be the cause of PD and RP co-occurrence.

AB  - Contemporary research evidence has corroborated a gradual loss of central cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This progressive deterioration leads to cognitive dysfunction and impaired motor activity, culminating in the brain cell's death in the disease. The approved drugs for AD treatment can only offer relief from symptoms without addressing the underlying pathological hallmarks of the disease. To address the limitations associated with rivastigmine (RIV), a marketed drug for AD, a series of tryptamine derivatives was designed, synthesized, and evaluated in various in-vitro and in-vivo AD models. Enzyme inhibition studies identified compounds 6d and 6e as the lead molecules with potent inhibitors against AChE (6d, IC50: 0.99 f 0.009 nM and 6e IC50: 7.97 f 0.016 nM and BChE (6d, IC50: 27.79 f 0.21 nM and 6e , IC50: 0.79 f 0.005 nM), compared to the marketed drug Riv (AChE, IC50: 6630 f 0.76 nM, BChE IC50 = 91 f 0.40 nM). The molecular docking and dynamics studies corroborated the enzyme inhibition studies. The PAMPA assay strongly suggested the BBB crossing ability of the lead molecules. Further, 6d and 6e demonstrated the capability to counteract oxidative stress and A beta 1-42 in various in-vitro studies. Compound 6e exhibited remarkable radical scavenging activity in the DPPH assay (IC50: 22.91 f 1.73 mu M) compared to rivastigmine (% radical scavenging activity: 3.71 f 0.09 at 200 mu M). Interestingly, 6d and 6e exhibited promising activity in the AD Drosophila model by protecting eye phenotypes from degeneration induced by A beta 1-42 toxicity and reduced mitochondrial and cellular oxidative stress in this model. Furthermore, upon oral administration, 6d and 6e could reverse scopolamine- induced amnesia by improving spatial and cognitive memory in mice at 0.3 and 0.5 mg/kg compared to rivastigmine at 3 mg/kg and were found to have potent ex-vivo anti-ChEs properties, which are correlated with the observed pro-cognitive effects in the Morris Water Maze, likely mediated through the inhibition of both cholinesterases. The expression of various neuroprotection markers, such as BDNF and TRKB, was significantly overexpressed compared to the disease control group.

AB  - Objective: 4-butylcyclohexane carboxylic acid (4-BCCA), a low-affinity inhibitor of AMPA receptors at the transmembrane domain have been suggested as potential therapeutic option for epilepsy, but its potential impact on status epilepticus and disease-modification and neurodegeneration following status epilepticus have not been investigated. Methods: This study established the effect of 4-BCCA along with standard antiseizure medications (ASMs) [valproate (VPA) and perampanel (PER)] in Li-pilocarpine induced status epilepticus rat model. We first established the effective dose of 4-BCCA in status epilepticus followed by an acute and long-term effect study. Assessments of neurobehaviour (by elevated plus maze and passive avoidance), neurodegeneration [by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and immunohistochemistry in hippocampal slices], total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and neuronal loss [by neuron specific enolase (NSE) in cerebral tissue] were performed. Results: 4-BCCA at 200 mg/kg. i.p. was found to be an effective dose and in comparison, to other ASMs it showed better seizure control in terms of latency and number of stage 3/4 seizures. PER group and 4-BCCA+PER showed better memory retention but without significant difference among the drug-treated groups. In TEM, 4BCCA+PER and 4-BCCA+VPA group showed less nucleus and cytoplasmic changes. In immunohistochemistry 4BCCA, PER and combination groups showed better neuronal viability. 4-BCCA+ PER showed higher TAC and lower NSE level. Significance: 4-BCCA alone and its combination with ASMs especially perampanel in status epilepticus model in rats showed better seizure control and neuroprotection.

AB  - Purpose: Radiotherapy is frequently employed for palliative treatment in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) but radiation dose fractionation regimens are not well-defined. We designed this phase 3 randomized controlled trial to compare two weekly hypo fractionated regimes and study the effect on progression-free survival (PFS) in this subset of patients. Materials and Methods: Non-metastatic locally advanced HNSCC patients (n = 305) who were not suitable for curative treatment were randomized to Arm A (20 Gy/5#/5 days) and Arm B (30 Gy/5#/5 days). PFS and OS were recorded along with acute toxicity using patient-reported quality of life HN QLQ 43. Results: From April 2020 to August 2023, 390 patients were randomized, of which 305 were eligible for final analysis. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, PFS and median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 7.4 and 10.03 months, respectively. PFS (p-0.553) and OS (p-0.203) did not differ significantly between the two groups. Toxicity rates were similar between the two arms and dose escalation was well tolerated. Patients with a better PS were found to have significantly better OS. No significant benefit in OS or PFS was observed in patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), underwent definitive conversion, or received palliative chemotherapy at progression. Conclusion: This is the largest phase 3 RCT to analyze the safety and efficacy of weekly palliative radiotherapy regimens and has not demonstrated further improvement with dose escalation.

AB  - The in vitro activity of two novel antibiotics with different modes of action, (i) siderophore cefiderocol and (ii) beta-lactam-enhancer mechanism-based cefepime/zide-Bactam, was tested against New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterial and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected in India. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics against multicentric NDM-producing Escherichia coli (n = 117), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 103), and P. aeruginosa (n = 72) were determined by the reference broth microdilution method. Among E. coli, 111 isolates were NDM-alone, and six were NDM + OXA-48-like producers. Among K. pneumoniae, 47 and 56 isolates were NDM-alone and NDM + OXA-48-like producers, respectively. All E. coli isolates harbored four amino acid inserts in their penicillin-binding protein 3. Using the highest susceptible breakpoint among CLSI, FDA, and EUCAST interpretive criteria, cefiderocol susceptibility was 39.3%, <= 80%, and 57%, for NDM +/- OXA-48-like-producing E. coli, NDM +/- OXA-48- like-producing K. pneumoniae, and NDM-producing P. aeruginosa, respectively. At a cefepime break point of <= 8 mg/L, 100% of Enterobacterales and >= 90% of P. aeruginosa isolates were cefepime/zidebactam-susceptible. NDM being a dominant carbapenemase among Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa in India, the variable activity of cefiderocol against NDM producers is a concern. Post approval, cefepime/zidebactam could offer a promising treatment option against NDM producers

AB  - High-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (HGBCL, NOS) has overlapping morphological and genetic features with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL), leading to uncertainty in its diagnosis and clinical management. Using functional genomic approaches, we previously characterized HGBCL and NOS, that demonstrate gene expression profiling (GEP), and genetic signatures similar to BL. Herein, we characterize distinct HGBCL, NOS, cohort (n = 55) in adults (n = 45) and in children (n = 10), and compared the GEP, genomic DNA copy number (CN), and mutational spectrum with de novo DLBCL (n = 85) and BL (n = 52). This subgroup, representing ~60% of HGBCL, NOS, lack gene-expression signature of BL and double hit/dark zone lymphoma, but express DLBCL like signatures and are characterized by either GCB- or ABC-like mRNA signatures and exhibit higher genomic complexity, similar to de novo DLBCL, and show alteration in genes regulating B-cell activation (CD79B, MYD88, PRDM1, TBLIXR1, CARD11), epigenome (KMT2D, TET2) and cell cycle transition (TP53, ASPM). However, recurrent mutations in genes often mutated in BL (DDX3X, GNA13, CCND3), but rare in DLBCL, are also present in HGBCL-NOS, highlighting genetic heterogeneity. Consistent with mutation spectrum, frequent genomic CN alterations in genes regulating B-cell activation (del-PRDM1, gain-BCL6, -REL, -STAT3) and cell cycle regulators (del-TP53, del-CDKN2A, del-RB1, gain-CCND3) were observed. Pediatric cases showed GCB-DLBCL-like mRNA signatures, but also featured hallmark mutations of pediatric BL. Frequent oncogenic PIM1 mutations were present in adult HGBCL, NOS. In vitro analyses with pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PIM1 expression triggered B-cell activation and NF-kappa B-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PIM1 is a rational therapeutic target.

AB  - BackgroundXeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genodermatosis, characterized both by premature aging and significantly increased risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancers at an early age. However, limited literature is available on the common histopathological subtypes of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in these patients.MethodsIn this ambispective case series, we recruited patients of XP who had either a currently present skin tumor or previously excised one, provided their histopathological sections were available. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in all the patients. The histopathological findings were recorded by two trained dermatopathologists.ResultsOf 22 recruited patients with XP, 12 patients had 41 BCCs, and 23 (56.09%) of them showed a high-risk histopathological subtype. Basosquamous carcinoma (10, 24.39%) was the most frequent high-risk tumor followed by infiltrative variant (7, 17.07%). Mixed-histopathological subtypes were noted in six (14.63%) cases, and all of them had a high-risk component. The low-risk subtypes included nodular (n = 17, 41.46%) and superficial BCC (1, 2.43%). Though a deep dermal involvement was seen in 27 (65.85%) lesions, none showed a perineural invasion or necrosis. Three (7.31%) lesions showed ulceration, while 10 (24.39%) showed presence of pigmentation.ConclusionsA frequent occurrence of high-risk basal cell carcinoma was noted in patients with XP-mandating creation of appropriate treatment and follow-up strategies in these patients.

AB  - Bacteria possess hair-like projections on their surface termed pili. The primary function of a pilus is to enable bacterial cell attachment to the host. Since pili are associated with cell adhesion, they play a major role in bacterial colonization and infection. Due to their important functional role, these surface appendages become ideal drug targets, hence it is essential to study the mechanism associated with pilus assembly, elongation, and attachment. Several enzymes are required for pilus biosynthesis, and their adhesion to the host. In this review paper, we have described the importance of the Sortase C (SrtC) protein which is required for pilus assembly and pilin polymerization. We also provide a detailed structural comparison of the protein from various pathogenic bacteria and highlight the importance of SrtC as a drug target. In addition to this, we have also reported structural studies of SrtC from the pathogenic bacteria Enterococcus faecalis using homology modelling.

AB  - Background: The optimal duration of spontaneous breath trial (SBT) for patients with difficult extubation from mechanical ventilation is unknown. Objective: This study compared extubation success with two different durations of SBT in patients who failed their first SBT. Methods: This single-center randomized controlled trial included adults on mechanical ventilation who had failed their first SBT. The participants were randomized to receive pressure support ventilation (PSV) for either 30 or 120 min. Our primary outcome was the rate of successful extubation (without reintubation within 48 h). Key secondary outcomes were the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Results: A total of 119 patients (62.2 % male) with a mean age of 53.9 years were randomized to undergo SBT for either 30 min (n = 60) or 120 min (n = 59). Among them, 82.4 % of patients had hypercapnic respiratory failure. The rates of successful extubation were similar with SBT of 30 min and 120 min (58.3 % vs. 59.3 %, respectively; p = 0.91). There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the durations of ICU and hospital stay or in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Conclusions: Extubation success and other clinically important outcomes were comparable between short (30 min) and long (120 min) SBT in difficult weaning. A 30-minute SBT may be acceptable in this setting.

AB  - BackgroundCoeliac disease (CD) is common in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but prevalence varies globally due to differing screening protocols. There have been substantial changes in screening guidelines over the past two decades.AimTo evaluate CD prevalence in patients with T1D, focusing on screening studies using antitissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG) antibody.MethodsWe searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus for studies published up to 11 December 2023 using keywords related to CD and diabetes. We used random-effects models for overall prevalence and all subgroups, with heterogeneity assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I2 statistic performed in STATA 18.ResultsWe included 106 articles involving 65,102 T1D patients across 40 countries. The pooled CD seroprevalence and confirmed CD prevalence were 9% (95% confidence interval, CI, 8%-10%) and 6% (95% CI 5%-7%), respectively. The prevalence was higher in females and children. Denmark, Saudi Arabia and Libya exhibited the highest prevalence (11%), followed by India and Egypt (10%). Belgium, France, Germany, South Africa and the United States had the lowest prevalence (2%). High-income countries showed significantly a lower CD prevalence than middle-income countries (p = 0.03). Meta-regression based on the Human Development Index (HDI) indicated that countries with higher HDI have lower seroprevalence and confirmed CD prevalence.ConclusionApproximately 1 in 16 patients globally and 1 in 12 patients in Asia and the Middle East with T1D has CD. We suggest that all patients with T1D should be screened for CD.

AB  - Due to numerous characteristics (chemical stability, optical transparency, etc.), tissue equivalency, and other factors, lithium borates are an appropriate material for radiation dosimetry. This work explores the optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimetry of lithium triborate (LiB3O5) doped with Ag. Here, we have used thermally-assisted OSL (TA-OSL), where OSL is recorded following thermal stimulation of the sample, to assess the presence of primary dosimetric and deep defects. The optimized elevated temperature for LiB3O5:Ag was found to be 100 degrees C corresponding to maximum TA-OSL intensity due to depletion of its filled traps (indicating deep defects). X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry were all used to characterized the structural and chemical properties of the sample. Along with other OSL characteristics like fading and repeatability, response of the obtained nanophosphor under CW-OSL with x-ray photons and electrons of a range of energies including cobalt-60 in radiotherapy has also been examined.

AB  - ObjectiveGlycogen storage disorders (GSD), inherent disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, feature hypoglycemia as a hallmark. Normoglycemia and glucose monitoring are pivotal in disease management. Conventional glucometer-based monitoring may overlook hypoglycemic trends. This study assesses glycemic control in Asian Indian GSD children using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and its role in facilitating dietary adjustments.MethodsA pre-post study enrolled molecularly confirmed GSDI, GSDIII, GSDVI, and GSDIX patients for baseline dietary compliance and CGM-based glycemic status evaluation. Hypoglycemic patients were stratified into diet-compliant and diet-noncompliant groups. Noncompliant patients received dietary reinforcement; compliant individuals underwent dietary adjustments. Repeat CGM (rCGM) was performed 6 weeks to 6 months postadjustments. Clinical and metabolic parameters were re-evaluated at 6 months.ResultsOf the 20 patients assessed at baseline, 11 were diet compliant. Six among these exhibited hypoglycemia, prompting diet adjustments. Among nine noncompliant patients, eight experienced hypoglycemia and received diet reinforcement. rCGM in 10 patients (five GSDI, three GSDIII, and two GSDIXc) showed a significant reduction in hypoglycemia duration in all. An improvement in height and body mass index was observed in all GSDI and GSDIII patients. Triglyceride levels, raised at baseline in two GSDI and one GSDIII, showed a substantial decline in one GSDI patient. Hepatic transaminase levels decreased in both GSDIXc patients. Plasma lactate levels decreased in all GSDI patients.ConclusionCGM is an efficacious adjunct in the personalized management of hepatic GSD patients, in the Asian Indian population. The study also underscores the need for long-term follow-up to determine the role of glycemic management in growth, general well-being, and metabolic control in the GSD subtypes.

AB  - Objectives: In vitro activity of (3-lactam enhancer/(3-lactam combination zidebactam/cefepime was evaluated against carbapenem- and colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Methods: Non duplicate K. pneumoniae (n=185), resistant to colistin as well as non-susceptible to carbapenems were collected (2018-2019) at two large tertiary care hospitals in India. Colistin resistance-conferring genes mcr1 and mcr3 were screened among 123 of 185 randomly-selected isolates. These isolates were also subjected to multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Additionally, alterations in mgrB were screened in 109 of these 123 isolates. All the study isolates were screened for presence of carbapenemases genes. MICs of zidebactam/cefepime, colistin, carbapenems, ceftazidime/avibactam, imipenem/relebactam, amikacin and piperacillin/tazobactam were determined by reference CLSI broth dilution method. Results: Among the isolates, 65.4% (121/185) carried bla OXA-48-like gene and 27.6% isolates (51/185) carried dual carbapenemase genes; bla OXA-48-like and bla NDM . Of the remainder, 8 isolates carried bla NDM and 5 isolates lacked carbapenemases gene despite being carbapenem-resistant. None of the isolates showed presence of mcr1 and mcr3. Out of 109 isolates analysed for mgrB, 36 showed mutational changes. The MLST profile revealed at least 14 unique sequence types with ST231 being the dominant clone. All the isolates showed colistin MICs >2 mg/L and were non-susceptible to carbapenems. Zidebactam/cefepime demonstrated potent activity with MIC50 and MIC90 of 1 and 2 mg/L, respectively. MIC(90)s of amikacin, ceftazidime/avibactam and imipenem/relebactam were >32 mg/L. Conclusion: Zidebactam/cefepime combination was highly active against multi-clonal, carbapenem-non-susceptible and colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates producing OXA-48-like (Ambler class D) or/and NDM (Ambler class B) carbapenemases, thus potentially offering a valuable treatment options for infections caused by such pan-drug resistant resistotypes. Though, zidebactam is not an inhibitor of class B and D (3-lactamases, potent activity of zidebactam/cefepime combination is attributable to (3-lactam enhancer mechanism.

AB  - ObjectivesThe parasternal intercostal muscle activity, a marker of accessory muscle usage, is found to correlate inversely with the pressure-generating capacity of the diaphragm and level of support of mechanical ventilation. The primary objective of our study was to determine whether the parasternal intercostal muscle thickening fraction (PMTF) measured by ultrasonography can predict weaning. We also evaluated whether addition of lung ultrasound score and echocardiographic assessment can add on to predicting weaning failure.MethodsThis prospective observational study conducted in a mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit, included 60 adult patients who were eligible for a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) after being invasively mechanically ventilated for more than 48 hours. Ultrasound of respiratory muscles, lung parenchyma, and echocardiographic assessment were performed before and after 120 minutes of SBT. Parasternal intercostal muscles were imaged with a high frequency linear probe on the right second intercostal space 5 cm lateral to the sternal margin. PMTF was calculated as (maximum-minimum thickness)/minimum thickness.ResultsAmong 60 patients, SBT failure was seen in 11 patients and extubation failed in 8 patients. PMTF (%) was significantly higher in the weaning failure group (13.33 [8.33-19.05]) as compared to patients with successful weaning (6.67 [6.06-11.54]). Diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) correlated inversely to PMTF in patients with weaning failure. A pre-SBT PMTF cut-off of >= 7.7% and post-SBT cut-off of >= 15.38% were good predictors of weaning failure and extubation failure, respectively.ConclusionsPMTF has good discriminatory power to predict weaning outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.74 [0.59-0.88]). Pre-SBT PMTF had similar power as DTF to predict weaning failure.

AB  - There is a paucity of literature regarding the effect of anesthetic techniques on antitumor immunity, especially in gall bladder malignancies. We designed a study to compare the effect of propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia and sevoflurane-based general anesthesia-on antitumor immunity, including tumor growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), T-helper cell profile, and inflammatory markers. A pilot prospective randomized trial was conducted in 64 patients undergoing surgery for gall bladder malignancy under general anesthesia in a tertiary specialty cancer hospital. Adult cancer patients of ASA physical status I-III fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized to either group S (sevoflurane-based general anesthesia) or group T (propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia). Preoperative (morning of surgery) and postoperative (24 h and 1 month after surgery) blood samples were obtained. Demographic profile and preoperative parameters were comparable between both groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the postoperative value of TGF-beta (higher in group T). There was a statistically significant difference in postoperative interleukin-17A value (indicative of TH17 cells), and it was found to be higher in group S. Propofol-based TIVA increases serum TGF-beta levels. At the same time, Sevoflurane modulates T-helper cells-based immunity to increase TH17 cells in patients with gall bladder cancer. Multiple larger studies will be required to validate the results and provide useful recommendations.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to explore the factors that could predict long term clinical outcomes in SA. Methods A retrospective study was conducted wherein SA patients undergoing surgical resection with a minimum follow up of 12 months were included in this study. Modified Mccormick Scale (MMS) was utilized to record the neurological status of the patients both preoperatively and at last follow up. Outcomes were assessed as: long term neurological status, that is final MMS grade and neurological deterioration, defined as increase in MMS score as compared to preoperative MMS score. Survival analysis was performed using the kaplan meier curves. Results 71 patients were included in this study with mean age of 33.07years. At a mean follow up of 57 months, preoperative MMS was the single independent predictor for moderate-severe neurological deficit (MMS III to V) on multivariate analysis (OR: 30.2, p < 0.001) and had an outstanding AUC of 0.91. Six patients had neurological deterioration at long term follow up. Absence of spasticity (p = 0.028), thoracic-thoracolumbar tumors (p = 0.006), low MMS score (p = 0.01) and hypointense T1 weighted MRI (p = 0.009) were significant predictors of long term neurological deterioration. The median overall survival was 48 months and was significantly higher in low grade tumors (p < 0.001). Conclusion The study highlights the efficacy of clinical features as a predictor of long term functional outcomes in SA patients. Role of spasticity as a prognostic factor was explored for the first time in this study.

TI  - Antiseptic efficacy and plasma chlorhexidine levels following two different methods of application of 1% aqueous chlorhexidine gluconate for skin disinfection in preterm newborns: a randomized controlled trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERINATOLOGY
AB  - Objective: Many neonatal units have started using Chlorhexidine gluconate for neonatal skin antisepsis. However, there is in-vitro evidence of inhibition of neurite growth. The current study aimed to compare two methods of its local application, for the extent of systemic absorption and antiseptic efficacy. Study design: Parallel group, blinded, randomised trial, at a Level III, neonatal intensive care unit. Between December 2020 to July 2022, neonates from 28 to 34 weeks gestation, were randomized to local skin antisepsis by either- (a) 1% aqueous chlorhexidine (CHG aq) followed by cleansing off the residual agent with sterile water swab (Cleansing group) or (b)1% CHG aq followed by air drying (No cleansing group). The outcome measures were the proportion of post antisepsis skin swabs with no/insignificant growth, and the plasma chlorhexidine levels. Results: Of the total of 457 enrollments (Cleansing: n = 230; No Cleansing: n = 227), 216 (93.91%) in "Cleansing" vs. 221 (97.36%) in "No cleansing" (risk difference -3.45%, 95% CI -7.2 to 0.28%; p = 0.072) had no/insignificant growth post-antisepsis. The lower bound of the confidence interval crossed the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of 5%. The median (IQR) plasma chlorhexidine levels were not significantly different between the two groups (7.9 (5.6, 17.9)) ng/mL in Cleansing vs. 6.5 (4.6, 17.7) in No cleansing groups (p = 0.437). Conclusion: Cleansing with sterile water after application of chlorhexidine in preterm neonates was not shown to be non-inferior compared to no cleansing, for skin antisepsis efficacy. Systemic absorption occurred to a similar extent despite cleansing off the residual agent.

AB  - Background Next-generation sequencing has enabled non-invasive diagnosis of type IV collagen disease in clinical settings other than the typical presentation of Alport syndrome (AS). Methods We reviewed the clinical and histological records of children diagnosed with Alport syndrome based on next-generation sequencing. Variants on clinical exome sequencing were categorized using ACMG 2015 criteria. Results During 2015-2023, we found 43 patients (34 boys) with 39 variants in COL4A5 (n = 27), COL4A4 (n = 7), and COL4A3 (n = 5). Thirty, 8, and 5 patients had X-linked, autosomal recessive, and autosomal dominant disease, respectively. The median (IQR) age and eGFR at diagnosis were 10 (7-13) years and 100.1 (59-140) ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. Fifteen patients were initially diagnosed with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Alport syndrome was suspected in these patients due to persistent microscopic hematuria, eGFR < 90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), characteristic histology, and/or non-response to immunosuppression. Of 26 patients who underwent kidney biopsy, light microscopy revealed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, minimal change disease, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis in 9, 9, and 8 patients, respectively. Electron microscopy (n = 18) showed characteristic glomerular basement membrane changes and/or foot process effacement in 12 and 16 cases, respectively. Twenty-one patients (48.8%) had high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, while two had lenticonus. Twelve patients progressed to chronic kidney disease stages 4-5. Median survival (IQR) with eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73 m(2) was 15.6 (13-18) years. Conclusions The phenotype of Alport syndrome varies from asymptomatic urinary abnormalities to hematuria, proteinuria and/or low eGFR, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Adverse outcomes are common, especially in boys with X-linked disease.

AB  - IntroductionThe population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in India is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. India instituted a targeted intervention (TI) programme to reduce this vulnerability. We aimed to measure the assessment of the TI programme for MSM.Materials and MethodsThe national Integrated Biological and Behavioural Survey (IBBS) was carried out in 2014-2015. We analysed MSM data from the IBBS and used bivariate and multivariate logistic regression to calculate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The use of a condom during their last sexual intercourse and consistent condom use during the previous month were considered indicators of programme effectiveness. The propensity score matching method was used to assess the effectiveness of the TI programme.ResultsThe matched-samples estimate (i.e., average treatment effect on treated) for the use of condoms during their last sexual intercourse increased by 10.0% (0.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.08-0.12), and consistent condom use during the previous month increased by 9.0% (0.09; 95% CI 0.07-0.10) among those who had received condoms from the peer educator/outreach worker compared with those who had not received condoms.ConclusionsThe TI programme intervention among MSM was effective in reducing HIV risk behaviours, as evidenced by an increase in the use of condoms during their last sexual intercourse and consistent condom use during the last month.

AB  - Background Limited data, primarily from small case series, exist regarding the clinical profile, genetic variants, and outcomes of WDR72-associated distal renal tubular acidosis (WDR72-dRTA). Methods Our study enrolled children diagnosed with WDR72-dRTA below 18 years of age from 9 Indian centers and analyzed their clinical characteristics, genetic profiles, and outcomes. Potential genotype-phenotype correlations were explored. Results We report 22 patients (59% female) with WDR72-dRTA who were diagnosed at a median age of 5.3 (3, 8) years with polyuria (n = 17; 77.3%), poor growth (16; 72.7%), and rickets (9; 40.9%). Amelogenesis imperfecta was present in 21 (95.5%) cases. At presentation, all patients had normal anion gap metabolic acidosis; hypokalemia and nephrocalcinosis were seen in 17 (77.3%) patients each. Seven (31.8%) patients had concomitant proximal tubular dysfunction. Genetic analysis identified biallelic nonsense variants in 18 (81.8%) patients, including novel variants in 6 cases. A previously reported variant, c.88C > T, and a novel variant, c.655C > T, were the most frequent variants, accounting for 10 (45.5%) cases. Over a median follow-up of 1.3 (1, 8) years, the height velocity improved by 0.74 (0.2, 1.2) standard deviation scores, while 3 children (13.6%) progressed to chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2, with eGFR ranging from 67 to 76 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively, after 11.3-16 years of follow-up. No specific genotype-phenotype correlation could be established. Conclusions WDR72-dRTA should be considered in children with typical features of amelogenesis imperfecta and dRTA. Biallelic nonsense variants are common in Asians. While most patients respond well to treatment with improved growth and preserved eGFR, on long-term follow-up, a decline in eGFR may occur.

AB  - BackgroundPre-vascular facial nodes (PV-FNs; perifacial lymph nodes) are supra-mandibular lymph nodes above the inferior border of the mandible. These are not part of routine neck dissection done for OCSCC. These lymph nodes can be sentinel station for metastatic lymph nodes from gingivobuccal complex cancers and are missed during routine neck dissection. It is imperative to include this sentinel station in routine neck dissection to prevent nodal recurrences.Materials and MethodsOne hundred thirty-seven patients with GBCC (T1-T4) were prospectively recruited between May 2020 and June 2022 with the intent to evaluate the incidence of PV-FN metastases and clinicopathological factors predicting them.ResultsPV-FN metastases were seen in 26 patients (18.9%; 26/137). The occult metastasis rate was 8.7% (12/137). On multivariate analysis, pathological T4 stage (pT4), LVE positivity, and intermediate-high BGS were statistically significant predictors of PV-FN metastases in our study.ConclusionsIncidence of PV-FN metastasis is high (18.9%) in GBCC, which can be potentially the first sentinel station in the lymphatic drainage pattern for this sub-site. Meticulous clearance of this nodal basin is of paramount importance during neck dissection to prevent nodal recurrences.Level of EvidenceLevel 2 (CEBM-Level of Evidence-2.1) Laryngoscope, 2024

AB  - Objectives To develop two ethical checklists to evaluate (i) management of ethical concerns in research projects and (ii) awareness of ethical conduct of healthcare laboratory professionals.Methods Comprehensive discussion among the members of IFCC Task Force on Ethics based on pertinent literature.Results This Checklist for Clinical Research Projects should be useful to evaluate research proposals from an ethical perspective before submitting it to an IRB or its equivalent, thereby diminishing rejection rates and resulting in more time-effective projects. The checklist designed to evaluate the ethical conduct in laboratory medicine could be useful for self evaluation (internal audits) and for certification/accreditation processes performed by third parties.Conclusions These checklists are simple but powerful tools useful to guide professionals to adhere to ethical principles in their practice, especially in developing countries where accredited ethics committees may be difficult to find.

AB  - Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an inborn metabolic error caused by cationic amino acid transport defects. The disease has a significant degree of phenotypic variation, with no confirmed genotype-phenotype correlation. Because it presents with symptoms similar to far more common diseases, the diagnosis is often missed, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. This case series describes three examples of LPI with pulmonary, neurological, and immunological manifestations, emphasising the importance of keeping this disorder on the differential list. Appropriate metabolic and genetic testing is important in providing the correct diagnosis and timely care in such cases.

AB  - Background Furosemide stress test (FST) is a novel functional biomarker for predicting severe acute kidney injury (AKI); however, pediatric studies are limited. Methods Children 3 months to 18 years of age admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital from Nov 2019 to July 2021 were screened and those who developed AKI stage 1 or 2 within 7 days of admission underwent FST (intravenous furosemide 1 mg/kg). Urine output was measured hourly for the next 6 h; a value > 2 ml/kg within the first 2 h was deemed furosemide responsive. Other biomarkers like plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and proenkephalin (PENK) were also evaluated. Results Of the 480 admitted patients, 51 developed AKI stage 1 or 2 within 7 days of admission and underwent FST. Nine of these patients were furosemide non-responsive. Thirteen (25.5%) patients (eight of nine from FST non-responsive group) developed stage 3 AKI within 7 days of FST, nine (17.6%) of whom (seven from non-responsive group) required kidney support therapy (KST). FST emerged as a good biomarker for predicting stage 3 AKI and need for KST with area-under-the-curve (AUC) being 0.93 +/- 0.05 (95% CI 0.84-1.0) and 0.96 +/- 0.03 (95% CI 0.9-1.0), respectively. FST outperformed NGAL and PENK in predicting AKI stage 3 and KST; however, the combination did not improve the diagnostic accuracy. Conclusions Furosemide stress test is a simple, inexpensive, and robust biomarker for predicting stage 3 AKI and KST need in critically ill children. Further research is required to identify the best FST cut-off in children.

The levels of endocannabinoids-anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2AG) in plasma, aqueous humor and tears; cortisol in plasma and aqueous humor; and WHO-QOL score in each group were noted. Results Plasma AEA (p = 0.01) and plasma 2-AG, (p = 0.002) levels were significantly higher in the control group as compared to the PACG group. WHO-QOL score was better in controls (p < 0.001). The EC were in undetectable levels in aqueous. Plasma and aqueous cortisol were significantly higher in PACG and both had the highest Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve value for differentiating PACG from controls. Tear 2AG and tear AEA had a moderately strong positive correlation with plasma 2-AG. Females had insignificantly higher levels of plasma and tear endocannabinoids. Conclusions Tear endocannabinoids were determined for the first time in PACG and normal with no difference between the two groups. Plasma and aqueous cortisol levels are a differentiating factor between normal and glaucoma patients with plasma endocannabinoids being remarkably higher in normals. Quality of life in glaucoma patients with high cortisol levels is poorer.

AB  - The deterioration of cartilage tissue and other joint components composed of synovial tissue is a defining characteristic of osteoarthritis (OA) disease. Because of the lack of understanding of the underlying cause and important molecular pathways, there are currently no effective diagnostic or treatment methods for OA. The purpose of the study is to find a specific protein biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity in order to understand the pathophysiology of the disease and the underlying molecular pathways. We examined plasma samples of matched age and sex from OA patients (n = 150) and healthy controls (HC) (n = 70) to find proteins that were differentially expressed and validated by western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. The results of western blotting demonstrated that the expression level of the fibrinogen alpha (FGA) protein was higher in plasma samples of osteoarthritis (OAPL) (p = 0.0343), and the ROC (receiver operating characteristic curve) curve supported the high sensitivity (95.22%) and specificity (74%) of FGA in OA plasma compared to healthy controls. FGA protein was detected to be deposited in the synovial tissue of OA patients (p = 0.0073). By activating the Toll-like receptor (TLR-4) receptor pathway in PBMCs (p = 0.04) and synovial tissue, FGA protein may be involved in the molecular mechanism of OA pathogenesis. Our findings collectively suggested that FGA, which is significantly expressed in OA plasma, synovial tissue, and PBMCs and is connected to the disease's advancement through the TLR-4 receptor, may serve as a diagnostic or disease-evolving tool for OA.

AB  - Background: Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical conditions. Although surgical evacuation is still the gold standard for treatment, recent advances have led to the development of other management strategies, such as medical therapies and endovascular middle meningeal artery (MMA) embolization. Through this international survey, we investigated the global trends in cSDH management, focusing on medical and endovascular treatments.Design and participants: A 14-question, web-based, anonymous survey was distributed to neurosurgeons worldwide.Results: Most responders do not perform MMA embolization (69.5%) unless for specific indications (29.6%). These indications include residual cSDH after surgical evacuation (58.9%) or cSDH in patients on antiplatelet medications to avoid surgical evacuation (44.8%). Survey participants from teaching versus non-teaching hospitals (p = 0.002), public versus private hospitals (p = 0.022), and Europe versus other continents (p < 0.001) are the most users of MMA embolization. A large number of participants (51%) declare they use a conservative/medical approach, mainly to avoid surgery in patients with small cSDH (74.8%).Conclusions: This survey highlights the current trends of cSDH management, focusing on conservative and MMA embolization treatment strategies. Most responders prefer a conservative approach for patients with small cSDHs not requiring surgical evacuation. However, in higher-risk scenarios such as residual hematomas after surgery or patients on antiplatelet medications, MMA embolization is regarded as a reasonable option by participants. Future studies should clarify the indications of MMA embolization, including appropriate patient selection and efficacy as a stand-alone procedure.

AB  - Injuries arising from car crashes are ubiquitous across the globe and account for over 1.3 million fatalities annually. 93% of mortalities are observed in middle- and low-income countries owing to the lack of infrastructure in the safety assessment of car designs. It is therefore imperative to predict the extent of injuries to the occupants during car crashes, which would lead to safer vehicle design. To date, conventional computational testing methods use Hybrid III dummies, which fail to reproduce fracture and tear injuries. In this work, a full-frontal collision of a vehicle against a rigid wall with a highly biofidelic human body model of an occupant was simulated for the first time to investigate fractures and tears using a novel fracture modeling technique. Fractures were observed in ribs (5-7), which occurred at stresses of 120 MPa at the left lateral vertebrosternal region. In the lower extremity, tears in the ligaments at 70.80 MPa, and fractures in the tibia and femur at 236 MPa were quantified. Stresses in the skull were limited to 11 MPa, indicating a possibility of concussion rather than fractures. The developed computational model would be indispensable for car manufacturers to test the crash impact on the human body at all possible accident scenarios accurately, which will help design better solutions for automotive injury mitigation.

KW  - Seizures
KW  - Neonate
KW  - Neurodevelopment
AB  - ObjectivesTo review whether levetiracetam is non-inferior to phenobarbitone as the first-choice antiseizure medication (ASM).MethodsThe authors searched Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until May 31, 2023. RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of levetiracetam and phenobarbitone as first-line ASM in neonatal seizures were included. Random effects meta-analysis was performed, and the Risk of Bias version 2 tool was used for quality assessment.ResultsEleven RCTs enrolling 821 neonates [mostly term, with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)] were included. There was no significant difference in seizure control between levetiracetam and phenobarbitone (10 RCTs, 786 participants; relative risk RR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.54; I2- 88%). Neonates in the levetiracetam group had a significantly lower incidence of hypotension (RR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.86), respiratory depression (RR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.66), and depressed sensorium (RR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.00). Three studies compared neurodevelopmental outcomes; however two of them were cross-over trials where infants received both drugs. Only one RCT enrolled pure cohorts and showed better neurodevelopment in the levetiracetam group at one month of age.ConclusionsWith the limitation of very-low certainty evidence, the results of this systematic review suggest that levetiracetam may be non-inferior to phenobarbitone for managing neonatal seizures. Considering a better safety profile and marginally better neurodevelopment in the short term, levetiracetam may be considered an initial choice for managing neonatal seizures.Registration NumberPROSPERO (CRD42023438018).
