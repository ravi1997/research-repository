TI  - Chronic ocular sequelae in Stevens-Johnson syndrome: a genetic association study
T2  - MOLECULAR VISION
KW  - TOXIC EPIDERMAL NECROLYSIS
KW  - RISK
KW  - MANIFESTATIONS
KW  - COMPLICATIONS
AB  - Purpose: This study sought to investigate the association of molecular markers with chronic ocular sequelae in Ste-vens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN).Methods: One hundred SJS/TEN patients (200 eyes) with confirmed diagnosis were enrolled between July 2011 and July 2015 from a tertiary eye-care hospital, and their clinical histories were noted. Each eye was scored for severity of manifestation on a scale of 0-5. Peripheral blood samples were collected for DNA followed by screening for interleukins (IL-4, IL-13, IL-4R) polymorphisms, HLA-A locus allele typing, and sera to detect levels of the apoptotic markers granulysin and sFas L.Results: Of the 100 enrolled patients (53 males/47 females; age range: 6-58 years), the incriminating drugs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (52%), antibiotics (10%), sulphonamides (8%), anti-epileptics (6%), and unknown (24%). Significant differences in the frequencies of IL-4R polymorphism, HLA-A*3301, HLA-A*02, and HLA-A*2402 alleles, and elevated levels of granulysin and sFas L were observed in patients compared to controls. The ocular complications of conjunctival keratinization (p=0.004) showed an association with IL-13 promoter region (IL-13a) genotypes.Conclusions: The study highlights the possible association of interleukin-13 with severity-graded chronic sequelae and the role of HLA-A alleles-HLA-A*3301, HLA-A*02, and HLA-A*2402 in SJS/TEN causation and manifestation. Screening of these alleles may help caregivers to identify alleles associated with severe and lifelong ocular complications, and help in appropriate treatment and management of the condition.

AB  - MARCH7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to regulate neuronal development,T-cell proliferation, and cell and tissue differentiation. But, the altered expression of MARCH7 has been observed in various malignancies. Herein, the cellular localization and role of MARCH7 have been elucidated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the information regarding which is currently limited. To check the expression of MARCH7 and its correlation with immune cells infiltration in ESCC, immunohistochemical analysis was performed. RNAi approach was used to investigate the role of MARCH7 in esophageal cancer cells. Interestingly, we found a significantly higher expression of MARCH7 protein in 84% of ESCC tissues than in distant matched non-malignant tissues (p <= 0.001). In addition to this, immunohistochemistry results have shown a negative correlation between MARCH7 protein expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells such as CD8 + T cells (r = - 0.633, p = 0.001) and PD1 + T cells (r = - 0.560, p = 0.005). Furthermore, MARCH7 silencing inhibited the ESCC cell growth and reduced the clonogenic and invasion/migration potential of ESCC cells. MARCH7 silencing also significantly increased E-cadherin protein levels in ESCC cells relative to those in negative control cells (p < 0.05). Thus, MARCH7 is oncogenic and might have a possible role in esophageal carcinogenesis. Moreover, E-cadherin may be a downstream target of MARCH7 in ESCC.

AB  - BackgroundEarly prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is important to aid personalized treatment in osteosarcoma. Diffusion-weighted Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) MRI was used to evaluate the predictive value for response to NACT and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.MethodsTotal fifty-five patients with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were recruited prospectively, among them 35 patients were further analysed. Patients underwent 3 cycles of NACT (Cisplatin+Doxorubicin) followed by surgery and response adapted adjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment outcomes were histopathological response to NACT (good-response >= 50% necrosis and poor-response<50% necrosis) and survival outcome (event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)). IVIM MRI was acquired at 1.5T at baseline (t0), after 1-cycle (t1) and after 3-cycles (t2) of NACT. Quantitative IVIM parameters (D, D*, f & D*.f) were estimated using advanced state-of-the-art spatial penalty based IVIM analysis method bi-exponential model with total-variation penalty function (BETV) at 3 time-points and histogram analysis was performed.ResultsGood-responders: Poor-responders ratio was 13 (37%):22 (63%). EFS and OS were 31% and 69% with 16.27 and 25.9 months of median duration respectively. For predicting poor-response to NACT, IVIM parameters showed AUC=0.87, Sensitivity=86%, Specificity=77% at t0, and AUC=0.96, Sensitivity=86%, Specificity=100% at t1. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed smaller tumour volume (HR=1.002, p=0.001) higher ADC-25(th)-percentile (HR=0.047, p=0.005) & D-Mean (HR=0.1, p=0.023) and lower D*-Mean (HR=1.052, p=0.039) were independent predictors of longer EFS (log-rank p-values: 0.054, 0.0034, 0.0017, 0.0019 respectively) and non-metastatic disease (HR=4.33, p<10(-3)), smaller tumour-volume (HR=1.001, p=0.042), lower D*-Mean (HR=1.045, p=0.056) and higher D*.f-skewness (HR=0.544, p=0.048) were independent predictors of longer OS (log-rank p-values:<10(-3), 0.07,<10(-3), 0.019 respectively).ConclusionIVIM parameters obtained with a 1.5T scanner along with novel BETV method and their histogram analysis indicating tumour heterogeneity were informative in characterizing NACT response and survival outcome in osteosarcoma.

AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization have increased air pollution, which poses a serious threat to human life. In megacities, the number of patients suffering from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases have increased rapidly. Face mask can be used for protection from outdoor air pollution, but indoor air quality can only be maintained through expensive, energy-inefficient air filtration devices. In the present study, nanofibrous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) filters encapsulated with titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were developed using the electrospinning technique. The filters are porous and nearly transparent and therefore do not resist sunlight and airflow. Field testing of the PAN : TiO2 filters was done against the real aerosol particles and laboratory testing was done against ammonium sulphate particles. The field test results showed efficiency of about similar to 81% against total suspended aerosol particles (TSPM) and similar to 75% against laboratory generated particles. The TiO2 nanoparticles have been reported to kill the influenza virus and may help minimize an individual's exposure to many harmful microbes due to their antimicrobial properties.

KW  - RISK-FACTORS
AB  - In the second wave of COVID-19 in India, there was a new challenge in the form of mucormycosis. Coinfection with mucormycosis was perilous as both conditions required a prolonged hospital stay, thus serving as an ideal platform for secondary infections. Using a retrospective observational study, we studied secondary infections and their impact on the outcome in COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis. The outcome in these patients was evaluated and compared with COVID-19 patients with mucormycosis but without any secondary infection. SPSS V-20 was used for data analysis. Fifty-five patients tested positive for mucormycosis (55/140; 39.28). Twelve out of these 55 (21.8%) developed secondary infections during their hospital stay. Bloodstream infection was the most common (42.86%) secondary infection. The Gram-negative (GN) organisms were more common (11/16; 68.75%) compared with the Gram-positives (GP) (5/16; 31.25%). But the most common isolate was Enterococcus faecium (5/16; 31.25%). A high percentage of microorganisms isolated were multidrug-resistant (15/16; 93.75%). Two out of five (40%) isolates of Enterococcus faecium were vancomycin-resistant (VRE). High resistance to carbapenems was noted in the GN isolates (9/11; 81.81%). The comparison of length of stay in both subgroups was statistically significant (P value,0.001). When compared, the length of stay in people with adverse outcomes was also statistically significant (P value,0.001). Procalcitonin (PCT) had a positive predictive value for the development of secondary bacterial infections (P value,0.001). Antimicrobial stewardship and strict infection control practices are the need of the hour.

AB  - BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA.MethodsWe analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5x5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units.ResultsWe found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.ConclusionsAs the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.

AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is a glycosylated antimicrobial protein present in milk with a molecular mass of 78 kDa. LPO is included in many biological processes and is well-known to have biocidal actions, acting as an active antibiotic and antiviral agent. The wide spectrum biocidal activity of LPO is mediated via a definite inhibitory system named lactoperoxidase system which plays a potent role in the innate immune response. With the current advancement in nanotechnology, nanoformulations can be developed for stabilizing and potentiating the activity of LPO for several applications. In the research described in this Research Communication, fresh LPO purified from bovine mammary gland secretions was used for nanoparticle synthesis using a simple thermal process at different pH and temperatures. The round-shaped nanoparticles (average size 229 nm) were successfully synthesized at pH 7.0 and a temperature of 75 degrees C. These nanoparticles were tested against four different bacterial species namely S. flexineri, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and E. coli. The prepared nanoparticles exhibited strong inhibition of the growth against all four bacterial species as stated by their MIC and ZOI values. These results may help in increasing the efficiency of lactoperoxidase system and will assist in identifying novel avenues to enhance the stability and antimicrobial function of LPO in drug discovery and industrial processes.

AB  - Background Reducing the burden of death due to infection is an urgent global public health priority. Previous studies have estimated the number of deaths associated with drug-resistant infections and sepsis and found that infections remain a leading cause of death globally. Understanding the global burden of common bacterial pathogens (both susceptible and resistant to antimicrobials) is essential to identify the greatest threats to public health. To our knowledge, this is the first study to present global comprehensive estimates of deaths associated with 33 bacterial pathogens across 11 major infectious syndromes.
   Methods We estimated deaths associated with 33 bacterial genera or species across 11 infectious syndromes in 2019 using methods from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, in addition to a subset of the input data described in the Global Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance 2019 study. This study included 343 million individual records or isolates covering 11 361 study-location-years. We used three modelling steps to estimate the number of deaths associated with each pathogen: deaths in which infection had a role, the fraction of deaths due to infection that are attributable to a given infectious syndrome, and the fraction of deaths due to an infectious syndrome that are attributable to a given pathogen. Estimates were produced for all ages and for males and females across 204 countries and territories in 2019. 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) were calculated for final estimates of deaths and infections associated with the 33 bacterial pathogens following standard GBD methods by taking the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles across 1000 posterior draws for each quantity of interest.
   Findings From an estimated 13.7 million (95% UI 10.9-17.1) infection-related deaths in 2019, there were 7.7 million deaths (5.7-10.2) associated with the 33 bacterial pathogens (both resistant and susceptible to antimicrobials) across the 11 infectious syndromes estimated in this study. We estimated deaths associated with the 33 bacterial pathogens to comprise 13.6% (10.2-18.1) of all global deaths and 56.2% (52.1-60.1) of all sepsis-related deaths in 2019. Five leading pathogens-Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-were responsible for 54.9% (52.9-56.9) of deaths among the investigated bacteria. The deadliest infectious syndromes and pathogens varied by location and age. The age-standardised mortality rate associated with these bacterial pathogens was highest in the sub-Saharan Africa super-region, with 230 deaths (185-285) per 100 000 population, and lowest in the high-income super-region, with 52.2 deaths (37.4-71.5) per 100 000 population. S aureus was the leading bacterial cause of death in 135 countries and was also associated with the most deaths in individuals older than 15 years, globally. Among children younger than 5 years, S pneumoniae was the pathogen associated with the most deaths. In 2019, more than 6 million deaths occurred as a result of three bacterial infectious syndromes, with lower respiratory infections and bloodstream infections each causing more than 2 million deaths and peritoneal and intra-abdominal infections causing more than 1 million deaths.
   Interpretation The 33 bacterial pathogens that we investigated in this study are a substantial source of health loss globally, with considerable variation in their distribution across infectious syndromes and locations. Compared with GBD Level 3 underlying causes of death, deaths associated with these bacteria would rank as the second leading cause of death globally in 2019; hence, they should be considered an urgent priority for intervention within the global health community. Strategies to address the burden of bacterial infections include infection prevention, optimised use of antibiotics, improved capacity for microbiological analysis, vaccine development, and improved and more pervasive use of available vaccines. These estimates can be used to help set priorities for vaccine need, demand, and development. Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BackgroundThe association of conventional (modifiable and non-modifiable) risk factors for hypertension has already been established in the literature. However, there are other putative risk factors specific to women (early menarche, age at first childbirth, women empowerment, number of children born, hysterectomy, etc.) in the development of hypertension. This study is the first study to highlight the potential association of gender-specific factors along with other conventional risk factors and hypertension, using a nationwide sample. MethodsThe study is a secondary analysis of the data collected from the National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4), a nationally representative sample of 699,686 women of reproductive age in India. The interview schedule included data on general background characteristics, marriage, reproductive history, hysterectomy, knowledge, and utilization of family planning services, maternal and child care, women empowerment, non-communicable diseases, and domestic violence. The blood pressure was measured by direct observation by the study investigators using a digital blood pressure monitor. To account for disproportionate sampling and non-response, a weighted statistical analysis was performed. Logistic regression analysis was done to study the strength of the association between the risk factors and hypertension (computation of unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio). ResultsThe prevalence of hypertension was 11.8% among women. Among the conventional factors, older age, higher body mass index (BMI), tobacco use, and alcohol use had higher odds for hypertension, while higher education, higher socio-economic position, and living in urban areas had lower odds. Among the gender-specific factors, younger age at first childbirth, early menarche, oral contraceptive pill use [adjusted OR: 1.23; (1.18-1.28)], and hysterectomy [adjusted OR: 1.10; (1.05-1.69)] were found to be risk factors for hypertension. Domestic violence was significantly associated with hypertension [unadjusted OR: 1.11; (1.02-1.20)]. Empowered women had lower odds of hypertension [adjusted OR: 0.93; (0.95-1.03)]. ConclusionSignificant association of these gender-specific factors among women necessitates the need for taking into account these factors while screening for hypertension among women and thus, designing a tailored model better suited to them for risk assessment.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most devastating injuries which causes either complete or partial loss of movement, balance, muscular coordination and endurance. Electromagnetic field (EMF) stimulation has been shown to reduce muscle atrophy and fiber-type switching and improves muscle function in a hindlimb suspension model. The present study aims to elucidate the therapeutic potential of EMF stimulation on motor neuron excitability, soleus muscle morphology and function in complete SCI rats. Thirty-six adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into Sham, SCI and SCI+EMF groups. Complete transection was done at the T13 spinal level, followed by whole-body EMF exposure for 7 or 14 days. Hyper-reflexia, muscle atrophy, reduction in twitch and tetanic force with earlier onset of fatigue was evident in the SCI group. EMF stimulation showed significant improvement in H and M wave parameters, H/M ratio, muscle twitch and tetanic force, fusion frequency and fatigability. A significant increase in regenerating myofibers and reduction in muscle degeneration following EMF was evident on histopathological examination. Further, EMF significantly increased myogenic protein levels responsible for muscle regeneration. Our study demonstrates for the first time the potential of EMF to modulate motor neuron excitability and muscle contractile function in SCI rats through activity-dependent mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to understand the global trends in the proliferation of various minimal invasive approaches including the endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) and the extended EEA. Questions about the use of the supraorbital and transorbital approach were also included. METHODS: We conducted an online anonymized and validated survey using a structured questionnaire on the use of EEA and EEEA, as well as periorbital approaches, in the management of sellar, suprasellar, and parasellar le-sions in different parts of the world. RESULTS: A total of 261 responses were received. Of respondents, 195 (74.71%) received training in EEA, but less than half during residency. Of respondents, 108 mentioned that parasellar lesions comprised 5%-25% of the total cases encountered in the past 5 years in their practice. Only half of the respondents relied on ENT (ear, nose, and throat) colleagues for the approach. Whereas Europe and South America relied on EEA about half the time, North America and Asia used EEA only a third of the time; in Africa, EEA was hardly used at all. The proportion of re-spondents using EEA for > 50% of giant pituitary adenoma, olfactory groove meningiomas, craniopharyngiomas, chor-doma, tuberculum sella meningiomas, and malignant skull base tumors was 34.5%, 3.4%, 13%, 16%, 7%, and 10%, respectively. EEEA, the supraorbital approach, and the transorbital approach were used by 50.6%, 54.4%, and 34.5%, respectively. EEEA was used predominantly by those having an experience of 11-20 years or > 30 years after residency (P [ 0.018) and those from North America (64.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey highlights the various geographic and demographic trends in the use of the EEA for sellar, suprasellar, and parasellar diseases.. Although EEA training was present in almost all countries, the approach was not used as frequently as would have been expected for giant adenomas, craniopharyngiomas, and chordomas. After 20 years of education about the technique and indications of the endoscopic endonasal approach, through countless courses and publications, the use of EEA is still lagging, particularly in developing countries.

AB  - Objective: Despite decades of experience, aspects of the management of tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary stenosis (TOF) remain controversial. Practitioners must consider newer, evolving treatment strategies with limited data to guide decision sioned by the American Association for Thoracic Surgery to provide a framework on this topic, focused on timing and types of interventions, management of highrisk patients, technical considerations during interventions, and best practices for assessment of outcomes of the interventions. In addition, the group was tasked with identifying pertinent research questions for future investigations. It is recognized that variability in institutional experience could influence the application of this framework to clinical practice. Methods: The TOF Clinical Practice Standards Committee is a multinational, multidisciplinary group of cardiologists and surgeons with expertise in TOF. With the assistance of a medical librarian, a citation search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed using key words related to TOF and its management; the search was restricted to the English language and the year 2000 or later. Articles pertaining to pulmonary atresia, absent pulmonary valve, atrioventricular septal defects, and adult patients with TOF were excluded, as well as nonprimary sources such as review articles. This yielded nearly 20,000 results, of which 163 were included. Greater consideration was given to more recent studies, larger studies, and those using comparison groups with randomization or propensity score matching. Expert consensus statements with class of recommendation and level of evidence were developed using a modified Delphi method, requiring 80% of the member votes with 75% agreement on each statement. Results: In asymptomatic infants, complete surgical correction between age 3 and 6 months is reasonable to reduce the length of stay, rate of adverse events,

AB  - Background: Indiscriminate and widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in emergence of many antibiotic-resistant organisms. Antibiotic administration during pregnancy is mostly avoided, unless there is compelling medical condition. We hypothesized that the uropathogens isolated from pregnant women would be more susceptible to antibiotics compared to those isolated from nonpregnant women, thus will be helpful in formulating separate empiric guideline for pregnant women based on the resistance pattern. Methods: This was a prospective cross-sectional study conducted over a period of 2 years in which females with the clinical diagnosis of either cystitis or asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy were included from the community settings. Uropathogen species and their antimicrobial resistance pattern were compared between the pregnant and nonpregnant groups. After accounting for centre-to-centre variation and adjusting for age and socio-economic status, the adjusted odds ratio for antibiotic resistance was calculated and compared between pregnant and nonpregnant women using logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 1758 women (pregnant: 43.3%; nonpregnant: 56.6%) were screened in the study over a period of 2 years, out of which 9.3% (163/1758) were having significant bacteriuria. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two commonest uropathogen in both the groups; their prevalence being 83.6% in pregnant women and 85.2% in nonpregnant women, respectively. Resistance against ampicillin, cefixime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were found significantly lower in the pregnant women compared to nonpregnant. After adjusting the age and socio-economic status accounting for centre-to-centre variation, the odds of resistance for cefixime, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and co-trimoxazole were found lower and statistically significant among the pregnant women group. Conclusions: The antimicrobial resistance was significantly higher among the community-dwelling nonpregnant women compared to pregnant women in case of few antibiotics. The study highlighted the need of building local antibiogram that could help to initiate the empirical treatment and thus prevent emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - Introduction This study was conducted with the objective to analyze the out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditure and catastrophic healthcare expenditure (CHE) on chronic non-communicable diseases (CNCD) among the elderly population, and the association of CHE on CNCD with associated factors among the same population.
   Materials and methods We collected data from the elderly population of Dharan Sub-metropolitan city of the Eastern Nepal via door-to-door survey and face-to-face interview. The ten wards out of twenty were chosen by lottery method, and the equal proportion out of 280 samples was purposively chosen from each of ten wards (28 participants from each selected ward). The data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2019 v16.0 and statistical analysis was performed by using statistical package for social sciences, IBM SPSS (R) v21. The chi-square test was used to test the group differences. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine independent factors associated with CHE (all variables with P < 0.20), and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated at 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results The median household, food and health expenditures were 95325 (72112.50-126262.50), 45000 (33000-60000) and 2100 (885.00-6107.50) NPR respectively. The proportion of the participants with CHE was 14.6%. The single living participants had 3.4 times higher odds of catastrophic health expenditure (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 1.2-9.6, P-value = 0.022) than those who are married. Similarly, those who had cancer had 0.1 times lower odds of CHE (AOR = 0.1, 95% CI = 0.0-0.2, P-value = <0.001) than those without cancer.
   Conclusion The elder population had significant financial health shocks due to chronic health ailments. There should be the provision of mandatory health insurance programmes for elderly to cut down the catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Similarly, there should be the provision of exemption scheme for vulnerable elderly who are more likely to face catastrophic expenditure from all available health facilities.

AB  - Maximum diameter and volume of the tumour provide important clinical information and are decision-making parameters for patients suspected with prostate cancer (PCa). The objectives of this study were to develop an automated method for 3D tumour measurement and compare it with the radiologist's manual assessment, as well as to investigate the impact of 3D tumour measurement on Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version-2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1) scoring of prostate cancer. Tumour maximum diameter and volume were calculated using automated ellipsoid-fit method. For all PI-RADS scores, mean +/- standard deviation range of tumour maximum diameter and volume measured using ellipsoid-fit method were 1.36 +/- 0.28 to 1.97 +/- 0.67 cm and 0.49 +/- 0.31 to 1.05 +/- 0.78 cc and manual assessment were in range of 0.73 +/- 0.12 to 1.14 +/- 0.25 cm and 0.36 +/- 0.21 to 0.93 +/- 0.39 cc, respectively. Ellipsoid-fit method showed significantly (p<0.05) higher values for maximum diameter and volume than manual assessment. 3D measurement of tumour using ellipsoid-fit method was found to have higher maximum diameter and volume values (in 40-61% patients) compared to conventional assessment by radiologist, which may have an impact on PI-RADS v2.1 scoring system.

AB  - Colistin resistance is a globalized sensible issue because it has been considered a drug of the last-line resort to treat drug-resistant bacterial infections. The product of the mobilized colistin resistance (mcr) gene and its variants are the significant causes of colistin resistance, which is emerging due to the frequent colistin use in veterinary, and these genes circulate among the bacterial community. Apart from mcr genes, some other intrinsic genes and proteins are also involved in colistin resistance. Researchers focus on the most advanced genomics (whole genome sequencing), proteomics, and bioinformatics approaches to explore the question of colistin resistance. To combat colistin resistance, researchers developed various strategies such as the development of newer drugs, the repurposing of existing drugs, combinatorial treatment by colistin with other drugs, a nano-based approach, photodynamic therapy, a CRISPRi-based strategy, and a phage-based strategy. In this timeline review, we have discussed the development of colistin resistance and its management in developing countries.

AB  - Background: Several methodological tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Tests are mostly used in the aid of diagnosis or for serological assessment. No tests are fully confirmatory and have variable level of diagnostic ability. We aimed at assessing agreement with three serological tests: quantitative anti receptor binding domain ELISA (Q-RBD), qualitative ELISA (WANTAI SARS-CoV-2 Ab) and qualitative chemiluminescence assay (CLIA). Methods: This study was a part of a large population based sero-epidemiological cohort study. Participants aged 1 year or older were included from 25 randomly selected clusters each in Delhi urban (urban resettlement colony of South Delhi district) and Delhi rural (villages in Faridabad district, Haryana). Three type of tests were applied to all the baseline blood samples. Result of the three tests were evaluated by estimating the total agreement and kappa value. Results: Total 3491 blood samples collected from March to September, 2021, out of which 1700 (48.7%) from urban and 1791 (51.3%) from rural. Overall 44.1% of participants were male. The proportion of sero-positivity were 78.1%, 75.2% and 31.8% by Wantai, QRBD and CLIA tests respectively. The total agreement between Wantai and QRBD was 94.5%, 53.1% between Wantai and CLIA, and 56.8% between QRBD and CLIA. The kappa value between these three tests were 0.84 (95% CI 0.80-0.87), 0.22 (95% CI 0.19-0.24) and 0.26 (95% CI 0.23-0.28). Conclusions: There was strong concordance between Wantai and QRBD test. Agreement between CLIA with other two tests was low. Wantai and QRBD tests measuring the antibody to same S protein can be used with high agreement based on the relevant scenario.

AB  - IntroductionOsteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints mainly affecting older individuals. Since the etiology behind the progression of OA is not well understood, several associated consequences, such as synovial joint stiffness and its progression due to joint fibrosis, are still poorly understood. Although a lot of developments have been achieved in the diagnosis and management of OA, synovial fibrosis remains one of the major challenging consequences. The present study was therefore focused on understanding the mechanism of synovial fibrosis, which may further contribute to improving symptomatic treatments, leading to overall improvements in the treatment outcomes of patients with OA. MethodsWe used advanced proteomic techniques including isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation and sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra for the identification of differentially expressed proteins in the plasma samples of patients with OA. An in silico study was carried out to evaluate the association of the identified proteins with their biological processes related to fibrosis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The most significantly upregulated protein was then validated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The target protein was then further investigated for its role in inflammation and joint fibrosis using an in vitro study model. ResultsLeucine-rich alpha-2 glycoprotein (LRG1) was found to be the most highly differentially expressed upregulated (9.4-fold) protein in the plasma samples of patients with OA compared to healthy controls. The knockdown of LRG1 followed by in vitro studies revealed that this protein promotes the secretion of the ECM in synovial cells and actively plays a role in wound healing and cell migration. The knockdown of LRG1 further confirmed the reduction of the inflammatory- and fibrosis-related markers in primary cells. ConclusionLRG1 was identified as a highly significant upregulated protein in the plasma samples of patients with OA. It was found to be associated with increased fibrosis and cell migration, leading to enhanced inflammation and joint stiffness in OA pathogenesis.

Medicinal plants have been classified in Ayurveda under six rasas/tastes-sweet, sour, saline, pungent, bitter and astringent. This study has explored for the first time, the use of Electronic tongue for studies of rasa-based classification of medicinal plants.Methods: Seventy-eight medicinal plants, belonging to five taste categories (sweet, sour, pungent, bitter, astringent) were studied along with the reference taste standards (citric acid, hydrochloric acid, caffeine, quinine, L-alanine, glycine, beta-glucose, sucrose, D-galactose, cellobiose, arabinose, maltose, mannose, lactose, xylose). The studies were carried out with the potentiometry-based Electronic tongue and the data was analysed using Principle Component Analysis, Discriminant Function Analysis, Taste Discrimination Analysis and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy.Results: Chemosensory similarities were observed between taste standards and the plant samples-citric acid with sour group plants, sweet category plants with sucrose, glycine, beta-glucose and D-galactose. The multivariate analyses could discriminate the sweet and sour, sweet and bitter, sweet and pungent, sour and pungent plant groups. Chemosensory category of plant (classified as unknown) could also be identified.Conclusion: This preliminary study has indicated the possibility of fingerprinting the chemosensory-based ayurvedic classification of medicinal plants using E-tongue coupled with multivariate statistical analysis.

AB  - Background. Fungal disease is frequent in India, but its incidence and prevalence are unclear. This review aims at defining the frequency or burden of various fungal infections in India. Methods. A systematic review of the literature on the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science (WOS) databases was conducted using appropriate search strings. Deterministic modeling determined annual incidence and prevalence estimates for multiple life- and sight-threatening infections with significant morbidity. Results. Literature searches yielded >2900 papers; 434 papers with incidence/prevalence/proportion data were analyzed. An estimated 57 251 328 of the 1 393 400 000 people in India (4.1%) suffer from a serious fungal disease. The prevalence (in millions) of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is 24.3, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is 2.0, tinea capitis in school-age children is 25, severe asthma with fungal sensitization is 1.36, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is 1.74, and chronic fungal rhinosinusitis is 1.52. The annual incidence rates of Pneumocystis pneumonia (58 400), invasive aspergillosis (250 900), mucormycosis (195 000), esophageal candidiasis in HIV (266 600), candidemia (188 000), fungal keratitis (1 017 100), and cryptococcal meningitis (11 500) were also determined. Histoplasmosis, talaromycosis, mycetoma, and chromoblastomycosis were less frequent. Conclusions. India's fungal burden is high and underappreciated in clinical practice.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used in physical therapy diagnosis and management for various impairments. Physical therapists (PTs) need to be able to utilize the latest innovative treatment techniques to improve the quality of care. The study aimed to describe PTs' views on AI and investigate multiple factors as indicators of AI knowledge, attitude, and adoption among PTs. Moreover, the study aimed to identify the barriers to using AI in rehabilitation. Two hundred and thirty-six PTs participated voluntarily in the study. A concurrent mixed-method design was used to document PTs' opinions regarding AI deployment in rehabilitation. A self-administered survey consisting of several aspects, including demographic, knowledge, uses, advantages, impacts, and barriers limiting AI utilization in rehabilitation, was used. A total of 63.3% of PTs reported that they had not experienced any kind of AI applications at work. The major factors predicting a higher level of AI knowledge among PTs were being a non-academic worker (OR = 1.77 [95% CI; 1.01 to 3.12], p = 0.04), being a senior PT (OR = 2.44, [95%CI: 1.40 to 4.22], p = 0.002), and having a Master/Doctorate degree (OR = 1.97, [95%CI: 1.11 to 3.50], p = 0.02). However, the cost and resources of AI were the major reported barriers to adopting AI-based technologies. The study highlighted a remarkable dearth of AI knowledge among PTs. AI and advanced knowledge in technology need to be urgently transferred to PTs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE To derive macronutrient recommendations for remission and prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Asian Indians using a data-driven optimization approach.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Dietary, behavioral, and demographic assessments were performed on 18,090 adults participating in the nationally representative, population-based Indian Council of Medical Research-India Diabetes (ICMR-INDIAB) study. Fasting and 2-h postglucose challenge capillary blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) were estimated. With HbA(1c) as the outcome, a linear regression model was first obtained for various glycemic categories: newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD), prediabetes (PD), and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Macronutrient recommendations were formulated as a constrained quadratic programming problem (QPP) to compute optimal macronutrient compositions that would reduce the sum of the difference between the estimated HbA(1c) from the linear regression model and the targets for remission (6.4% for NDD and 5.6% for PD) and prevention of progression to T2D in PD and NGT groups.
   RESULTS Four macronutrient recommendations (%E- Energy) emerged for 1) diabetes remission in NDD: carbohydrate, 49-54%; protein, 19-20%; and fat, 21-26%; 2) PD remission to NGT: carbohydrate, 50-56%; protein,18-20%; fat, 21-27%; 3 and 4) prevention of progression to T2D in PD and NGT: carbohydrate, 54-57% and 56-60%; protein, 16-20% and 14-17%, respectively; and fat 20-24% for PD and NGT.
   CONCLUSIONS We recommend reduction in carbohydrates (%E) and an increase in protein (%E) for both T2D remission and for prevention of progression to T2D in PD and NGT groups. Our results underline the need for new dietary guidelines that recommend appropriate changes in macronutrient composition for reducing the burden due to diabetes in South Asia.

AB  - The outcome for children with rheumatic diseases has been dramatically altered by the use of biological therapies. Increasing use of these agents will need careful monitoring for long term safety, particularly in children. Current data on safety of these drugs stem exclusively from Western literature. There is clear need for a registry of all children with rheumatic diseases who are commenced on biological agents to ensure appropriate pharmacovigilance. In this perspective, we discuss the need for and the role of a biologics registry for children with rheumatic diseases in India.

AB  - Objective The SVDsketch [MATLAB function which implements a randomized singular value decomposition (rSVD) algorithm] uses tolerance (tol) to adaptively determine the rank of the matrix sketch approximation. As the tol gets larger, fewer features of input image matrix are used in the matrix sketch. The objective of this study was to optimize the value of tol for compressing technetium-99m (Tc-99m) L,L, ethylenedicysteine (LLEC) renal dynamic (RD) study in minimum time preserving clinical information. Materials and methods At different values of tol [0.00012(default), 0.1, 0.01, and 0.05] 50 Tc-99m LLEC RD studies were compressed. Two nuclear medicine (NM) physicians compared compressed images at tol = 0.1 with its input images. The SVD computation time and compression factor were calculated for each study. The image quality metrics: Error, structural similarity index for measuring image quality, brightness, global contrast factor (GCF), contrast per pixel (CPP), and blur were used for objective assessment of image quality. Percentage error in split function estimated from compressed and original images was calculated. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied to find statistically significant difference between renal split function, blur, GCF, CPP, and brightness of the compressed image and the original image at alpha=0.05. Results As per NM physicians, compressed images estimated with tol = 0.1 were identical to the original images. Based on image quality metrics, compressed images were significantly less noisy, brighter, and have better contrast compared with its input images. There was insignificant difference in split renal function estimated from compressed RD study at tol = 0.1 and its original study. The SVD computation and percentage compression per study were found to be 0.04725 s and up to 74.53%. Conclusion The optimized value of tol for compressing Tc-99m LLEC RD study preserving clinical information was found to be 0.1, and SVD computation time: 0.04725 s.

AB  - Previous studies were mainly focused on genomic evolution and diversity of type species of Bifidobacterium genus due to their health-promoting effect on host. However, those studies were mainly based on species-level taxonomic resolution, adaptation, and characterization of carbohydrate metabolic features of the bifidobacterial species. Here, a comprehensive analysis of the type strain genome unveils the association of pan-genome evolution with the divergence of metabolic function of the Bifidobacterium genus. This study has also demonstrated that horizontal gene transfer, as well as genome expansion and reduction events, leads to the divergence of metabolic functions in Bifidobacterium genus. Furthermore, the genome-based search of probiotic traits among all the available bifidobacterial type strains gives hints on type species, that could confer health benefits to nutrient-deficient individuals. Altogether, the present study provides insight into the developments of genomic evolution, functional divergence, and potential probiotic type species of the Bifidobacterium genus.

AB  - Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there has been an unprecedented increase in the acquisition of chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Nearly 616 million people have been infected by COVID-19 worldwide to date, of whom many were subjected to CT scanning. CT exposes the patients to hazardous ionizing radiation, which can damage the genetic material in the cells, leading to stochastic health effects in the form of heritable genetic mutations and increased cancer risk. These probabilistic, long-term carcinogenic effects of radiation can be seen over a lifetime and may sometimes take several decades to manifest. This review briefly describes what is known about the health effects of radiation, the lowest dose for which there exists compelling evidence about increased radiation-induced cancer risk and the evidence regarding this risk at typical CT doses. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer from low- and standard-dose chest CT scans performed in COVID-19 subjects is also discussed along with the projected number of future cancers that could be related to chest CT scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The LAR of cancer Incidence from chest CT has also been compared with those from other radiation sources, daily life risks and lifetime baseline risk.

AB  - Thyroid carcinomas (TC) are rare in the pediatric population; however, they constitute the most common endocrine malignancy. Despite some similarities with adult carcinomas, they have distinct clinical behavior and responses to therapy due to their unique pathology and molecular characteristics. The age cut-off used for defining the pediatric age group has been variable across different studies, and the universally accepted recommendations influence accurate interpretation of the available data. Moreover, factors such as radiation exposure and germline mutations have greater impact in children than in adults. Papillary TC is the most common and the most evaluated pediatric TC. Others, including follicular, poorly differentiated and medullary carcinomas, are rarer and have limited available literature. Most studies are from the West. Asian studies are primarily from Japan, with few from China, India, Saudi Arabia and Republic of Korea. This review provides a comprehensive account of the well-established and novel biomarkers in the field, including point mutations, fusions, miRNA, and thyroid differentiation genes. Familial and syndromic associations are also discussed. Current management guidelines for pediatric patients are largely derived from those for adults. An awareness of the molecular landscape is essential to acknowledge the uniqueness of these tumors and establish specific diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines.

AB  - Purpose
   To explore the burden, clinical features and associations of trichiasis due to trachomatous and non-trachomatous aetiologies.
   Methods
   Consenting patients presenting with trichiasis of either eyelid (of one or both eyes) attending the outpatient department, cornea and oculoplasty clinics of a tertiary eye care hospital in New Delhi between August 2018 to March 2020 were included. A comprehensive examination including visual acuity and anterior segment evaluation and photography was performed. Grade of trichiasis, laterality, presence and grade of entropion, and information on corneal opacity, conjunctival scarring, Herbert's pits, and pannus, if present, were recorded in the case record form.
   Results
   Overall, 302 patients (454 eyes) with trichiasis were recruited. The most common attributed cause of upper eyelid trichiasis (276 patients, 405 eyes) was trachoma (26% of patients), followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome (23%), blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (17%) and old age (10%). A total of 296/405 eyes (73%) had some form of corneal involvement. Trachoma was not identified as the cause of trichiasis in any eye with lower eyelid-only disease.
   Conclusion
   Only about a quarter of upper eyelid trichiasis in this peri-elimination setting was attributed to trachoma. A distinction between trachomatous and non-trachomatous trichiasis is imperative to meaningfully determine whether elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has occurred. These data may have implications for population-based estimates of TT prevalence in India and other peri-elimination settings.
   Author summary
   "Elimination of trachoma as a public health problem" is defined in part by the presence of very low proportions of the population demonstrating the clinical sign "trachomatous trichiasis". Trichiasis is the condition in which eyelashes touch the eyeball. But determining whether trichiasis is trachomatous in origin requires expertise that most graders who contribute to field-based surveys do not have; the right approach has therefore been debated. We undertook a twenty-month prospective study of trichiasis in a tertiary eye care hospital in New Delhi, using expert examiners. The setting is important here because India is very close to having each district demonstrate a prevalence of upper eyelid trichiasis lower than the agreed elimination threshold prevalence for trachomatous trichiasis. Our data suggest that only 26% of upper eyelid trichiasis in this setting was attributable to trachoma. Trachoma was not identified as the cause of trichiasis in any eye with lower eyelid-only disease, supporting the recent change in definition of trachomatous trichiasis to include only disease affecting the upper eyelid. However, better ways to routinely distinguish trachomatous from non-trachomatous trichiasis are still needed.

AB  - Millions of burn injuries are reported every year, with severe cases needing skin graft implantation. To date, the highest achievable expansion produced by split-thickness skin grafting has been reported to be just three times, which is insufficient for covering large burn sites with limited donor site skin. In this work, the authors studied the expansion potential of skin grafts with rotating-triangle (RT)-shaped auxetic incision patterns, which are known to exhibit a highly negative Poisson's effect. Ten two-layer skin graft models with RT angles varying from 0 to 135 degrees were developed and tested under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loads. Poisson's effect, meshing ratios (MRs) and induced stresses were quantified across all models and loads up to the ultimate tensile stress. Very high expansions (MR > 45), varying widely across uniaxial and biaxial loads and without rupture, were observed for low RT angles. However, for RT angles greater than 45 degrees, the expansions significantly decreased, with the lowest MR reported at 135 degrees. Beyond an RT angle of 90 degrees, the induced stresses were very high, with potential for skin rupture. Such expansion potentials and stress estimations with skin grafts have not been reported previously and would be indispensable for initiating groundbreaking advances in burn surgery research.

AB  - History An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents.
   Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 mu IU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 mu IU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 mu g/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 mu g/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries. The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand and pelvis were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of the neck was also performed. Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.

AB  - Trauma hemorrhagic shock (THS) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. It is the leading cause of death with or without sepsis in approximately 50% of patients. In THS, there is an incidence of cellular apoptosis, which contributes majorly to cellular dysfunction, organ failure, and mortality. The Akt (protein kinase B) isoform, Akt1, and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Akt1-GSK3 beta) signaling pathway controls cell survival and apoptosis. Deleterious consequences of alteration of this signaling system might lead to inflammation, cytokine storm, and other diseases. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the role of this signaling system by measuring the phosphorylation levels of Akt1-GSK3 beta. Here, we demonstrated that the downregulation of pAkt1 and upregulation of pGSK3 beta in THS were significantly associated with the severity of the shock, apoptosis of immune cells, altered glucose metabolism, inflammation, cytokine storm, hemostasis, and acidosis, causing mortality with or without sepsis. For the first time, this study shows that a dysregulated pAkt1-GSK3 beta pathway causes contrasting cell fates in THS, leading to trauma pathology. Hence, the delineation and the implications of this signaling system may provide a new important target for the treatment of THS. In addition, Akt activation may become a potential strategy for increasing the survival rate following THS.

AB  - The nasal breathing parameters have shown promising applications in hyperventilation, Kussmaul breathing, sleep apnea, shortness of breath in COVID-19, bradypnea, sinus arrhythmia, and breathing pranayama. However, a wearable setup, which is affordable, esthetic, and accurate in real time during various physical activities, is not available currently. This article developed a novel, low-cost and wearable instrumented nasal temperature sensing (NTS) device for measuring various breathing parameters. The proposed device was tested during controlled breathing exercises in a seated position at three ambient temperature settings (18 ?, 28 ?, and 38 & DEG;C). The device was further tested for standing and walking at various speeds, including slow (1.5 km/h), medium (3.5 km/h), and fast (5.5 km/h). The NTS device is compared against a commercially available respiration belt (RB) (gold standard). The mean absolute error (MAE) (averaged across subjects and ambient temperature settings) was 0.09 +/- 0.05 breaths per minute (bpm), 0.17 +/- 0.10 bpm, and 0.13 +/- 0.13 bpm for controlled breathing at 6, 12, and 18 bpm, respectively. The root mean square between the NTS device and RB across the subjects at the normal standing position was 1.13 +/- 0.39 bpm. The results suggest that the proposed NTS device is accurate for real-time applications with the potential advantage of being robust enough to motion artifacts.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a severe disease with elevated morbidity and mortality rate worldwide. This is attributed to great losses of cardiomyocytes, which can trigger the alteration of gene expression patterns. Although several attempts have been made to assess the AMI biomarkers, to date their role in rescuing myocardial injury remains unclear. Therefore, the current study investigated three independent microarray-based gene expression datasets from AMI patients (n = 85) and their age-sex-matched healthy controls (n = 70), to identify novel gene signatures that might be involved in cardioprotection. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using 'GEO2R', and weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify biomarkers/modules. We found 91 DEGs, of which the number of upregulated and downregulated genes were 22 and 5, respectively. Specifically, we found that the deregulated genes such as ADOR-A3, BMP6, VPS8, and GPx3, may be associated with AMI. WGCNA revealed four highly preserved modules among all datasets. The 'Enrichr' unveiled the presence of miR-660 and STAT1, which is known to affect AMI severity. Conclusively, these genes and miRNA might play a crucial role the rescue of cardiomyocytes from severe damage, which could be helpful in developing appropriate therapeutic strategies for the management of AMI.

TI  - Comparison of prevention of parent-to-child HIV transmission programme & national biennial HIV sentinel surveillance data for tracking HIV epidemic in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
AB  - Background & objectives: HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) among antenatal women in India has been used to track the epidemic for many years. However, reliable tracking at the local level is not possible as ANC sentinel sites are limited in number and cover a smaller sample size at each site. Prevention of parent-to-child-transmission (PPTCT) programme data has a potential advantage due to better geographical coverage, which could provide more precise HIV case estimates; therefore, we compared HSS ANC data with PPTCT programme data for HIV tracking.
   Methods: Out of the 499 surveillance sites, where HSS and PPTCT programme was being conducted in 2015, 210 sites (140 urban and 70 rural) were selected using a stratified random sampling method. HSS (n=72,981) and PPTCT (n=112,832) data records were linked confidentially. The sociodemographic characteristics of HSS and PPTCT attendees were compared. HIV prevalence from HSS ANC was compared with the PPTCT programme data using Chi-square test. State- and site-level correlation of HIV prevalence was also done. Concordance between HSS and PPTCT HIV positivity was estimated using kappa statistics.
   Results: The age distribution of HSS and PPTCT attendees was similar (range: 23 to 27 yr); however, HSS ANC participants were better educated, whereas PPTCT recorded a higher proportion of homemakers. The correlation of HIV prevalence between HSS and PPTCT was high (r=0.9) at the State level and moderate at the site level (r=0.7). The HIV positivity agreement between HSS ANC and PPTCT was good (kappa=0.633). A similar prevalence was reported across 26 States, whereas PPTCT had a significantly lower prevalence than HSS in three States where PPTCT coverage was low. Overall HIV prevalence was 0.31 per cent in HSS and 0.22 per cent in PPTCT (P<0.001).
   Interpretation & conclusions: High-quality PPTCT programme data can provide reliable HIV trends in India. An operational framework for PPTCT-based surveillance should be pilot-tested in a phased manner before replacing HSS with PPTCT.

AB  - Background Influenza increases the risk of cardiovascular events and deaths. We aimed to see whether influenza vaccination reduces death and vascular events in patients with heart failure.
   Methods We did a pragmatic, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 30 centres (mostly hospitals affliated with universities or a research institute) in ten countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa (7 in India, 4 in Philippines, 4 in Nigeria, 6 in China, 1 in Zambia, 2 in Mozambique, 3 in Saudi Arabia, 1 in Kenya, 1 in Uganda, and 1 in Zambia). Participants (aged >= 18 years; 52.1% female; not disaggregated by race or ethnicity) with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV) were randomly assigned (1:1) by a centralised web-based system with block randomisation stratified by site, to receive 0.5 ml intramuscularly once a year for up to 3 years of either inactivated standard dose influenza vaccine or placebo (saline). We excluded people who had received influenza vaccine in 2 of the previous 3 years, and those likely to require valve repair or replacement. Those who administered assigned treatments were not masked and had no further role in the study. Investigators, study coordinators, outcome adjudicators, and participants were masked to group assignment. The first of two co- primary outcomes was a first-event composite for cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke, and the second was a recurrent-events composite for cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalisation for heart failure. Outcomes were assessed every 6 months in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, all-cause hospitalisation, hospitalisation for heart failure, and pneumonia, both overall and during periods of peak influenza exposure. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02762851.
   Findings Between June 2, 2015, and Nov 21, 2021, we enrolled 5129 participants and randomly assigned (1:1) 2560 (50.0%) to influenza vaccine and 2569 (50 .0%) to placebo. The first co-primary outcome occurred in 380 (14.8%) of 2560 participants in the vaccine group and 410 (16.0%) of 2569 participants in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93 [95% CI 0.81-1.07]; p= 0.30). The second co-primary outcome occurred in 754 (29. 5%) of 2560 participants in the vaccine group and 819 (31.9%) of 2569 participants in the placebo group; HR 0.92 [95% CI 0.84-1.02]; p=0.12). The secondary outcomes of all-cause hospitalisations (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.74-0.97]; p=0.013) and pneumonia (HR 0.58 [0.42-0.80]; p=0.0006) were significantly reduced in the vaccine group compared with in the placebo group but there was no significant difference between groups for all-cause death, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and hospitalisation for heart failure. In a prespecified analysis, in which events were limited to periods of peak influenza circulation, the first co- primary outcome, and the secondary outcomes of all-cause death, cardiovasular death, and pneumonia were significantly lower in the vaccinated group than in the placebo group, whereas the second co- primary outcome and the secondary outcomes of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, all-cause hospitalisation, and hospitalisation for heart failure were not significantly lower.
   Interpretation Although the prespecified co-primary outcomes during the entire period of observation were not statistically significant, the reduction during the peak influenza circulating period suggests that there is likely to be a clinical benefit of giving influenza vaccine, given the clear reduction in pneumonia, a moderate reduction in hospitalisations, and a reduction in cardiovascular events and deaths during periods of peak circulation of influenza. Taken in conjunction with previous trials and the observational studies, the collective data suggest benefit. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Electrical discharge machining(EDM) has proven effective in the processing of tough and complicated structural materials that are often challenging to manufacture or alter using traditional machining techniques. EDM represents a promising technique for the surface engineering of biomedical devices. In this article, electrical discharge machining is discussed for its high precision in surface modification as well as surface properties. According to previous studies on this non-traditional machining technique, optimizing critical EDM process variables such as pulse duration, voltage, current, polarity, dielectric fluid, and electrodes can yield adequate surface integrity and bioactive coating on alloys. As a result, the EDM process could be prospectively employed to examine issues including bioimplant manufacture and precision modeling.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the corneal tissue of asymptomatic deceased novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study performed at a tertiary eye hospital. All corneas of the deceased asymptomatic donors who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab at the time of corneal tissue harvesting were included in the study. Histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed. mRNA in situ hybridization for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in all specimens that showed positive immunostaining. The main outcome measure was the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the corneal tissues. Results: Twenty-two corneal tissues of 11 donors were analyzed. The mean age was 72.2 +/- 14.2 years. On histological examination, no signs of inflammation or any other abnormalities were detected in the cornea and adjacent bulbar conjunctiva. Immunohistochemistry revealed faint to moderate cytoplasmic staining in the basal layer of the corneal epithelium in 8 specimens from 5 patients. None of the specimens with positive immunostaining showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA. Conclusions: In line with previous studies, our study also reflects the absence of SARS-CoV-2 viral mRNA in corneal tissues of clinically asymptomatic deceased COVID-19 donors, thereby indicating a probable low risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the transplantation of corneas from donors who tested positive for, but were asymptomatic for COVID-19. In addition, further studies on the subject should include histopathological examination because of the false positive and negative rates of molecular tests.

AB  - Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy affects the Descemet membrane and endothelium, resulting in corneal decompensation. Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) has been the gold-standard surgical management until recently; however, at present, endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK/DSAEK/n-DSEK: Descemet-stripping or non-Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty and DMEK/n-DMEK: Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty) is being preferred due to lesser intraoperative and postoperative complications, early visual recovery, and comparable visual outcomes. Endothelial keratoplasty (EK) can be challenging, especially in pediatric eyes with CHED due to smaller eyeballs, shallow anterior chambers, phakic status, and poor intraoperative visibility due to thick and hazy corneas. A total of 198 articles matched our search strategy. After screening for duplication and going through the titles and abstracts, 12 relevant original articles, one case series, and six case reports were included in this review. Various surgical modifications have to be adopted in comparison to adult eyes to overcome the aforementioned difficulties. Regardless, studies have shown favorable visual outcomes with better graft survival and fewer complications in eyes that underwent EK compared to PKP. Hence, timely surgical intervention and strict amblyopia management can result in better final visual outcomes. The purpose of this review is to summarize various intraoperative difficulties and the surgical modifications required, different surgical techniques, visual and graft-related outcomes, and various complications of EK in CHED eyes.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aimed to review the research on the quality of life after hysterectomy (surgical removal of the womb) to prevent endometrial (womb) cancer. We conducted a systematic review on this topic, and found only four papers. After this operation, women had reduced worry about cancer, and were generally satisfied. There was a severe impact from the removal of both ovaries, which resulted in menopause-symptoms, particularly for women not taking hormone-replacement. We also looked at papers reporting quality of life after hysterectomy to treat heavy or abnormal periods. We found 25 papers, and generally these reported that women were satisfied after this operation, with improved quality of life, and were very unlikely to have worse sexual function or urinary problems. This review demonstrates that there is very little evidence on quality of life after this surgery to prevent endometrial cancer, and highlights how more research is needed. Background: Risk-reducing hysterectomy (RRH) is the gold-standard prevention for endometrial cancer (EC). Knowledge of the impact on quality-of-life (QoL) is crucial for decision-making. This systematic review aims to summarise the evidence. Methods: We searched major databases until July 2022 (CRD42022347631). Given the paucity of data on RRH, we also included hysterectomy as treatment for benign disease. We used validated quality-assessment tools, and performed qualitative synthesis of QoL outcomes. Results: Four studies (64 patients) reported on RRH, 25 studies (1268 patients) on hysterectomy as treatment for uterine bleeding. There was moderate risk-of-bias in many studies. Following RRH, three qualitative studies found substantially lowered cancer-worry, with no decision-regret. Oophorectomy (for ovarian cancer prevention) severely impaired menopause-specific QoL and sexual-function, particularly without hormone-replacement. Quantitative studies supported these results, finding low distress and generally high satisfaction. Hysterectomy as treatment of bleeding improved QoL, resulted in high satisfaction, and no change or improvements in sexual and urinary function, although small numbers reported worsening. Conclusions: There is very limited evidence on QoL after RRH. Whilst there are benefits, most adverse consequences arise from oophorectomy. Benign hysterectomy allows for some limited comparison; however, more research is needed for outcomes in the population of women at increased EC-risk.

AB  - Background: Robot-assisted surgery demands a specific skillset of surgical knowledge, skills, and attitudes from the robotic surgeon to function as part of the robotic team and for maximal utility of the assistive surgical robot. Subsequently, the learning process of robot-assisted surgery entails new modes of learning. We sought to systematically summarize the published data on pediatric robot-assisted pyeloplasty (pRALP) to decipher the learning process by analyzing learning curves. Methods: This review followed the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched for 'learning curve' AND 'pediatric pyeloplasty'. All studies presenting outcomes of learning curves (LC) in the context of pRALP in patients < 18 years of age were included. Studies comparing LC in pRALP versus open and/or laparoscopic pyeloplasty were also included; however, those solely focusing on LC in non-robotic approaches were excluded. The methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle and Ottawa scale. Results: Competency was non-uniformly defined in all fifteen studies addressing learning curves in pRALP. pRALP was considered safe at all stages. Proficiency in pRALP was reached after 18 cases, while competency was estimated to demand 31 operated cases with operative duration as outcome variable. Conclusions: Pediatric RALP is safe during the learning process and 'learning by doing' improves efficiency. Competencies with broader implications than time must be defined for future studies.

AB  - The emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 necessitates unremitting efforts to discover novel therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Here, we report an extremely potent mAb named P4A2 that can neutralize all the circulating variants of concern (VOCs) with high efficiency, including the highly transmissible Omicron. The crystal structure of the P4A2 Fab:RBD complex revealed that the residues of the RBD that interact with P4A2 are a part of the ACE2-receptor-binding motif and are not mutated in any of the VOCs. The pan coronavirus pseudotyped neutralization assay confirmed that the P4A2 mAb is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs. Passive administration of P4A2 to K18-hACE2 transgenic mice conferred protection, both prophylactically and therapeutically, against challenge with VOCs. Overall, our data shows that, the P4A2 mAb has immense therapeutic potential to neutralize the current circulating VOCs. Due to the overlap between the P4A2 epitope and ACE2 binding site on spike-RBD, P4A2 may also be highly effective against a number of future variants.

   Author summary
   Existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antibody therapies may be rendered ineffective by newly developing SARS-CoV-2 mutations which are exceedingly alarming. This means that existing vaccines and antibody-based countermeasures must be thoroughly assessed against the mutational variants that already exist in order to determine their protective efficiency. In this study, we isolated a highly potent and broadly neutralizing murine monoclonal antibody having broad neutralizing efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern (VOCs). Structural characterization of P4A2 Fab in complex with the receptor-binding domain defined a substantially overlapped surface required for human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) interaction. The SARS-CoV-2 VOCs challenge paradigm in K18-hACE2-transgenic mice against SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, revealed the broad and potent effects of the leading clone, P4A2, both prophylactically and therapeutically in vivo. Additionally, humanized P4A2 mAb may be used alone or in conjunction with other non-competing antibodies as an effective cocktail method for SARS-CoV-2 prophylactics or therapeutics, or additives to current cocktails to safeguard against emerging variants. Our findings provide insights into the design of biopharmaceuticals against current and future emerging variants.

AB  - Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a highly aggressive hematologic neoplasm and classified under acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of three cases of BPDCN: two with classical and one uncommon immunophenotype. A-35-year-old female (case 1) presented with complaint of nasal mass and generalized lymphadenopathy. Biopsy from axillary lymph node showed infiltration by cells with scant cytoplasm which were immunopositive for LCA, CD4, CD43, and ALK1. Flowcytometry showed positivity for CD45, CD4, CD33, and CD123 while negative for rest all markers. The other two cases have classical immunophenotype. In clinical practice, nasal mass with lymphadenopathy suggests natural killer T-cell/peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Again immunohistochemical positivity for CD4, CD43, and ALK while negativity for CD3 suggests anaplastic large cell lymphoma. In this case, morphology and extensive bone marrow involvement raise the suspicion. Fowcytometry positivity for HLADR, CD123, and CD33 helps in making diagnosis.

AB  - Digital hemoglobinometers have been used as point-of-care tests (POCT) to estimate the burden of anemia in community-based studies and national-level surveys in India. As the accuracy of hemoglobin estimated in POCT varies, there is a need for adjustments to the POCT-hemoglobin to ensure they are closer to reality and are comparable. We used data (collected between 2016 and 2020) (N = 1145) from four studies from India: three among pregnant women and 6-59-month-old children from Haryana and the fourth from a national nutritional survey among 1-19-year-old children. We compared the same individuals' POCT-hemoglobin (capillary blood) and automated hematology analyzers (AHA) hemoglobin (venous blood) and developed a predictive linear regression model to obtain the correction equation for POCT-hemoglobin. We analyzed paired data from 1145 participants. The correction equation for obtaining the true hemoglobin value = 3.35 + 0.71 x POCT-hemoglobin using capillary blood (adjusted R2-64.4% and mean squared error -0.841 g/dL). In comparison with the AHA-hemoglobin, the mean difference of POCT-hemoglobin was 0.2 g/dL, while with the predicted Hb obtained from the correction equation it was 0.01 g/dL. The correction equation was the first attempt at deriving the true hemoglobin values from the POCTs. There is a need for multi-country collaborative studies to improve the correction equation by adjusting for factors affecting hemoglobin estimation.

AB  - Background: At what rate does the RNA of SARS CoV-2 shed from cadavers? Although, there have been numerous studies which have demonstrated the persistence of the virus on dead bodies, there is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the variation of viral RNA content in cadavers. This has led to a knowledge gap regarding the safe handling/management of COVID-19 decedents, posing a barrier in forensic investigations.
   Methods: In this study, we report the presence of RNA of SARS CoV-2 by real time RT-PCR, in nasopharyngeal swabs collected after death from two groups of bodies - one who died due to COVID-19 and the other who died due to other diagnoses. A prospective study on 199 corpses, who had tested positive for COVID-19 ante-mortem, was conducted at a tertiary care center. RNA testing was conducted at different time intervals (T1-T5).
   Results: 112(56.3%) died primarily due to COVID-19 and 87(43.7%) died due to other diagnoses. 144(72.4%) were male and 55(27.6%) were female. A total of 115 (57.8%) tested positive for COVID-19 after death at different time points. The mean age was 50.7 +/- 18.9 years and the length of hospitalization ranged from 1 to 50 days with a mean of 9.2 +/- 7.6 days. Realtime RT-PCR positivity of SARS CoV-2 RNA decreases with time.
   Conclusion: We observed that real time RT-PCR positivity, indicating viral RNA detection, decreases with time. Therefore, it is advisable to follow appropriate COVID-19 precautions to carry out scientific studies, medicolegal investigations and mortuary services on suspected/confirmed COVID-19 corpses.

AB  - Renewing interest in the study of intermediate metabolism and cellular bioenergetics is brought on by the global increase in the prevalence of metabolic illnesses. Understanding of the mechanisms that integrate energy metabolism in the entire organism has significantly improved with the application of contemporary biochemical tools for quantifying the fuel substrate metabolism with cutting-edge mouse genetic procedures. Several unexpected findings in genetically altered mice have prompted research into the direction of intermediate metabolism of skeletal cells. These findings point to the possibility of novel endocrine connections through which bone cells can convey their energy status to other metabolic control centers. Understanding the expanded function of skeleton system has in turn inspired new lines of research aimed at characterizing the energy needs and bioenergetic characteristics of these bone cells. Bone-forming osteoblast and bone-resorbing osteoclast cells require a constant and large supply of energy substrates such as glucose, fatty acids, glutamine, etc., for their differentiation and functional activity. According to latest research, important developmental signaling pathways in bone cells are connected to bioenergetic programs, which may accommodate variations in energy requirements during their life cycle. The present review article provides a unique perspective of the past and present research in the metabolic characteristics of bone cells along with mechanisms governing energy substrate utilization and bioenergetics. In addition, we discussed the therapeutic inventions which are currently being utilized for the treatment and management of bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteogenesis imperfecta (OIM), etc., by modulating the energetics of bone cells. We further emphasized on the role of GUT-associated metabolites (GAMs) such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), indole derivates, bile acids, etc., in regulating the energetics of bone cells and their plausible role in maintaining bone health. Emphasis is importantly placed on highlighting knowledge gaps in this novel field of skeletal biology, i.e., "Osteometabolism" (proposed by our group) that need to be further explored to characterize the physiological importance of skeletal cell bioenergetics in the context of human health and bone related metabolic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors aimed to assess the frequency of homozygous CDKN2A deletion in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant diffuse astrocytomas (grade 2/3) and to narrow down the clinicopathological indications in which the CDKN2A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay is cost-effective in resource-constrained settings.METHODS IDH-mutant astrocytomas were analyzed for ATRX, p53, MIB1-LI, and p16 expression using immunohis-tochemistry. The FISH assay was used to evaluate CDKN2A deletion and 1p/19q codeletion. Survival outcomes were assessed according to the different molecular markers.RESULTS A total of 150 adult patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 (n = 95) and grade 3 (n = 55) astrocytomas (145 pri-mary and 5 recurrent) were analyzed. Using a cutoff value of 30% for defining significant homozygous CDKN2A deletion, none of the grade 2 and 10.9% (6/55) of grade 3 astrocytomas showed this deletion (4 primary and 2 recurrent grade 3 tumors) and were reclassified as grade 4. This mutation was more frequent in recurrent (40%, 2/5) than primary (2.76%, 4/145) gliomas. Half (3/6, 50%) of the CDKN2A-deleted cases demonstrated poor outcomes; 2 of these cases experi-enced recurrence at 12 and 36 months after surgery, and 1 died at 5 months. The majority of CDKN2A-deleted cases showed marked cellularity (100%), pleomorphism (100%), brisk mitosis (83.3%), and tumor giant cell formation (83.4%). None of the cases with retained p16 expression harbored this deletion. Both overall survival (p = 0.039) and progression -free survival (p = 0.0045) were found to be worse in cases with p16 loss. Selectively performing CDKN2A FISH only in high-risk cases with histomorphological features of anaplasia, p16 loss, or recurrent tumors achieved a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%. This approach would have resulted in saving 41.1% of the original expenditure ($6900 US per 150 samples) and 27.6 person-minutes per sample without compromising the identification of deleted cases.CONCLUSIONS Homozygous CDKN2A deletion is conspicuously absent in grade 2 and rare in primary grade 3 IDH- mutant astrocytomas. The authors propose that restricting use of the FISH assay to cases showing histomorphological features of anaplasia, p16 loss, or recurrent tumors will help this platform to be utilized in the most cost-effective manner in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - Interleukin-33 (IL-33) acts as an 'alarmin', and its role has been demonstrated in driving immune regulation and inflammation in many human diseases. However, the precise mechanism of action of IL-33 in regulating neutrophil and macrophage functioning is not defined in advanced atherosclerosis (aAT) patients. Further, the role of IL-33 in neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation in aAT and its consequent effect on macrophage function is not known. In the present study, we recruited n = 52 aAT patients and n = 52 control subjects. The neutrophils were isolated from both groups via ficoll/percoll-based density gradient centrifugation. The effect of IL-33 on the NET formation ability of the neutrophils was determined in both groups. Monocytes, isolated via a positive selection method, were used to to differentiate them into macrophages from each of the study subjects and were challenged by IL-33-primed NETs, followed by the measurement of oxidative stress by calorimetric assay and the expression of the proinflammatory molecules by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Transcript and protein expression was determined by qPCR and immunofluorescence/ELISA, respectively. The increased expression of IL-33R (ST-2) was observed in the neutrophils, along with an increased serum concentration of IL-33 in aAT compared to the controls. IL-33 exacerbates NET formation via specifically upregulating CD16 expression in aAT. IL-33-primed NETs/neutrophils increased the cellular oxidative stress levels in the macrophages, leading to enhanced macrophage necroptosis and the release of atherogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in aAT compared to the controls. These findings suggested a pathogenic effect of the IL-33/ST-2 pathway in aAT patients by exacerbating NET formation and macrophage necroptosis, thereby facilitating the release of inflammatory factors and the release of MMPs that may be critical for the destabilization/rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in aAT. Targeting the IL-33/ST-2-NETs axis may be a promising therapeutic target for preventing plaque instability/rupture and its adverse complications in aAT.

AB  - Purpose: To study the antifungal susceptibility of common corneal pathogenic fungi to antifungal agents in the North Indian population. Methods: Prospective study of the antifungal sensitivity testing (natamycin, amphotericin B, voriconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin, micafungin) of fungal isolates from 50 cases of culture positive fungal keratitis by using E test method. Details noted included demographic data, visual acuity, clinical details, grade of keratitis, healing time, and success in medical management. Results: Of 50 patients with fungal keratitis (mean age: 40.28 +/- 16.77 years), 12 eyes healed within 3 weeks, 14 had a delayed healing response, and 24 had chronic keratitis. Among the 15 cases of Fusarium isolates, 93.3% were sensitive to natamycin, while 40% to amphotericin B; 66.6% to voriconazole, 13.4% to itraconazole and fluconazole each. 80% of Fusarium cases (n = 12) showed susceptibility to posaconazole. Among Aspergillus flavus isolates, 53.4% (n = 8) were sensitive to natamycin, with only 40% (n = 7) showing sensitivity to amphotericin B and good susceptibility to azoles. MIC against susceptible Fusarium spp. for natamycin was 3-16 mu g/mL, amphotericin B: 1-8 mu g/mL, voriconazole: 0.5-1.5 mu g/mL, itraconazole: 0.5-12 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 0.094-1.5 mu g/mL. MIC against Aspergillus flavus was natamycin: 8-32 mu g/mL, amphotericin B: 0.5-16 mu g/mL, voriconazole: 0.025-4 mu g/mL, itraconazole: 0.125-8 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 0.047-0.25 mu g/mL; against Aspergillus niger isolates, to natamycin was 6 mu g/mL (n=1), amphotericin B 8-12 mu g/mL (n = 3), voriconazole: 0.125-0.19 mu g/mL (n = 3), itraconazole: 0.38-0.75 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 0.064-0.19 mu g/mL and against Aspergillus fumigatus (n = 1), was natamycin4 mu g/mL, amphotericin B - 8 mu g/mL, voriconazole 0.25 mu g/mL, itraconazole 1 mu g/mL, and posaconazole 0.19 mu g/mL. MIC against susceptible Acremonium spp. for natamycin was 1.5-16 mu g/mL, amphotericin B: 0.5-8 mu g/mL, voriconazole: 0.19-3 mu g/mL, itraconazole: 0.125 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 0.125-0.5 mu g/mL and against susceptible Curvularia was natamycin 0.75-4 mu g/mL, amphotericin B 0.5-1 mu g/mL, voriconazole 0.125-0.19 mu g/mL, itraconazole 0.047-0.094 mu g/mL, posaconazole 0.047-0.094 mu g/mL. MIC against Mucor spp.+ Rhizopus spp. (n = 1) was natamycin: 8 mu g/mL, amphotericin B: 0.75 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 1.5 mu g/mL. MIC against of Alternaria (n = 1) was voriconazole: 0.19 mu g/mL, posaconazole: 0.094 mu g/mL. MIC against Penicillium (n=1) was natamycin: 8 mu g/mL, voriconazole: 0.25 mu g/mL, itraconazole: 0.5 mu g/mL, and Posaconazole: 0.125 mu g/mL. Conclusion: Our observations highlight the variations in susceptibility to antifungal agents. Posaconazole seems to be effective with low MIC against common corneal pathogenic fungal isolates.

AB  - Background & objectives: The overall adult prevalence of HIV in India was estimated to be 0.22 per cent in 2019. The HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM), a high-risk group for HIV, was estimated to be 4.3 per cent, which is 16 times higher than the national average. In Delhi, the estimated prevalence among MSM was 1.8 per cent. Despite free HIV testing services being made available by the National AIDS Control Programme for more than two decades, many MSM were not aware about their HIV status. Therefore, newer testing strategies are needed. Oral HIV self-testing (HIVST) has proved to be one such promising innovation. At present, there are no programme guidelines on HIVST and oral HIVST kit is not available in India. The aim of this study was to understand the perceived advantages and disadvantages of introduction of oral HIVST strategy among MSM.
   Methods: MSM who were registered with the selected non-governmental organizations working as targeted intervention sites in Delhi, India, were recruited for focus group discussions (FGDs) between January and May 2021. For the purpose of this study, MSM were defined as males who had anal/oral sex with male/hijra partner in the past one month. A total of six FGDs were conducted using a prepared FGD guide. The FGD guide included questions on problems faced during conventional HIV testing, participants' awareness, acceptability and perceptions of oral HIVST. The data were manually coded and entered in NVivo release 1.5 and themes were identified.
   Results: A total of 67 respondents participated in the FGDs. A total of 28.4 per cent MSM were beggars at traffic lights, 12 per cent were sex workers and 11.9 per cent were bar/event dancers. Nearly half (50.7%) of the participants had undergone HIV testing less than twice in the preceding one year. None of the MSM were aware about oral HIVST. Perceived advantages of oral HIVST were ease of use, confidentiality and the non-invasive pain-free procedure. Perceived concerns included lack of post-test counselling, linkage to care, poor mental health outcomes and forced testing.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Most MSM had positive perceptions about oral HIVST. Therefore, it is likely that the introduction of oral HIVST may result in higher uptake of HIV testing among MSM.

AB  - Simple Summary Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are cancer cells that are disseminated in the bloodstream and may be responsible for early recurrence and poor rates of survival. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 18 prospective studies comprising 1321 patients that reported CTC in resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Our analysis revealed that the presence of CTC in both the baseline and postoperative period was associated with an increased risk of recurrence and death compared to an absence of CTC in lung cancer patients. The results were independent of sources of CTC (peripheral, pulmonary vein), detection methods, and follow-up duration. CTCs hold a significant prognostic and predictive potential, as evident in our meta-analysis; however, heterogeneity of data, publication bias, and variable cut-off values limit its clinical utility. Background: In breast, prostate, and other epithelial tumors, circulating tumor cells (CTC) in peripheral blood may predict survival. Our study evaluated the prognostic significance of baseline and postoperative CTC in patients with early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through a meta-analytic approach. Methods: Prospective studies comparing survival outcomes between positive (CTC+) and negative CTC (CTC-) patients were systematically searched. Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) with hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) as the effect measure. Pooled HR determined the prognostic role under a fixed-effect or random-effect model depending on heterogeneity. Results: Eighteen studies with 1321 patients were eligible. CTC+ patients were associated with an increased risk of death (HR 3.53, 95% CI 2.51-4.95; p < 0.00001) and relapse (HR 2.97, 95% CI 2.08-4.22; p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis results were consistent in different subsets, including time points (baseline and postoperative) and sources (peripheral and pulmonary vein) of blood collection, detection methods (label-free, label-dependent, and RT-PCR), and follow-up duration. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis revealed that CTC is a promising predictive biomarker for stratifying survival outcomes in patients with early-stage NSCLC. However, future studies are required to validate these findings and standardize detection methods.

AB  - Simple Summary Synthesised cost-effectiveness evidence is necessary for resource allocation for risk-reducing surgery in breast cancer (BC)/ovarian cancer (OC)/endometrial cancer (EC) prevention strategies. We aimed to review evidence on the cost-effectiveness of surgical prevention for BC/OC/EC in high/intermediate/low-risk populations. From 22 included studies, risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM) and/or risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) were cost-effective for BRCA1/2, and RRSO was also cost-effective at a lower lifetime OC risk-threshold of 4-5%. Risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy (RRESDO) was cost-effective compared to RRSO in one-study. Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) was cost-effective in Lynch syndrome women. Opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy (OBS) was cost-effective when conducted with hysterectomy for benign gynaecology surgery or in lieu of tubal sterilisation. This systematic review found that surgical prevention is cost-effective for women who are at high risk of BC, intermediate/high risk of OC and high risk of EC. The results are sensitive to age, disutility and uptake rates regarding RRS along with the effect sizes in terms of OC-risk reduction from salpingectomy. These areas require further research. Question: What is the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing surgery for breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer prevention? Findings: This systematic review found that surgical prevention is cost-effective for women in high-income countries who are at a high risk of breast cancer, intermediate/high risk of ovarian cancer and high risk of endometrial cancer. The results, while robust for most strategies, are sensitive to certain parameters, especially the disutility from surgery and the effect sizes of ovarian cancer risk reduction from salpingectomy. Implications: Risk-reducing surgery is cost-effective for breast/ovarian/endometrial cancer prevention across most settings, but more research is needed on the disutility from all preventive surgery and the precision in terms of the cancer risk reduction from salpingectomy. Policymakers require robust cost-effectiveness evidence of risk-reducing-surgery (RRS) for decision making on resource allocation for breast cancer (BC)/ovarian cancer (OC)/endometrial cancer (EC) prevention. We aimed to summarise published data on the cost-effectiveness of risk-reducing mastectomy (RRM)/risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO)/risk-reducing early salpingectomy and delayed oophorectomy (RRESDO) for BC/OC prevention in intermediate/high-risk populations; hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) in Lynch syndrome women; and opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy (OBS) for OC prevention in baseline-risk populations. Major databases were searched until December 2021 following a prospective protocol (PROSPERO-CRD42022338008). Data were qualitatively synthesised following a PICO framework. Twenty two studies were included, with a reporting quality varying from 53.6% to 82.1% of the items scored in the CHEERS checklist. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio/incremental cost-utility ratio and cost thresholds were inflated and converted to US$2020, using the original currency consumer price index (CPI) and purchasing power parities (PPP), for comparison. Eight studies concluded that RRM and/or RRSO were cost-effective compared to surveillance/no surgery for BRCA1/2, while RRESDO was cost-effective compared to RRSO in one study.
   Three studies found that hysterectomy with BSO was cost-effective compared to surveillance in Lynch syndrome women.
   Two studies showed that RRSO was also cost-effective at >= 4%/>= 5% lifetime OC risk for pre-/post-menopausal women, respectively. Seven studies demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of OBS at hysterectomy (n = 4), laparoscopic sterilisation (n = 4) or caesarean section (n = 2). This systematic review confirms that RRS is cost-effective, while the results are context-specific, given the diversity in the target populations, health systems and model assumptions, and sensitive to the disutility, age and uptake rates associated with RRS. Additionally, RRESDO/OBS were sensitive to the uncertainty concerning the effect sizes in terms of the OC-risk reduction and long-term health impact. Our findings are relevant for policymakers/service providers and the design of future research studies.

AB  - Infections remain a leading cause of death in neonates. The sparse antibiotic development pipeline and challenges in conducting neonatal research have resulted in few effective antibiotics being adequately studied to treat multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections in neonates, despite the increasing global mortality burden caused by antimicrobial resistance. Of 40 antibiotics approved for use in adults since 2000, only four have included dosing information for neonates in their labelling. Currently, 43 adult antibiotic clinical trials are recruiting patients, compared with only six trials recruiting neonates. We review the World Health Organization (WHO) priority pathogens list relevant to neonatal sepsis and propose a WHO multiexpert stakeholder meeting to promote the development of a neonatal priority antibiotic development list. The goal is to develop international, interdisciplinary consensus for an accelerated neonatal antibiotic development programme. This programme would enable focused research on identified priority antibiotics for neonates to reduce the excess morbidity and mortality caused by MDR infections in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Background The complications of a blind procedure for gastric tube placement are well documented. POCUS has been widely used to confirm the position of blindly inserted gastric tubes, and it does not prevent complications caused by the blind method. We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare gastric tube insertion with real-time oesophagus visualization using POCUS to the standard technique. Objective The primary goal of this study was to compare the accuracy of real-time POCUS-guided nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion and confirmation to that of the standard technique. Methods It was a prospective, parallel-group, open-label randomized controlled trial with a superiority design. All patients requiring NGT were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 120 patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: POCUS (n = 60) or control (n = 60). Following the procedures, confirmatory chest radiographs were obtained in both groups. Results As per protocol, 118 patients were analyzed. In POCUS group, the oesophagus was visualized on POCUS in 56 of 58 patients (96.5%). In 55 of 58 cases (94.8%), an NGT was inserted in real time. Despite visualizing the oesophagus, we fail to insert the tube in one (1.8%). The oesophagus could not be seen on the scan in two cases (3.4%). Chest radiographs confirmed the tube in the stomach in 55 (98.2%). The chest radiograph revealed the tip of the NGT in the stomach in 52 of 60 (86.6%) patients. In seven cases (11.7%), we were unable to insert NGT. On a chest radiograph, one (1.6%) tip of the tube was seen in the right lung and was safely removed. The ultrasound-guided gastric tube insertion had a sensitivity of 96.5% (95% CI, 88-99.6%) and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.2% (95% CI, 98.1-98.3%). The conventional technique had 88% (95% CI, 77-95%) sensitivity and a PPV of 98% (95% CI, 97.9-98.2%). Conclusion POCUS enables real-time insertion of a gastric tube with high sensitivity, in a short time with high first-attempt success rate and limited passage-related complications. POCUS should be utilized for NGT insertion whenever expertise is available on the bedside.

AB  - The onset and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have created an unprecedented universal crisis. Although vaccines have been developed against the parental SARS-CoV-2, outbreaks of the disease still occur through the appearance of different variants, suggesting a continuous need for improved and effective therapeutic strategies. Therefore, we developed a novel nanovesicle presenting Spike protein on the surface of the dendritic cell-derived extracellular vesicles (DEVs) for use as a potential vaccine platform against SARS-CoV-2. DEVs express peptide/MHC-I (pMHC-I) complexes, CCR-7, on their surface. The immunogenicity and efficacy of the Spike-activated DEVs were tested in mice and compared with free Spike protein. A 1/10 Spike equivalent dose of DEVs showed a superior potency in inducing anti-Spike IgG titers in blood of mice when compared to dendritic cells or free Spike protein treatment. Moreover, DEV-induced sera effectively reduced viral infection by 55-60% within 15 days of booster dose administration. Furthermore, a 1/10 Spike equivalent dose of DEV-treated mice was found to be equally effective in inducing CD19+CD38+ T-cells in the spleen and lymph node; CD8 cells in the bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node; and CD4+CD25+ T-cells in the spleen and lymph node after 90 days of treatment. Thus, our results support the immunogenic nature of DEVs, demonstrating that a low dose of DEVs induces antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, therefore warranting further investigations.

AB  - Background There is uncertainty in the treatment options for resectable hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.
   Methods A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was performed. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings databases and trial registries were searched until November 2020 for randomized controlled trials performed on resectable hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Two systematic review authors independently identified studies and extracted data. The primary outcomes evaluated were overall survival, disease-free survival, any recurrence, local recurrence, loco-regional recurrence, distal recurrence and laryngectomy-free survival. The secondary outcomes were response rates following neoadjuvant treatment and comparison of treatment-related toxicity. Assessment of risk of bias was performed for the selected studies using Cochrane's tool for assessing risk of bias. The studies were evaluated for the quality of evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations). Risk ratios (RR), rate ratios, and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated along with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model.
   Results Five RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this review. The risk of bias was unclear or high for the trials. Non-organ preservation(n = 140) versus organ preservation (n = 144) (two trials): no statistically significant difference could be identified for any of the primary outcomes. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 37) versus sequential chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 34) (one trial): no statistically significant difference was noted between the two treatment arms for overall survival, disease-free survival and loco-regional recurrence. Laryngectomy-free survival was found to be superior in concurrent chemoradiotherapy arm (HR:0.28, 95% CI 0.13, 0.57). Induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (n = 53) versus induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy (n = 60) (one trial): no statistically significant difference was noted between the treatment arms for overall survival, disease-free survival and laryngectomy-free survival. Preoperative radiotherapy (n = 24) versus postoperative radiotherapy (n = 23) (one trial): overall survival was found to be better in the postoperative radiotherapy arm (HR:2.44, 95% CI1.18, 5.03). No statistically significant difference was noted in terms of treatment-related toxicity.
   Conclusions There are considerable uncertainties in the management of resectable hypopharyngeal cancer.

AB  - Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the fractal dimension (FD) and radiomorphometric indices (RMIs) in the mandible from orthopantomographic radiographs in patients with oral lesions associated with smokeless/smoking tobacco (SLT/ST) and areca nut habits in a North Indian cohort.
   Study Design. A prospective, cross-sectional, observational pilot study was conducted of 120 subjects, including controls and 3 study groups of 30 patients each with oral submucous fibrosis, tobacco pouch keratosis, and oral leukoplakia (OL). Two observers calculated FD and the RMIs of mandibular cortical thickness (MCT), panoramic mandibular index (PMI), and mandibular cortical index (MCI).
   Results. Mean FD was significantly reduced compared to controls with all oral lesions (P <.05) and with all habits in 3 of 4 regions of interest (P <.05). MCT was significantly reduced with OL (P <.005) and in ST users (P <.05). PMI did not differ regarding lesion status or habits. Compared to the controls, MCI C2 type was significantly more common in all oral lesions (P <=.005) and all types of habit (P <.005). Inter- and intraobserver agreement was strong to excellent.
   Conclusions. FD and RMI values were significantly altered compared to controls in oral lesions associated with tobacco and areca nut habits and in the dominant type of habit.

AB  - Introduction:Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a common chronic condition with significant health and socioeconomic consequences. In Nepal, T2DM is a common disease for which people consult ayurvedic (traditional medical system) practitioners and use ayurvedic medicines. Strong concerns remain about the suboptimal T2DM management of many patients by ayurvedic practitioners, and therefore, based on the best available scientific evidence, we have developed a clinical guideline for managing T2DM by ayurvedic practitioners. The research question to be addressed by a definitive cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is whether the introduction of a clinical guideline can improve the management of T2DM by ayurvedic practitioners in Nepal as compared to usual ayurvedic management (i.e., without any clinical guideline). In preparation for this future work, this current study aims to determine the feasibility of undertaking the definitive cluster RCT. Methods:This is a 2-arm, feasibility cluster RCT with a blinded outcome assessment and a qualitative evaluation. The study is conducted in 12 public and private ayurveda centers in and outside the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal (1:1 intervention:control). Eligible participants should be new T2DM adult patients (i.e., treatment naive) - the glycated hemoglobin level should be 6.5% or above but less than 9%. At least 120 participants (60/group) will be recruited and followed up for 6 months. Important parameters, needed to design the definitive trial, will be estimated, such as the standard deviation of the outcome measure (i.e., glycated hemoglobin level at 6-month follow-up), intraclass correlation coefficient, cluster size, recruitment, the time needed to recruit participants, follow-up, and adherence to the recommended ayurvedic medicine. Semi-structured qualitative interviews will be conducted with around 20 to 30 participants and all the participating ayurvedic practitioners to explore their experiences and perspectives of taking part in the study and of the intervention and a sample of eligible people declining to participate in the study to explore the reasons behind nonparticipation. Discussion:We are now conducting a feasibility cluster RCT in Nepal to determine the feasibility of undertaking the definitive cluster trial. The first participant was recruited on 17 July 2022. If the feasibility is promising (such as recruitment, follow-up, and adherence to the recommended ayurvedic medicine), then the parameters estimated will be used to design the definitive cluster trial. Decisions over whether to modify the protocol will mainly be informed by the qualitative data.

AB  - BackgroundProstate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1) was developed to standardize the interpretation of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) for prostate cancer (PCa) detection. However, a significant inter-reader variability among radiologists has been found in the PI-RADS assessment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of an in-house developed semi-automated model for PI-RADS v2.1 scoring using machine learning methods. MethodsThe study cohort included an MRI dataset of 59 patients (PI-RADS v2.1 score 2 = 18, score 3 = 10, score 4 = 16, and score 5 = 15). The proposed semi-automated model involved prostate gland and zonal segmentation, 3D co-registration, lesion region of interest marking, and lesion measurement. PI-RADS v2.1 scores were assessed based on lesion measurements and compared with the radiologist PI-RADS assessment. Machine learning methods were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the proposed model by classification of PI-RADS v2.1 scores. ResultsThe semi-automated PI-RADS assessment based on the proposed model correctly classified 50 out of 59 patients and showed a significant correlation (r = 0.94, p < 0.05) with the radiologist assessment. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 88.00% +/- 0.98% and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 for score 2 vs. score 3 vs. score 4 vs. score 5 classification and accuracy of 93.20 +/- 2.10% and AUC of 0.99 for low score vs. high score classification using fivefold cross-validation. ConclusionThe proposed semi-automated PI-RADS v2.1 assessment system could minimize the inter-reader variability among radiologists and improve the objectivity of scoring.

AB  - The approach utilized a systematic review of the medical literature executed with specifically designed criteria that focused on the etiologies and pathogenesis of hypoparathyroidism. Enhanced attention by endocrine surgeons to new knowledge about parathyroid gland viability are reviewed along with the role of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring during and after neck surgery. Nonsurgical etiologies account for a significant proportion of cases of hypoparathyroidism (similar to 25%), and among them, genetic etiologies are key. Given the pervasive nature of PTH deficiency across multiple organ systems, a detailed review of the skeletal, renal, neuromuscular, and ocular complications is provided. The burden of illness on affected patients and their caregivers contributes to reduced quality of life and social costs for this chronic endocrinopathy. (c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected certain groups, such as older people (ie, >65 years), minority ethnic populations, and people with specific chronic conditions including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and some respiratory diseases. There is now evidence of not only direct but also indirect adverse effects of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Recurrent lockdowns and public health measures throughout the pandemic have restricted access to routine diabetes care, limiting new diagnoses, and affecting self-management, routine follow-ups, and access to medications, as well as affecting lifestyle behaviours and emotional wellbeing globally. Pre-pandemic studies have shown that short-term delays in delivery of routine care, even by 12 months, are associated with adverse effects on risk factor control and worse microvascular, macrovascular, and mortality outcomes in people with diabetes. Disruptions within the short-to-medium term due to natural disasters also result in worse diabetes outcomes. However, the true magnitude of the indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term outcomes and mortality in people with diabetes is still unclear. Disasters tend to exacerbate existing health disparities; as we recover ambulatory diabetes services in the aftermath of the pandemic, there is an opportunity to prioritise those with the greatest need, and to target resources and interventions aimed at improving outcomes and reducing inequality.

AB  - Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in the majority of patients with underlying chronic liver disease (CLD) of viral and non-viral etiologies, which requires screening for early HCC diagnosis. Liquid biopsy holds great promise now for early detection, prognosis, and assessment of response to cancer therapy. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a liquid biopsy marker can be easily detected by a real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assay for a change in its concentration, integrity, and fragmentation in cancer. Methods: Patients with HCC (n = 100), CLD (n = 100), and healthy (n = 30) controls were included in the study. The cfDNA was isolated from serum and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was carried out using primer pairs for large (> 205 bp) and small (110 bp) fragments of repetitive elements (ALU and LINE1) and housekeeping genes (beta-Actin and GAPDH). Total cfDNA concentrations and integrity index were determined by the absolute quantitation method (L/S ratio or cfDII-integrity). The cfDII as a measure of fragmentation was determined by comparative Ct ((2-delta delta Ct)) method of relative quantification (cfDII-fragmentation). Using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, cfDII-integrity and cfDII-fragmentation were used to differentiate HCC from CLD patients or healthy controls. Results: The total cfDNA concentrations in the sera of HCC (244 ng/ml) patients were significantly higher than those of CLD (33 ng/ml) patients and healthy (16.88 ng/ml) controls. HCC patients have shown poor DNA integrity or excess cfDNA fragmentation than CLD patients and healthy controls. The cfDII-integrity of GAPDH and ALU fragment significantly differentiate HCC from CLD at AUROC 0.72 and 0.67, respectively. The cfDII-fragmentation following normalization with cfDNA of healthy control has shown significant differential capabilities of HCC from CLD at AUROC 0.67 using GAPDH and 0.68 using the ALU element. The ROC curve of LINE1 and beta-actin cfDII was not found significant for any of the above methods. The cfDII-fragmentation trend in HCC patients of different etiologies was similar indicating increased cfDNA fragmentation irrespective of its etiology. Conclusion: The cfDII measuring both DNA integrity (L/S ratio) and fragmentation of the Alu and GAPDH genes can differentiate HCC from CLD patients and healthy individuals.

AB  - Introduction: Fall is the second most common mechanism of trauma worldwide after road traffic injuries. Data on fall predominantly comes from the high-income countries (HICs) and mostly includes injuries in children and elderly. There are very few studies from low-and middle-income countries(LMICs) that describe fall related injuries other than fragility fractures in elderly. This study describes the profile of poly-trauma patients admitted with a history of 'fall' and assesses the variables associated with mortality. Method: We analyzed data from the 'Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcome' (TITCO) database which prospectively collected data of poly-trauma patients admitted to four major tertiary care hospitals of India between 2013 to 2015. Patients across all age groups admitted to hospital with the history of 'fall'; were included in our study. Single bone fractures were excluded. The Kaplan Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the survival probability in different age groups. Results: A total of 3686 patients were included in our study. The median age of the patients was 28 years (IQR: 9, 47) with the majority being males (73.6%). Almost one-third of the patients were within the age group of 0-14 (30.4%). Most of the patients (79.9%) had a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The overall in-hospital mortality was 18% (664), but higher at 39.0% among patients over 65 years of age. Probability of survival decreased with increase of age. Conclusion: Falling from height is a common injury mechanism in India, occurring more in young males and usually associated with TBI. Isolated TBI and TBI associated with other injuries are the main contrib-utors of mortality in fall injuries. Mortality from these injuries increased with age and ISS.

AB  - The most important stage in activating an appropriate immune response during an infection is pathogen detection. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are innate sensors used for pathogen detection that mould and link the innate and adaptive immune responses by the host. Toll Like receptors (TLRs) specifically TLR2 and TLR4, are PRRs, which have gained prominence due to their exceptional capacity to recognize unique molecular patterns from invading pathogens. They also play a critical role in maintaining the balance between Th1 and Th2 responses, which are necessary for the host's survival. Leprosy is a spectral disease with a wide range of immunological manifestations in the host. Cells of both the innate and adaptive branches play crucial roles in this polarized immune state. Here, we have analysed the proportional expression patterns of TLR2 and TLR4 on the surface of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+ and CD161+ lymphocytes and CD14+ monocytes in different groups of leprosy patients. Further, these TLRs positive cells were correlated with the surface markers of cell exhaustion such as Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1), which indicated their role in immunosuppression. Additionally, blocking the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 in lymphocytes demonstrated visible improvement in their immune activation status through release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha).

AB  - Gene editing has great potential in treating diseases caused by well-characterized molecular alterations. The introduction of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based gene-editing tools has substantially improved the precision and efficiency of gene editing. The CRISPR/Cas9 system offers several advantages over the existing gene-editing approaches, such as its ability to target practically any genomic sequence, enabling the rapid development and deployment of novel CRISPR-mediated knock-out/knock-in methods. CRISPR/Cas9 has been widely used to develop cancer models, validate essential genes as druggable targets, study drug-resistance mechanisms, explore gene non-coding areas, and develop biomarkers. CRISPR gene editing can create more-effective chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells that are durable, cost-effective, and more readily available. However, further research is needed to define the CRISPR/Cas9 system's pros and cons, establish best practices, and determine social and ethical implications. This review summarizes recent CRISPR/Cas9 developments, particularly in cancer research and immunotherapy, and the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based screening in developing cancer precision medicine and engineering models for targeted cancer therapy, highlighting the existing challenges and future directions. Lastly, we highlight the role of artificial intelligence in refining the CRISPR system's on-target and off-target effects, a critical factor for the broader application in cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Immunotherapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become the backbone of treatment for most lung cancers with advanced or metastatic disease. In addition, they have increasingly been used for early stage tumors in neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Unfortunately, however, only a subset of patients experiences meaningful response to ICIs. Although programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pro-tein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has played a role as the principal predictive biomarker for immuno-therapy, its performance may not be optimal, and it suffers multiple practical issues with different companion diag-nostic assays approved. Similarly, tumor mutational burden (TMB) has multiple technical issues as a predictive biomarker for ICIs. Now, ongoing research on tumor-and host immune-specific factors has identified immunotherapy biomarkers that may provide better response and prognosis prediction, in particular in a multimodal approach. This review by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee provides an overview of various immunotherapy biomarkers, including updated data on PD-L1 IHC and TMB, and assessments of neo-antigens, genetic and epigenetic signatures, immune microenvironment by IHC and transcriptomics, and micro -biome and pathologic response to neoadjuvant immuno-therapies. The aim of this review is to underline the efficacy of new individual or combined predictive biomarkers beyond PD-L1 IHC and TMB.(c) 2022 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

AB  - Background Since inception of the COVID-19 pandemic, early detection and isolation of positive cases is one of the key strategies to restrict disease transmission. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) has been the mainstay of diagnosis. Most of the qRTPCR kits were designed against the target genes of original strain of SARS-CoV-2. However, with the emergence of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2, sensitivity of the qRTPCR assays has reportedly reduced. In view of this, it is critical to continuously monitor the performance of the qRTPCR kits in the backdrop of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2. Real world monitoring of assay performance is challenging. Therefore, we developed a two-step in-silico screening process for evaluating the performance of various qRTPCR kits used in India. Results We analysed 73 qRT-PCR kits marketed in India, against the two SARS-CoV-2 VoCs. Sequences of both Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) VoCs submitted to GISAID within a specific timeframe were downloaded, clustered to identify unique sequences and aligned with primer and probe sequences. Results were analysed following a two-step screening process. Out of 73 kits analysed, seven were unsatisfactory for detection of both Delta and Omicron VoCs, 10 were unsatisfactory for Delta VoC whereas 2 were unsatisfactory for only Omicron VoC. Conclusion Overall, we have developed a useful screening process for evaluating the performance of qRTPCR assays against Delta and Omicron VoCs of SARS-CoV-2 which can be used for detecting SARS-CoV-2 VoCs that may emerge in future and can also be redeployed for other evolving pathogens of public health importance.

AB  - Background: A Core Outcome Set (COS) is a standardised list of outcomes that should be reported as a minimum in all clinical trials. In epilepsy, the choice of outcomes varies widely among existing studies, particularly in clinical trials. This diminishes opportunities for informed decision-making, contributes to research waste and is a barrier to integrating findings in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Furthermore, the outcomes currently being measured may not reflect what is important to people with epilepsy.
   Therefore, we aim to develop a COS specific to clinical effectiveness research for adults with epilepsy using Delphi consensus methodology.
   Methods: The EPSET Study will comprise of three phases and follow the core methodological principles as outlined by the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Initiative. Phase 1 will include two focused literature reviews to identify candidate outcomes from the qualitative literature and current outcome measurement practice in phase III and phase IV clinical trials. Phase 2 aims to achieve international consensus to define which outcomes should be measured as a minimum in future trials, using a Delphi process including an online consensus meeting involving key stakeholders. Phase 3 will involve dissemination of the ratified COS to facilitate uptake in future trials and the planning of further research to identify the most appropriate measurement instruments to use to capture the COS in research practice.
   Discussion: Harmonising outcome measurement across future clinical trials should ensure that the outcomes measured are relevant to patients and health services, and allow for more meaningful results to be obtained.

AB  - Background In 2021, WHO Member States endorsed a global target of a 40-percentage-point increase in effective refractive error coverage (eREC; with a 6/12 visual acuity threshold) by 2030. This study models global and regional estimates of eREC as a baseline for the WHO initiative.
   Methods The Vision Loss Expert Group analysed data from 565 448 participants of 169 population-based eye surveys conducted since 2000 to calculate eREC (met need/[met need + undermet need + unmet need]). A binary logistic regression model was used to estimate eREC by Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study super region among adults aged 50 years and older.
   Findings In 2021, distance eREC was 79.1% (95% CI 72.4-85.0) in the high-income super region; 62.1% (54.7-68.8) in north Africa and Middle East; 49.5% (45.0-54.0) in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia; 40.0% (31.7-48.2) in southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania; 34.5% (29.4-40.0) in Latin America and the Caribbean; 9.0% (6.5-12.0) in south Asia; and 5.7% (3.1-9.0) in sub-Saharan Africa. eREC was higher in men and reduced with increasing age. Global distance eREC increased from 2000 to 2021 by 19.0%. Global near vision eREC for 2021 was 20.5% (95% CI 17.8-24.4).
   Interpretation Over the past 20 years, distance eREC has increased in each super region yet the WHO target will require substantial improvements in quantity and quality of refractive services in particular for near vision impairment. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Health-care needs change throughout the life course. It is thus crucial to assess whether health systems provide access to quality health care for all ages. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019), we measured the Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) Index overall and for select age groups in 204 locations from 1990 to 2019.
   Methods We distinguished the overall HAQ Index (ages 0-74 years) from scores for select age groups: the young (ages 0-14 years), working (ages 15-64 years), and post-working (ages 65-74 years) groups. For GBD 2019, HAQ Index construction methods were updated to use the arithmetic mean of scaled mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) and risk-standardised death rates (RSDRs) for 32 causes of death that should not occur in the presence of timely, quality health care. Across locations and years, MIRs and RSDRs were scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) separately, putting the HAQ Index on a different relative scale for each age group. We estimated absolute convergence for each group on the basis of whether the HAQ Index grew faster in absolute terms between 1990 and 2019 in countries with lower 1990 HAQ Index scores than countries with higher 1990 HAQ Index scores and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. SDI is a summary metric of overall development.
   Findings Between 1990 and 2019, the HAQ Index increased overall (by 19.6 points, 95% uncertainty interval 17.9-21.3), as well as among the young (22.5, 19.9-24.7), working (17.2, 15.2-19.1), and post-working (15.1, 13.2-17.0) age groups. Large differences in HAQ Index scores were present across SDI levels in 2019, with the overall index ranging from 30.7 (28.6-33.0) on average in low-SDI countries to 83.4 (82.4-84.3) on average in highSDI countries. Similarly large ranges between low-SDI and high-SDI countries, respectively, were estimated in the HAQ Index for the young (40.4-89.0), working (33.8-82.8), and post-working (30.4-79.1) groups. Absolute convergence in HAQ Index was estimated in the young group only. In contrast, divergence was estimated among the working and post-working groups, driven by slow progress in low-SDI countries.
   Interpretation Although major gaps remain across levels of social and economic development, convergence in the young group is an encouraging sign of reduced disparities in health-care access and quality. However, divergence in the working and post-working groups indicates that health-care access and quality is lagging at lower levels of social and economic development. To meet the needs of ageing populations, health systems need to improve health-care access and quality for working-age adults and older populations while continuing to realise gains among the young.

AB  - Selection of reference genes during real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is critical to determine accurate and reliable mRNA expression. Nonetheless, not a single study has investigated the expression stability of candidate reference genes to determine their suitability as internal controls in SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Using qRT-PCR, we determined expression stability of the nine most commonly used housekeeping genes, namely, TATA-box binding protein (TBP), cyclophilin (CypA), beta- 2-microglobulin (B2M), 18S rRNA (18S), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), glucuronidase beta (GUSB), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT-1), beta- ACTIN, and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in patients with COVID-19 of various severities (asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe) and those with CAM. We used statistical algorithms (delta-C-T [threshold cycle], NormFinder, BestKeeper, GeNorm, and RefFinder) to select the most appropriate reference gene and observed that clinical severity profoundly influences expression stability of reference genes. CypA demonstrated the most consistent expression irrespective of disease severity and emerged as the most suitable reference gene in COVID-19 and CAM. Incidentally, GAPDH, the most commonly used reference gene, showed the maximum variations in expression and emerged as the least suitable. Next, we determined expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-15 using CypA and GAPDH as internal controls and show that CypA-normalized expression matches well with the RNA sequencing-based expression of these genes. Further, IL-6 expression correlated well with the plasma levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. In conclusion, GAPDH emerged as the least suitable and CypA as the most suitable reference gene in COVID-19 and CAM. The results highlight the expression variability of housekeeping genes due to disease severity and provide a strong rationale for identification of appropriate reference genes in other chronic conditions as well.

AB  - Commercial dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural-1 (NS1) Ag detection immunoassays often perform poorly, particularly in secondary DENV infection. To develop a highly sensitive NS1 ELISA, we generated a large repertoire of anti-DENV NS1 mouse mAbs (n = 95) that falls into 36 mAb classes based on binding specificities. The identified mAb pair, capable of efficiently detecting NS1 from four DENV serotypes in an immunoassay, was selected based on multiparametric analysis. The selected mAbs have subnanomolar affinities for NS1 with recognition sites outside the immunodominant wing domain. The assay was converted to an ELISA kit, which showed higher analytical sensitivity (3-fold to 83-fold) for NS1 from four DENV serotypes than commercial Platelia NS1 ELISA (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Compared to RT-PCR, the developed NS1 ELISA showed 78.57%(66 of 84) sensitivity, whereas Platelia NS1 ELISA showed a sensitivity of 60.71% (51 of 84). In a subgroup of RT-PCR-positive secondary dengue samples, our ELISA showed a sensitivity of 70.18% (40 of 57), whereas Platelia ELISA detected only 47.37% (27 of 57) samples. Furthermore, unlike Platelia ELISA, our test equally detected NS1 from four serotypes; Platelia ELISA performed poorly for the DENV-2 serotype, in which only 8 of 21 (38.10%) samples were detected compared with 17 of 21 (80.95%) in our ELISA. Moreover, our ELISA showed 100% specificity in 342 challenging dengue-negative samples. The large and diverse mAb repertoire generated against DENV NS1 and the appropriate selection of mAbs allowed us to establish an ELISA that can efficiently detect NS1 Ag even in secondary dengue and without serotype level bias.

AB  - Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the association of the Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) and Cerebro-Placental Ratio (CPR) in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses who are appropriately-grown (AGA), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and growth restricted (FGR). Methods Singleton pregnancies were recruited after 24 weeks. The patients were recruited after having been classified as AGA (AC/EFW > 10th centile), SGA (AC/EFW-3rd-10th centile without doppler abnormalities), and FGR (AC/EFW < 3rd centile or 3rd-10th centile with doppler abnormalities). A total of 103 cases comprising 48 AGA, 11 SGA, and 44 FGRfetuses were recruited. The Pulsatility Index of the Umbilical artery, Middle cerebral artery, Ductus Venosus, and Aortic Isthmus was obtained. MPI and CPR were calculated too. The primary outcome was to evaluate the predictive value of MPI and CPR for the composite adverse perinatal outcome. Results The mean gestational age of recruitment was 30 weeks. The OR for Composite Adverse Perinatal Outcome in FGR group for MPI > .47 and CPR < 1.67 was 3.48 (95% CI: 1.00-12.24, p-value < .05) with sensitivity and specificity of 65% each and 11.08 (95% CI: 2.62-46.83, p-value = .001) with the sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 70%, respectively. When combined together, MPI and CPR yielded an OR of 58.5 (95% CI: 4.58-746.57, p-value = .002) with a sensitivity of 56.5% and specificity of 95% in the FGR group. Conclusions MPI in conjunction with CPR can be used together to predict adverse perinatal outcomes in FGR.

AB  - Introduction: Androgenic alopecia (AGA), scalp hair loss, occurs due to the hyperactivity of steroid 5 alpha-reductase2 (SRD5A2), which metabolizes testosterone into 5 alpha-dihydroxytestosterone. Finasteride, an FDA-approved drug producing many side effects, is a commonly used competitive inhibitor for SRD5A2 to treat AGA. As a number of mushroom species have been used to treat patients having hair loss problems since ancient times, in the present paper, the bioactive metabolites in mushrooms were computationally screened to assess SRD5A2 inhibitory properties and compared with Finasteride. Methodology: A virtual screening approach in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulation and MMPBSA methods has been applied to identify potential inhibitors against SRD5A2. SwissADME tool and AutoDock Vina were used to screen the library of 152 bioactive mushroom metabolites. All MD simulations were carried out using GROMACS 5.1.4 suite and GROMOS96 43a1 force field. The stability of SRD5A-ligand complexes was determined in terms of RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and hydrogen bonding. The binding energy of complexes was calculated using MMPBSA.Results and Conclusion: Virtual screening and MD simulation studies revealed that out of the 152 metabolites, three bioactives, i.e., Zhankuic acid A (-11.5 kcal/mol), Sterenin M (-10.4 kcal/mol), Melleolide K (-10.2 kcal/ mol), and drug Finasteride having the least binding energy are the potential inhibitors of SRD5A2. These mol-ecules also exhibited stable interaction with SRD5A2 during MD simulation. This study will pave the way for the experimental evaluation and validation of the medicinal potentials of screened mushroom compounds to treat androgenic alopecia.

AB  - Purpose There is an increasing burden of kidney diseases worldwide and access to specialist care is limited. Telemedicine, has been relatively less used in developing countries like India. The current study aims to assess the feasibility and acceptance of telenephrology services at our institute, a public hospital. Methods A total of 150 patients were selected by stratified random sampling from the list of attendees who had undergone both in-person outpatient consultation and telenephrology consultation. Patient's attitude towards, and knowledge and acceptance of telenephrology services were evaluated. Results The average age of the study cohort was 42.52 +/- 15.1 years. More than one-third (39.3%) of our patients belonged to the lower middle socioeconomic class. The median distance traveled to reach our outpatient clinic was 113.5 km (3-2249 km). Patients reported lost workdays in 54.7% cases. The majority (95%) of patients managed to consult through teleservices successfully. Ninety percent of the patients gave a satisfaction score of 4 (out of 5) or above for their tele-consultation experience. The most important perceived benefit of teleconsultation was the reduced risk of infection (40.6%) followed by economic benefits (32%). The major disadvantage (36%) was the absence of physical examination. A combination of physical and telenephrology services was the option preferred by 84% of the patients. Conclusion In developing countries like India, with the majority of the population residing outside major cities and with limited medical access, telenephrology has a huge potential to provide quality nephrology care to the remotest parts of the country.

AB  - Current evidence emerging from both human and animal models confirms that high-salt diet consumption over a period modulates the gut ecology and subsequently accelerates the development of the pathophysiology of many metabolic diseases. The knowledge of short-term intake of a high-salt diet (HSD) on gut microbiota and their role in the progression of metabolic pathogenesis and the consequence of a typical course of common antibiotics in this condition has yet not been investigated. The present study elicited this knowledge gap by studying how the gut microbiota profile changes in mice receiving HSD for a short period followed by Amoxicillin treatment on these mice in the last week to mimic a typical treatment course of antibiotics. In this study, we provided a standard chow diet (CD) and HSD for 3 weeks, and a subset of these mice on both diets received antibiotic therapy with Amoxicillin in the 3rd week. We measured the body weight of mice for 3 weeks. After 21 days, all animals were euthanised and subjected to a thorough examination for haemato-biochemical, histopathological, and 16S rRNA sequencing, followed by bioinformatics analysis to determine any changes in gut microbiota ecology. HSD exposure in mice for short duration even leads to a significant difference in the gut ecology with enrichment of specific gut microbiota crucially linked to developing the pathophysiological features of metabolic disease-related inflammation. In addition, HSD treatment showed a negative impact on haemato-biochemical parameters. However, Amoxicillin treatment in HSD-fed mice restored the blood-biochemical markers near to control values and reshaped gut microbiota known for improving the pathophysiological attributes of metabolic disease related inflammation. This study also observed minimal and insignificant pathological changes in the heart, liver, and kidney in HSD-fed mice.

AB  - Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a heterogeneous group of diseases that result in a common pathology, thrombotic microangiopathy, which is classically characterised by the triad of non-immune microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. In this Seminar, different causes of HUS are discussed, the most common being Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli HUS. Identifying the underlying thrombotic microangiopathy trigger can be challenging but is imperative if patients are to receive personalised disease-specific treatment. The quintessential example is complement-mediated HUS, which once carried an extremely high mortality but is now treated with anti-complement therapies with excellent long-term outcomes. Unfortunately, the high cost of anti-complement therapies all but precludes their use in low-income countries. For many other forms of HUS, targeted therapies are yet to be identified.

AB  - Introduction: The high burden of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in young children disproportionately occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The PROUD (Preventing RespiratOry syncytial virUs in unDerdeveloped countries) Taskforce of 24 RSV worldwide experts assessed key needs for RSV prevention in LMICs, including vaccine and newer preventive measures. Methods: A global, survey-based study was undertaken in 2021. An online questionnaire was developed following three meetings of the Taskforce panellists wherein factors related to RSV infection, its prevention and management were identified using iterative questioning. Each factor was scored, by non-panellists interested in RSV, on a scale of zero (very-low-relevance) to 100 (very-high-relevance) within two scenarios: (1) Current and (2) Future expectations for RSV management. Results: Ninety questionnaires were completed: 70 by respondents (71.4% physicians; 27.1% researchers/scientists) from 16 LMICs and 20 from nine high-income (HI) countries (90.0% physicians; 5.0% researchers/scientists), as a reference group. Within LMICs, RSV awareness was perceived to be low, and management was not prioritised. Of the 100 factors scored, those related to improved diagnosis particularly access to affordable point-of-care diagnostics, disease burden data generation, clinical and general education, prompt access to new interventions, and engagement with policymakers/payers were identified of paramount importance. There was a strong need for clinical education and local data generation in the lowest economies, whereas upper-middle income countries were more closely aligned with HI countries in terms of current RSV service provision. Conclusion: Seven key actions for improving RSV prevention and management in LMICs are proposed.

AB  - Introduction Data on the impact of desmoid type fibromatosis (DTF) on emotional distress and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is sparse.
   Methodology In this prospective cross-sectional study, patients with DTF and healthy controls were asked to fill the EORTC QLQ-C30, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 questionnaires. The objectives were to determine HRQoL, anxiety, and depression in patients with DTF.
   Results Two hundred four subjects (102 DTF patients and 102 healthy controls) were recruited. The median age of DTF patients at recruitment into the study was 31 years (IQR, 25-37 years). There was a female preponderance with a male:female ratio of 1:1.83. Appendicular skeleton and abdomen sites were most commonly involved in 59% and 22.5% respectively. About half (54%) of patients were currently on sorafenib and 41% were under active surveillance. The mean global health status in DTF patients was 65.58 +/- 22.64, significantly lower than healthy controls. Similarly, DTF patients scored low on all functional scales except cognitive functioning. The symptom scale showed a significantly higher symptom burden of fatigue, pain, insomnia, and financial difficulties. Anxiety and depression was observed in 39.22% and 50% of DTF patients respectively. DTF patients had higher rates of mild, moderate, and severe anxiety and depression compared to healthy controls.
   Conclusion DTF patients have significant symptom burden, poor functioning, and heightened anxiety and depression as compared to healthy controls. HRQoL, anxiety, and depression should be routinely used to assess symptom burden and treatment efficacy in DTF patients.

AB  - Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in the adult population. It causes the patient to incur a great deal of malady. Even with the advances in management and the Stupp protocol in place, the prognosis remains grim. There are various parameters to evaluate patients' performance status and frailty pre-operatively, but these are mostly subjective and thus suffer from inter-observer variability. Assessment of sarcopenia serves as an objective parameter to assess the patient's performance status pre-operatively. Temporalis muscle thickness serves as a surrogate to assess sarcopenia in patients with glioblastoma. We conducted a literature review and meta-analysis to determine the prognostic implications of temporalis muscle thickness in 3283 patients with primary glioblastoma. The pooled overall survival hazard's ratio of thick versus thin TMT was 0.54. The pooled progression-free survival hazard's ratio of thick versus thin TMT was 0.38. Thus, the main finding of this study is that thicker temporal muscle is associated with better OS and PFS as compared to thinner temporal muscle. We thus conclude that TMT is a viable surrogate for predicting sarcopenia and survival in primary glioblastoma. TMT measurement is extremely easy and can be incorporated as a part of the routine neurosurgical workflow in these patients. Survival prediction will help inform treatment decisions in glioblastoma patients having poor prognosis, at the initial diagnosis itself.

AB  - Background and Objectives Enabling universal access to safe blood components should be a key component of every country's national healthcare strategy. This study aimed to assess the current status of infrastructure and resources of blood transfusion services (BTS) in low- and middle-income countries. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional survey was designed to gather information on blood donations, components, redistribution, testing resources and quality management systems (QMSs). The survey was distributed to the International Society of Blood Transfusion members between October 2021 and November 2021. Results A total of 54 respondents from 20 countries responded to the survey. This included hospital-based BTS/blood centres (46%), national blood centres (11%)and national and regional blood services (11%). Voluntary non-remunerated, replacement and paid donors accounted for 94.2%, 84.6% and 21.1% of donations, respectively. Apheresis donation was available in 59.6% of institutions. National/regional criteria for redistribution of blood components were reported by 75.9% of respondents. Blood components incurred payment charges in 81.5% of respondents' institutions, and payments were borne by patients in 50% of them. Testing methods, such as manual (83%), semi-automated (68%) or fully automated (36.2%), were used either alone or in combination. QMSs were reported in 17 institutions, while accreditation and haemovigilance were reported in 12 and 8 countries, respectively. Conclusion QMS was implemented in most of the countries despite the common use of paid donations and the lack of advanced testing. Efforts to overcome persistent challenges and wider implementation of patient blood management programmes are required.

AB  - Tuberculosis is recognized as one of the major public health threats worldwide. The DevR-DevS (DosR/DosS) two-component system is considered a novel drug target in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiological agent of tuberculosis, owing to its central role in bacterial adaptation and long-term persistence. An increase in DevR levels and the decreased permeability of the mycobacterial cell wall during hypoxiaassociated dormancy pose formidable challenges to the development of antiDevR compounds. Using an in vitro evolution approach of Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX), we developed a panel of single-stranded DNA aptamers that interacted with Mtb DevR protein in solid-phase binding assays. The best-performing aptamer, APT-6, forms a G-quadruplex structure and inhibits DevR-dependent transcription in Mycobacterium smegmatis. Mechanistic studies indicate that APT-6 functions by inhibiting the dimerization and DNA binding activity of DevR protein. In silico studies reveal that APT-6 interacts majorly with C terminal domain residues that participate in DNA binding and formation of active dimer species of DevR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a DNA aptamer that inhibits the function of a cytosolic bacterial response regulator. By inhibiting the dimerization of DevR, APT-6 targets an essential step in the DevR activation mechanism, and therefore, it has the potential to universally block the expression of DevR-regulated genes for intercepting dormancy pathways in mycobacteria. These findings also pave the way for exploring aptamer-based approaches to design and develop potent inhibitors against intracellular proteins of various bacterial pathogens of global concern.

AB  - Introduction This study was aimed to investigate the effect of multimodal intervention on the cognitive functions of older adults with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI).
   Materials and methods Sixty subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive either computer based cognitive therapy (CBCT) or CBCT+Mediterranean equivalent diet (MED) or CBCT+MED+ Exercise regime and the control group. The intervention group received supervised CBCT twice a week to have 40 sessions, each of 40 minutes duration, and/ or supervised aerobic and resistive exercise twice a week for 24 weeks and or MED at home under the supervision of a dietician. The control group was provided with health awareness instructions for brain stimulating activities such as sudoku, mental maths, and learning music and new skills.
   Results Cognitive functions which was the primary outcome measure were assessed using the Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale (PGI-MS), and Stroop Colour and Word Test at baseline and after 6 months intervention period. As assessed by the PGI-MS, there was significant improvement in domains such as mental balance, attention and concentration, delayed recall, immediate recall, verbal retention of dissimilar pairs, Visual retention, and total score both in the unimodal and multimodal intervention groups. However, the improvement was observed to be the highest in the multimodal intervention group as compared to unimodal group. All the participants completed the trial.
   Conclusion This pilot randomized control trial indicated that multimodal intervention could be an effective non-pharmacological intervention in individuals with SCI for improving their cognitive functions.

AB  - Candida auris is a globally emerging fungal pathogen responsible for causing nosocomial outbreaks in healthcare associated settings. It is known to cause infection in all age groups and exhibits multi-drug resistance with high potential for horizontal transmission. Because of this reason combined with limited therapeutic choices available, C. auris infection has been acknowledged as a potential risk for causing a future pandemic, and thus seeking a promising strategy for its treatment is imperative. Here, we combined evolutionary information with reverse vaccinology approach to identify novel epitopes for vaccine design that could elicit CD4+ T-cell responses against C. auris. To this end, we extensively scanned the family of proteins encoded by C. auris genome. In addition, a pathogen may acquire substitutions in epitopes over a period of time which could cause its escape from the immune response thus rendering the vaccine ineffective. To lower this possibility in our design, we eliminated all rapidly evolving genes of C. auris with positive selection. We further employed highly conserved regions of multiple C. auris strains and identified two immunogenic and antigenic T-cell epitopes that could generate the most effective immune response against C. auris. The antigenicity scores of our predicted vaccine candidates were calculated as 0.85 and 1.88 where 0.5 is the threshold for prediction of fungal antigenic sequences. Based on our results, we conclude that our vaccine candidates have the potential to be successfully employed for the treatment of C. auris infection. However, in vivo experiments are imperative to further demonstrate the efficacy of our design.

AB  - Background: Macrophages are mononuclear CD34(+) antigen-presenting cells of defense mechanism and play dual roles in tumor burden. The immunomodulatory and their antitumor function of beta-defensin 2 is still unclear, despite the accumulating evidence of the response in infection. So, the aim of present study is to elucidate the role of beta-defensin 2 on the level of ROS, cytokines, chemokine expression in macrophages and antitumor function in breast cancer.
   Method: Swiss albino mice were used to harvest PEC macrophages and C127i breast cancer cells line for tumor model was used in this study. Macrophages were harvested and characterized by flow-cytometry using F4/80 and CD11c antibodies. MTT was performed to estimate cytotoxicity and dose optimization of beta-defensin 2. Oxidative stress was analyzed by H2O2 and NO estimation followed by iNOS quantified by q-PCR. Cytokines and chemokines estimation was done using q-PCR. Co-culture experiment was performed to study anti-tumor function using PI for cell cycle, Annexin -V and CFSE analysis for cell proliferation.
   Results: PEC harvested macrophages were characterized by flow-cytometry using F4/80 and CD11c antibodies with the purity of 8% pure population of macrophages. It was found that 99% of cells viable at the maximum dose of 100 ng/ml of beta-defensin 2 in MTT. Levels of NO and H2O2 were found to be decreased in beta-defensin 2 as compared to control. Expression of cytokines of IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta was found to be increased while IL-3 was decreased in beta-defensin 2 group as compared to control. Levels of chemokines CXCL-1, CXCL-5 and CCL5 increased in treated macrophages while CCL24 and CXCL-15 expression decreased. Adhesion receptor (CD32) and fusion receptor (CD204) were decreased in the beta-defensin 2 group as compared to control. Anti-tumor experiment was performed using co-culture experiment apoptosis (Annexin-V) was induced, cell cycle arrest in phage and cell proliferation of C127i cells was decreased.
   Conclusion: This is the first report of beta-defensin 2 modulates macrophage immunomodulatory and their antitumor function in breast cancer. beta-defensin 2 as a new therapeutic target for immunotherapy as an adjuvant in vaccines.

AB  - Progression and metastasis of ER+ breast cancer depend on multiple signaling cascades. The available conventional treatment options have limited efficacy in ER+ breast cancer due to overexpression of AKT, c-Myc and BCL-2 proteins. Simultaneous targeting and inhibition of these targets in ER+ cancer may result in effective therapeutic outcomes. However, combining two or more free drug molecules to treat cancer leads to unsynchronised pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and eventual resistance development. To overcome these limitations, a novel nanoformulation of PI3-K delta/HDAC6 dual inhibitor in combination with Navitoclax is developed using Pluronic modified PLA based hybrid block copolymer. The prepared dual drug loaded PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NAV-NPs (1:3-NPs) have shown high encapsulation efficiency, hydrodynamic size, and polydispersity of similar to 93 %, 159 +/- 2.6 nm, and 0.19 +/- 0.03, respectively. These PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NAV-NPs exhibit slow and sustained release profiles of PI3-K delta/HDAC6 inhibitor and NAV in phosphate buffer saline (PBS, pH 7.4). The in-vitro cytotoxicity studies done with PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NAV-NPs in ER+ breast cancer cell lines have shown a synergistic effect with lower IC50 values compared to individual NAV-NPs and PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NPs. The PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NAV-NPs treatment (4 mg/kg, I.V., twice a week for three weeks) of ER+ breast cancer syngeneic mice tumor model resulted in complete tumor eradication without any overt toxicity. These results demonstrate that a unique formulation of a novel PI3-K delta/HDAC6 dual inhibitor in combination with Navitoclax represents an approach for an efficient treatment option for ER+ breast cancer.

AB  - Aim The present study sought to evaluate the morphology and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with aortopulmonary window on virtual dissection of multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography data sets. Material and Methods We conducted a retrospective search of our departmental database from January 2014 to September 2021 to identify patients with aortopulmonary window and relevant information was extracted from the electronic case records and from routine examination as well as virtual dissection of CT data sets. Results An aortopulmonary window was observed in 26 patients (20 males; 6 females). Based on location of the defect, a distal aortopulmonary window was the most common subtype, seen in 13/26 (50%) patients followed by a proximal, complete and intermediate subtypes seen in 7/26 (27%), 5/26 (19%) and 1/26 (4%) patients respectively. Associated ventricular septal defect was observed in 9/26 (34.6%) patients while an interrupted aortic arch was present in 5/26 (19.2%) patients. Tetralogy of Fallot was seen in 5/26 (19.2%) patients. Anomalous origin of right pulmonary artery from ascending aorta and crossed pulmonary arteries were seen in 2/26 (7.6%) patients each. An isolated aortopulmonary window without any simple/complex congenital anomaly was seen in 10/26 (38.5%) patients. Conclusion Aortopulmonary window is associated with a wide gamut of cardiovascular lesions, with ventricular septal defect being the commonest associated anomaly followed by tetralogy of Fallot and interrupted aortic arch respectively. Virtual dissection of multidetector CT angiography allows detailed anatomical evaluation of aortopulmonary window, allowing a clear visualization of the defect and associated cardiovascular anomalies.

AB  - Background Clear cell adenocarcinoma of the lower urinary tract (CCACLUT) is a rare primary malignant neoplasm with heterogenous morphology. There is a paucity of data in the literature regarding its immunohistochemical profile. Methods The immunohistochemical features (extent and intensity) of a multinational cohort of CCACLUT were evaluated with comparison between clear cell adenocarcinoma of the female genital tract (CCACFGT, tissue microarray) and nephrogenic adenoma (NA). Results 33 CCACLUT (24 female, 9 male; mean age 59 years) were collected. CCACLUT most commonly arose from the urinary bladder (26/33, 78%), particularly from the trigone (10/33, 30.3%) followed by the urethra (8/33, 22%). All 12 NA cases were located at the urinary bladder, whereas the most common CCACFGT location was the ovary (29/56, 52%). None of the CCACLUT patients had, intestinal metaplasia, NA, or urothelial carcinoma. One patient had concurrent endometriosis of the sigmoid colon. Most frequently observed morphology in CCACLUT was papillary/tubulocystic (9/3; 27.3%), followed by papillary/tubular (6/33; 18.2%) and papillary/solid (5/33; 15.2%). GATA3 expression was significantly higher in CCACLUT (18/33, 54.5%) and NA (6/12, 50%), when compared to CCACFGT cases 6/56, 11.7%)(p = 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). The extent of GATA3 was significantly higher in CCACLUT group (19.2 +/- 16.6%) than the other groups (9.6 +/- 22.5% in NA and 2.6 +/- 9% in CCACFGT group) (p = 0.001). 4/33 patients (12.1) had weak, 10/33 patients (30.3%) had moderate, and 4/33 patients (12.1%) had strong GATA3 intensity in CCACLUT group. In NA group, one patient (8.3%, 1/12) had weak, one patient (8.3%, 1/12) had moderate and 4 patients (33.3%, 4/12) had strong GATA3 intensity. Most cases (CCACLUT 29/33, 88%; NA 11/12, 92%; CCACFGT 46/56, 82.1%) had positive Napsin A expression, by which CCACLUT had significantly more cases with Napsin A expression (p = 0.034). p63 was consistently negative in all cases (30/33 (91.9%) CCACLUT; 12/12 (100%) NA; 42/56 (75%) CCACFGT. Ki67 (MIB) proliferation index was significantly higher in CCACLUT group (54.6 +/- 21%) when compared to NA group (4.5 +/- 2.7%) and CCACFGT group (35.5 +/- 25.8%) (p = 0.001). Conclusion CCACLUT has consistent GATA3 expression, which may cause challenge in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma but can be used to distinguish CCACLUT from CCACFGT.

AB  - Death due to abuse and accidental ingestion of methanol is widely known around the globe. The paper presents the postmortem changes in concentrations of methanol in the vitreous humor, aqueous humor, and ocular tissues in a rabbit model in methanol intoxication. Rabbits were intoxicated with methanol at a dose of 6.3 ml/kg through oral gavage. After 3.5 h of methanol administration, the rabbits were sacrificed. Vitreous humor, aqueous humor, and ocular tissues were collected both, perimortem (immediately) and postmortem (17 h post-death). Whole blood and plasma samples were also collected to explore the correlation between levels of methanol in whole blood/plasma and ocular fluids/ocular tissues if any. All the samples were analyzed by Headspace Gas Chromatography. The analysis revealed a decrease in methanol levels at postmortem for all the matrices, except for retina-choroid than its perimortem value. For retina-choroid, no significant change in methanol levels at postmortem was found.

AB  - Currently, there are no FDA approved antiviral drugs available to treat COVID-19 patients. Also, due to emer-gence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, the protective efficacy of vaccines could be reduced, hence it is urgent to have alternative treatments for combating the SARS-CoV-2 infection.Since, there is a long-standing history of herbal medicine in the treatment of respiratory diseases. In the present study, we investigated two polyherbal oil blend viz. Sudarshan AV and Elixir AV (SAV and EAV) in inhibiting SARS-COV-2. From GC-MS analysis of polyherbal oils (SAV and EAV) a total of 11 active compounds were selected, on the basis of their abundance and activity. Further, from the molecular docking studies, we found an inhibitory effect of these compounds on viral envelope and membrane, spike proteins whilst an agonistic effect with human host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) implicating the crucial role of the individual compound in resistance of SARS-CoV-2. Since, the in-silico results suggest that polyherbal oil (SAV and EAV) contributes in preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the human body, we further investigated the efficacy of polyherbal formulated essential oil (FEO; SAV & EAV) in prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in hamster model. The male golden Syrian hamsters (n = 23) were divided into 5 groups i.e., Group 1: Control (n = 3); Group 2: Infected (n = 5); Group 3: Infected + Remdesivir (n = 5); Group 4: Infected + FEO (n = 5) and Group 5: Prophylactic FEO + Infected (n = 5). In both treatment and prophylactic groups, the FEO's significantly reduced the lung injury investigated histo-pathologically and viral load expression measured by real time PCR in comparison to infected hamsters. Furthermore, cytokines expression analysis clearly highlighted the efficacy of FEO's due to its anti-inflammatory activity and overall protection in treatment groups. In conclusion, the FEO (SAV & EAV) seem to be potent in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and related lung injury.

AB  - New variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to evolve. The novel SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern (VOC) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) was particularly menacing due to the presence of numerous consequential mutations. In this study, we reviewed about 12 million SARS-CoV-2 genomic and associated metadata using extensive bioinformatic approaches to understand how evolutionary and mutational changes affect Omicron variant properties. Subsampled global data based analysis of molecular clock in the phylogenetic tree showed 29.56 substitutions per year as the evolutionary rate of five VOCs. We observed extensive mutational changes in the spike structural protein of the Omicron variant. A total of 20% of 7230 amino acid and structural changes exclusive to Omicron's spike protein were detected in the receptor binding domain (RBD), suggesting differential selection pressures exerted during evolution. Analyzing key drug targets revealed mutation-derived differential binding affinities between Delta and Omicron variants. Nine single-RBD substitutions were detected within the binding site of approved therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. T-cell epitope prediction revealed eight immunologically important functional hotspots in three conserved non-structural proteins. A universal vaccine based on these regions may likely protect against all these SARS-CoV-2 variants. We observed key structural changes in the spike protein, which decreased binding affinities, indicating that these changes may help the virus escape host cellular immunity. These findings emphasize the need for continuous genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand how novel mutations may impact viral spread and disease outcome.

AB  - Cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (CAPJ) has piqued the interest of researchers for various antimicrobial applications such as disinfection, wound decontamination, etc. In the current context, a deeper understanding of the correlation between CAPJ's intrinsic parameters, discharge characteristics, species composition, and antimicrobial activity is required for any successful application. This research evaluated the effect of intrinsic operational parameters such as voltage, frequency, gas flow rate, and operating gas on the reactive species composition of an in-house-developed CAPJ discharge along with the antimicrobial activity. It was observed that the identified excited atoms (Ar I, He I, N-2, and O I), ions (Ar+, N-2+, N+, H2O+, H3O+, etc.), radical reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) (OH_), and nonradical RONS (O I, O+, OH+, NO+, O-2+, O-2-, NO2-, N2O2-, NO3-, N-2 O-3-, etc.) might play a synergistic role in bacterial inactivation via oxidative and electrostatic stress. The variation in voltage, frequency, gas flow rate, and operating gas influenced the discharge chemistry, leading to variation in bacterial inactivation. The reactive species in the discharge responsible for such variation was evaluated extensively. This investigation into various operational parameters would aid in determining the most effective settings for a developed CAPJ to achieve high productivity.

AB  - Glutamate-receptor-mediated hyperexcitability contributes to seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (TKP) metabolites regulate glutamate receptor activity under physiological conditions. This study was designed to investigate alterations in the levels of TKP metabolites and the differential regulation of glutamatergic activity by TKP metabolites in the hippocampus, anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and neocortex samples of a lithium-pilocarpine rat model of TLE. We observed that levels of tryptophan were reduced in the hippocampus and ATL samples but unaltered in the neocortex samples. The levels of kynurenic acid were reduced in the hippocampus samples and unaltered in the ATL and neocortex samples of the TLE rats. The levels of kynurenine were unaltered in all three regions of the TLE rats. The magnitude of reduction in these metabolites in all regions was unaltered in the TLE rats. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were enhanced in hippocampus ATL samples but not in the neocortex samples of the TLE rats. The exogenous application of kynurenic acid inhibited glutamatergic activity in the slice preparations of all these regions in both the control and the TLE rats. However, the magnitude of reduction in the frequency of kynurenic acid was higher in the hippocampus (18.44 +/- 2.6% in control vs. 30.02 +/- 1.5 in TLE rats) and ATL (16.31 +/- 0.91% in control vs. 29.82 +/- 3.08% in TLE rats) samples of the TLE rats. These findings suggest the differential regulation of glutamatergic activity by TKP metabolites in the hippocampus, ATL, and neocortex of TLE rats.

AB  - Introduction: Data are limited on antibody response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222; Covishield (R)) in cirrhosis. We studied the antibody response following two doses of the ChAdOx1 vaccine, given 4-2 weeks apart, in cirrhosis. Methods: Prospectively enrolled, 131 participants (71% males; age 50 (43-58); alcohol-related etiology 14, hepatitis B 33, hepatitis C 46, cryptogenic 21, autoimmune 9, others 8; Child-Turcott-Pugh class A/B/C 52/63/16). According to dose intervals, the participants were grouped as <= 6 weeks (group I), 7-12 weeks (group II), and 13-36 weeks (group III). Blood specimens collected at >= 4 weeks after the second dose were tested for anti-spike antibody titre (ASAb; positive >= 0.80 U/mL) and neutralizing antibody (NAb; positive >= 20% neutralization) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche) and SARS-CoV-2 NAb ELISA Kit (Invitrogen), respectively. Data are expressed as number (proportion) and median (interquartile range) and compared using non-parametric tests. Results: Overall, 99.2% and 84% patients developed ASAb (titre 5440 (1719-9980 U/mL)) and NAb (92 (49.1-97.6%)), respectively. When comparing between the study groups, the ASAb titres were significantly higher in group II than in group I (2613 (310-7518) versus 6365 (2968-9463), p = 0.027) but were comparable between group II and III (6365 (2968-9463) versus 5267 (1739-11,653), p = 0.999). Similarly, NAb was higher in group II than in group I (95.5 (57.6-98.0) versus 45.9 (15.4-92.0); p < 0.001), but not between the groups II and III (95.5 (57.6-98.0) versus 92.4 (73.8-97.5); p = 0.386). Conclusion: Covishield (R) induces high titres of ASAb and NAb in cirrhosis. A higher titre is achieved if two doses are given at an interval of more than six weeks.

AB  - Objective: To compare the efficacy of sunlight exposure and oral vitamin D3 supplementation to achieve vitamin D sufficiency in infants at 6 months of age. Design: Open-label randomized controlled trial. Setting: Public hospital in Northern India (28.7 & DEG;N). Participant: Breastfed infants at 6-8 weeks of age. Intervention: Randomized to receive sunlight exposure (40% body surface area for a minimum of 30 minutes/week) or oral vitamin D3 supplementation (400 IU/day) till 6 months of age. Outcome: Primary - proportion of infants having vitamin D sufficiency (> 20 ng/mL). Secondary - proportion of infants developing vitamin D deficiency (< 12ng/mL) and rickets in both the groups at 6 months of age. Results: Eighty (40 in each group) infants with mean (SD) age 47.8 (4.5) days were enrolled. The proportion of infants with vitamin D sufficiency increased after intervention in the vitamin D group from 10.8% to 35.1% (P=0.01) but remained the same in sunlight group (13.9%) and was significant on comparison between both groups (P=0.037). The mean (SD) compliance rate was 72.9 (3.4)% and 59.7 (23.6)% in the vitamin D and sunlight group, respectively (P=0.01). The geometric mean (95% CI) serum 25(OH) D levels in the vitamin D and sunlight group were 16.23 (13.58-19.40) and 11.89 (9.93-14.23) ng/mL, respectively; (P=0.02), after adjusting baseline serum 25(OH)D with a geometric mean ratio of 1.36 (1.06-1.76). Two infants in sunlight group developed rickets. Conclusion: Oral vitamin D3 supplementation is more efficacious than sunlight in achieving vitamin D sufficiency in breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life due to better compliance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The concept of listing essential medicines can lead to improved supply and access, more rational prescribing, and lower costs of drugs. However, these benefits hinge on the prescription of drugs from an Essential Medicines List (EML). Several studies have highlighted the problem of underutilization of EMLs by prescribers. Therefore, as part of prescription research by the Indian Council of Medical Research-Rational Use of Medicines Centres Network, we evaluated the extent of prescription of drugs not listed in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prescriptions of outpatients from participating centers were included after obtaining verbal/written informed consent as approved by the Ethics Committee, and evaluated for prescription of drugs from the NLEM 2015. RESULTS: Analysis of 4838 prescriptions from 13 tertiary health-care institutes revealed that 2677 (55.33%) prescriptions had at least one non-NLEM drug prescribed. In all, 5215 (31.12%) of the total 16,758 drugs prescribed were not in NLEM. Of these, 2722 (16.24%) were single drugs and 2493 (14.88%) were fixed-dose combinations (FDCs). These comprised 700 different drug products - 346 single drugs and 354 FDCs. The average number of non-NLEM drugs prescribed per prescription was 1.08, while the average number of all drugs prescribed was 3.35 per prescription. It was also found that some of the non-NLEM drugs prescribed had the potential to result in increased cost (for example, levocetirizine), increased adverse effects (dextromethorphan), and less effectiveness (losartan) when compared to their NLEM counterparts. Nonavailability of an essential drug (oral hydroxocobalamin) was another important finding of our study. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the extent and pattern of drugs prescribed from outside the NLEM at the tertiary health-care level and the need for training and enhanced awareness among prescribers for greater utilization of the NLEM.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) presents with a spectrum of cognitive impairment due to stroke and poses a huge socioeconomic burden especially in low middle-income countries. There is a critical need for early recognition and identification of VCI patients. Therefore, we developed and validated culturally appropriate neuropsychological instruments, the ICMR-Neuro Cognitive Tool-Box (ICMR-NCTB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to diagnose vascular MCI and dementia in the Indian context. Methods: A total of 181 participants: 59 normal cognition, 25 stroke with normal cognition, 46 vascular MCI (VaMCI) and 51 vascular dementia (VaD) were recruited for the study. The ICMR-NCTB and MoCA were administered to patients with VCI and major cognitive domains were evaluated. Results: The ICMR-NCTB was found to have good internal reliability in VaMCI and VaD. The sensitivity of the ICMR-NCTB to detect VaMCI and VaD ranged from 70.8% to 72.9% and 75.9% to 79.7%, respectively, and the specificity for VaMCI and VaD ranged from 84.8% to 86.1% and 82.5% to 85.2%, respectively. The MoCA had excellent sensitivity and specificity to detect VaMCI and VaD at ideal cut-off scores. Conclusion: The ICMR-NCTB is a valid neuropsychological toolbox that can be used for comprehensive cognitive assessment and diagnosis of VCI in India. In addition, the Indian version of MoCA is more adept as a screening instrument to detect VCI due to its high sensitivity. The ICMR-NCTB will aid in early detection and management of many patients, thereby reducing the burden of vascular MCI and dementia in India.

AB  - Introduction: The classification of odontogenic tumors has been revised from time to time in order to provide unified terminology. This reclassification had considerable impact on their prevalence and frequency distribution.
   Objectives: This study was aimed to emphasize impact of changing classification systems on prevalence and relative frequency of odontogenic tumors. The secondary objective was to analyze demographics of various histological types of odontogenic tumors in comparison to published literature. Review of Indian studies (1992-2020) elaborating frequency of odontogenic tumors is summarized in the end.
   Methods: This was a hospital-based retrospective study wherein case files of odontogenic tumors diagnosed from 1990 to 2019 period were retrieved. The classification system used originally at the time of diagnosis was retained and prevalence of odontogenic tumors in three different periods (1990-2004, 2005-2016 and 2017-2019) was compared. Further, prevalence, frequency distribution and demographics of all these tumors (1990-2019) were analyzed using latest World Health Organization 2017 classification.
   Results: A total of 345 odontogenic tumors was diagnosed as per World Health Organization 2017 system of classification from 1990 to 2019. 96.81% tumors were benign and 3.81% constituted malignant odontogenic tumors. However, there was marked increase in prevalence of odontogenic tumors in 2005-2016 (6.2%) period as compared to 1990-2004 (3.87%) and 2017-2019 (3.47%). Ameloblastoma remained the most common tumor in three different periods, whereas keratocystic odontogenic tumor became second commonest tumor in 2005-2016 as compared to odontoma in 1990-2004 and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor in 2017-2019.
   Conclusions: The continuous evolving systems of classification may partly be responsible for inconsistency in odontogenic tumors, with inclusion of keratocystic odontogenic tumor,and has marked impact on prevalence and frequency distribution of odontogenic tumors. The geographical variations in demographics of odontogenic tumors might reflect genetic and environment influence; however it requires elucidation by further studies.

AB  - Nanoconfinement within flexible interfaces is a key step towards exploiting confinement effects in several biological and technological systems wherein flexible 2D materials are frequently utilized but are arduous to prepare. Hitherto unreported, the synthesis of 2D hydrogel nanosheets (HNSs) using a template- and catalyst-free process is developed representing a fertile ground for fundamental structure-property investigations. In due course of time, nucleating folds propagating along the edges trigger co-operative deformations of HNS generating regions of nanoconfinement within trapped water islands. These severely constricting surfaces force water molecules to pack within the nanoscale regime of HNS almost parallel to the surface bringing about phase transition into puckered rhombic ice with AA and AB Bernal stacking pattern, which was mostly restricted to molecular dynamics studies so far. Interestingly, under high lateral pressure and spatial inhomogeneity within nanoscale confinement, bilayer rhombic ice structures were formed with an in-plane lattice spacing of 0.31 nm. In this work, a systematic exploration of rhombic ice formation within HNS has been delineated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and its ultrathin morphology was examined using atomic force microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed high porosity while mechanical testing presented young's modulus of 155 kPa with similar to 84% deformation, whereas contact angle suggested high hydrophilicity. The combinations of nanosheets, porosity, nanoconfinement, hydrophilicity, and mechanical strength, motivated us to explore their application as a scaffold for cartilage regeneration, by inducing chondrogenesis of human Wharton Jelly derived mesenchymal stem cells. HNS promoted the formation of cell aggregates giving higher number of spheroid formation and a marked expression of chondrogenic markers (ColI, ColII, ColX, ACAN and S-100), thereby providing some cues for guiding chondrogenic differentiation.

AB  - Background: In this trial, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of olanzapine in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Materials and Methods: In this study, patients aged 3 to 18 years were randomly assigned to either the olanzapine group or the placebo group. All patients received intravenous ondansetron and dexamethasone 30 minutes before highly emetogenic chemotherapy, followed by oral ondansetron for 48 hours. Participants in the olanzapine group received olanzapine once daily on days 1 and 2, while those in the control group received a placebo in the same dosage and schedule. The primary objective was: (a) to compare the complete control rates of vomiting in the delayed phase and (b) to compare the complete control rates of vomiting in acute and overall phases. The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety of olanzapine and the need for rescue medications. Results: A total of 128 patients were randomly assigned either to the olanzapine group (n=63) or the control group (n=65). Complete control of vomiting between olanzapine and placebo group was 73% versus 48% (P=0.005) in the delayed phase, 60% versus 54% (P=0.46) in the acute phase, and 48% versus 34% (P=0.117) in the overall phase, respectively. Grades 1 and 2 sedation was greater in the olanzapine group (46% vs. 14%; P<0.001). A significantly higher proportion of patients in the placebo group required rescue medications for vomiting compared with in the olanzapine group (P=0.025). Conclusions: Olanzapine significantly improved complete control of vomiting in the delayed phase. A considerably lesser proportion of patients in the olanzapine group needed rescue medications.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether simulation based education (SBE) improves the practices and knowledge of junior residents for stabilization of a preterm neonate in delivery room as compared to conventional education (CE). Methods: This trial randomized 24 pediatric residents to either SBE (n=12) or CE (n=12) groups. One-time SBE was imparted to the SBE group. Both the groups had similar facilitator participant ratio and equally timed sessions. The individual skills scores and performance by preterm stabilization performance evaluation (PSPE) score in real time were recorded using a validated tool within 8 weeks of the training. Knowledge gain was evaluated using pre and post-test scores. Results: The mean (SD) skill and PSPE scores were comparable between the two groups (skill score 51.1 (8.1), 46.5 (7.8), respectively mean difference 4.6; 95% CI-2.1 to 11.3; PSPE-score 80.2 (14.2) vs. 82.9 (10.3); mean difference-2.68; 95% CI-8.35 to 13.71). The mean (SD) knowledge gain was similar in the groups [4.4 (1.9), 5.3 (4.1); mean difference 0.91; 95% CI,-1.81 to 3.64. Conclusion: In junior residents, a one-time SBE session, when compared to conventional task training, did not lead to improvement in the performance of the initial steps of neonatal resuscitation.

AB  - An assemblage nexus of microorganisms enclosed in a composite extracellular polymeric matrix is called as a biofilm. The main factor causing biological fouling, or biofouling, is biofilms. Biofilm-mediated biofouling is a significant detrimental issue in several industries, including the maritime environment, industrial facilities, water treatment facilities, and medical implants. Conventional antibacterial remedies cannot wholly eradicate bacterial species owing to the structural rigidity of biofilm and the eventual growth of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Consequently, several approaches to disrupt the biofilm have been investigated to address this particular phenomenon. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have emerged as a promising contender in this category, offering several advantages over traditional solutions, including broad-spectrum action and lack of antibiotic resistance. Because biofouling significantly impacts the marine industry, AMPs derived from marine sources may be suitable natural inhibitors of bacterial proliferation. In this article, we discuss the range of physicochemical and structural diversity and the model of action seen in marine AMPs. This makes them an appealing strategy to mitigate biofilm and biofilm-mediated biofouling. This review also systematically summarizes recent research on marine AMPs from vertebrates and invertebrates and their industrial significance, shedding light on developing even better anti-biofouling materials shortly.

AB  - Cancer is the utmost common disease-causing death worldwide, characterized by uncontrollable cell division with the potential of metastasis. Overexpression of the Inhibitors of Apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and autophagy correlates with tumorigenesis, therapeutic resistance, and reoccurrence after anticancer therapies. This study illuminates the role and efficacy of smac mimetic compound BV6 alone and in co-treatment with death ligands such as TRAIL and TNF alpha in the regulation of cell death mechanisms, i.e., apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, MTT assays, wound healing assays, and cellular and nuclear morphological studies were done. DAPI staining, AO/EtBr staining and AnnexinV/PI FACS was done to study the apoptosis. The expression of IAPs and autophagy biomarkers was analyzed using Real time-PCR and western blotting. Meanwhile, TEM demonstrated autophagy and cellular autophagic vacuoles in response to the BV6. The result shows a promising anti-cancer effect of BV6 alone as well as in combinational treatment with TRAIL and TNF alpha, compared to the lone treatment of TRAIL and TNF alpha in both breast cancer cell lines. The smac mimetic compound might provide an alternative combinational therapy with conventional anticancer therapies to tackle their inefficiency at the advanced stage of cancer, cancer resistance, and reoccurrence. Also, IAPs and autophagic proteins could act as potent target molecules for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs in pathogenesis and the betterment of regimens for cancer.

AB  - Systems genetics is key for integrating a large number of variants associated with diseases. Vitamin K (VK) is one of the scarcely studied disease conditions. In this work, we ascertained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and variants associated with individual subpopulations of VK disease phenotypes, viz., myocardial infarction, renal failure and prostate cancer. We sought to ask whether or not any DEGs harbor pathogenic variants common in these conditions, attempt to bridge the gap in finding characteristic biomarkers and discuss the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the biogenesis of VK deficiencies.

AB  - Background Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with gastrocnemius muscle abnormalities. However, the biological pathways associated with gastrocnemius muscle dysfunction and their associations with progression of PAD are largely unknown. This study characterized differential gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression in gastrocnemius biopsies from people without PAD compared with those with PAD. Participants with PAD included those with and without PAD progression. Methods and Results mRNA and miRNA sequencing were performed to identify differentially expressed genes, differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNA-miRNA interactions, and associated biological pathways for 3 sets of comparisons: (1) PAD progression (n=7) versus non-PAD (n=7); (2) PAD no progression (n=6) versus non-PAD; and (3) PAD progression versus PAD no progression. Immunohistochemistry was performed to determine gastrocnemius muscle fiber types and muscle fiber size. Differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNAs were more abundant in the comparison of PAD progression versus non-PAD compared with PAD with versus without progression. Among the top significant cellular pathways in subjects with PAD progression were muscle contraction or development, transforming growth factor-beta, growth/differentiation factor, and activin signaling, inflammation, cellular senescence, and notch signaling. Subjects with PAD progression had increased frequency of smaller Type 2a gastrocnemius muscle fibers in exploratory analyses. Conclusions Humans with PAD progression exhibited greater differences in the number of gene and miRNA expression, biological pathways, and Type 2a muscle fiber size compared with those without PAD. Fewer differences were observed between people with PAD without progression and control patients without PAD. Further study is needed to confirm whether the identified transcripts may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and progression of PAD.

AB  - Background and Purpose Autoimmune encephalitis (AIE) following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an underexplored condition. This study aims to systematically review the clinico-investigational and pathophysiologic aspects of COVID-19 and its vaccines in association with AIE, and identify the factors predicting neurological severity and outcomes.
   Methods Relevant data sources were searched using appropriate search terms on January 15, 2022. Studies meeting the criteria for AIE having a temporal association with COVID-19 or its vaccines were included.
   Results Out of 1,894 citations, we included 61 articles comprising 88 cases: 71 of COVID19-associated AIE, 3 of possible Bickerstaff encephalitis, and 14 of vaccine-associated AIE. There were 23 definite and 48 possible seronegative AIE cases. Anti-NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor; n=12, 16.9%) was the most common definite AIE. Males were more commonly affected (sex ratio=1.63) in the AIE subgroup. The neurological symptoms included alteredmental state (n=53, 74.6%), movement disorders (n=28, 39.4%), seizures (n=24, 33.8%), behavioural (n=25, 35.2%), and speech disturbances (n=17, 23.9%). The median latency to AIE diagnosis was 14 days (interquartile range=4-22 days). Female sex and ICU admission had higherrisks of sequelae, with odds ratio (OR) of 2.925 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.005-8.516) and 3.515 (95% CI=1.160-10.650), respectively. Good immunotherapy response was seen in42/ 48 (87.5%) and 13/13 (100%) of COVID-19-associated and vaccine-associated AIE patients, respectively. Sequelae were reported in 22/60 (36.7%) COVID-19 associated and 10/13 (76.9%) vaccine-associated cases.
   Conclusions The study has revealed diagnostic, therapeutic, and pathophysiological aspects of AIE associated with COVID-19 and its vaccines, and its differences from postinfectious AIE.

AB  - Objective: To compare efficacy and safety of Intranasal and Intramuscular routes of midazolam administration in terminating seizures.Method: This was an open label Randomized controlled trial (RCT). People with drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) undergoing Video Electroencephalogram (VEEG) monitoring, were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Intranasal (IN) or Intramuscular (IM) midazolam, for prolonged seizures: longer than 5 min for focal, and longer than 2 min for focal to bilateral tonic-clonic. Outcome assessor was blinded to the allocation arm. Primary outcome was time to electrographic seizure termination after administration of midazolam. All adverse events in both the groups were noted. Result: A total of 1108 seizures were recorded in 130 subjects, of which 110 (65 seizures in 23 subjects in IN group; 45 seizures in 18 subjects in IM group) seizures required midazolam administration and were included in final analysis. Mean time to electrographic seizure termination after midazolam administration was 45.1 +/- 23.8 s in the IM group and 90.4 +/- 59.0 s in the IN group (p = 0.0014); mean time to clinical seizure termination was 53.9 +/- 25.8 s in IM group and 104.3 +/- 66.4 s in the IN group (p = 0.002). Local side effects were more in IN group; hypotension as serious adverse event was noted in the IM group.Significance: Though mean time to electrographic and clinical seizure termination was significantly lesser in Intramuscular group for both adults and pediatric population, it was still under 2 min in the Intranasal mid-azolam group.IN midazolam is a useful option for terminating seizures.

AB  - Background and Purpose: We aimed to explore the characteristics, clinical features, predictors of seizure, and associated clinical outcomes in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). Methods: We enrolled patients with CVT from January 2014 to July 2020. Prospectively patients were recruited from December 2018. We analyzed predictors of seizures and associated good functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, mRS: 0-2) using multivariable logistic regression. Results: We enrolled 153 patients with CVT in which 77 (50%) had presented with a seizure. The median age was 31 years (IQR 16-46), and the majority were men (73.2%). Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic was the most common seizure type (27%), followed by generalized seizures (22%). None of the patients had status epilepticus. Antiseizure medications (ASM) were used in 71% of patients at diagnosis, 42% having received them prophylactically. Supratentorial parenchymal involvement was seen in 72% of seizure patients compared to 38% in those without, and superior sagittal sinus was most commonly involved. Percentage of patients who achieved good clinical outcome (mRS 0-2) at 3 months did not vary significantly between both groups. The only predictor for seizures with CVT was the presence of a parenchymal lesion (OR-3.75, 95% CI 1.79-7.85), whereas seizure occurrence (OR- 12.55, 95% CI- 1.53-102.59) was associated with statistically significant risk for recurrent seizures, by multiple logistic regression analysis. Seizure occurrence was not associated with adverse functional outcomes. Conclusion: Seizures at presentation occurred in 50% of patients with CVT which was associated with a parenchymal lesion in the brain. There was no association between seizure at presentation and clinical outcome.

AB  - Background and Objectives: While laparoscopic appendectomy is standardized, techniques for appendiceal stump closure and mesoappendix division remain variable. Novel vessel sealing techniques are increasingly utilized ubiquitously. We sought to systematically summarize all relevant data and to define the current evidence on the safety and utility of energy devices for clipless-sutureless laparoscopic appendectomy in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and Methods: This review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria included studies with laparoscopic appendectomy for appendicitis. The intervention included patients undergoing division of mesoappendix and/or securing of the appendicular base using diathermy (Monopolar or Bipolar or LigaSure Sealing Device) or Harmonic Scalpel (Group A) compared to patients undergoing division of mesoappendix and/or securing of the appendicular base using endoclip or Hem-o-lok or ligature (Group B). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. The outcomes of surgical site infection (SSI) or intra-abdominal collection, postoperative ileus, average operative duration, and length of hospital stay (LHS) were compared. Results: Six comparative studies were included; three were retrospective, two were prospective, and one was ambispective. Meta-analysis revealed a shorter operative duration in Group A with respect to appendicular base ligation (MD -12.34, 95% CI -16.57 to -8.11, p < 0.00001) and mesoappendix division (MD -8.06, 95% CI -14.03 to -2.09, p = 0.008). The pooled risk ratios showed no difference in SSI between groups. Additionally, no difference was observed in LHS. The risk of postoperative ileus was higher in group B regarding mesoappendix division (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.93, p = 0.02), but no difference was found concerning appendicular base ligation. The included studies showed a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Conclusions: Clipless-sutureless laparoscopic appendectomy is safe and fast. Postoperative ileus seems less common with energy devices for mesoappendix division. However, the studies included have a moderate-to-high risk of bias. Further studies addressing the individual devices with surgeons of similar levels are needed.

AB  - Pregnancy in women with bipolar disorder (BD) can be considered a high-risk pregnancy in view of several clinical and pharmacotherapeutic considerations. Pharmacological treatment during pregnancy requires a careful weighing of psychotropic drug exposure against the risk of BD relapse. An untreated bipolar illness can negatively affect the health of mother as well as unborn child in the event of a relapse. Availability of well balanced, latest information on safety of prophylactic drugs for BD is crucial for making informed decisions. The review provides an evidence-based update (2015-2021) on the drug safety considerations involved in providing care for women with BD who are either pregnant or planning to conceive in near future. Literature review based on systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and data available from studies based on large-scale cohorts and birth registries has been synthesized and presented along with clinically relevant recommendations.

AB  - Simple Summary The article "Immunology of Oral Cancer-A comprehensive insight with Recent Concepts" highlights the significance of the immune system and immune regulation in treating oral cancer effectively. The article outlines the importance of the fundamentals of immunomodulatory mechanisms and immunoediting in oral cancer. The research work provides substantial evidence that novel technologies have revolutionized oral cancer management in the present era. This review aims to understand the concept of oral cancer immunology through the notion of immune profiling, immunoediting and immunotherapy, and to gain knowledge regarding its application for the management of oral cancer patients. Oral cancer is an immunogenic tumor where the cells of the tumor microenvironment play an important role in tumorigenesis. Understanding the mechanism of these modulations can help design immunotherapeutic strategies in oral cancer patients. This article gives an overview of immunomodulation in the oral cancer tumor microenvironment, with concepts of immune profiling, immunoediting and immunotherapy. English literature searches via Google Scholar, Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, and PubMed database were performed with the key words immunology, tumor microenvironment, cells, cross talk, immune profiling, biomarkers, inflammation, gene expression, techniques, immunoediting, immunosurveillance, tumor escape, immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines in cancer, oral cancer, and head and neck cancer. Original research articles, reviews, and case reports published from 2016-2021 (n = 81) were included to appraise different topics, and were discussed under the following subsections. Literature published on oral cancer immunology reveals that oral cancer immune profiling with appropriate markers and techniques and knowledge on immunoediting concepts can help design and play an effective role in immunotherapeutic management of oral cancer patients. An evaluation of oral cancer immunology helps to determine its role in tumorigenesis, and immunotherapy could be the emerging drift in the effective management of oral cancer.

AB  - Purpose of review
   Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex disease that poses significant economic, and psychological burden on patients. Despite advent of newer biologics and small molecules targeting different aspects of immunopathogenesis, there appears to be a plateau in clinical outcomes. In this review we discuss the role of multiple biologics, existing evidence and various considerations when prescribing multiple biologics.
   Recent findings
   Recent scientific advances helped to unravel the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease and newer cytokines have been identified which can be potential targets in the management of IBD. Targeting more than one cytokine appears to be logical solution to break the therapeutic ceiling to improve clinical outcomes in IBD. The combination biologics appear safe and effective; however, the available evidence is limited. Refractory IBD, presence of other immune mediated inflammatory diseases and extra intestinal manifestations are currently the common considerations of combination biologics in IBD.
   Summary
   Inflammatory bowel disease is a complex immune mediated disease with diverse clinical presentation and often has a complicated clinical course requiring multidisciplinary management. As the number of targeted therapies increases so does the concern on their safety and efficacy. Combination biologics though may appear to be safe, we need well designed prospective studies for firm conclusions.

AB  - Dengue fever is one of the significant fatal mosquito-borne viral diseases and is considered to be a worldwide problem. Aedes mosquito is responsible for transmitting various serotypes of dengue viruses to humans. Dengue incidence has developed prominently throughout the world in the last ten years. The exact number of dengue cases is underestimated, whereas plenty of cases are misdiagnosed as alternative febrile sicknesses. There is an estimation that about 390 million dengue cases occur annually. Dengue fever encompasses a wide range of clinical presentations, usually with undefinable clinical progression and outcome. The diagnosis of dengue depends on serology tests, molecular diagnostic methods, and antigen detection tests. The therapeutic approach relies completely on supplemental drugs, which is far from the real approach. Vaccines for dengue disease are in various stages of development. The commercial formulation Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) is accessible and developed by Sanofi Pasteur. The vaccine candidate Dengvaxia was inefficient in liberating a stabilized immune reaction toward different serotypes (1-4) of dengue fever. Numerous promising vaccine candidates are now being developed in preclinical and clinical stages even though different serotypes of DENV exist that worsen the situation for a vaccine to be equally effective for all serotypes. Thus, the development of an efficient dengue fever vaccine candidate requires time. Effective dengue fever management can be a multidisciplinary challenge, involving international cooperation from diverse perspectives and expertise to resolve this global concern.

AB  - Any interference in the timely and orderly progression through all the phases of healing process can turn a minor injury into a chronic wound. Most of the wound dressings available in the market are moderately effective and have not shown satisfactory improvement in healing. Along with the appropriate wound management, it is imperative for a dressing to facilitate the wound repair process too. In the present research, we hypothesize to improve the wound healing process by applying cost effective natural cocktail of various bioactive factors. Bovine colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, hormones and cytokines which play significant role in wound healing. Hence, multifunctional colostrum conjugated PCL-PEG based nanofibrous dressings were developed and analyzed for their physicochemical properties and cellular responses. The dress-ings were also evaluated for cell migration, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. In-vivo wound healing ability was validated on a rat wound model. Numerous growth factors present in the colostrum showed their role in stimulation of skin repair and regeneration by direct action on genetic material. Significantly less inflammation in colostrum treated wounds was observed due to anti-inflammatory properties of lactoferrin. Thus obtained results confirmed the suitability of these multifunctional colostrum conjugated nanofibrous dressings for improved wound healing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A novel agar-based phantom was developed and assessed for ultrasonography (USG)-guided brain bi-opsy training. The phantom provides visual cues combined with sonologic cues, allowing multimodal training. Impact of multimodal training is evaluated through pretraining and posttraining trials.METHODS: Twenty-five participants were divided based on experience with USG-based procedures into familiar (double dagger 3 procedures performed in the past) (n = 14) and unfa-miliar (<3 procedures performed) (n = 11). Agar phantoms with an opaque top and transparent middle layer were constructed in transparent glass bowls, each having 12 embedded targets. Participants underwent 2 supervised trials of USG-guided biopsy with aluminum foil covering the glass bowls, eliminating visual cues. Between 2 trials, participants underwent unsupervised self-training on a phantom without foil cover, providing visual cues. Perfor-mance was measured through insonation efficiency (EfI), biopsy efficiency (EfB), efficiency score (Ef), error score (Er), and performance score (PS). Scores were compared between and within the 2 groups before and after training. Impact of the self-training session on subjective comfort levels with the procedure was assessed through feedback forms.RESULTS: Familiars had better pretraining EfB, Ef, Er, and PS (P < 0.001) compared with unfamiliars. After training, both performed similarly on all metrics. After training, fa-miliars improved only in EfI (P = 0.001), with the un-familiars showing significance in all metrics except EfI.CONCLUSIONS: Simulation and phantom-based models can never supplant training through supervised skill application in vivo but our model supplements training by enabling technical skill acquisition, especially for begin-ners in USG-guided brain biopsy.

AB  - Introduction: and objective: Tremor is a disabling symptom of PD that usually responds poorly to available standard pharmacological agents. This study aimed to assess the effect of Zonisamide 25 mg on tremor in tremor -dominant PD patients as compared to placebo. Methods: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Parkinson's disease patients were allocated either to the intervention group (standard treatment along with Zonisamide 25 mg add-on) or the placebo group (standard treatment along with placebo). Baseline Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Scale (TETRAS) scores, as well as accelerometric tremor analysis were done and follow-up assessments of the same were done after 12 weeks of intervention. Percentage change from baseline in the UPDRS tremor score was the primary outcome whereas percentage change from baseline of total UPDRS score, UPDRS rigidity and bradykinesia scores, TETRAS score, and accel-erometric tremor analysis values were the secondary outcomes.Results: There was no significant difference in the percentage change from baseline UPDRS tremor scores between the two groups (placebo: 8.33 [-19.89-23.86] vs drug: 26.14 [-35.58 to-16.07], p-value: 0.164, CI: 0.157-0.171). Best-case analysis for missing values showed a significant improvement in the drug group, compared to the placebo group (p-value: < 0.001, CI: <0.001 -<0.001).Conclusion: Zonisamide at a dose of 25 mg per day did not improve tremor in tremor-dominant PD patients, however, a positive trend was seen as compared to Placebo in the UPDRS tremor score. Larger studies are required to confirm this finding.

AB  - Human Aurora kinase A (AurA) has recently garnered the attention of researchers worldwide as a promising effective mitotic drug target for its involvement in cancer and related inflammatory anomalies. This study has explored the binding affinity of newly identified heteroarene-fused anthraquinone derivatives against AurA. Molecular docking analyses showed that all the heteroanthraquinone compounds bind to AurA with different affinities. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that the compounds maintained relatively stable binding modes in the active site pocket while inducing minimal conformational changes in the AurA structure, interacting with key residues through several noncovalent interactions, including hydrogen bonds. Fluorescence spectroscopy and biolayer interferometry binding assays with synthesized compounds against recombinantly expressed AurA further verified their binding efficacy. Naphthoisatine 3 proved to be the best binder, with compounds anthraimidazole 5 and anthrathiophene 2 showing comparable results. Overall, this study indicates decent binding of heterocyclic derivatives of anthraquinone with the target AurA, which can further be assessed by performing enzymatic assays and cellular studies. The studies also highlight the applicability of the heteroarene-fused anthraquinone scaffold to construct selective and potent inhibitors of Aurora kinases after necessary structural modifications for the development of new anticancer drugs.

AB  - Background The global burden of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) and corresponding risk factors in children older than 5 years and adults has not been studied as comprehensively as it has been in children younger than 5 years. We assessed the burden and trends of LRIs and risk factors across a groups by sex, for 204 countries and territories.
   Methods In this analysis of data for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we used dinician-diagnosed pneumonia or bronchiolitis as our case definition for LRIs. We included International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes 079.6, 466-469, 470.0, 480-482.8, 483.0-483.9, 484.1-484.2, 484.6-484.7, and 487-489 and International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes A48.1, A70, B97.4 B97.6, 109-115.8, J16 J16.9, J20-121.9, J91.0, P23.0 P23.4, and U04 U04.9. We used the Cause of Death Ensemble modelling strategy to analyse 23109 site-years of vital r *stration data, 825 site-years of sample vital registration data, 1766 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 681 site-years of mortality surveillance data. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian metaregression tool, to analyse age sex-specific incidence and prevalence data identified via systematic reviews of the literature, population-based survey data, and daims and inpatient data. Additio y, we estimated age sex-specific LRI mortality that is attributable to the independent effects of 14 risk factors.
   Findings Globally, in 2019, we estimated that there were 257 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 240-275) LRI incident episodes in males and 232 million (217-248) in females. In the same year, LRIs accounted for 1.30 million (95% UI 1.18-1.42) male deaths and 1.20 million (1.07-1.33) female deaths. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were 1.17 times (95% UI 1.16-1.18) and 1.31 times (95% UI 1.23-1.41) greater in males than in fe es in 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, LRI incidence and mortality rates declined at different rates across age groups and an increase in LRI episodes and deaths was estimated among all adult age groups, with males aged 70 years and older having the highest increase in LRI episodes (126.0% [95% UI 121.4-131.1]) and deaths (100.0% [83.4-115.9]). During the same period, LRI episodes and deaths in children younger than 15 years were estimated to have decreased, and the greatest dedine was observed for LRI deaths in males younger than 5 years (-70.7% [-77.2 to 61.8]). The leading risk factors for LRI mortality varied across age groups and sex. More than half of global LRI deaths in children younger than 5 years were attributable to child wasting (population attributable fraction [PAF] 53.0% [95% UI 37.7-61.8] in males and 56.4% [40.7-65.1] in females), and more than a quarter of LRI deaths among those aged 5-14 years were attributable to household air pollution (PAF 26.0% [95% UI 16.6-35.5] for males and PAF 25.8% [16.3-35.4] for females). PAFs of male LRI deaths attributed to smoking were 20.4% (95% UI 15.4-25.2) in those aged 15-49 years, 305% (24.1-36. 9) in those aged 50-69 years, and 21.9% (16. 8-27. 3) in those aged 70 years and older. PAFs of female LRI deaths attributed to household air pollution were 21.1% (95% UI 14.5-27.9) in those aged 15-49 years and 18 " 2% (12.5-24.5) in those aged 50-69 years. For females aged 70 years and older, the leading risk factor, ambient particulate matter, was responsible for 11-7% (95% UI 8.2-15.8) of LRI deaths.
   Interpretation The patterns and progress in reducing the burden of LRIs and key risk factors for mortality varied across age groups and sexes. The progress seen in children you - than 5 years was dearly a result of targeted interventions, such as vaccination and reduction of exposure to risk factors. Similar interventions for other age groups could contribute to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals targets, induding promoting wellbeing at all ages and reducing health inequalities. Interventions, including addressing risk factors such as child wasting, smoking, ambient particulate matter pollution, and household air pollution, would prevent deaths and reduce health disparities.

AB  - Over the recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been progressing rapidly with its ability to mimic human cognitive functions. The potential applications of AI technology in diagnosis, treatment planning, and prog-nosis prediction have been demonstrated in various studies. The present scoping review aimed to provide an overview of AI and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and their applications in orthognathic surgery. A com-prehensive search was conducted in databases including PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and OVID Medline until November 2021. This scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 19 studies were included for final review. AI has profoundly impacted the diagnosis and prediction of orthognathic surgeries with a clinically acceptable accu-racy range. Furthermore, AI reduces the work burden of the clinician by eliminating the tedious registration procedures, thereby helping in efficient and automated planning. However, focussing on the research gaps, there is a need to foster the AI models/algorithms to contemporize their efficiency in clinical decision making, diagnosis and surgical planning in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Clinical trials evaluating biologics and small molecules in patients with ulcerative colitis are predominantly excluding ulcerative proctitis. The objective of the Definition and endpoints for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs initiative was to develop consensus statements for definitions, inclusion criteria, and endpoints for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis in adults.
   METHODS: Thirty-five international experts held a consensus meeting to define ulcerative proctitis, and the endpoints to use in clinical trials. Based on a systematic review of the literature, statements were generated, discussed, and approved by the working group participants using a modified Delphi method. Consensus was defined as at least 75% agreement among voters.
   RESULTS: The group agreed that the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis should be made by ileocolonoscopy and confirmed by histopathology, with the exclusion of infections, drug-induced causes, radiation, trauma, and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative proctitis was defined as macroscopic extent of lesions limited to 15 cm distance from the anal verge in adults. Primary and secondary endpoints were identified to capture response of ulcerative proctitis to therapy. A combined clinical and endoscopic primary endpoint for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis disease activity was proposed. Secondary endpoints that should be evaluated include endoscopic remission, histologic remission, mucosal healing, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, disability, fecal incontinence, urgency, constipation, and health-related quality of life.
   CONCLUSIONS: In response to the need for guidance on the design of clinical trials in patients with ulcerative proctitis, the Definition and end points for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs consensus provides recommendations on the definition and endpoints for ulcerative proctitis clinical trials.

AB  - Background In India, the prevalence of overweight among adolescents is on the rise, setting the stage for an increase in metabolic syndrome (MS). This paper presents the national prevalence of MS in adolescents in India. Methods A nationally representative data of adolescents (10-19 years) from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey was used. MS was defined based on the NCEP-ATP III criteria for adolescents. Bivariate analysis was used to report socio-demographic differentials in prevalence and to assess interstate variability. Multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to measure the association between socio-demographic characteristics and prevalence of MS. Census data from 2011 was projected to 2017 to calculate burden. Results The prevalence of MS was 5.2% among adolescents. 11.9%, 15.4%, 26.0%, 31.9% and 3.7% had central obesity, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-cholesterol and high fasting glucose, respectively. The prevalence was higher among males (5.7% vs. 4.7%, adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.3, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0, 1.6), those residing in urban areas (7.9% vs 4.2%, AOR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.8), and from wealthier households as compared to their counterparts (8.3% vs. 2.4%, AOR: 3.4, 95% CI: 2.1, 5.5). There was wide interstate variability in the prevalence of MS (0.5% - 16.5%). In 2017, 14.2 million adolescents had MS in India. Conclusions The prevalence of MS among adolescents in India is low and clustered in urban areas and richer households. Early prevention interventions promoting a healthy lifestyle, especially in high prevalence areas, are needed to keep MS from becoming a public health issue.

AB  - The transplacental route of vertical transmission of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) has been known for over a decade. Here we present evidence which suggest HBV can replicate in placenta. Forty-one HBsAg positive and 10 control pregnant women were enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent. HBV positives were further divided in the High Viral Load (HVL) Group and Low Viral Load (LVL) Group according to INASL guidelines 2018. The Presence of the HBV DNA and expression of NTCP in the placenta was analyzed by qPCR/RT-qPCR and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). The presence of cccDNA was assessed using Digital Droplet PCR while the presence of pre-genomic (pg) RNA was assessed through qRT-PCR and sequencing. The presence of HBeAg and HBcAg in the placenta was assessed by IHC. Immunostaining of NTCP, HBeAg and HBcAg on trophoblasts along with the presence of total HBV DNA, cccDNA and pgRNA indicated, that these cells are not only susceptible to HBV infection but may also support viral replication. This is further supported by the finding that trophoblasts of the several HBeAg seronegative samples harbored the HBeAg. Although, we did not find any correlation in NTCP expression and viral markers with viral load indicates placental replication may not aping hepatocytes. The presence of the HBV receptor, NTCP along with the presence of cccDNA, pgRNA, and HBeAg in placenta of HBV infected females without circulating HBeAg suggest that placenta act as a replication host.

AB  - The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) represents a focused update of the KDIGO 2020 guideline on the topic. The guideline targets a broad audience of clinicians treating diabetes and CKD. Topic areas for which recommendations are updated include: Chapter 1: Comprehensive care in patients with diabetes and CKD and Chapter 4: Glucose-lowering therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CKD. Previous chapters on Glycemic monitoring and targets in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 2), Lifestyle interventions in patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 3), and Approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD (Chapter 5) have been deemed current and their content has remained unchanged. Development of this guideline update followed an explicit process of evidence review and appraisal. Treatment approaches and guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies, and appraisal of the quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations followed the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. Limitations of the evidence are discussed and areas of future research are also presented.

AB  - Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the effects of mono-, bi-, and polytherapy anti-seizure medications (ASMs) in terms of seizure reduction and quality of life (QOL) in persons with epilepsy (PWE). Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted. All PWE with age <75 years were recruited and further classified into two groups: responders and non-responders, based on the response of the ASMs to the treatments for reduced seizure frequency since the last one year. Other demographic and clinical data such as seizure frequency, type of seizures, age at onset of seizures, and information about ASMs with their daily doses were assessed for the descriptive analysis. The quality of life was assessed in randomly selected PWE (n = 100) using the quality of life in epilepsy inventory-31 (QOLIE-31) in adults.
   Results: With a total of 486 PWE, the median age (years) was comparable in both groups. Out of these the nonresponders group was found to be significantly higher (77.8%) than the responders group (22.2%). In the responders group, the percentage of PWE who were on monotherapy was significantly higher (51.85 %) than those who were on polytherapy (17.59%), whereas in the non-responders group, 21.16% of PWE were on monotherapy and 44.86% were on polytherapy. The duration of epilepsy was similar in both groups, but the average seizure frequency was significantly higher in the non-responders. In QOL assessments, 43% of PWE were observed in the responders group, whereas 57% of PWE were found in the non-responders group. The overall comparative QOL scores were also significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the responders group as compared to the non-responders group.
   Conclusion: Our findings revealed that those PWE who were on monotherapy showed better reduction in seizure frequency and improved QOL in responder groups as compared to non-responder groups.

AB  - Objectives: We assessed and correlated neurochemical levels and cognitive functions in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left hippocampus in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and compared these with healthy controlsMethodology: Twenty-five right-handed euthymic patients (HAM-D score < 7, and YMRS score < 7) with bipolar disorder and 20 age and gender matched controls were compared for neurometabolites (n-acetylaspartate - tNAA, choline - Cho, creatinine - Cr, myoinositol - Ins, and glutamine/glutamate - Glu/Gln) measured in left DLPFC and left hippocampus using single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and cognitive functions assessed using trail making test (TMT - A and B), wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), and wechsler memory scale (WMS-III Indian adaptation).Results: The two groups were comparable on socio-demographic variables. tNAA levels in DLPFC and hippo -campus, and glutamate levels in hippocampus were found to be significantly lower and Inositol and glutamine levels in hippocampus were found to be significantly higher in patients as compared to controls. Patients per-formed significantly poorly as compared to controls on TMT A & B, all subscales of WMS - III, 5 subscales of WCST, including perseverative responses and errors. The tNAA and glutamate levels in left DLPFC in patients correlated with scores on TMT A & B, and several subscales of WCST and WMS-III. tNAA concentration in left hippocampus in patients correlated with scores on subscales of WMS-III.Conclusion: Neurochemical dysfunction in select brain areas directly correlates with impairment in cognitive functions seen in patients with bipolar disorder in euthymic phase.

AB  - The persistent infection of high-risk Human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) induced cervical cancer remains a challenge in women worldwide including India. Recent advances in cancer research have paved the way for advanced cancer treatment modalities including immunotherapy by manipulating the function or number of cytotoxic T cells. It is well established that anaphylatoxins like C3a and C5a of complement system influence tumor growth by evading apoptosis leading to progression of cancer. The role of the complement system, particularly the complement regulatory proteins (CRPs) which are important determinants of immune response play a crucial role in carcinogenesis. In a tumor microenvironment (TME) assisted suppression of immune effector cells may be achieved through CRPs. However, recent advances in pharmacogenomics including drug designing and combination of these approaches have provided a holistic understanding of signaling pathways and their crosstalk, to regulate cellular communications.This review describes the role of complement system; particularly CRPs in HPV induced cervical carcinogenesis which may be used for designing anti- HPV or cervical cancer therapeutics.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in computational psychiatry have identified latent cognitive and perceptual states that predispose to psychotic symptoms. Behavioral data fit to Bayesian models have demonstrated an overreliance on priors (i.e., prior overweighting) during perception in select samples of individuals with hallucinations, corre-sponding to increased precision of prior expectations over incoming sensory evidence. However, the clinical utility of this observation depends on the extent to which it reflects static symptom risk or current symptom state.METHODS: To determine whether task performance and estimated prior weighting relate to specific elements of symptom expression, a large, heterogeneous, and deeply phenotyped sample of hallucinators (n = 249) and non -hallucinators (n = 209) performed the conditioned hallucination (CH) task.RESULTS: We found that CH rates predicted stable measures of hallucination status (i.e., peak frequency). However, CH rates were more sensitive to hallucination state (i.e., recent frequency), significantly correlating with recent hallucination severity and driven by heightened reliance on past experiences (priors). To further test the sensitivity of CH rate and prior weighting to symptom severity, a subset of participants with hallucinations (n = 40) performed a repeated-measures version of the CH task. Changes in both CH frequency and prior weighting varied with changes in auditory hallucination frequency on follow-up.CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CH rate and prior overweighting are state markers of hallucination status, potentially useful in tracking disease development and treatment response.

AB  - Management of locally advanced cervix cancer underwent major change 2 decades back when concurrent chemotherapy (CCRT) (with cisplatin alone or in combination) along with definite radiation therapy (ex-ternal + brachytherapy) was found to be superior compared to radiation alone in a series of randomized trials. Since then CCRT has been the standard treatment approach; this has resulted in 5-year overall sur-vival rate of 66% and disease-free survival (DFS) of 58%. About 30% to 40% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer continue to have treatment failure. Also, some patients experience early and late side effects of treatment with negative impact on quality of life. To improve the outcome further - recent approaches have explored use of weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin for 4 to 6 weeks as dose dense chemotherapy prior to CCRT, adjuvant chemotherapy after CCRT in high risk patients. For patients with early stage disease (IA2-IIA), short course chemotherapy prior to surgery is associated with improved outcome in many studies. Bevacizumab-an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor - is associated with improved survival. More recently, addition of treatment with immune check inhibitors (to boost the ability of T cells to destroy cancer cells) have improved responses and survival in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer. Whether these and other similar novel agents targeting molecular pathways could be brought in front line treatment along with cytotoxic chemotherapy along with bevacizumab are potential areas of current research.

T2  - PROGRESS IN TRANSPLANTATION

KW  - sarcopenia
KW  - living donor liver transplantation
AB  - Introduction The effect of sarcopenia, malnutrition, and functional status on immediate post liver transplantation outcome is not well established. Most studies on sarcopenia are related to 1 and 3-year mortality. Studies evaluating the effect of malnutrition are at least a decade old. Project Aims We evaluated the effect of preoperative sarcopenia, malnutrition, and functional status on postoperative length of hospital and ICU stay, incidence of complications, and mortality. Design In this prospective study conducted on living donor liver transplant recipients, sarcopenia and malnutrition were identified using the psoas muscle thickness to height and the Royal Free Hospital- Nutritional Prioritizing Tool respectively. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score was noted. Postoperatively, length-of-hospital stay, ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and incidence of postoperative complications were noted. Results Hospital and ICU length of stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation were greater in sarcopenic versus non-sarcopenic patients (35.9 (14.6) versus 26.7 (10.7) days, P = 0.02; 12.9 (4.8) versus 9.6 (3.8) days, P = 0.02 and 8 [5,23] versus 5 [4,7] days, P = 0.01 respectively). The incidence of acute kidney injury was higher in patients with sarcopenia (53.3% vs 19.4%, P = 0.02). Patients with malnutrition and repeated hospitalizations had higher ICU stays but hospital length of stay duration of mechanical ventilation or the incidence of postoperative complications were not affected. The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score did not affect postoperative outcome. Conclusion In living donor liver transplant recipients, sarcopenia increased hospital and ICU stays, and duration of mechanical ventilation postoperatively. Malnutrition increased ICU stays.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of a probiotic strain Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 on gut microbiota and cy-tokines in IBD patients. Method: Patients were randomly allocated to either placebo or probiotic Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 for four weeks along with the standard medical treatment (SMT). Enrolled patients were evaluated before and after intervention for presence of the given probiotic, change in gut microbiota, change in serum cyto-kines, serotonin and dopamine, symptoms of disease, physical, behavioral and psychological parameters. Results: Probiotic strain Bacillus clausii UBBC-07 showed good survival in IBD patients in the treatment group (p < 0.01) without any reported adverse event. Metagenomic analysis showed that the given probiotic strain was able to modulate the gut microbiota in treated group. Phylum Firmicutes was increased and phylum Bacteroidetes was decreased in the probiotic treated group. A significant increase was observed in the abundance of anaerobic bacterial genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Faecali-bacterium in the probiotic treated group (p < 0.01) as compared to placebo group. Significant increase was observed in IL-10 (p < 0.05) and variable decrease in the secretion of IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-17 and IL-23 in probiotic treated group. In the treatment group a significant decrease in the symptoms of IBD and improvement in the psychological parameter to various degrees was noted. Conclusion: These results indicated that probiotic strain B clausii UBBC-07 affected the gut microbiota and cytokine secretion and shown efficacy in IBD patients. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Plain Language Summary The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been studied previously in several settings, including reducing childhood mortalities due to viral infections and induction of trained immunity and reducing upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in older adults. This multi-centre trial has tried to evaluate the efficacy of BCG revaccination in reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections in adults between 18 and 60 years of age belonging to the high-risk group owing to the presence of comorbidities including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease and chronic lung diseases. A single dose of BCG vaccine produced significantly high titres of BCG antibodies lasting for six months. While there was no significant reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 infection, there was an 8.4% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease at the end of 9 months of follow-up. In addition, there were significantly fewer severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospital stay and oxygen support. However, the overall numbers of severe COVID-19 infections were low. Thus, the study shows that BCG can protect against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 disease. However, it might not reduce the incidence of new infections. The study results are significant for low- and middle-income countries without adequate coverage of primary doses of COVID-19 vaccination, let alone the booster doses. Future studies should evaluate the BCG vaccine's efficacy as a booster compared with routine COVID-19 vaccine boosters.
   Introduction Universal coverage of vaccines alone cannot be relied upon to protect at-risk populations in lower- and middle-income countries against the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and newer variants. Live vaccines, including Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), are being studied for their effectiveness in reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection. Methods In this multi-centre quadruple-blind, parallel assignment randomised control trial, 495 high-risk group adults (aged 18-60 years) were randomised into BCG and placebo arms and followed up for 9 months from the date of vaccination. The primary outcome was the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 infection at the end of 9 months. Secondary outcomes included the difference in the incidence of severe COVID-19 infections, hospitalisation rates, intensive care unit stay, oxygen requirement and mortality at the end of 9 months. The primary analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis, while safety analysis was done per protocol. Results There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CB-NAAT) positive COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-2.14] in the two groups, but the BCG arm showed a statistically significant decrease in clinically diagnosed (symptomatic) probable COVID-19 infections (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.72). Compared with the BCG arm, significantly more patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia (CB-NAAT positive) and required hospitalisation and oxygen in the placebo arm (six versus none; p = 0.03). One patient belonging to the placebo arm required intensive care unit (ICU) stay and died. BCG had a protective efficacy of 62% (95% CI 28-80%) for likely symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Conclusions BCG is protective in reducing the incidence of acute respiratory illness (probable symptomatic COVID-19 infection) and severity of the disease, including hospitalisation, in patients belonging to the high-risk group of COVID-19 infection, and the antibody response persists for quite a long time. A multi-centre study with a larger sample size will help to confirm the findings in this study.

This study attempts to objectively analyze the medical oxygen supply chain in India along the principles of value stream mapping (VSM), identify bottlenecks, and recommend systemic improvements. Methods:Process mapping of the medical oxygen supply chain in India was done. Different licenses and approvals, their conditions, compliances, renewals, among others were factored in. All relevant circulars (Government Notices), official orders, amendments, and gazette notifications pertaining to medical oxygen from April 2020 to April 2021 were studied and corroborated with information from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) official website. Results:Steps of medical oxygen supply chain right from oxygen manufacture to filling, storage, and transport up to the end users; have regulatory bottlenecks. Consequently, flow of materials is sluggish and very poor information flow has aggravated the inherent inefficiencies of the system. Government of India has been loosening regulatory norms at every stage to alleviate the crisis. Conclusions:Regulatory bottlenecks have indirectly fueled the informal sector over the years, which is not under Government's control with difficulty in controlling black-marketing and hoarding. Technology enabled, data-driven regulatory processes with minimum discretionary human interface can make the system more resilient.

AB  - Background A high-fat diet (HFD) induced perturbation of gut microbiota is a major contributory factor to promote the pathophysiology of HFD-associated metabolic syndrome. The HFD could also increase the susceptibility to the microbial infections warranting the use of antibiotics which are independently capable of impacting both gut microbiota and metabolic syndrome. Further, the usage of antibiotics in individuals consuming HFD can impact mitochondrial function that can be associated with an elevated risk of chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Despite this high propensity to infections in individuals on HFD, the link between duration of HFD and antibiotic treatment, and its impact on diversity of the gut microbiome and features of metabolic syndrome is not well established. In this study, we have addressed these knowledge gaps by examining how the gut microbiota profile changes in HFD-fed mice receiving antibiotic intervention in the form of amoxicillin. We also determine whether antibiotic treatment in HFD-fed mice may adversely impact the ability of immune cells to clear microbial infections. Methods and Results We have subjected mice to HFD and chow diet (CD) for 3 weeks, and a subset of these mice on both diets received antibiotic intervention in the form of amoxicillin in the 3rd week. Body weight and food intake were recorded for 3 weeks. After 21 days, all animals were weighted and sacrificed. Subsequently, these animals were evaluated for basic haemato-biochemical and histopathological attributes. We used 16S rRNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analysis to determine changes in gut microbiota in these mice. We observed that a HFD, even for a short-duration, could successfully induce the partial pathophysiology typical of a metabolic syndrome, and substantially modulated the gut microbiota in mice. The short course of amoxicillin treatment to HFD-fed mice resulted in beneficial effects by significantly reducing fasting blood glucose and skewing the number of thrombocytes towards a normal range. Remarkably, we observed a significant remodelling of gut microbiota in amoxicillin-treated HFD-fed mice. Importantly, some gut microbes associated with improved insulin sensitivity and recovery from metabolic syndrome only appeared in amoxicillin-treated HFD-fed mice reinforcing the beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment in the HFD-associated metabolic syndrome. Moreover, we also observed the presence of gut-microbiota unique to amoxicillin-treated HFD-fed mice that are also known to improve the pathophysiology associated with metabolic syndrome. However, both CD-fed as well as HFD-fed mice receiving antibiotics showed an increase in intestinal pathogens as is typically observed for antibiotic treatment. Importantly though, infection studies with S. aureus and A. baumannii, revealed that macrophages isolated from amoxicillin-treated HFD-fed mice are comparable to those isolated from mice receiving only HFD or CD in terms of susceptibility, and progression of microbial infection. This finding clearly indicated that amoxicillin treatment does not introduce any additional deficits in the ability of macrophages to combat microbial infections. Conclusions Our results showed that amoxicillin treatment in HFD-fed mice exert a beneficial influence on the pathophysiological attributes of metabolic syndrome which correlates with a significant remodelling of gut microbiota.
   A novel observation was the increase in microbes known to improve insulin sensitivity following amoxicillin treatment during short-term intake of HFD. Even though there is a minor increase in gut-resistant intestinal pathogens in amoxicillin-treated groups, there is no adverse impact on macrophages with respect to their susceptibility and ability to control infections. Taken together, this study provides a proof of principle for the exploration of amoxicillin treatment as a potential therapy in the people affected with metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Escalated and inappropriate levels of aggressive behavior referred to as pathological in psychiatry can lead to violent outcomes with detrimental impact on health and society. Early life stressful experiences might increase the risk of developing pathological aggressive behavior in adulthood, though molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we provide prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus specific transcriptome profiles of peripubertal stress (PPS) exposed Balb/c adult male mice exhibiting escalated aggression and adult female mice resilient to such aberrant behavioral responses. We identify transthyretin (TTR), a well known thyroid hormone transporter, as a key regulator of PPS induced escalated aggressive behavior in males. Brain-region-specific long-term changes in Ttr gene expression and thyroid hormone (TH) availability were evident in PPS induced escalated aggressive male mice, circulating TH being unaltered. Ttr promoter methylation marks were also altered being hypermethylated in hypothalamus and hypomethylated in prefrontal cortex corroborating with its expression pattern. Further, Ttr knockdown in hypothalamus resulted in escalated aggressive behavior in males without PPS and also reduced TH levels and expression of TH-responsive genes (Nrgn, Trh, and Hr). Escalated aggressive behavior along with reduced Ttr gene expression and TH levels in hypothalamus was also evident in next generation F1 male progenies. Our findings reveal that stressful experiences during puberty might trigger lasting escalated aggression by modulating TTR expression in brain. TTR can serve as a potential target in reversal of escalated aggression and related psychopathologies.

AB  - The persistent difficulty in conceptualizing the relationship between addictive and other mental disorders stands out among the many challenges faced by the field of Psychiatry. The different philosophies and schools of thought about, and the sheer complexity of these highly prevalent clinical conditions make progress inherently difficult, not to mention the profusion of competing and sometimes contradictory terms that unnecessarily exacerbate the challenge. The lack of a standardized term adds confusion, fuels stigma, and contributes to a "wrong door syndrome" that captures the difficulty of not only diagnosing but also treating addictive and other mental disorders in an integrated manner. The World Association on Dual Disorders (WADD) proposes the adoption of the term "Dual Disorder" which, while still arbitrary, would help harmonize various clinical and research efforts by rallying around a single, more accurate, and less stigmatizing designation.

AB  - SettingTuberculosis Research Laboratory, Division of Clinical Microbiology and Molecular Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, and the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases (NITRD), both situated in New Delhi. ObjectivesWe aimed to identify the distribution of various genotypes of M. tuberculosis among HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients suspected of having Tuberculosis, seen at the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, New Delhi, which is a tertiary care dedicated TB hospital. Patients and methodsGenotyping by Spoligotyping and 24 loci MIRU-VNTR was performed and analyzed using SITVITWEB and MIRU-VNTRplus. Drug susceptibility patterns were also analyzed. ResultsA total of 503 subjects who were PTB/EPTB suspected were recruited and 287 were culture positive. Among them, 276 had growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and in 11 patients non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) were grown. The isolation rate of NTM was predominantly from HIV positive [10 of 130 (7.6%)] patients. Of the total isolates of MTB, 156 (56.5%) were from HIV negative patients and 120 (43.5%) were from HIV positive patients. All 276 M. tuberculosis isolates were genotyped and tested for drug susceptibility patterns. The CAS genotype was most predominant [153 (55.4%)], followed by Beijing lineage [44 (15.9%)], East African India [25 (9.1%)] and others [54 (19.6%)]. Beijing genotype was significantly more common in HIV positive patients (22.5%) than in HIV negative patients (10.9%). In MIRU-VNTR analysis, clustering was found to be more frequent in CAS strains irrespective of HIV status. In the HIV positive group, spoligotyping could differentiate various genotypes in 90% of isolates and MIRU-VNTR analysis in 84.2% of isolates. The clustering of various MTB strains was more associated with drug resistance. ConclusionThe Beijing lineage was predominant in HIV-TB coinfected cases, even though the Central Asian Strain (CAS) was overall more predominant in the region.

AB  - With the overuse and misuse of antibiotics amid COVID-19 pandemic, the antimicrobial resistance, which is already a global challenge, has accelerated its pace significantly. Finding novel and potential antibiotics seems one of the probable solutions. In this work, a novel Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 was isolated and found to be an excellent source of antimicrobials as confirmed by agar-plug assay. It showed antibacterial activity against infection-causing bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 inhibited the growth methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and ampicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, to get deep insights about the genome and biosynthetic gene clusters producing antibiotics, whole genome sequencing was done. The strain EMB24 is closely related to the Streptomyces longispororuber as revealed by phylogenetic analysis which is a potential source of antibiotics and pigments as undecylprodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin belonging to the class prodigiosin. Naphthyridinomycin, alkylresorcinols, desferrioxamine B and E, venezuelin, aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin are potent therapeutics that shared 100% similarity with the reference strain as revealed by the online antiSMASH tool.

AB  - The vascular subtype of Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (vEDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder characterized by spontaneous arterial, bowel or organ rupture. The diagnosis of vEDS is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the alpha-1 gene of type III collagen (COL3A1) by molecular analysis. In this report, we present a case of vEDS with life threatening, spontaneous arterial dissections in association with an uncharacterized rare variant of COL3A1, exon19:c.1340G > A. Primary culture of patient skin fibroblasts followed by immunofluorescence revealed a complete absence of COL3A1 protein expression as well as altered morphology. Electron microscopy of the cultured fibroblasts showed abnormal vacuoles in the cytoplasm suggestive of a secretory defect. In this study, we have performed functional characterization of the COL3A1 exon19:c.1340G > A variant for the first time and this may now be classified as likely pathogenic in vEDS.

AB  - Background Estimation of residual risk (RR) is necessary to understand status of blood safety with current testing strategies and need to improve it further. These estimates from India are lacking till date. Present study was aimed to estimate RR and incident rate (IR) of transfusion transmitted infectious disease (TTIDs) in Indian setting. Study Design and Methods Blood donor demographic data, serological testing results and nucleic acid testing (NAT) screening results were collected retrospectively from January 2015 to June 2017. Mathematical modelling using NAT yield/window period model was done to estimate IR and RR of TTIDs. Data was compared between different groups based on age-group, gender, donation repeatability and type of donor. Results A total 106 119 blood donors donated 109 441 units with overall TTID reactivity of 2.22%. HBV was most prevalent TTID (1.26%) with RR of 16.1 per million followed by HCV and HIV with RR of 4.4 and 3.1 per million donations, respectively. NAT testing variably reduced RR ranging from 69.4% to 96.1% depending on TTID. Younger, repeat and voluntary donors had significantly lower prevalence of TTIDs compared to older, first time and replacement donors. Discussion Gaps in the blood safety could be bridged significantly by implementing NAT testing and using quality serological assays. Comparatively high RR despite using quality serological assays and ID-NAT testing highlights need to develop long term strategies to improve blood safety by focusing on improving donor pool by recruiting regular voluntary donors among youth and imparting knowledge of healthy practices.

AB  - CASE PRESENTATION: A 50-year-old woman who was a nonsmoker presented to the out-patient-department with history of dry cough and breathlessness on exertion for the past 4 months along with onset of dull aching chest pain for the last 2 weeks. Her breathlessness had gradually deteriorated to the point that she experienced dyspnea even on walking a few steps on level ground. Loss of appetite and significant weight loss during the same period also formed part of her clinical semiology. There was no history of fever, night sweats, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, hemoptysis, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, edema, headache, visual disturbance, weakness of any extremity, or drooping of eyelids. Her medical history revealed that she had undergone hysterectomy 8 years earlier for removal of a probable uterine mass, for which no documentation was available.

AB  - Introduction Adolescent girls face challenges in menstrual hygiene in routine patterns which impacts their education and health. A qualitative study was undertaken to assess the knowledge and practices regarding menstruation in a rural community of Haryana and to identify the barriers to menstrual hygiene. Methodology The study was conducted in the month of September 2019 among various stakeholders i.e. adolescent females, adolescent males, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, Anganwadi workers, school teachers and Medical Officers. The stakeholders were mapped with the help of a Multi-Purpose Health Worker and ASHA of the village. Interview guides for focus group discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview (IDI) were prepared from previous literature to understand menstrual health management among the stakeholders. Results After IDI and FGD, we found that there is a barrier to accessibility of regular sanitary pads, a lack of education on menstrual hygiene among adolescent girls. School absenteeism was a concern due to the unavailability of mechanisms for the disposal of sanitary pads in school and poor maintenance of toilets. Conclusion Proper implementation of the Adolescent Reproductive Sexual Health program and Menstrual health education can improve the use and reduce stigma and ignorance. Free uninterrupted supply of sanitary pads through school and Anganwadi will help improving accessibility and separate toilets for girls would lead to a reduction in absenteeism.

AB  - Background Atherosclerosis, a progressive manifestation of coronary artery disease, has been observed to be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting various protein-coding genes involved in several pathophysiological events of coronary artery disease. Objective In our previous report, we identified differential expression profiles of candidate miRNAs, miR-133b and miR-21, in patients with coronary artery disease as compared with controls, suggesting their possible implication in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. To better understand the functional role of these miRNAs, we sought to predict and validate their target genes while assessing the expression pattern of these genes in patients with coronary artery disease, as well as in macrophages. Methods Potential target genes of miR-133b and miR-21 were predicted bioinformatically followed by validation through the identification of their expression at the protein level in patients with coronary artery disease (n-30), as well as in macrophages treated with respective miRNA inhibitors (antagomiRs), through immunoblotting. Results SGPP1, a gene associated with the sphingolipid pathway, was predicted to be a potential target gene of miR-133b while ATG5 and LRP6 were target genes of miR-21 while being associated with autophagy and Wnt signalling pathways, respectively. SGPP1 was observed to be upregulated significantly (p = 0.019) by 2.07-fold, whereas ATG5 and LRP6 were found to be downregulated (p = 0.026 and 0.007, respectively) by 3.28-fold and 8.46-fold, respectively, in patients with coronary artery disease as compared with controls. Expression patterns of all the genes were also found to be modulated when cells were treated with respective miRNA inhibitors. Conclusions Results from the present study suggest that SGPP1, ATG5 and LRP6, target genes of miR-133b and miR-21, may serve as potential therapeutic hotspots in the management of coronary artery disease, which undoubtedly merit further experimental confirmation.

KW  - TUMORS
AB  - Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is an uncommon primary cancer in the adrenal gland. Its incidence of showing metastasis in the head and neck region is very rare. Herein, we present a case of a 46-year-old man who presented with complaints of pain and numbness on the left side of the lower face for 4 months. Radiographic examination revealed an osteolytic lesion with an illdefined border in the left body region of the mandible. Histopathologic examination revealed a tumor composed of sheets of oval to polygon-shaped tumor cells predominantly displaying abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. These tumor cells showed features of a high degree of anaplasia. On immunohistochemical examination, tumor cells were focally positive for synaptophysin, inhibin, vimentin, pancytokeratin (pan-CK), cytokeratin (CK)5/6, CD68, and CK8/18 and immunonegative for CK7, chromogranin, melan-A, S100, SMA, and SATB2. The Ki-67 proliferation index was approximately 20%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of metastatic oncocytic ACC to the oral cavity region.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), causing significant visual impairment worldwide. Current gold standards for retarding the progress of DR include blood sugar control and regular fundus screening. Despite these measures, the incidence and prevalence of DR and vision-threatening DR remain high. Given its slowly progressive course and long latent period, opportunities to contain or slow DR before it threatens vision must be explored.This narrative review assesses the recently described unconventional strategies to retard DR progression. These include gut-ocular flow, gene therapy, mitochondrial dysfunction -oxidative stress, stem cell therapeutics, neurodegeneration, anti-inflammatory treatments, lifestyle modification, and usage of phytochemicals. These therapies impact DR directly, while some of them also influence DM control. Most of these strategies are currently in the preclinical stage, and clinical evidence remains low. Nevertheless, our review suggests that these approaches have the potential for human use to prevent the progression of DR.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Managing pediatric corneal disorders is challenging as the prognosis of pediatric keratoplasty depends on several factors. Advancements in the genetic basis of congenital corneal diseases and investigations in congenital corneal conditions provide a better understanding of pediatric corneal conditions. Surgeons performing keratoplasty in children now have a choice of various techniques. Evolving surgical techniques of anterior lamellar and endothelial keratoplasties have expanded the management interventions in these pediatric corneal morbidity conditions; however, considerable concerns still exist in association with corneal transplantation in infants and children. Outcomes in pediatric keratoplasty depend upon the preoperative indications, the timing of surgical intervention, intraoperative and postoperative factors including the patient/care givers' compliance. Factors such as low scleral rigidity, higher rate of graft failure, need for frequent examinations under anesthesia, and difficulty in optimal visual acuity assessment still remain a considerable challenge in pediatric scenarios. In children, deprivation amblyopia as a result of the corneal opacification can adversely affect visual development, causing dense amblyopia. Outcomes to surgical interventions for management of corneal opacification in children are further compromised by the preexisting amblyopia apart from the concerns of refractive outcome of the graft. Graft rejection, graft infection, amblyopia, and glaucoma continue to be serious concerns. In recent years both anterior and posterior lamellar keratoplasty techniques are being increasingly performed in pediatric eyes, which offer advantages in the form of lower risk of graft rejection. The timing of surgery, careful case selection, cautious intraoperative ap-proach, and optimal postoperative management can improve the anatomical and functional outcome in difficult cases.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background Non-cultured epidermal cell suspension (ECS) and hair follicle cell suspension (HFCS) are well-established methods of surgical treatment of stable vitiligo. Aims The aim of the present study was to compare the laboratory indicators and clinical efficacy of ECS and HFCS in the treatment of stable vitiligo. Methods This was a single centre, open-labeled randomized trial. Vitiligo patches from 74 patients were randomized to receive either ECS or HFCS. Both cell suspensions were analyzed for total cell count, cell viability and melanocyte count. Percentage re-pigmentation was assessed at regular intervals for 36 weeks. Results The percentage re-pigmentation with ECS was significantly higher than HFCS at week 4 (p = .01) and week 16 (p = .03) however, no difference was observed at weeks 24 (p = .38) and 36 (p = .05). Forty-seven patients completed the study follow-up duration and excellent re-pigmentation (>90%) was achieved in 61.7% and 53.2% and complete re-pigmentation (100%) was observed in 6.4% and 12.8% of participants using ECS and HFCS, respectively. Significantly higher cell yield (p < .01) and percentage of HMB45+ melanocytes (p = .01) were obtained using ECS. No difference was noted in the percentage of viable cells or S100 + melanocytes. Conclusion The median cell yield was eight times higher in ECS than in HFCS with a significantly higher percentage of HMB45+ melanocytes in the former group. The median percentage of re-pigmentation in both groups was 90% at the end of 36 weeks. ECS provides faster re-pigmentation; however, both ECS and HFCS have comparable safety and efficacy over a longer duration of follow-up.

AB  - This paper presents an automated method for detection of the diagnostically prominent frames containing optic nerve sheath (ONS) from ocular ultrasonography video using deep learning; such frames are referred to as "Good View" frames in this paper. Vivid acquisition and measurement of diagnostic features during ultrasound imaging is a challenging task; it needs a highly skilled and experienced medical expert. Automated detection of the Good View frame and the subsequent automatic measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), predicting elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) status, will eliminate the need for frequent intervention of a medical expert for continuous monitoring and ICP status in traumatic patients. In the presented work, the proposed model automatically detects the appropriate frames containing ONS, from an ultrasound video, by using faster region-based CNN (Faster R-CNN) object detection model. The region proposal detection network finds the ONS by using bounding boxes. In addition, three CNN-based architectures are used for its feature extraction. Finally, SoftMax classifier classifies the ONS containing Good View frame. The Inceptionv2, ResNet50, and ResNet101 architectures are then compared by utilizing the optimized learning rate and epoch parameters for the CNN model so as to provide better detection of the Good View frame. The performance of the developed module has been analyzed by proposing a grading criterion of the Good View frame. Based on the detection score and mean opinion score, an USG frame is considered a Good View for a 95-99% detection score, and this Good View frame is used for measuring the ONSD value. It is found that Faster R-CNN ResNet101 (model 3) is an optimal model in terms of sensitivity and specificity for Good View frame detection at a learning rate of 0.0003. The sensitivity and specificity of this model are obtained as 90.41 and 91.45, respectively. Furthermore, the ONSD value is measured from Good View-detected frames using an automated algorithm involving image processing and computational methods. Considering the Good View frame (detection score 95-99), the algorithm-generated ONSD values are compared with the radiologist's measured value of ONSD to validate the findings; a small percent root mean square difference (PRD) of 0.501 is found between these values, which is strong indicative of the accuracy of algorithm generated ONSD measurement using automatically detected Good View ocular USG frames.

AB  - Objective To study the growth and neurodevelopmental outcome of very and moderate preterm infants (VMPT) compared to term appropriate-for-age (term AGA) infants at 18-months corrected age. Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled consecutively born 212 VMPT infants and 250 term AGA controls delivered during study period. Outcome measures Major neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) defined as any one of cerebral palsy, motor (MoDQ) or mental developmental quotient (MoDQ) <70 on Developmental Assessment Scale for Indian infants, visual or hearing impairment, or epilepsy, and growth outcomes. Results Among 195 VMPT and 240 term AGA infants who completed follow-up, the frequency of major NDI was 12.8% and 2.5% respectively (RR 5.1; 95% CI [2.13-12.19]). Major NDI was higher among infants <28 weeks gestation (39%) and birthweight <1000 grams (27%). A quarter of VMPT infants exhibited wasting and 18% stunting than 7% each among controls. Conclusion VMPT infants had a higher frequency of major NDI and growth failure at 18-months.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the role of intraoperative optical coherence tomography (i-OCT) in donor grading, selection, and preparation during different types of keratoplasty. Methods: Seventy-one consecutive donor corneas collected over 6 months, after clinical grading, were observed by an experienced corneal surgeon under an i-OCT equipped microscope. The donor preparation (manual/automated) for different types of keratoplasty procedures was also undertaken under i-OCT. Results: The mean central corneal thickness of optical and nonoptical grade tissues was 533 +/- 19 and 662 +/- 52 mu m, respectively. The i-OCT-based grading matched with clinical grading in 98.5% cases. Irregular thickness, anterior stromal hyperreflectivity, and previous scars were appreciated in 1.4, 1.4, and 7.04% donors, respectively. During Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty, i-OCT facilitated selection of appropriate microkeratome head for automated donor preparation in all cases, besides allowing manual dissection of partially dissected lenticule, identification of site of inadvertent perforation, and eccentric trephination in one case each. During Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty, i-OCT-based assessment of preexisting scar (five cases) guided careful tissue selection (2/5) and preparation. During predescemetic endothelial keratoplasty, precise needle advancement allowed successful type-1 bubble formation in all cases. All manually punched donors demonstrated an extra endothelial ledge, while those with automated preparation showed tapering donor margins. Conclusion: i-OCT might serve as a useful imaging tool for objective assessment of donor characteristics. The modality may complement clinical evaluation for donor grading, selection, and preparation.

TI  - Generation of two induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (IGIBi006-A and IGIBi008-A) carrying exonic deletions in the dystrophin gene
T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder with defect in dystrophin gene that shows features of degeneration of muscle tissue at an early age. Here, we describe iPSC lines generated from LCL of two patients of Indian origin carrying 46-48 and 49-50 exons deletions in DMD. The resulting iPSC lines IGIBi006-A and IGIBi008-A showed all the characteristic features of pluripotency, differentiated into cells of three germ layers in vitro and have no major genetic alterations due to reprogramming process. These lines can serve as a useful cell model for studying disease pathogenesis and will aid in precision therapy.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken to combat it have greatly impacted the health infrastructure of all nations. Here we present a rare case of leptospirosis with severe acute pancreatitis, bilateral peripheral gangrene, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and multiorgan failure. This is a rare presentation of leptospirosis wherein the patient had no history suggestive of acquisition of leptospires. The patient was started on doxycycline but still could not be saved due to the multisystem involvement.

AB  - Aims and objectives The aim of the study is to compare the single matrix approach and slice-by-slice approach for computing singular value decomposition (SVD) to achieve near-lossless compression of PET/CT images. Materials and methods The parameters used for comparison were SVD computation time, percentage compression and percentage difference between ROI counts on compressed and original images. SVD of 49 F-18-FDG PET/CT studies (33 370 PET/CT images) was computed using both approaches. The smaller singular values contributing insignificant information to the image were truncated, and then, the compressed image was reconstructed. A mask (101 x 101pixels) was used to extract the ROI counts from compressed and original images. Two nuclear medicine physicians compared compressed images with their corresponding original images for loss of clinical details and the presence of generated artifacts. Structural Similarity Index Measure, blur, brightness, contrast per pixel and global contrast factor were used for objective assessment of image quality. Wilcoxon test was applied to find a statistically significant difference between the parameters used for comparison at alpha = 0.05. Results Nuclear medicine physicians found compressed image identical to the corresponding original image. The values of comparation parameters were significantly larger for the single matrix approach in comparison with the slice-by-slice approach. The maximum percentage error between the compressed image and original image was less than 5%. Conclusions Up to 64 % and 44% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved, respectively using the slice-by-slice approach, and up to 58 and 53% near-lossless compression of PET and CT images were achieved respectively using the single matrix approach.

AB  - Objectives:Management of "failing" and "failed" Fontan circulation, particularly the indications, timing, and type of re-intervention, currently remains nebulous. Factors contributing to pathogenesis and mortality following Fontan procedure differ between children and adults. Methods:Since organ systems in individual patients are affected differently, we searched the extant literature for a "failing" and "failed" Fontan reviewing the clinical phenotypes, diagnostic modalities, pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical techniques employed, and their outcomes. Results:A total of 410 investigations were synthesised. Although proper candidate selection, thoughtful technical modifications, timely deployment of mechanical support devices, tissue-engineered conduits, and Fontan takedown have decreased the peri-operative mortality from 9 to 15% and 1 to 3% per cent in recent series, pernicious changes in organ function are causing long-term patient attrition. In the setting of a failed Fontan circulation, literature documents three surgical options: Fontan revision, Fontan conversion, or cardiac transplantation. The reported morbidity of 25% and mortality of 8-10% among Fontan conversion continue to improve in select institutions. While operative mortality following cardiac transplantation for Fontan failure is 30% higher than for other CHDs, there is no difference in long-term survival with actuarial 10-year survival of around 54%. Mechanical circulatory assistance, stem cells, and tissue-engineered Fontan conduit for destination therapy or as a bridge to transplantation are in infancy for failing Fontan circulation. Conclusions:An individualised management strategy according to clinical phenotypes may delay the organ damage in patients with a failing Fontan circulation. At present, cardiac transplantation remains the last stage of palliation with gradually improving outcomes.

AB  - Background: Hemoglobin (Hb) variants arise due to point mutations in globin chains and their pathological treatments rely heavily on the identification of the nature and location of the mutation in the globin chains. Traditional methods for diagnosis such as HPLC and electrophoresis have their own limitations. Therefore, the present study aims to develop and optimize a specific method of sample processing that could lead to improved sequence coverage and analysis of Hb variants by nano LC-MALDI MS/MS. Methods: In our study, we primarily standardized various sample processing methods such as conventional digestion with trypsin followed by 10% acetonitrile treatment, digestion with multiple proteases like trypsin, Glu-C, Lys-C, and trypsin digestion subsequent to 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol (TFE) treatment. Finally, the peptides were identified by LC-MALDI MS/MS. All of these sample processing steps were primarily tested with recombinant Hb samples. After initial optimization, we found that the TFE method was the most suitable one and the efficiency of this method was applied in Hb variant identification based on high sequence coverage. Results: We developed and optimized a method using an organic solvent TFE and heat denaturation prior to digestion, resulting in 100% sequence coverage in the beta-chains and 95% sequence coverage in the alpha-chains, which further helped in the identification of Hb mutations. A Hb variant protein sequence database was created to specify the search and reduce the search time. Conclusion: All of the mutations were identified using a bottom-up non-target approach. Therefore, a sensitive, robust and reproducible method was developed to identify single substitution mutations in the Hb variants from the sequence of the entire globin chains. Biological Significance: Over 330,000 infants are born annually with hemoglobinopathies and it is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in early childhood. Hb variants generally arise due to point mutation in the globin chains. There is high sequence homology between normal Hb and Hb variant chains. Due to this high homology between the two forms, identification of variants by mass spectrometry is very difficult and requires the full sequence coverage of alpha- and beta-chains. As such, there is a need for a suitable method that provides 100% sequence coverage of globin chains for variant analysis by mass spectrometry. Our study provides a simple, robust, and reproducible method that is suitable for LC-MALDI and provides nearly complete sequence coverage in the globin chains. This method may be used in the near future in routine diagnosis for Hb variant analysis.

AB  - Background: We evaluated the efficacy of training health care workers (HCWs) in point-of-care quality improvement (POCQI) and a preterm newborn health care package (PHCP), followed by remote mentoring and supportive supervision in improving health care practices, neonatal survival, and morbidities in special neonatal care units (SNCUs).
   Methods: This pre- and postintervention quality improvement study was conducted at 3 SNCUs in Madhya Pradesh, India from February 2017 to February 2019. Clinical care teams comprising doctors and nurses from the study sites were trained in POCQI and the PHCP. The teams identified, prioritized, and analyzed problems and designed quality improvement initiatives at their respective health facilities. Change ideas were tested by the local teams using sequential plan-do-study-act cycles. Facilitators maintained contact with the teams through quarterly review meetings, fortnightly videoconferencing, on-demand phone calls, and group chat service. State SNCU coordinators made follow-up visits to supplement coaching. Study research staff independently collected data on admissions, health care practices, and outcomes of neonates.
   Findings: A total of 156 HCWs were trained in the POCQI methodology and PHCP. Sixteen quality improvement projects were formulated and implemented. Among 13,821 enrolled neonates (birth weight 2275 +/- 6635 g; gestation: 35.8 +/- 62.8 weeks), improvement was seen in reduction of use of oxygen (36.1% vs. 48.0%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=0.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.55, 0.66), antibiotics (29.4% vs. 39.0%; aOR=0.76, 95% CI=0.68, 0.85), and dairy milk (33.8% vs. 49.4%; aOR= 0.34, 95% CI=0.31 to 0.38). Enteral feeds were started within 24 hours of admission in a larger number of neonates, resulting in fewer days to reach full feeds. There was no effect on survival at discharge from the hospital (aOR=0.93; 95% CI=0.80, 1.09).
   Conclusion: A collaborative cross-learning quality improvement approach with remote mentoring, coaching, and supportive supervision was successful in improving the quality of care at SNCUs.

AB  - To assess the global research landscape in the field of Posterior urethral valve (PUV), a scientometric study was conducted to determine the quantity and quality of the research output and get insight into the key research areas and pattern of collaboration in the research community.Methods Primary data was acquired from the Scopus (R) data-base. Various parameters like the total research productivity, citations, citations per publication, citations per year, citations per publication per year, the scientific output of countries, institutions, au-thors, and journals were calculated. Key research areas were inferred by examining the top-cited ar-ticles (citations >150). Collaborative maps were generated by calculating co-authorship links amongst countries and authors using VOSviewer software.Results One thousand seven hundred fourteen results were found published from 1913 to 2019, receiving a total of 27,253 citations, authored by 5138 authors from 125 countries. The top three countries were the United States of America (USA), India, and the United Kingdom (UK). The leading institutes were the Children's Hospital Boston, USA (n = 48), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, Delhi), India (n = 38), and Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK (n-= 27). The journals which published the most articles on PUV were the Journal of Urology (n = 278), Journal of Pediatric Urology (n = 121), followed by Urology (n = 86). Leading authors were Glassberg, K. L and Bajpai M (n = 17, each), Canning DA & Kajbafzadeh, AM (n = 16, each), followed by Peters CA with 14 manuscripts. The top-cited docu-ments (n = 10) received 2104 citations and were published between 1986 and 2010. The key areas of interest found were "long-term outcomes" (n = 4) and "fetal surgery" (n = 2). The most productive countries were also the most collaborative countries (the USA and UK).Conclusion In the research landscape of PUV, the USA, Chil-dren's Hospital Boston, and Glassberg, K. L, along with Bajpai, M were the top contributors in terms of the country, organization, and authors, respectively. The "Journal of Urology" and "Pediatric Nephrology" stands out in terms of bibliometric pa-rameters considered. The hotspot topics based on the number of citations received were "long-term outcomes" and "fetal surgery" in PUV. The most productive countries were also the most collabora-tive countries (the USA and UK).

AB  - Background More than 3 billion people do not have access to clean energy and primarily use solid fuels to cook. Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels.
   Methods We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km x 5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2.1 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution.
   Findings Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205000 (95% uncertainty interval 147000-257000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution.
   Interpretation Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Dystonias are relatively rare disorders characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal movements or postures. Generalized dystonia is a therapeutic challenge because medications are unable to control dystonia adequately in most patients. These patients may be candidates for surgical therapy. The commonly used surgical procedures in these patients are pallidotomy and deep brain stimulation. Limited studies are available on the role of pallidotomy in children with acquired/heredodegenerative generalized dystonia. The objective of this study was to describe the authors' experience with bilateral pallidotomy in this group of patients.
   METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed all pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) with acquired/heredo-degenerative generalized dystonia who underwent bilateral simultaneous pallidotomy at their center between January 2014 and January 2021. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores before and after surgery were recorded. Complications arising after the procedure were recorded as well.
   RESULTS Ten patients (8 male and 2 female) with a mean (range) age of 11.1 (5-17) years were included in this study. The mean duration between disease onset and surgical intervention was 3.9 years. Two patients presented in status dystonicus. The mean +/- SD (range) preoperative BFMDRS score of the patients without status dystonicus (n = 8) was 80 +/- 18.9 (59.5-108). The mean +/- SD BFMDRS score at the time of discharge from the hospital after surgery was 58.8 +/- 37.9. Three patients had more than 20% change in BFMDRS score at the time of discharge from the hospital. The mean improvement was 25.5% at the end of 1 year. Of 5 surviving patients in the non-status dystonicus group, 3 patients had more than 40% change in BFMDRS score while the other 2 patients developed recurrence at the last follow-up (4.5 years). Status dystonicus abated after bilateral pallidotomy in both patients. Permanent bulbar complications were seen in 2 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS Bilateral pallidotomy may result in clinically significant improvement in children with acquired/heredo- degenerative generalized dystonia, although the benefits should be closely weighed against the risk of irreversible bulbar dysfunction. It is a viable option for children in resource-limited settings.

AB  - The use of smartphone-based applications as a telenutrition tool could redefine the nutritional management of IBD. We developed and validated a digital health platform in the form of a smartphone application for the nutritional assessment of IBD patients. Our team of gastroenterologists and dieticians at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi developed a smartphone application titled IBD NutriCare, which was made available in both Android and iOS interfaces in English and seven other Indian languages. The application includes >650 Indian recipes and provides subjective global assessment and IBD clinical activity scores in a patient-friendly manner. The utility of the smartphone app was validated in comparison with the traditional 24-h dietary recall method. A total of 49 IBD patients were enrolled in the study. The mean difference in energy intake between the two dietary assessment methods was -4.776 kJ (95% LOA, range -417.916-408.365 kJ). A total of 94% of patients found the smartphone application convenient and acceptable in comparison to the recall method for dietary assessment. Bland-Altman plots showed a good level of agreement for nutrients and food groups between the two methods. Telenutrition in the form of a smartphone application helps in real-time tracking of dietary details of IBD patients, thus making appropriate interventions and large-scale data acquisition feasible.

AB  - Copy number alteration (CNA) status and CNA risk profiles of IKZF1(plus), UK-ALL CNA risk groups and MRplus scores, were evaluated for clinical and prognostic impact in a cohort of 493 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases diagnosed and treated under the Indian Collaborative Childhood Leukemia group (ICiCLe) protocol trial. Overall CNA frequency was 59% with 60% of cases showing 2-loci deletion. CDKN2A/B deletion was most common CNA (36.3%), while IKZF1 deletion and IKZF1(plus) profile were noted in 19.5% and 13.4% of cases, respectively. IKZF1 deletions and other CNA risk profiles were significantly associated with poor (PR)/high risk (HR) clinical and genetic profile parameters (P < 0.001). In addition, the 3-year OS, event-free survival (EFS) was significantly poor with high relapse rate (RR) of 38.6%, 46.5%, and 35.2% for IKZF1 deletions, IKZF1(plus) profiles, and UK-ALL CNA-intermediate risk (IR)+PR risk groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Integrated evaluation of UK-ALL CNA risk profile with ICiCLe trial risk stratification groups revealed a worse overall survival, EFS, and RR of 63.3%, 43.2%, and 35.2% for CNA-IR+PR profile compared to CNA-good risk profile (81.3%, 65.0%, and 21.0%; P < 0.001). Hence, routine CNA testing in our setting is must to identify standard risk and IR cases likely to benefit from HR treatment.

AB  - Netarsudil is a hypotensive drug that reduces intraocular pressure (!OP). Although it is used to treat corneal decompensation/edema in normotensive eyes, we observed the occurrence of corneal epithe-lial edema with corneal honeycombing in children with uncontrolled !OP (primary or secondary glaucoma) on maximal topical medication following netarsudil (0.02%) therapy of >2 weeks. Of 16 eyes of 16 children, 9 (56%) developed corneal honeycombing. They were younger than those without honeycombing (median age, 3.1 vs 9.7 years [P = 0.016]), had higher baseline !OP (35.6 +/- 7.4 vs 27.2 +/- 5.6 mm Hg [P < 0.001]), and usually had preexisting corneal edema (7/9 eyes vs none [P < 0.001]).

AB  - Slippery flooring often leads to unintentional slips and falls, which results in traumatic injuries. To reduce slipping risks, adequate traction at the shoe and flooring contact is essential. In addition, viscous slippery contaminants like water or oil reduce a floor's traction performance and increase slipping hazards. In this work, the effect of commonly available protective floor coatings on the traction performance of safety-labelled shoes was extensively studied. The study included three floor coatings, namely acid-based etchant coating, epoxy floor paint, and polyurethane, which were tested across five safety shoes. The coated floorings were tested using a robotic slip-testing device in dry and in the presence of water and machine oil-as separate contaminants. The application of floor coatings produced varying surface roughness for the flooring. Significant traction was generated by the etchant coating for the dry flooring, epoxy coating for the wet flooring, and polyurethane coating for all flooring conditions. A comparison of uncoated and coated floorings showed a high effectiveness of generating traction with epoxy coating on wet flooring and polyurethane coating on both wet and oily conditions. The study results are novel and are anticipated to provide valuable guidelines for the selection of slip-resistant coatings for different slippery floorings, and to reduce risks related to slips and falls.

AB  - Introduction As millions of people worldwide recover from COVID-19, a substantial proportion continue to have persistent symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and radiological findings suggestive of post-COVID interstitial lung disease (ILD). To date, there is limited scientific evidence on the management of post-COVID ILD, necessitating a consensus-based approach. Areas covered A panel of experts in pulmonology and thoracic radiology was constituted. Key questions regarding the management of post-COVID ILD were identified. A search was performed on PubMed and EMBASE and updated till 1 March 2022. The relevant literature regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of post-COVID ILD was summarized. Subsequently, suggestions regarding the management of these patients were framed, and a consensus was obtained using the Delphi approach. Those suggestions which were approved by over 80% of the panelists were accepted. The final document was approved by all panel members. Expert opinion Dedicated facilities should be established for the care of patients with post-COVID ILD. Symptom screening, pulmonary function testing, and thoracic imaging have a role in the diagnosis. The pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options for the management of post-COVID ILD are discussed. Further research into the pathophysiology and management of post-COVID ILD will improve our understanding of this condition.

AB  - Purpose: Whereas a large number of features are mentioned to connote the quality of medical research, no tool is available to comprehensively measure it objectively across different types of studies. Also, all the available tools are for reporting, and none includes quality of the inputs and the process of research. The present paper is aimed to initiate a discussion on the need to develop such a comprehensive scoring system (in the first place), to show that it is feasible, and to describe the process of developing a credible system. Method: An expert group comprising researchers, reviewers, and editors of medical journals extensively reviewed the literature on the quality of medical research and held detailed discussions to parse quality at all stages of medical research into specific domains and items that can be assigned scores on the pattern of quality-of-life score. Results: Besides identifying the domains of the quality of medical research, a comprehensive tool for scoring emerged that can be possibly used to objectively measure the quality of empirical research comprising surveys, trials, and observational studies. Thus, this can be used as a tool to assess Quality of Empirical Research in Medicine (QERM). The expert group confirmed its face and content validity. The tool can be used by the researchers for self-assessment and improvement before submission of a paper for publication, and the reviewers and editors can use this for assessing the submissions. Published papers can also be rated such as those included in a meta-analysis. Conclusion: It is feasible to devise a comprehensive scoring system comprising domains and items for assessing the quality of medical research end-to-end from choosing a problem to publication. The proposed scoring system needs to be reviewed by the researchers and needs to be validated.

AB  - Objective To determine the burden of early growth faltering and understand the care practices for small and sick babies discharged from newborn units in the district. Study design Observational and follow-up study. Participants 512 babies discharged from two Special Newborn Care Units (SNCUs) and four Newborn Stabilization Units (NBSUs) in two districts of Himachal Pradesh. Methods Anthropometric assessments, interview of mothers and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) conducted between August, 2018 and March, 2019. Change in weight-for-age z-score (Delta WAZ) of Outcomes Proportion of growth faltering (or catch-down growth) in small and sick babies discharged from SNCUs and NBSUs, and infant care practices. Results Growth faltering was observed in a significant proportion of both term (30%) and preterm (52.6%) babies between 1 to 4 months of age. Among babies with growth faltering (n=180), 73.9% received a home visit by ASHA, and only 36.7% received a follow-up visit at a facility. There were 71.3% mothers counselled at discharge (mostly informed about breast feeding). Most (96.7%) mothers did not perceive inadequate weight gain in their babies post-discharge. During home visits, ASHAs weighed 61.6% of the infants with growth faltering. Amongst infants who had growth faltering, only 49.6% of mothers had been provided information about their infant's growth and 57.1% mothers had received breastfeeding counselling. Conclusion Small and sick newborn infants (both term and preterm babies) discharged from special care newborn units are at increased risk of early growth faltering. Follow-up care provided to these infants is inadequate. There is a need to strengthen both facility-based and home-based follow up of small and sick newborn infants discharged from newborn care facilities.

AB  - Purpose: Diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) primarily relies on the detection of morphological dysplasia in bone marrow. It is subjective and many studies have reported lack of interobserver agreement in reporting. Biopsy is preferred specimen for megakaryocyte assessment. We studied 43 bone marrow biopsies from 40 suspected MDS patient having persistent undiagnosed cytopenia. Utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) with CD61 and p53 in detecting low-grade MDS was analyzed over routine morphology. Method and Results: Total number of megakaryocytes and number of dysplastic megakaryocytes seen on CD61 IHC was significantly higher than that on H and E stain (P value < 0.05) Out of total 43 biopsies, 13 [30.2%] cases showed dysplastic megakaryocytes that were confirmed by interobserver agreement after IHC. From 30 cases with no significant dysplasia on morphology, 21/43 [48.8%] cases showed >10% dysplastic megakaryocytes on CD61 (P value 0.0001). Nine cases showed no significant dysmegakaryopoiesis with either H and E or CD61 IHC. Fourteen cases could meet higher cut off (30%) of dysmegakaryopoiesis with CD 61 IHC. Out of total 34 cases showing significant dysplasia 7 cases (20.6%) showed positivity for p53 on IHC, which is little less than that reported in low-grade MDS. Conclusion: CD61 IHC is helpful in making correct diagnosis of MDS in cases with minimal dysplasia and should be performed before excluding possibility of MDS on morphology in a patient with undiagnosed cytopenia. IHC is cost effective tool for MDS diagnosis in developing world where access to extensive flow cytometery and molecular testing is limited.

   Patients and Methods: This is a prospective randomized phase III study enrolling patients with Stage IB to IVA cervical carcinoma in two arms receiving either three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or IMRT from December 2017 to December 2019. The primary objective was to compare the hematologic toxicities (Grade 2 or more neutropenia as the primary factor) and the secondary objectives were to compare GI toxicities, and dosimetric analysis for volumes of BM, and bowel irradiated. SPSS version 20 was used for all statistical calculations.
   Results: Eighty patients with histopathologically confirmed cervical cancer were randomized to receive IMRT or 3DCRT (40 in each arm). The median age of the patients was 56.5 (36-67) and 59.5 (37-68) years, respectively, in IMRT and 3DCRT arms. The median dose of external radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions, and of brachytherapy was 24 Gy in 3 fractions in both the arms. The incidence of grade >= 2 neutropenia was 42.5% and 15% in the 3DCRT and IMRT arms, respectively (P < 0.001). All patients received concurrent chemotherapy with cisplatin, with the median number of cycles being 5 (range 3-5) in both the arms. All five cycles of concurrent chemotherapy could be completed in 25 (62.5%) patients in the IMRT arm and 24 (60%) patients in the 3DCRT arm.
   Conclusions: IMRT significantly reduces acute hematologic and GI toxicities compared with 3DCRT with a better dosimetry profile.

AB  - Chlorpyrifos (CPF) is an extensively used organophosphate pesticide for crop protection. However, there are concerns about it contaminating the environment and human health, with estimated three lakh deaths annually. The molecular modeling protocol was assisted in redesigning thirteen well-known CPF linkers and inserting them at five selectable CPF (R1-R5) positions of CPF to get 258 CPF derivatives. CPF and its derivatives were optimized using LigPrep and docked to a grid centralized on Trp214 using extra precision glide docking. The Binding free energy of complexes was calculated using molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM-GBSA). CPF and CPFD-225 have glide scores of - 3.08 and - 6.152 kcal/mol, respectively, with human serum albumin and Delta G bind for CPF (- 33.041817 kcal/mol) (- 52.825 kcal/mol) for CPF-D225. The top ten CPF derivatives showed at least ninefold better binding free energy than the CPF proposed for polyclonal antibody production. Subsequently, molecular docking studies revealed that CPF and its derivatives could bind to human serum albumin (HSA). Furthermore, using the Desmond package, a 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed on the potential binding site. The final systems of CPF-HSA and CPF-222D complexes consist of 76,014 and 76,026 atoms, respectively. The physical stability of both the systems (CPF-HSA and CPF-222D) was analyzed by considering the overall potential energy, RMSF, RMSD, Hydrophobic interactions, and water-mediated patterns, which showed total energy of - 141,610 kcal/mol and - 140,150 kcal/mol, respectively.

AB  - Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a common disorder with rising incidence due to increased use of digital devices. While multiple treatment options are available, some are not efficacious or sometimes even safe for use in DES. This is particularly true for Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) that may contain ingredients having no rational for their use or may actually be harmful. Various committees appointed by the Government have reviewed several FDCs marketed in India and found some of them to be irrational and recommended for their removal. This paper discusses the contents of some of these FDCs marketed for DES with an aim to ensure that prescribers are mindful of their ingredients and whether there is adequate data about their efficacy and safety and prescribe them only if they consider them necessary for managing the patient.

AB  - Lung microenvironment is altered by injurious stimuli resulting in alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) injury, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and aberrant remodeling. This pathogenetic process reduces the drug amount delivered to the target site, both neoplastic and non-neoplastic and necessitates the use of nanocarriers based targeted drug delivery. Pirfenidone, a partially water-soluble drug was encapsulated; poly(e-caprolactone) nanoparticles (PCL-NPs) and to MePEG-PCL diblock by nanoprecipitation. Their physicochemical properties were characterized by Nanosight, DLS, Zeta potential, TEM, FTIR and H-1 NMR. Drug encapsulation and release efficiency was evaluated by HPLC. Their efficacy in modulating TGF-beta 1, SMAD-2,3,5 signaling and regulating EMT was assessed in-vitro on A-549 cells by measuring Vimentin and E-cadherin mRNA levels. The pirfenidone loaded PCL and MePEG-PCL-NPs were spherical with uniform particle size (similar to 150 nm), polydispersity index (0.095-0.224), high encapsulation efficacy (50-75 %), drug loading capacity (20 %) and good colloidal stability. Bleomycin induced EMT of AECs with an upregulation of mesenchymal protein, vimentin and loss of epithelial marker, E-cadherin. Bimodal increase in TGF beta 1, SMAD-2,3.5 genes at 4 h and then at 24 & 48 h was seen. The pirfenidone nanoformulations efficiently reversed EMT by downregulation of TGF-beta 1, SMAD-2,3,5, Vimentin and upregulation of E-cadherin gene. The effect of nanoformulations was similar to standard dose pirfenidone.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate visual field changes in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) with retinal nerve fiber layer thickness on optical coherence tomography. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, consecutive PCG children who underwent combined trabeculotomy with trabeculectomy and on regular follow-up were enrolled. All patients were aged over four years and co-operative for RNFL OCT and visual field examination. Perimetry was done on Humphrey visual field (HVF) analyzer using 30-2 and 10-2 SITA standard algorithms as appropriate. If a reliable automated perimetry was not feasible, kinetic perimetry was done. The following were noted at baseline and every follow-up: age, sex, visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), cup-disc ratio (CDR), corneal diameters, refraction, any topical antiglaucoma medications, surgeries underwent, age at surgery and duration between surgery and final examination. Results: Forty-eight eyes of 34 children operated for PCG and 19 eyes of 17 controls were analyzed. A statistically significant thinner average RNFL thickness of 87.2 +/- 28 mu m was noted in PCG eyes as compared to controls with 100.6 +/- 7.2 mu m (P = 0.04). The mean cup-disc area ratio on OCT in PCG eyes was 0.43 +/- 0.2 (0.02-0.93) and in control eyes was 0.23 +/- 0.07 (0.1-0.4) (P < 0.001). On RNFL OCT, there was significant focal RNFL loss in temporal superior (P = 0.003), nasal inferior (P = 0.037) and temporal inferior (P < 0.001) quadrants compared to controls. Among PCG eyes, 20/48 eyes (41.7%), had definitive, reproducible glaucomatous VF defects. Mean baseline IOP in PCG eyes with VF defect was 28.7 +/- 5.7 mmHg and in eyes with normal VF was 24.6 +/- 5.9 mmHg (P = 0.03). On univariate regression analysis, higher baseline IOP was significantly associated with both RNFL loss (odds ratio (OR): -2.17) and VF defects (OR: 3.35). Fluctuation in follow-up IOP (OR: 3.33) was also significantly associated with the presence of VF defects. On multivariable regression analysis maximum, IOP was significantly associated with RNFL loss and VF defects. Conclusion: Peripapillary RNFL thickness could be used to identify PCG eyes having visual field loss and possibly poor visual function from PCG eyes without visual field defects. Baseline and follow-up IOP, significantly correlated with RNFL thickness in PCG eyes.

AB  - Although caesarean delivery is a safe procedure, however, with rising numbers being performed every year globally, increasing number of complications are being encountered by clinicians and radiologists. These complications can be early, occurring over first few days to weeks, or late, which can present months to years later. Also, it must be kept in mind that the normal variations of physiological involution occurring in early postpartum period can mimic pathology in many cases. Clinical history, laboratory parameters, and radiological investigations go hand in hand in identifying acute complications at the earliest, enabling early initiation of treatment. Among radiological investigations, ultrasound is the first line investigation of choice, followed by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in certain conditions which will be described and illustrated further in this article.

AB  - Purpose: To validate the international chronic ocular graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) diagnostic criteria (ICCGVHD) compared to the National Institute of Health diagnostic criteria 2014 (NIH2014) for chronic ocular GVHD. Methods: Between 2013 and 2019, the study enrolled 233 patients with or without chronic ocular GVHD combined with the presence or absence of systemic chronic GVHD in an internationally prospective multicenter and observational cohort from 9 institutions. All patients were evaluated for four clinical parameters of ICCGVHD. Results: The relation between the ICCGVHD score (0-11) and NIH2014 eye score (0-4) was relatively high (r = 0.708, 95% CI: 0.637-0.767, p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of ICCGVHD for NIH 2014 for 233 patients were 94.3% (95% CI: 89.6%-98.1%) and 71.7% (95% CI: 63.0-79.5%), respectively (cutoff value of the ICCGVHD score = 6). The positive predictive value was 77.1% (95% CI: 71.1%-82.1%), and the negative predictive value was 87.0% (95% CI:81.6-92.5%). For the patients with systemic GVHD (n = 171), the sensitivity and specificity were 94.2% and 67.2%, respectively (ICCGVHD-score cutoff value = 6). By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.903 (95% CI: 0.859-0.948). For patients without systemic GVHD (n = 62), the sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 76.7%, respectively (ICCGVHD-score cutoff value = 6). The AUC was 0.891 (95% CI 0.673-1.000). Conclusions: Good sensitivity, specificity, predictive value and correlation were found between ICCGVHD and NIH2014. ICCGVHD scores =6 can be useful to diagnose ocular GVHD with or without systemic GVHD for clinical research.

AB  - Precis: Human corneoscleral rims provide a low cost model and resource to enhance angle based glaucoma surgical training skills. Purpose: To understand the feasibility, utility, and efficacy of a low-cost model for performing anterior chamber angle gonioscopy and micro-surgery on human corneoscleral tissues in wet lab on resident skill enhancement. Methods: Post-keratoplasty residual corneoscleral rims and/or the expired donor corneoscleral buttons were included for the purpose of this study. Initially, inverted rims were used to demonstrate the basic angle anatomy on a slit lamp bio-microscope. Central hazy cornea was then replaced with an artificial cornea and an artificial anterior chamber to simulate indirect gonioscopy, direct gonioscopy, goniotomy, and other angle-based surgeries. Direct gonioscopy and goniotomy exercises (as a means to simulate intraoperative gonioscopy and other angle-based surgeries respectively) were evaluated quantitatively, and the rest qualitatively. Results: A total of 65 residents were included in the exercise. The mean age was 26.69 +/- 1.74 years. Amongst these, 55 ophthalmology residents performed the basic examination, that is, slit lamp mounted angle anatomy examination (n=55) and artificial chamber mounted indirect gonioscopic examination through artificial cornea (n=55). In the second exercise, 10 glaucoma fellows performed the direct gonioscopic and the goniotomy exercises on artificial chamber. The fellows demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in interpretation and surgical skill enhancement concurrent with reduction in time taken with increasing number of attempts (P<0.05). In the third simulation exercise, micro-stent placement within the Schlemm's canal, subconjunctival space, and the suprachoroidal space was re-produced successfully on multiple occasions. Conclusions: The residual human corneoscleral rims proved to be an important resource for teaching both the basic examination skills and those required for transitioning to advanced intraoperative gonioscopy and goniotomy skills. These low cost, easy to adapt models can be incorporated within the curriculum for improved glaucoma training of both the residents and the glaucoma fellows.

AB  - PURPOSE To compare the ocular surface parameters of children with vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) with those of healthy controls and to correlate cytological characteristics with clin-ical findings and disease severity. METHODS Newly diagnosed cases of VKC, not currently being treated, were recruited, along with age-matched controls with no ocular comorbidities. The Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire (OSDI) was administered to all children. Slit lamp biomicroscopy for mei-bomian gland dysfunction and ocular surface analysis was performed, including tear meniscus height, noninvasive tear film break-up time, lipid layer thickness, meibomian gland morphology, and meibomian gland duct distortion on meibography imaging. Conjunctival impression cytology was also performed. RESULTS A total of 68 VKC patients and 33 controls were included. Statistically significant differ-ence was seen in the mean OSDI score (30 +/- 13.7 vs 16.1 +/- 3 [P # 0.01]), lipid layer thick-ness (24.2 +/- 7.9 nm vs 69.9 +/- 15.1 nm [P <0.001]), and noninvasive tear film break-up time (6.8 +/- 1.7 vs 12.5 +/- 1.8 sec [P < 0.01]) between groups. Mean tear meniscus height was 0.22 +/- 0.06 mm in the VKC and 0.24 +/- 0.04 mm in the control group (P = 0.096). Significant association was seen between grade of squamous metaplasia and severity of VKC (P < 0.01). Severity of VKC was found to be positively correlated with OSDI score (r = 0.767), grade of squamous metaplasia (r = 0.64) and negatively correlated with noninvasive tear film break-up time (r =-0.468), and lipid layer thickness (r =-0.253). CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the poor ocular surface health of children with VKC, with severe dis-ease being associated with worse forms of dry eye disease. ( J AAPOS 2022;26:240.e1-6)

AB  - Background: Neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a dreaded complication of chemotherapy. There is scant literature regarding incidence, clinical features, and determinants. The understanding of gut dysbiosis in NEC and pediatric cancer is evolving. Methods: Pediatric cancer patients with neutropenia and gastrointestinal symptoms were evaluated for NEC with contrast-enhanced computed tomography abdomen. Clinical, imaging, and laboratory features were analyzed. Fecal samples were analyzed for fecal calprotectin by sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay and gut microbiota by conventional culture and compared with healthy controls and children without NEC. Results: NEC was diagnosed in 44 children based on clinical and imaging features with incidence of 7.4% (4 had recurrent episodes). Common manifestations included fever (98%), pain abdomen (88%), and diarrhea (83%). Hypoalbuminemia was observed in 78% of patients. Large bowel involvement (94%) with diffuse bowel involvement (63%) and pancolitis (64%) were common. Fecal calprotectin was significantly elevated in NEC group than non-NEC group and healthy controls (median: 87, 53, and 42 mu g/g, respectively). A higher degree of gut dysbiosis was observed in children with NEC with higher isolation of Bacteroides and infrequent isolation of Lactobacilli. Mortality rate of 23% was observed. Only the presence of free fluid predicted higher mortality. Though levels of fecal calprotectin and gut dysbiosis were higher in NEC, they did not increase mortality. Isolation of Bacteroides and absence of Lactobacilli predicted a longer duration of intravenous alimentation. Conclusions: NEC caused significant morbidity and mortality in pediatric cancer patients. Gut dysbiosis was significantly higher in NEC group suggesting a role in pathogenesis and influencing outcome. This highlights the role of targeted interventions towards gut dysbiosis like prebiotics and probiotics.

AB  - Diagnostic investigations of aneurysm, hemorrhagic stroke, and other asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders due to the flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking) phenomenon in the circulatory system of humans and animals on the Earth and in the human spaceflight are active research topics of topical interest {Kumar et al., "boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking leads to hemorrhagic stroke and other neurological disorders in earth and human spaceflight, " Paper presented at the Basic Cardiovascular Sciences Conference, 23-25 August 2021 (American Stroke Association, 2021) [Circ. Res. 129, AP422 (2021)] and "Lopsided blood-thinning drug increases the risk of internal flow choking and shock wave generation causing asymptomatic stroke, " in International Stroke Conference, 19-20 March 2021 (American Stroke Association, 2021) [Stroke 52, AP804 (2021)]}. The theoretical concept of flow choking [Kumar et al., "Lopsided blood-thinning drug increases the risk of internal flow choking leading to shock wave generation causing asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, " Global Challenges 5, 2000076 (2021); "Discovery of nanoscale boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking in cardiovascular system-Exact prediction of the 3D boundary-layer-blockage factor in nanotubes, " Sci. Rep. 11, 15429 (2021); and "The theoretical prediction of the boundary layer blockage and external flow choking at moving aircraft in ground effects, " Phys. Fluids 33(3), 036108 (2021)] in the cardiovascular system (CVS) due to gas embolism is established herein through analytical, in vitro (Kumar et al., "Nanoscale flow choking and spaceflight effects on cardiovascular risk of astronauts-A new perspective, " AIAA Paper No. 2021-0357, 2021), in silico (Kumar et al., "Boundary layer blockage, Venturi effect and cavitation causing aerodynamic choking and shock waves in human artery leading to hemorrhage and massive heart attack-A new perspective, " AIAA Paper No. 2018-3962, 2018), and in vivo animal methodology [Jayaraman et al., "Animal in vivo: The proof of flow choking and bulging of the downstream region of the stenosis artery due to air embolism, " Paper presented at the Basic Cardiovascular Sciences Conference, 25-28 July 2022 (American Heart Association, 2022)]. The boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking phenomenon is a compressible viscous flow effect, and it arises at a critical pressure ratio in continuum/non-continuum real-world yocto to yotta scale flow systems and beyond [Kumar et al., "Universal benchmark data of the three-dimensional boundary layer blockage and average friction coefficient for in silico code verification, " Phys. Fluids 34(4), 041301 (2022)]. The closed-form analytical models, capable of predicting the flow choking in CVS, developed from the well-established compressible viscous flow theory are reviewed and presented herein. The lower-critical flow-choking index of the healthy subject (human being/animal) is predicted through the speciation analysis of blood. The upper-critical flow-choking index is predicted from the specific heat of blood at constant pressure (C-p) and constant volume (C-v), estimated using the Differential Scanning Calorimeter. These flow-choking indexes, highlighted in terms of systolic-to-diastolic blood pressure ratio (SBP/DBP), are exclusively controlled by the biofluid/blood heat capacity ratio (BHCR = C-p/C-v).
   An in vitro study shows that nitrogen (N-2), oxygen (O-2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) gases are predominant in fresh-blood samples of the healthy humans and Guinea pigs at a temperature range of 37-40 & DEG;C (98.6-104 & DEG;F) causing gas embolism. In silico results demonstrated the existence of the biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking, stream tube flow choking, shock wave generation, and pressure overshoot in the downstream region of simulated arteries (with and without stenosis), at a critical pressure ratio, due to gas embolism. The flow choking followed by aneurysm (i.e., bulging of the downstream region of the stenosis artery due to shock wave generation) due to air embolism is demonstrated through small animal in vivo studies. We could corroborate herein, with the animal in vivo and three-dimensional in silico studies, that flow-choking followed by shock wave generation and pressure overshoot occurs in arteries with stenosis due to air embolism at a critical pressure ratio. Analytical models reveal that flow-choking occurs at relatively high and low blood viscosities in CVS at a critical blood pressure ratio (BPR), which leads to memory effect (stroke history/arterial stiffness) and asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases [Kumar et al., "Lopsided blood-thinning drug increases the risk of internal flow choking leading to shock wave generation causing asymptomatic cardiovascular disease, " Global Challenges 5, 2000076 (2021)]. We concluded that an overdose of drug for reducing the blood viscosity enhances the risk of flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking) due to an enhanced boundary layer blockage (BLB) factor because of the rise in Reynolds number (Re) and turbulence. An analytical model establishes that an increase in Re due to the individual or the joint effects of fluid density, fluid viscosity, fluid velocity, and the hydraulic diameter of the vessel creates high turbulence level in CVS instigating an escalated BLB factor heading to a rapid adverse flow choking. Therefore, prescribing the exact blood-thinning course of therapy is crucial for achieving the anticipated curative value and further annulling adverse flow choking (biofluid/boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking) in CVS. We could conclude authoritatively herein, with the animal in vivo studies, that flow choking occurs in the artery with stenosis due to air embolism at a critical BPR (i.e., SBP/DBP = 1.892 9), which is regulated by the heat capacity ratio of air. The cardiovascular risk due to boundary layer blockage persuaded flow choking could be diminished by concurrently reducing the viscosity of biofluid/blood and flow-turbulence. This comprehensive review is a pointer toward achieving relentless unchoked flow conditions (i.e., flow Mach number < 1) in the CVS for prohibiting asymptomatic cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders associated with flow choking and shock wave generation followed by pressure overshoot causing arterial stiffness. The unchoked flow condition can be achieved in every subject (human/animal) by suitably increasing the thermal-tolerance-level in terms of BHCR and/or by reducing the BPR within the pathophysiological range of individual subjects through the new drug discovery, the new companion drug with the conventional blood thinners and/or proper health care management for increasing the healthy-life span of one and all in the universe.

The adaptation of cells to hypoxia appears to be mediated via hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) which is also said to be associated with malignant transformation of epithelial cells in various other carcinomas like prostate and cervical carcinoma. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the role of HIF-1 alpha in progression and malignant transformation of OSMF. Materials and Methods: The study group consisted of histo-pathologically diagnosed 30 cases of oral submucous fibrosis and 10 cases of OSCC were taken as control. The immunohistochemistry was carried out on neutral buffered formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections by using the monoclonal antibody of HIF-1 alpha. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software version 2.0. Results: A gradual and significant rise in the expression of HIF-1 alpha was observed in various grades of OSMF and OSCC cases. HIF 1 alpha expression was increased in cases showing hylanization and constricted blood vessels. A cut off value of 39.6% of HIF-1a positive cells was determined statistically to categorize the cases into high risk and low risk group for malignant transformation. Conclusion: Overexpression of HIF-1a may contribute to the progression and malignant transformation of OSMF. Cases expressing more than 40% of HIF-1 alpha positive cells are at a greater risk for malignant transformation.

AB  - Background: The genome of SARS-CoV-2, is mutating rapidly and continuously challenging the management and preventive measures adopted and recommended by healthcare agencies. The spike protein is the main antigenic site that binds to the host receptor hACE-2 and is recognised by antibodies. Hence, the mutations in this site were analysed to assess their role in differential infectivity of lineages having these mutations, rendering the char-acterisation of these lineages as variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI).Methods: In this work, we examined the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and their phylogenetic re-lationships with the other PANGOLIN lineages. The mutational landscape of WHO characterized variants was determined and mutational diversity was compared amongst the different severity groups. We then computa-tionally studied the structural impact of the mutations in receptor binding domain of the VOCs. The binding affinity was quantitatively determined by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations.Results: The mutational frequency, as well as phylogenetic distance, was maximum in the case of omicron fol-lowed by the delta variant. The maximum binding affinity was for delta variant followed by the Omicron variant. The increased binding affinity of delta strain followed by omicron as compared to other variants and wild type advocates high transmissibility and quick spread of these two variants and high severity of delta variant.Conclusion: This study delivers a foundation for discovering the improved binding knacks and structural features of SARS-CoV-2 variants to plan novel therapeutics and vaccine candidates against the virus.

AB  - Context. Lack of palliative care (PC) awareness is a barrier to its utilization in developing contexts.
   Objectives. To identify and understand strategies that changed awareness of the concepts and value of palliative care in a multi-site quality improvement project in India.
   Methods. The Palliative Care - Promoting Assessment and Improvement of the Cancer Experience (PC-PAICE) evaluation team conducted 44 semi-structured interviews with clinician and organization stakeholders at seven geographically dispersed sites. We used inductive and deductive approaches in this secondary analysis to identify emerging themes.
   Results. We identified the following strategies to improve awareness of concepts and value of palliative care. Strategy 1: Educate medical trainees, staff, and the community about palliative care and its concepts. Sub-strategies: Participate in community events. Integrate PC concepts into early medical education. Standardize training for practitioners. Strategy 2: Design and disseminate India-pecific research to reinforce awareness of the value of palliative care. Sub-strategies: Publish and use India-specific palliative care research. Strategy 3: Facilitate communication between providers and departments to improve awareness of palliative care services and its concepts. Sub-strategies: Create referral frameworks and network with providers referring to palliative care to change awareness of available services and palliative care concepts.
   Conclusion. To increase palliative care utilization, program development can include community and provider-focused efforts on awareness of the concepts and value of palliative care. These three strategies held salience across sites representing diverse Indian geographic and cultural settings; as such, they may be applicable to other contexts.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
KW  - ANXIETY
KW  - DEPRESSION
KW  - SCALE
AB  - Background & objectives: There is a possibility that vaccinated people may experience lesser psychological distress due to the sense of safety felt by them against getting the COVID-19 infection as compared to those who are not vaccinated. However, there is a paucity of research examining the mental health status of this important sub-group of population. Thus, the present study was aimed to examine the pattern of psychological distress and its correlates among people receiving COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: This cross-sectional study assessed individuals receiving COVID-19 vaccine at a tertiary care hospital. Psychological distress and COVID-19-related anxiety were assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale-7, respectively. Results: The study comprised 728 individuals with a mean age of 44.8 yr. Moderate levels of depression, anxiety and stress were reported by about 50, six and 15 per cent of the participants, respectively, as assessed on DASS-21. Generalized linear model and quantile regression analyses revealed COVID-19-related anxiety, and being a healthcare worker or front-line worker as significant correlates of psychological distress. Interpretation & conclusions: About half of the study participants receiving COVID-19 vaccine reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression. Strategies focusing on alleviation of COVID-19-related fear and anxiety might be effective in improving the symptoms of psychological distress.

AB  - Mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNeN) is a recently described entity of the esophagus in the latest (fifth) edition of WHO Classification of Digestive System Tumors. It is often a difficult pathological diagnosis, especially in small preoperative biopsies. We herein report a case of high-grade MiNeN of gastroesophageal junction diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma in preoperative biopsy and subsequently as a high-grade MiNeN in esophagogastrectomy specimen comprising areas of mucoepidermoid carcinoma and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC). This report accentuates the importance of deeper multisite preoperative biopsies as the management is completely different in a MiNeN from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - We herein describe the kissing MVR technique in cases of microspherophakia for safe and effective endocapsular lens aspiration. Microspherophakia is associated with abnormally lax and broken zonules, which pose a great challenge to the operating surgeon, especially while creating the openings in the capsular bag. In this novel technique, simultaneous use of two 23 G MVR blades reduces the above problem associated with the severely mobile lens. Here, one MVR blade stabilizes the capsular bag and, at the same time, provides counter-traction for the opposite MVR blade while puncturing the capsular bag. Furthermore, the creation of openings in the lens at the equator or just posterior to it is beneficial as the capsule is relatively thicker and stronger at this location. This also minimizes the risk of premature extension to the anterior or posterior capsule, thereby avoiding complications like dropped lens matter, vitreous prolapse, and vitreous traction.

AB  - Background & objectives: Studies assessing the spatial and temporal association of ambient air pollution with emergency room visits of patients having acute respiratory symptoms in Delhi are lacking. Therefore, the present study explored the relationship between spatio-temporal variation of particulate matter (PM)(2.5) concentrations and air quality index (AQI) with emergency room (ER) visits of patients having acute respiratory symptoms in Delhi using the geographic information system (GIS) approach. Methods: The daily number of ER visits of patients having acute respiratory symptoms (less than or equal to two weeks) was recorded from the ER of four hospitals of Delhi from March 2018 to February 2019. Daily outdoor PM2.5 concentrations and air quality index (AQI) were obtained from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee. Spatial distribution of patients with acute respiratory symptoms visiting ER, PM2.5 concentrations and AQI were mapped for three seasons of Delhi using ArcGIS software. Results: Of the 70,594 patients screened from ER, 18,063 eligible patients were enrolled in the study. Winter days had poor AQI compared to moderate and satisfactory AQI during summer and monsoon days, respectively. None of the days reported good AQI (<50). During winters, an increase in acute respiratory ER visits of patients was associated with higher PM2.5 concentrations in the highly polluted northwest region of Delhi. In contrast, a lower number of acute respiratory ER visits of patients were seen from the 'moderately polluted' south-west region of Delhi with relatively lower PM(2.5 )concentrations. Interpretation & conclusions: Acute respiratory ER visits of patients were related to regional PM(2.5 )concentrations and AQI that differed during the three seasons of Delhi. The present study provides support for identifying the hotspots and implementation of focused, intensive decentralized strategies to control ambient air pollution in worst-affected areas, in addition to the general city-wise strategies.

AB  - BackgroundHome visitation has emerged as an effective model to provide high-quality care during pregnancy, childbirth, and post-natal period and improve the health outcomes of mother- new born dyad. This 360(0) assessment documented the constraints faced by the community health workers (known as the Accredited Social Health Activists, ASHAs) to accomplish home visitation and deliver quality services in a poor-performing district and co-created the strategies to overcome these using a nexus planning approach. MethodsThe study was conducted in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The grounded theory approach was applied for data collection and analysis using in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with stakeholders representing from health system (including the ASHAs) and the community (rural population). A key group of diverse stakeholders were convened to utilize the nexus planning five domain framework (social-cultural, educational, organizational, economic, and physical) to prioritize the challenges and co-create solutions for improving the home visitation program performance and quality. The nexus framework provides a systemic lens for evaluating the success of the ASHAs home visitation program. ResultsThe societal (caste and economic discrimination), and personal (domestic responsibilities and cultural constraints of working in the village milieu) issues emerged as the key constraints for completing home visits. The programmatic gaps in imparting technical knowledge and skills, mentoring system, communication abilities, and unsatisfactory remuneration system were the other barriers to the credibility of the services. The nexus planning framework emphasized that each of the above factors/domains is intertwined and affects or depends on each other for home-based maternal and newborn care services delivered with quality through the ASHAs. ConclusionThe home visitation program services, quality and impact can be enhanced by addressing the social-cultural, organizational, educational, economic, and physical nexus domains with concurrent efforts for skill and confidence enhancement of the ASHAs and their credibility.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer (CxCa) could result in >62 million lives saved by 2120 if strategy targets are reached and maintained: 90% of adolescent girls receiving prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, 70% of women receiving twice-lifetime cer-vical cancer screening, and 90% of cervical pre-cancer lesions and invasive CxCa treated. However, the cost and complexity of CxCa screening and treatment approaches has hampered scale-up, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and new approaches are needed. Therapeutic HPV vaccines (TxV), which could clear persistent high-risk HPV infection and/or cause regression of pre-cancerous lesions, are in early clinical development and might offer one such approach. During October 2021 to March 2022, WHO, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, convened a series of glo-bal expert consultations to lay the groundwork for understanding the potential value of TxV in the con-text of current CxCa prevention efforts and for defining WHO preferred product characteristics (PPCs) for TxV. WHO PPCs describe preferences for vaccine attributes that would help optimize vaccine value and use in meeting the global public health need. This paper reports on the main discussion points and find-ings from the expert consultations. Experts identified several ways in which TxV might address chal-lenges in current CxCa prevention programmes, but emphasized that the potential value of TxV will depend on their degree of efficacy and how quickly they can be developed and implemented relative to ongoing scale-up of existing interventions. Consultation participants also discussed potential use -cases for TxV, important PPC considerations (e.g., vaccine indications, target populations, and delivery strategies), and critical modelling needs for predicting TxV impact and cost-effectiveness.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of applications related to neurosurgical procedures, education, and training require accurate reconstruction of the involved structures from the medical images such as computed tomography (CT). This study evaluates the quality of CT-based reconstruction of dry skull bones for advanced neurosurgical applications. The accuracy and precision of these models were exam-ined with reference optical scanning.METHODS: Three consecutive CT and optical scans of different skull bones were acquired and used to develop three-dimensional models. The accuracy of three-dimensional models was examined by manual inspection of the defined anatomical landmarks of the skull. Repro-ducibility was examined by deviation analysis of the models developed from repeated CT and optical scans.RESULTS: Precision was excellent in both the tech- -iques with less than 0.1 mm deviation error. On the interscan evaluation of the CT versus optical scan model, deviations of more than 0.1 mm were observed in 16 out of 21 instances. CT reconstruction using standard segmenta-tion algorithms results in missing bone portions while using the default bone segmentation threshold. The seg-mentation threshold was varied to construct missing bone regions, and its effect on the iso-surface generation was evaluated. The threshold variation led to increased mean deviations of surfaces up to 0.6 mm.CONCLUSIONS: The study reveals that bone structure, complexity, and segmentation threshold lead to CT recon-struction variability. The trade-off between the desirable model and accepted mean deviation should be considered as per traits of the desired application.

AB  - Background and purposesRecent developments in high-throughput proteomic approach have shown the potential to discover biomarkers for diagnosing acute stroke and to elucidate the pathomechanisms specific to different stroke subtypes. We aimed to determine blood-based protein biomarkers to diagnose total stroke (IS+ICH) from healthy controls, ischemic stroke (IS) from healthy controls, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from healthy control subjects within 24 h using a discovery-based SWATH-MS proteomic approach. MethodsIn this discovery phase study, serum samples were collected within 24 h from acute stroke (IS & ICH) patients and healthy controls and were subjected to SWATH-MS-based untargeted proteomics. For protein identification, a high-pH fractionated peptide library for human serum proteins (obtained from SCIEX) comprising of 465 proteins was used. Significantly differentially expressed (SDE) proteins were selected using the following criteria: >1.5-fold change for upregulated, < 0.67 for downregulated, p-value < 0.05, and confirmed/tentative selection using Boruta random forest. Protein-protein interaction network analysis and the functional enrichment analysis were conducted using STRING 11 online tool, g:Profiler tool and Cytoscape 3.9.0 software. The statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.2. ResultsOur study included 40 stroke cases (20 IS, 20 ICH) within 24 h and 40 age-, sex-, hypertension-, and diabetes-matched healthy controls. We quantified 375 proteins between the stroke cases and control groups through SWATH-MS analysis. We observed 31 SDE proteins between total stroke and controls, 16 SDE proteins between IS and controls, and 41 SDE proteins between ICH and controls within 24 h. Four proteins [ceruloplasmin, alpha-1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and coagulation factor XIII B chain (F13B)] commonly differentiated total stroke, IS, and ICH from healthy control subjects. The most common significant pathways in stroke cases involved complement and coagulation cascades, platelet degranulation, immune-related processes, acute phase response, lipid-related processes, and pathways related to extracellular space and matrix. ConclusionOur discovery phase study identified potential protein biomarker candidates for the diagnosis of acute stroke and highlighted significant pathways associated with different stroke subtypes. These potential biomarker candidates warrant further validation in future studies with a large cohort of stroke patients to investigate their diagnostic performance.

AB  - BackgroundAlcohol use disorders (AUDs) leading to liver disease is major concern over other spectrum of disorder. Excessive alcohol consumption resulting in leaky gut syndrome is attributed to alcohol-induced liver injury through portal translocation of bacterial endotoxin. Susceptibility to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in AUD patients could be dependent upon genes responsible for inflammation and alcohol metabolism. The pattern recognition receptor CD14 gene is a major player in endotoxin-mediated inflammation and susceptibility to ALD. This study investigated the genetic association of CD14 polymorphisms and other mechanisms relevant to altered inflammatory responses leading to ALD. MethodsPatients with alcohol use disorder with ALD (n = 128) and without liver disease (ALC, n = 184) and controls without alcohol use disorder (NALC, n = 152) from North India were enrolled. The CD4 gene polymorphisms in the North Indian population were evaluated by RFLP and sequencing. Secretory CD14 (sCD14), LBP, TLR4, MD2, TNF alpha, IL1b, IFN gamma, IL6, IL10, and IL4 levels in serum were measured by ELISA among groups. The influence of polymorphisms on CD14 gene promoter activity and circulatory bacterial DNA level was determined. ResultsThe CD14 gene promoter and exonic region SNPs were found to be monomorphic, except for SNP rs2569190 for the North Indian population. The genetic association of SNP rs2569190(C/T) with the risk of developing ALD was found significant for TT genotype [ORTT, 95% CI = 2.19, 1.16-4.13 for ALD vs. ALC and OR, 2.09, 1.18-3.72 for ALD vs. NALC]. An increased sCD14 level was observed in AUD patients compared to NALC control. Increased levels of LBP, TLR4, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, IFN gamma, and IL6 and reduced levels of MD2, IL10, and IL4 were observed among the ALD patients compared to the other two control groups. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the risk genotype TT groups of ALD patients and the ALC group compared to NALC. Promoter activity was observed in the intronic region flanking SNPs and risk genotype can influence reporter activity, indicating CD14 gene expression. ConclusionEnhanced CD14 expression associated with inflammatory responses increases susceptibility to ALD in the TT genotype of AUD patients.

AB  - While considerable information exists on the ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) mutational landscape in AML, the information on TET2 expression is limiting. So, we aimed to study the TET2 expression at mRNA and protein levels in AML patients compared to healthy controls. To achieve this, we recruited 70 non-M3, de novo AML patients and 20 healthy controls. The expression of TET2 was checked at mRNA and protein levels by qPCR and ELISA respectively and the TET activity was checked by the 5-hmC assay. TET2 mRNA expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. We found a significant downregulation of TET2 mRNA and protein and significantly lower DNA 5-hmC levels in AML patients compared to controls. TET2 downregulation was more in patients with high blast counts and patients of the adverse-risk ELN category. We also found a significant upregulation of DNMT1 and DNMT3a suggesting a hypermethylation phenotype in de novo AML.

AB  - Chemotherapy is the standard of care for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. However, its use is associated with severe toxicity and resistance arising mainly due to non-specificity, resulting in disease progression. The advancement in recombinant technology has led to the synthesis of genetically engineered protein polymers like Elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), Silk-like polypeptide (SLP), hybrid protein polymers with specific sequences to impart precisely controlled properties and to target proteins that have provided satisfactory preclinical outcomes. Such protein polymers have been exploited for the formulation and delivery of chemotherapeutics for biomedical applications. The use of such polymers has not only solved the limitation of conventional chemotherapy but has also improved the therapeutic index of typical drug delivery systems. This review, therefore, summarizes the development of such advanced recombinant protein polymers designed to deliver chemotherapeutics and also discusses the key challenges associated with their current usage and their application in the future.

AB  - 2-Halogenatedphenyl benzoxazole-5-carboxylic acids with mono-halogen (chloro, bromo and fluoro) substituted at ortho-, meta- and para-positions on the phenyl ring were designed and synthesized based on significance of presence of halogen in increasing number of marketed halogenated drugs and importance of benzoxazoles. These 2-alogenatedphenylbenzoxazole-5-carboxylic acids and their methyl esters were screened for anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity. 2-(3-Chlorophenyl)benzoxaole-5-carboxylic acid (6b) exhibited significant anti-inflammatory activity with IC50 values of 0.103 mM almost equivalent to the standard drug ibuprofen (0.101 mM). 2-(4-Chlorophenyl)benzoxaole-5-carboxylic acid (6c) showed excellent cytotoxic activity against 22Rv1 cells (human prostate carcinoma epithelial cell lines) with IC50 value of 1.54 mu M better than that of standard drug doxorubicin having IC50 value of 2.32 mu M. More importantly, the selectivity index of this potential molecule was found to be 57.74. Molecular docking analysis resulted in good binding interactions of these compounds with their respective biochemical targets viz. Cyclooxygenase-2 and aldo-keto reductase IC3.

AB  - Mesenchymal tumors are the most common benign neoplasms of the esophagus. Owing to the rarity of these neoplasms, there is a dearth of literature regarding their diagnosis and management. Our 2-decade-long experience in managing these neoplasms surgically is presented. Relevant clinical data of all patients with esophageal mesenchymal neoplasms (EMNs) managed between January 2000 and May 2020 were retrospectively collected from a prospectively maintained esophageal diseases database in the Department of GI Surgery, AIIMS, New Delhi (India). Special emphasis was given to data pertaining to diagnostic evaluation of patients, type of surgery done (enucleation vs. resection), postoperative outcomes, histopathology and long-term follow-up. Nineteen patients (12 females; age 15-66 years) underwent surgery for EMN (mean tumor size 7.6 cm; enucleation 10; resection 9). On histopathological examination, 17 cases were noted to be benign esophageal leiomyomas and 2 were identified as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. There was no perioperative mortality. All cases were followed up for a median duration of 6 years (range 1-19 years) with no evidence of recurrence in any case. Though EMNs are uncommon, they are mostly benign, and the long-term outcomes after surgical excision are gratifying.

AB  - Background: The objectives of this study were to investigate the mutation profiles of targeted genes and copy number variations (CNVs) in normal cytogenetics (CN) pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods: This prospective study was conducted from October 2018 to December 2020. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) and chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) were performed in pediatric CN-AML patients. Results: Out of 94 children (aged <= 18 years), 70 patients with AML (24 excluded) underwent conventional karyotyping/cytogenetic analyses. Forty-five (64.3%) of patients had abnormal/ recurrent cytogenetic abnor-malities and 25 (35.7%) had normal cytogenetics. Twenty-three out of 25 CN-AML were further processed for gene mutation profile and CNVs using NGS and CMA, respectively. Twenty-two out of 23 (95.7%) patients were detected to have mutations in various genes. The common mutations were: NRAS, NPM1, CEBPA, KRAS, KIT, RUNX1, NOTCH1, WT1, GATA1, GATA2, FLT3, KMT2D, FLT3-TKD, and PHF6. Copy number variations (CNVs) were detected in nine patients (39%), and eight (34.8%) had a long contiguous stretch of homozygosity (LCSH) /loss of heterozygosity (LOH). An LCSH was detected on chromosomes 5, 7, 11, and 19. The gains were more common than losses (8 vs 2). The gains were observed on chromosomes 8, 9, 14, 19, 21, and 22, and the losses were detected on chromosomes 7 and 10. Monosomy was observed in three patients. Three patients (mono-somy7, n = 2, and FLT-ITD, n = 1) were reclassified into the high-risk category. Post-induction, complete remission was achieved in all evaluable patients. Conclusion: CN-AML patients have genetic abnormalities that can be detected by more advanced techniques like NGS and CMA. These genetic abnormalities play a role in risk stratification that may remain hidden in otherwise CN-AML.

AB  - Objective To develop a diagnostic algorithm for cystic fibrosis (CF) in the setting of unavailability of sweat chloride, based on clinical features and basic laboratory investigations. Methods In a prospective observational study, we enrolled children with recurrent/persistent pneumonia with either malabsorption or poor growth, undergoing a sweat chloride test, between January 2019 and December 2020. They were simultaneously evaluated for aquagenic wrinkling of hands, stool fat globules, sputum for bacterial culture, blood gas, and serum electrolytes. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for parameters having a significant difference between CF and non-CF groups. Scoring systems and algorithms for the diagnosis of CF were developed. Results Of 134 children enrolled, 46 (34%) had CF. The sensitivity and specificity of various parameters to diagnose CF was: sibling death due to respiratory illness (30.43%, 96.59%), aquagenic wrinkling (76.74%, 47.67%), metabolic alkalosis (17.78%, 94.12%), hyponatremia (28.89%, 89.41%), stool fat globules (38.46%, 81.18%), and presence of Pseudomonas in sputum culture (23.68%, 98.80%). Using coefficients of significant parameters on stepwise logistic regression, the composite score for diagnosis of CF was calculated as: 3X sibling death due to respiratory illness + 1.5X hyponatremia + 1.5X metabolic alkalosis + 1.5X aquagenic wrinkling + 1X stool fat globules + 2.5X presence of Pseudomonas in sputum culture (each of the variables scores 0 or 1 for absence and presence, respectively). The cut-off of >= 2.5 had sensitivity and specificity of 81.82% and 76.83%, respectively. Conclusions In resource-limited settings, the proposed diagnostic algorithm can be used for the diagnosis of presumptive CF with fair sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Background: Radioactive iodine lobar ablation (RAILA) of the contralateral thyroid lobe has been suggested as an alternative to completion thyroidectomy in patients of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who underwent initial hemithyroidectomy. However, data on long-term outcomes are scarce. In this study, we intended to describe the long-term outcomes of RAILA versus completion thyroidectomy in a cohort of low-risk DTC patients.Methods: Data of patients with low-risk DTC who underwent initial hemithyroidectomy, and were subsequently treated with either completion thyroidectomy or RAILA between 1996 and 2015, were collected and analyzed. The treatment outcomes included ablation rate, recurrence rate, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and adverse events, and were validated by propensity score matching analysis.Results: Of the 1243 patients (median age: 34 years, range: 5-78) with low-risk DTC, 514 patients underwent upfront RAILA while 729 patients underwent completion thyroidectomy followed by remnant ablation. The ablation rate following the first radioactive iodine (I-131) cycle was 75.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71.3-78.9] in the RAILA group versus 84.1% [CI 81.2-86.6] in the completion thyroidectomy group (p < 0.001). Over median follow-up of 11.4 years (interquartile range: 8.3-15.8), the recurrence rates between the two groups were not significantly different (1.6% [CI 0.7-3.2] vs. 1.0% [CI 0.4-2.1], respectively, p = 0.343). The product limit estimate of RFS at 10 years was 98.6% [CI 97.6-99.6%] in the RAILA group versus 99.1% [CI 98.3-99.9%] in the completion thyroidectomy group (p = 0.391). The outcomes in 497 matched pairs generated through propensity score analysis were similar. None of the patients in the RAILA group experienced permanent hypocalcemia or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, while the corresponding rates in the completion thyroidectomy group were 10/729 (1.4%) (p = 0.006) and 5/729 (0.7%) (p = 0.080), respectively. Radiation thyroiditis was seen in 25/514 (4.9%) patients in the RAILA group versus 3/729 (0.4%) in the completion thyroidectomy group (p < 0.001).Conclusions: Upfront RAILA is seen to be a noninvasive, safe, and effective alternative to surgical completion thyroidectomy in low-risk DTC patients in the absence of macroscopic malignancy in the remaining thyroid lobe.

AB  - Purpose Bile duct injuries (BDIs) are the potential grievous complications of cholecystectomy that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of BDI management depend on multiple factors such as the type and extent of injury, timing of repair, and surgical expertise. The present retrospective study was conducted to analyse the risk factors associated with the BDI repair outcomes. Methods The data of patients having primary or recurrent bile duct stricture following BDI from 1985 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated. Results A total of 268 patients underwent hepaticojejunostomy (HJ). Of the total, 218 patients had primary bile duct stricture, and 50 patients had HJ stricture. The most commonly performed procedure for primary BDI was Roux-en-Y HJ (RYHJ), followed by right hepatectomy, right posterior sectionectomy, and left hepatectomy. All patients with strictured HJ underwent RYHJ, except one who underwent a right hepatectomy. Outcome assessment using the McDonald grading system showed that 62%, 27%, 5%, and 6% of patients with primary bile duct stricture had grade A, grade B, grade C, and grade D complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 3.21%, whereas 46%, 34%, and 18% patients with strictured HJ had grade A, grade B, and grade C complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 2%. High-up biliary strictures, early repair, and blood loss > 350 mL are the surrogate markers for failure of repair. Conclusion Management of BDI needs a multidisciplinary approach. The outcomes of both primary biliary stricture and strictured HJ can be improved with management of patients in a tertiary care centre. However, attempts to repair within 2 weeks of injury, Strasberg E-4 and E-5, and blood loss of > 350 mL may have an adverse effect on the outcome of HJ.

AB  - Background: Small Extracellular vesicles (EV) are emerging as crucial intercellular messengers that contribute to the physiological processes. EVs contain numerous functional proteins and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and have different roles depending on their origin. Functionally, EVs transfer these biological ma-terials from the parent cell to the recipient and thus exhibits a novel therapeutic platform for delivering ther-apeutics molecules to the target tissue. In this regard, EVs derived from stem cells such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells and iPSCs have demonstrated a higher ability to benefit regenerative medicine. Even though these stem cells share some common properties, due to the differences in their origin (cell sources, the hierarchy of potency, etc) the EVs cargo profiling and functionality may vary.Method: We used iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of EVs derived from iPSCs and various tissue-specific MSCs in this study. Additionally, the data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic tools, including ProteinPilot for peptide and protein identification and quantification; Funrich, GO, Reactome, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment; the STRING database, and the inBio Discover tool for identifying known and predicted Protein-Protein networks.Results: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 223 differentially expressed proteins in these EVs; however, Wharton's jelly MSC-EV contained more exclusive proteins with higher protein expression levels. Additionally, 113 proteins were abundant in MSC-EVs, while others were shared between MSC-EVs and iPSC-EVs. Further, based on an in-depth examination of the proteins, their associated pathways, and their interactions with other proteins, it was determined that these proteins are involved in bone regeneration (9.3%), wound healing (4.4%), immune regulation (8.9%), cardiac regeneration (6.6%), neuro regeneration (8.9%), and hepatic regeneration (3.5%). Conclusion: Overall, the results of our proteomic analysis indicate that EVs derived from MSCs have a more robust profile of proteins with higher expression levels than iPSCs. This is a significant finding, as it demonstrates the critical therapeutic role of EVs in a variety of diseases, as demonstrated by enrichment analysis, their versatility, and broad application potential.

AB  - Pathological low birth weight due to fetal growth restriction (FGR) is an important predictor of adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes. It is more common amongst native lowlanders when gestating in the hypoxic environment of high altitude, whilst populations who have resided at high altitude for many generations are relatively protected. Genetic study of pregnant populations at high altitude permits exploration of the role of hypoxia in FGR pathogenesis, and perhaps of FGR pathogenesis more broadly. We studied the umbilical cord blood DNA of 316 neonates born to pregnant women managed at the Sonam Norboo Memorial Hospital, Ladakh (altitude 3540m) between February 2017 and January 2019. Principal component, admixture and genome wide association studies (GWAS) were applied to dense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genetic data, to explore ancestry and genetic predictors of low birth weight. Our findings support Tibetan ancestry in the Ladakhi population, with subsequent admixture with neighboring Indo-Aryan populations. Fetal growth protection was evident in Ladakhi neonates. Although no variants achieved genome wide significance, we observed nominal association of seven variants across genes (ZBTB38, ZFP36L2, HMGA2, CDKAL1, PLCG1) previously associated with birthweight.

AB  - The POTE family comprises 14 paralogues and is primarily expressed in Prostate, Placenta, Ovary, Testis, Embryo (POTE), and cancerous cells. The prospective function of the POTE protein family under physiological conditions is less understood. We systematically analyzed their cellular localization and molecular docking analysis to elucidate POTE proteins' structure, function, and Adaptive Divergence. Our results suggest that group three POTE paralogs (POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, POTEJ, and POTEKP (a pseudogene)) exhibits significant variation among other members could be because of their Adaptive Divergence. Furthermore, our molecular docking studies on POTE protein revealed the highest binding affinity with NCI-approved anticancer compounds. Additionally, POTEE, POTEF, POTEI, and POTEJ were subject to an explicit molecular dynamic simulation for 50ns. MM-GBSA and other essential electrostatics were calculated that showcased that only POTEE and POTEF have absolute binding affinities with minimum energy exploitation. Thus, this study's outcomes are expected to drive cancer research to successful utilization of POTE genes family as a new biomarker, which could pave the way for the discovery of new therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: End points to determine the efficacy and safety of medical therapies for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are evolving. Given the heterogeneity in current outcome measures, harmonizing end points in a core outcome set for randomized controlled trials is a priority for drug development in inflammatory bowel disease. METHODS: Candidate outcome domains and outcome measures were generated from systematic literature reviews and patient engagement surveys and interviews. An iterative Delphi process was conducted to establish consensus: panelists anonymously voted on items using a 9-point Likert scale, and feedback was incorporated between rounds to refine statements. Consensus meetings were held to ratify the outcome domains and core outcome measures. Stakeholders were recruited internationally, and included gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, methodologists, and clinical trialists. RESULTS: A total of 235 patients and 53 experts participated. Patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, endoscopy, biomarkers, and safety were considered core domains; histopathology was an additional domain for UC. In CD, there was consensus to use the 2-item patient-reported outcome (ie, abdominal pain and stool frequency), Crohn's Disease Activity Index, Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and co-primary end points of symptomatic remission and endoscopic response. In UC, there was consensus to use the 9-point Mayo Clinic Score, fecal urgency, Robarts Histopathology Index or Geboes Score, fecal calprotectin, and a composite primary end point including both symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Safety outcomes should be reported using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary collaboration involving patients and clinical experts has produced the first core outcome set that can be applied to randomized controlled trials of CD and UC.

AB  - Background and aim We assessed the anatomical variations in coronary arterial patterns relative to the techniques of reimplantation in the setting of the arterial switch operation, relating the variations to influences on outcomes. Methods We reviewed pertinent published investigations, assessing events reported following varied surgical techniques for reimplantation of the coronary arteries in the setting of the arterial switch procedure. Results The prevalence of reported adverse events, subsequent to reimplantation, varied from 2% to 11%, with a bimodal presentation of high early and low late incidence. The intramural pattern continues to contribute to mortality, with some reports of 28% fatality. The presence of abnormal course relative to the arterial pedicles in the setting of single sinus origin was associated with a three-fold increase in mortality. Abnormal looping with bisinusal origin of arteries was not associated with increased risk. Conclusion The techniques of transfer of the coronary arteries can be individually adapted to cater for the anatomical variations. Cardiac surgeons, therefore, need to be familiar with the myriad creative options available to achieve successful repair when there is challenging anatomy. Long-term follow-up will be required to affirm the superiority of any specific individual technique. Detailed multiplanar computed-tomographic scanning can now reveal all the variants, and elucidate the mechanisms of late complications. Coronary angioplasty or surgical revascularization may be considered in selected cases subsequent to the switch procedure.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus (DM) alters immune responses and given the rising prevalence of DM in tuberculosis (TB) endemic countries; hyperglycemia can be a potential risk factor for active TB development. However, the impact of hyperglycemia on TB-specific innate immune response in terms of macrophage functions remains poorly addressed. We assessed macrophage effector functions in uncontrolled DM patients with or without TB infection (PTB+DM and DM), non-diabetic TB patients (PTB), and non-diabetic-uninfected controls. Phagocytic capacity against BCG and surface expression of different pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (CD11b, CD14, CD206, MARCO, and TLR-2) were measured via flow cytometry. Effector molecules (ROS and NO) required for bacterial killing were assessed via DCFDA and Griess reaction respectively. A systematic dysregulation in phagocytic capacity with concurrent alterations in the expression pattern of key PRRs (CD11b, MARCO, and CD206) was observed in PTB+DM. These altered PRR expressions were associated with decreased phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Similarly, ROS was aberrantly higher while NO was lower in PTB+DM. These altered macrophage functions were positively correlated with increasing disease severity. Our results highlight several key patterns of immune dysregulation against TB infection under hyperglycemic conditions and highlight a negative impact of hyperglycemia with etiology and progression of TB.

AB  - The disruption and overexpression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT signaling pathway in cancer results in tumor growth, metastasis, and survival. Treatment with common anthracyclines has confirmed cancer cells' dependence on PI3K pathway through overexpression of AKT. Moreover, combining HDAC inhibitor with anthracycline has shown the targeting of breast cancer stem cells. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that the co-delivery of PI3-K delta/HDAC6 dual inhibitor with Epirubicin using polymeric nanoparticle could increase the anti-cancer treatment efficacy with reduced toxicity. Pluronic modified polylactic acid block copolymer (quatramer) was used for encapsulation of PI3-K delta/HDAC6 and Epirubicin. The co-encapsulated nanoparticles, PI3-K delta/HDAC6-Epi-NPs have shown size of 99 +/- 3 nm, PDI of 0.18 +/- 0.07 with a sustained and slow-release profile in non-physiological buffer (PBS, pH 7.4). The in-vitro cell proliferation inhibition studies done on 2D and 3D culture of breast cancer cell lines have confirmed the synergistic effect of PI3-K delta/HDAC6-Epi-NPs with lower IC50 values compared to PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NPs and Epi-NPs. Additionally, intravenous twice a week treatment for three weeks with PI3-K delta/HDAC6-Epi-NPs resulted in complete tumor eradication in the syngeneic breast tumor mice model. In comparison, the PI3-K delta/HDAC6-NPs and Epi-NPs result in tumor growth inhibition of 15.86% and 81.59%, respectively. These studies predicted that clinical use of PI3-K delta/HDAC6-Epi-NPs will be effective in breast cancer treatments.

AB  - Background The population of patients with cancer requiring palliative care (PC) is on the rise in India. Family caregivers will be essential members of the care team in the provision of PC.
   Objective We aimed to characterize provider perspectives of the challenges that Indian families face in taking on a palliative caregiving role.
   Method Data for this analysis came from an evaluation of the PC-PAICE project, a series of quality improvement interventions for PC in India. We conducted 44 in-depth semi-structured interviews with organizational leaders and clinical team members at seven geographically and structurally diverse settings. Through thematic content analysis, themes relating to the caregivers' role were identified using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches.
   Result Contextual challenges to taking up the PC caregiving role included family members' limited knowledge about PC and cancer, the necessity of training for caregiving responsibilities, and cultural preferences for pursuing curative treatments over palliative ones. Some logistical challenges include financial, time, and mental health limitations that family caregivers may encounter when navigating the expectations of taking on the caregiving role. Strategies to facilitate family buy-in for PC provision include adopting a family care model, connecting them to services provided by Non-Governmental Organizations, leveraging volunteers and social workers to foster PC awareness and training, and responding specifically to family's requests.
   Conclusion Understanding and addressing the various challenges that families face in adopting the caregiver role are essential steps in the provision and expansion of PC in India. Locally initiated quality improvement projects can be a way to address these challenges based on the context.

AB  - Background: Available anti-seizure medications (ASMs) target the symptomatology of the disease rather than any significant disease/epileptogenesis modifying actions. There are critical concerns of drug resistance and seizure recurrence during epilepsy management. So, drug repurposing is evolving as a paradigm change in the quest for novel epilepsy treatment strategies. Metformin, a well-known anti-diabetic drug has shown multiple pieces of evidence of its potential antiepileptic action.Objective: This review elucidates various mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of metformin in seizure control and modulation of the epileptogenesis process.Methods: Preclinical and clinical evidence involving metformin's role in epilepsy and special conditions like tuberous sclerosis have been reviewed in this paper. The putative mechanisms of epileptogenesis modulation through the use of metformin are also summarised. Results: This review found the efficacy of metformin in different seizure models including genetic knockout model, chemical induced, and kindling models. Only one clinical study of metformin in tuberous sclerosis has shown a reduction in seizure frequency and tumor volume compared to placebo. The suggested mechanisms of metformin relevant to epileptogenesis modulation mainly encompass AMPK activation, mTOR inhibition, pro-tection against blood-brain-barrier disruption, inhibition of neuronal apoptosis, and reduction of oxidative stress. In addition to seizure protection, metformin has a potential role in attenuating adverse effects associated with epilepsy and ASMs such as cognition and memory impairment.Conclusion: Metformin has shown promising utility in epilepsy management and epileptogenesis modulation. The evidence in this review substantiates the need for a robust clinical trial to explore the efficacy and safety of metformin in persons with epilepsy.

AB  - Background Testing of factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with rheumatic heart disease-associated atrial fibrillation has been limited.
   Methods We enrolled patients with atrial fibrillation and echocardiographically documented rheumatic heart disease who had any of the following: a CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score of at least 2 (on a scale from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicating a higher risk of stroke), a mitral-valve area of no more than 2 cm(2), left atrial spontaneous echo contrast, or left atrial thrombus. Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard doses of rivaroxaban or dose-adjusted vitamin K antagonist. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, or death from vascular (cardiac or noncardiac) or unknown causes. We hypothesized that rivaroxaban therapy would be noninferior to vitamin K antagonist therapy. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding according to the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis.
   Results Of 4565 enrolled patients, 4531 were included in the final analysis. The mean age of the patients was 50.5 years, and 72.3% were women. Permanent discontinuation of trial medication was more common with rivaroxaban than with vitamin K antagonist therapy at all visits. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 560 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 446 in the vitamin K antagonist group had a primary-outcome event. Survival curves were nonproportional. The restricted mean survival time was 1599 days in the rivaroxaban group and 1675 days in the vitamin K antagonist group (difference, -76 days; 95% confidence interval [CI], -121 to -31; P<0.001). A higher incidence of death occurred in the rivaroxaban group than in the vitamin K antagonist group (restricted mean survival time, 1608 days vs. 1680 days; difference, -72 days; 95% CI, -117 to -28). No significant between-group difference in the rate of major bleeding was noted.
   Conclusions Among patients with rheumatic heart disease-associated atrial fibrillation, vitamin K antagonist therapy led to a lower rate of a composite of cardiovascular events or death than rivaroxaban therapy, without a higher rate of bleeding.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MSC-Exos) have been utilized as medicinal agents or as delivery vehicles in cartilage injuries and cartilage-based diseases. Given the ongoing emergence of evidence on the effector mechanisms and methods of the utility of the MSC-Exos in knee osteoarthritis, a comprehensive review of the current evidence is the need of the hour. Hence, in this article, we review the current understanding of the role of MSC-Exos in the management of knee osteoarthritis in view of their classification, characterization, biogenesis, mechanism of action, pathways involved in their therapeutic action, in-vitro evidence on cartilage regeneration, in-vivo evidence in OA knee models and recent advances in using MSC-Exos to better streamline future research from bench to bedside for OA knee.

AB  - Introduction: Morphine is widely used in patients and has been reported to alter seizure threshold, but its role in the development of epilepsy is unknown. In this study, role of morphine administration in the development of epilepsy using the status epilepticus (SE) model was determined in rats.Methods: Rats experiencing SE with lithium-pilocarpine (LiP) were randomized into four groups- saline, morphine low dose (5 mg/kg, s.c.), morphine high dose (5-20 mg/kg, s.c.), and naloxone (1 mg/kg, s.c.). Treatments were started 90 min after termination of SE and repeated twice daily for next three days. Rats were video monitored daily for 21 days to determine onset and frequency of spontaneous convulsive sei-zures (SS).Results: Morphine in low doses increased frequency of SS (1.51 +/- 0.15 vs LiP 0.60 +/- 0.12 seizures/rat/day, p-value = 0.0026) and seizures occurred during handling (SDH) (0.08 +/- 0.02 vs LiP control 0.01 +/- 0.01) (p -value = 0.0018). In high doses, no significant change in SS and SDH was found as compared to LiP. No effect of morphine on the onset of SS and percentage of rats experienced SS was found. No effect of nalox-one per se was found on SS. Conclusion: Morphine administration after SE does not affect epileptogenesis as no change in the onset of SS and percentage of rats experiencing SS was found. However, it might alter the susceptibility and fre-quency of SS. As no other study is available with a similar finding, it needs further evaluation.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a ubiquitous bacterium and contributes significantly to the burden of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer across the world. Adaptive phenotypes and virulence factors in H. pylori are heterogeneous and dynamic. However, limited information is available about the molecular nature of antimi-crobial resistance phenotypes and virulence factors of H. pylori strains circulating in India. In the present study, we analyzed the whole genome sequences of 143 H. pylori strains, of which 32 are isolated from two different regions (eastern and southern) of India. Genomic repertoires of individual strains show distinct region-specific signatures. We observed lower resistance phenotypes and genotypes in the East Indian (Kolkata) H. pylori iso-lates against amoxicillin and furazolidone antibiotics, whereas higher resistance phenotypes to metronidazole and clarithromycin. Also, at molecular level, a greater number of AMR genes were observed in the east Indian H. pylori isolates as compared to the southern Indian isolates. From our findings, we suggest that metronidazole and clarithromycin antibiotics should be used judicially in the eastern India. However, no horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance gene was observed in the current H. pylori strains. The comparative genome analysis shows that the number of genes involved in virulence, disease and resistance of H. pylori isolated from two different regions of India is significantly different. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based phylogenetic analysis distinguished H. pylori strains into different clades according to their geographical locations. Condi-tionally beneficial functions including antibiotic resistance phenotypes that are linked with faster evolution rates in the Indian isolates.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The use of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent plasma (CCP) in the treatment of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 infection has been controversial. Early administration of CCP before hospital admission offers a potential advantage. This manuscript summarizes current trials of early use of CCP and explores the feasibility of this approach in different countries.
   Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to the International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT) CCP working group. We recorded respondents' input on existing trials on early/outpatient CCP and out-of-hospital (OOH)/home transfusion (HT) practices in their countries and feedback on challenges in initiating home CCP infusion programmes. In addition, details of existing trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov were summarized.
   Results: A total of 31 country representatives participated. Early/OOH CCP transfusion studies were reported in the United States, the Netherlands, Spain and Brazil. There were a total of six published and five ongoing trials on the prophylactic and therapeutic early use of CCP. HT was practised in Australia, the UK, Belgium, France, Japan, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Norway, the United States and some provinces in Canada. Thirty-four representatives indicated a lack of OOH CCP or HT in their institutions and countries. Barriers to implementation of OOH/HT included existing legislation, lack of policies pertaining to outpatient transfusion, and associated logistical challenges, including lack of staffing and resources.
   Conclusion: Early administration of CCP remains a potential option in COVID-19 management in countries with existing OOH/HT programmes. Legislation and regulatory bodies should consider OOH/HT practice for transfusion in future pandemics.

AB  - Introduction The aim of the study was to evaluate the differences in the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)-based glycemic parameters between women with normoglycemia and early gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) identified on the basis of mild fasting plasma glucose elevation (FPG, 5.1-5.5 mmol/L) and/or post-load plasma glucose elevation (PLG, 1-h >= 10.0 mmol/L or 2-h >= 8.5 mmol/L). Methods This cross-sectional study included women with singleton pregnancy (8(+0) to 19(+6) weeks of gestation) and normoglycemia or GDM per World Health Organization (WHO) 2013 criteria. We evaluated the glycemic parameters of clinical interest using blinded CGMS evaluation and reported them per standard methodology proposed by Hernandez et al. Results A total of 87 women (GDM, n = 38) were enrolled at 28.6 +/- 4.5 years. Among women with GDM, 10 (26.3%) had isolated mild FPG elevation (5.1-5.5 mmol/L), 10 (26.3%) had isolated PLG elevation (1-h >= 10.0 mmol/L or 2-h >= 8.5 mmol/L), and 7 (18.4%) had a combination of both. The remaining 11 (28.9%) had elevated FPG (>= 5.6 mmol/L) with or without PLG elevation. Thus, when an isolated FPG cutoff >= 5.6 mmol/L is used to diagnose GDM, 27 (71.0%) women would be perceived as normoglycemic. Such women had significantly higher CGMS parameters of clinical interest, such as 24-h mean glucose, fasting glucose, 1-h and 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), 1-h PPG excursion, and peak PPG. Conclusions An isolated FPG threshold, especially the higher cutoff >= 5.6 mmol/L, can potentially miss a large proportion of women (nearly three-fourths) diagnosed with GDM per WHO 2013 criteria. Eventually, such women fare significantly differently from normoglycemic women in various CGMS parameters of clinical interest.

AB  - Pregestational diabetes (PGDM) leads to developmental impairment, especially cardiac dysfunction, in their offspring. The hyperglycemic microenvironment inside the uterus alters the cardiac plasticity characterized by electrical and structural remodeling of the heart. The altered expression of several transcription factors due to hyperglycemia during fetal development might be responsible for molecular defects and phenotypic changes in the heart. The molecular mechanism of the developmental defects in the heart due to PGDM remains unclear. To understand the molecular defects in the 2-days old neonatal rats, streptozotocin-induced diabetic female rats were bred with healthy male rats. We collected 2-day-old hearts from the neonates and identified the molecular basis for phenotypic changes. Neonates from diabetic mothers showed altered electrocardiography and echocardiography parameters. Transcriptomic profiling of the RNA-seq data revealed that several altered genes were associated with heart development, myocardial fibrosis, cardiac conduction, and cell proliferation. Histopathology data showed the presence of focal cardiac fibrosis and increased cell proliferation in neonates from diabetic mothers. Thus, our results provide a comprehensive map of the cellular events and molecular pathways perturbed in the neonatal heart during PGDM. All of the molecular and structural changes lead to developmental plasticity in neonatal rat hearts and develop cardiac anomalies in their early life.

AB  - In this study, we present an efficient Graph Convolutional Network based Risk Stratification system (GCRS) for cancer risk-stage prediction of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) patients. GCRS is a hybrid graph convolutional network consisting of a fusion of multiple connectivity graphs that are used to learn the latent representation of topological structures among patients. This proposed risk stratification system integrates these connectivity graphs prepared from the clinical and laboratory characteristics of NDMM cancer patients for partitioning them into three cancer risk groups: low, intermediate, and high. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCRS outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of C-index and hazard ratio on two publicly available datasets of NDMM patients. We have statistically validated our results using the Cox Proportional-Hazards model, Kaplan-Meier analysis, and log-rank test on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We have also evaluated the contribution of various clinical parameters as utilized by the GCRS risk stratification system using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis, an interpretability algorithm for validating AI methods. Our study reveals the utility of the deep learning approach in building a robust system for cancer risk stage prediction.

AB  - Structural and conformational insights of a putative beta-1,4-xylosidase (PsGH43F) of glycoside hydrolase family 43 from Pseudopedobacter saltans were investigated by computational and Circular Dichroism (CD) analyses. PsGH43F was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and the purified enzyme gave the size similar to 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE analysis. Multiple Sequence Alignment of PsGH43F sequence followed by superposition of modeled structure with homologous structures displayed the presence of three conserved catalytic amino acid residues, Asp33, Asp149 and Glu212. The secondary structure analysis by CD showed 2.72 % alpha-helix and 36.06 % beta-strands. The homology modeled structure of PsGH43F displayed a 5-bladed beta-propeller fold for catalytic module at N-terminal and a beta-sandwich structure for CBM6 at the C-terminal. Ramachandran plot displayed 99.5 % of residues in the allowed regions. MD simulation of PsGH43F revealed the compactness and stability of the structure. Molecular docking studies of PsGH43F with xylo-oligosaccharides revealed its maximum binding affinity for xylobiose. MD simulation of PsGH43F-xylobiose complex confirmed the increased structural and conformational stability in presence of substrate. The Hydrodynamic diameter analysis of PsGH43F by DLS was in the range, 0.25-0.28 mu m.

AB  - Pulmonary fibrosis is the key feature of majority of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) as well as many patients with post-COVID-19. The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis is a complex molecular process that involves myriad of cells, proteins, genes, and regulatory elements. The non-coding RNA mainly miRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA are among the key regulators of many protein coding genes and pathways that are involved in pulmonary fibrosis. Identification and molecular mechanisms, by which these non-coding RNA molecules work, are crucial to understand the molecular basis of the disease. Additionally, elucidation of molecular mechanism could also help in deciphering a potential diagnostic/prognostic marker as well as therapeutic targets for IIPs and post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis. In this review, we have provided the latest findings and discussed the role of these regulatory elements in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis associated with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia and Covid-19.

AB  - BackgroundDiagnostic ultrasound has long been a part of a physician's armamentarium, but transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging treatment of neurological disorders. Consequently, the literature in this field is increasing at a rapid pace. ObjectiveThis analysis was aimed to identify the top-cited articles on FUS to discern their origin, spread, current trends highlighting future impact of this novel neurosurgical intervention. MethodsWe searched the Web of Science database on 28th May 2021 and identified the top 100 cited articles. These articles were analyzed with various scientometric parameters like the authors, corresponding authors, country of corresponding author, journal of publication, year of publication. Citation based parameters including total citations, mean citations per article and mean citations, citation count, and the citation per year, citations per year and co-authors per document were studied as well in addition to Hirsch h-index, g-index, m-index, Bradford's Law, Lotka's law and Collaboration index. ResultsThe 100 top-cited articles were published between 1998 and 2019 in 45 different journals. The average citations per document and citations per document per year were 97.78 and 12.47, respectively. The most prolific authors were Hynynen K (Medical Biophysics-Toronto), Elias WJ (Neurosurgery-Virginia), Zadicario (InSightec). The Journal of Neurosurgery published the most top-cited articles (n = 11), and most articles originated from the United States, followed by Canada. Among individual institutions, the University of Toronto was the most productive. ConclusionFUS is an emerging treatment of neurological disorders. With its increasing application, the FUS literature is increasing rapidly. Eleven countries contributed to the top 100 cited articles, with the top 2 countries (the United States and Canada) contributing to more than half of these articles.

AB  - The radial position of the flax fibers as reinforcement and polypropylene (pp) fibers as matrix was altered using friction spinning in three distinctive sequences from core to sheath, namely, (a) pp-flax-flax-pp (PFFP), (b) flax-pp-flax-pp (FPFP), and (c) flax-flax-pp-pp (FFPP). Interestingly, at the towpregs stage, PFFP demonstrated higher tensile characteristics than FPFP and FFPP. The towpregs were consolidated to yield three unidirectional composites (UDCs), namely, UDC-PFFP, UDC-FPFP, and UDC-FFPP, using compression molding. The tensile strength of the composites (sigma(UDC-)(FFPP) > sigma(UDC)(-FPFP) > sigma(UDC-)(PFFP)) was contrary to the breaking load (f) of the corresponding towpregs (f(FFPP) < f(FPFP) < f(PFFP)) which necessitated the current investigation. Remarkably, the UDC with the lowest tensile as well as interla mina r shear strength i.e. UDC-PFFP, yielded the maximum energy absorption in Charpy and Notch impact tests. In the towpreg, the flax fibers when placed at the core position, slid over each other resulting in poor strength in FFPP while post-curing the pp matrix impregnated the core flax fibers in UDC-FFPP, resulting in the highest strength amongst the three UDCs in tensile and flexural modes. Micro-computed tomography (mu CT) was carried out to confirm the same. Thus, the user can select the requisite fiber-matrix radial positions within towpreg to suit the ultimate applications.

AB  - Purpose: The choice of Esophageal replacement (ER) depends on surgeons' preference and patients' anatomical condition. A cross-sectional study was done to compare the long-term outcomes of two meth-ods of ER, Gastric transposition (GT) and Colonic interposition (CI).Methods: Children who had undergone ER from January 1997 to December 2017 with a minimum of two-year post-ER follow-up were evaluated by anthropometry, hepatobiliary scintigraphy, gastroesophageal reflux study, gastric emptying test, pulmonary function test and blood tests.Results: Twenty-six (Male:female = 17:9) children were recruited. The median age at ER was 13 months (interquartile range 9-40 months) and mean follow-up post-ER was 116.7 +/- 76.4 months (range 24-247 months). GT:CI was done in 15(57.7%):11(42.3%) cases. A greater number of abnormal oral contrast studies ( p = 0.02) and re-operations ( p = 0.05) were documented as baseline characteristics with CI group. The presence of gastroesophageal reflux 9/23(39.1%), duodenogastric reflux 6/24(25%), delayed gastric emp-tying 6/25(24%), abnormal pulmonary function test 14/22(63.6%) were documented during the study pe-riod. However, there was no significant(p > 0.05) difference in nutritional, developmental and functional outcomes of both operative methods of ER in the study.Conclusion: Assessment of nutritional, developmental and functional parameters in children after ER re-veals good long-term results. There was no significant difference in CI and GT. Level of evidence: Comparative study; II (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background The economic burden of autism is substantial and includes a range of costs, including healthcare, education, productivity losses, informal care and respite care, among others. In India, approximately, 2 million children aged 2-9 years have autism. Given the likely substantial burden of illness and the need to identify effective and cost-effective interventions, this research aimed to produce a comprehensive cost of illness inventory (COII) suitable for children with autism in South Asia (India) to support future research. Methods A structured and iterative design process was followed to create the COII, including literature reviews, interviews with caregivers, pilot testing and translation. Across the development of the COII, thirty-two families were involved in the design and piloting of the tool. The COII was forward translated (from English to Hindi) and back translated. Each stage of the process of development of the COII resulted in the further refinement of the tool. Results Domains covered in the final COII include education, childcare, relocation, healthcare contacts (outpatient, inpatient, medical emergencies, investigations and medication), religious retreats and rituals, specialist equipment, workshops and training, special diet, support and care, certification, occupational adjustments and government rebates/schemes. Administration and completion of the COII determined it to be feasible to complete in 35 minutes by qualified and trained researchers. The final COII is hosted by REDCap Cloud and is a bilingual instrument (Hindi and English). Conclusions The COII was developed using experiences gathered from an iterative process in a metropolitan area within the context of one low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting, India. Compared to COII tools used for children with autism in high-income country settings, additional domains were required, such as complimentary medication (e.g. religious retreats and homeopathy). The COII will allow future research to quantify the cost of illness of autism in India from a broad perspective and will support relevant economic evaluations. Understanding the process of developing the questionnaire will help researchers working in LMICs needing to adapt the current COII or developing similar questionnaires.

AB  - Background Incomplete combustion of wood releases toxic chemicals. Exposure to these chemicals during charcoal production can modulate redox status of cellular system which may further lead to genomic instability and of antioxidant enzymes. Genetic polymorphism may alter the functioning properties of these enzymes and modulate the response to oxidative stress. Methods In this study, we analyzed the link between genetic polymorphism and enzyme activity for antioxidant enzymes: MnSOD and GPx-1 in charcoal workers and control population. This study included 77 charcoal workers and 79 demographically matched healthy control subjects. This association was studied using multiple linear regression, adjusted for confounding factors viz. age, consumption habits and exposure duration. Results SOD activity was lower for TT genotype (3.47 +/- 0.66; 5.92 +/- 1.08) versus CC genotype (3.47 +/- 0.66; 6.67 +/- 1.60) in control and charcoal workers respectively. Significant lower GPx-1 activity was found in leu/leu genotype (7.25 +/- 0.38; 3.59 +/- 0.57) when compared to pro/pro genotype (7.78 +/- 0.59; 4.28 +/- 0.71) and pro/leu genotype (8.48 +/- 0.34; 4.30 +/- 0.76) in control population and charcoal workers respectively. A significant difference in the levels of 1-Hydroxypyrene (biomarker of exposure) and SOD and GPx-1 activity (biomarkers of oxidative stress) was evident in exposed group in comparison to the control one. Conclusion Collectively, our findings suggested that PAH influenced the mode of action of SOD and GPx-1 which were impacted by polymorphism in SOD and GPx-1 gene. Hence, polymorphism of MnSOD and GPx-1 genes were found to play a modulatory role in human susceptibility to oxidative damage induced by wood smoke in charcoal workers.

AB  - Acute lung injury is a life-threatening medical problem induced by sepsis or endotoxins and may be associated with enhanced Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Vitamin-D (Vit-D) possesses an anti-inflammatory effect; however, this specific mechanism on acute lung injury is still unknown. Here we scrutinize the mechanism of Vit-D on Acute lung injury (ALI) models and explored the Vit-D augmented miRNA's role in regulating the ER stress pathway in ALI. Sepsis was induced by CLP, and Endotoxemia was caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that Vit-D alleviates pulmonary edema, improves lung histoarchitecture, infiltration of neutrophils, endothelial barrier in mice, and improves ER stress markers Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) and CHOP (C/EBP Homologous Protein) expression elevated by CLP/LPS induce ALI. Vit-D decreases the nitric oxide production and ATF6 in macrophages induced by LPS. Vit-D augments miR (miR-149-5p) in LPS-induce macrophages, CLP, and LPS-induced ALI models. Vit-D enhanced miRNA-149-5p when overexpressed, inhibited ER-specific ATF6 inflammatory pathway in LPS-stimulated macrophages, and improved histoarchitecture of the lung in LPS/CLP-induced mice models. This vitro and vivo studies demonstrate that Vit-D could improve ALI induced by CLP/LPS. In this regard, miR-149-5p may play a crucial role in vitamin-D inhibiting LPS/CLP induce ALI. The mechanism might be an association of increased miR-149-5p and its regulated gene target ATF6, and downstream CHOP proteins were suppressed. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory effect of Vit-D is achieved by augmentation of miRNA-149-5p expression, which may be a key physiologic mediator in the prevention and treatment of ALI.

AB  - Rationale Alpha lipoic acid is known to reverse NMDA receptor hypofunction in addition to dopamine receptor blockade activity. It also enhances neurotrophic factors and has antioxidant potential. These properties combined together may be beneficial for treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS).
   Objectives This study evaluates the effect of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) on psychopathological scores (positive, negative, cognitive), neurotrophic factors and oxidative stress in TRS.
   Methods A pilot randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel design trial was conducted in 20 patients with TRS. After initial screening, participants were randomized into test (add-on ALA) and control (add-on placebo) groups. After recruitment, clinical evaluations with scale for assessment of positive symptoms and negative symptoms (SAPS and SANS), schizophrenia cognitive rating scale (SCoRS), UKU side effect rating scale were done. Serum levels of BDNF, MDA, and GSH were estimated. Patients were followed up for 8 weeks, and clinical and biochemical evaluations were repeated. Adherence to medication was evaluated at follow-up.
   Results A significantly greater improvement was found in SANS score in the test group when compared to control (Mann-Whitney U= 17.0; p= 0.021), whereas there was no significant improvement in SAPS score (Mann-Whitney U= 41.5; p = 0.780). A significant increase in BDNF levels was observed in the control group when compared to ALA (U=20.0; p= 0.041). No significant differences were found between the test and control groups in serum MDA (U= 30.0; p= 0.221), serum GSH (U=40.0; p= 0.683), and medication adherence rating scale (MARS) scores (U=44.0; p= 0.934).
   Conclusions ALA supplementation improved psychopathology and decreased oxidative stress in patients with TRS. This study thus shows the potential of adjunctive ALA in TRS.

AB  - Insulin-resistant brain state is proposed to be the early sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can be studied in the intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) rodent model. ICV-STZ is reported to induce sporadic AD with the majority of the disease hallmarks as phenotype. On the other hand, available experimental evidence has used varying doses of STZ (< 1 to 3 mg/kg) and studied its effect for different study durations, ranging from 14 to 270 days. Though these studies suggest 3 mg/kg of ICV-STZ to be the optimum dose for progressive pathogenesis, the reason for such is elusive. Here, we sought to investigate the mechanism of action of 3 mg/kg ICV-STZ on cognitive and non-cognitive aspects at a follow-up interval of 2 weeks for 2 months. On the 60th day, we examined the layer thickness, cell density, ventricular volume, spine density, protein expression related to brain metabolism, and mitochondrial function by histological examination. The findings suggest a progressive loss of a spatial, episodic, and avoidance memory with an increase in anxiety in a span of 2 months. Furthermore, hippocampal neurodegeneration, ventricular enlargement, diffused amyloid plaque deposition, loss of spine in the dentate gyrus, and imbalance in energy homeostasis were found on the 60th day post-injection. Interestingly, AD rats showed a uniform fraction of time spent in four quadrants of the water maze with a change in strategy when they were exposed to height. Our findings reveal that ICV-STZ injection at a dose of 3 mg/kg can cause cognitive and neuropsychiatric abnormalities due to structural loss both at the neuronal as well as the synaptic level, which is tightly associated with the change in neuronal metabolism.

AB  - In this study, we examined the cellular infectivity and ultrastructural changes due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the various cells of bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) from intubated patients of different age groups (>= 60 years and <60 years) and with common comorbidities such as diabetes, liver and kidney diseases, and malignancies. BALF of 79 patients (38 cases >60 and 41 cases <60 years) were studied by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the ciliated epithelium, type II pneumocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and anucleated granulocytes. This study demonstrated relatively a greater infection and better preservation of subcellular structures in these cells from BALF of younger patients (<60 years compared with the older patients (>= 60 years). The different cells of BALF from the patients without comorbidities showed higher viral load compared with the patients with comorbidities. Diabetic patients showed maximum ultrastructural damage in BALF cells in the comorbid group. This study highlights the comparative effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the different airway and inflammatory cells of BALF at the subcellular levels among older and younger patients and in patients with comorbid conditions.

AB  - The benefit of three-drug induction chemotherapy over a two-drug induction has not been evaluated in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We, therefore, conducted a randomized controlled trial to ascertain the benefit of a three-drug induction regimen. Patients aged 1-18 years with newly diagnosed AML were randomized to two cycles of induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin and ara-C (DA) or two cycles of ara-C, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE). After induction, patients in both arms received consolidation with two cycles of high-dose ara-C. The study's primary objective was to compare the event-free survival (EFS) between the two arms. The secondary objectives included comparing the composite complete remission (cCR) rates, overall survival (OS), and toxicities. The study randomized 149 patients, 77 in the DA and 72 in the ADE arm. The median age was 8.7 years, and 92 (62%) patients were males. The median follow-up was 50.9 months. The cCR rate in the DA and ADE arm were 82% and 79% (p = 0.68) after the second induction. There were 13 (17%) induction deaths in the DA arm and 12 (17%) in the ADE arm (p = 0.97). The 5-year EFS in the DA and ADE arm was 34.4% and 34.5%, respectively (p = 0.66). The 5-year OS in the DA and ADE arms was 41.4% and 42.09%, respectively (p = 0.74). There were no significant differences in toxicities between the regimens. There was no statistically significant difference in EFS, OS, CR, or toxicity between ADE and DA regimens in pediatric AML. The trial was registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (Reference number: CTRI/2014/11/005202).

AB  - Altered neural oscillations during prestimulus-task conditions have been reported to be associated with aberrant information processing in schizophrenia. Spectral perturbations induced by visuo-spatial working memory (VSWM) task were investigated in patients and their first-degree relatives in order to study the biomarkers in schizophrenia. EEG was recorded using 128-channel during VSWM task in 28 patients, 27 first-degree relatives and 25 controls. After pre-processing and ICA, current dipole was estimated for each IC. Total of 1609 inde-pendent and localizable EEG components across all groups were used to compute ERSP during different events of task. Patients deactivated DMN, RSN, auditory cortex more compared to controls during search period to perform VSWM task. Relatives showed altered activation of right medial and inferior frontal gyri during different events and loads of task in lower frequencies compared to controls. Relatives also showed hyperactivity in right cingulate and parahippocampal gyri compared to controls. This is suggestive of genetic predisposition in schizophrenia and could act as vulnerability markers, further strengthened by no significant differences between patients and relatives. Altered processing of simultaneous ongoing events in patients and relatives can serve as state and trait-specific features of schizophrenia.

AB  - In the absence of adequate diagnosis and treatment, leishmaniasis remains a major public health concern on a global scale. Drug resistance remains a key obstacle in controlling and eliminating visceral leishmaniasis. The therapeutic gap due to lack of target-specific medicine and vaccine can be minimized by obtaining parasite's genomic information. This study compared whole-genome sequence of paromomycin-resistant parasite (K133PMM) developed through in vitro adaptation and selection with sensitive Leishmania clinical isolate (K133WT). We found a large number of upstream and intergenic gene variations in K133PMM. There were 259 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 187 insertion-deletion (InDels), and 546 copy number variations (CNVs) identified. Most of the genomic variations were found in the gene's upstream and non-coding regions. Ploidy estimation revealed chromosome 5 in tetrasomy and 6, 9, and 12 in trisomy, uniquely in K133PMM. These contain the genes for protein degradation, parasite motility, autophagy, cell cycle maintenance, and drug efflux membrane transporters. Furthermore, we also observed reduction in ploidy of chromosomes 15, 20, and 23, in the resistant parasite containing mostly the genes for hypothetical proteins and membrane transporters. We chronicled correlated genomic conversion and aneuploidy in parasites and hypothesize that this led to rapid evolutionary changes in response to drug induced pressure, which causes them to become resistant.

AB  - In the absence of a sensitive and specific diagnostic modality capable of detecting all forms of tuber-culosis (TB), proteomics may identify specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) proteins in urine, with a potential as biomarkers. To identify candidate biomarkers for TB, proteome profile of urine from pul-monary TB patients was compared with non-disease controls (NDC) and disease controls (DC, Strepto-coccus pneumonia infected patients) using a combination of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Eleven differentially expressed host proteins and Eighteen high abundant M.tb proteins were identified. Protein -protein interactome (PPI) and functional enrichment analyses like Gene Ontologies, Reactome pathway etc. demonstrated that the human proteins mainly belong to extracellular space and show physiological pathways for immune response and hematological disorders. Whereas, M.tb proteins belong to the cell periphery, plasma membrane and cell wall, and demonstrated catalytic, nucleotide binding and ATPase activities along with other functional processes. The study findings provide valuable inputs about the biomarkers of TB and shed light on the probable disease consequences as an outcome of the bacterial pathogenicity.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the dosage of bivalirudin as the anticoagulant for cardiac surgery in neonates and infants. Design: Pilot study. Setting: Tertiary-care hospital. Participants: Twenty-five neonates and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing cardiac surgery. Interventions: The children received a 1 mg/kg bivalirudin bolus followed by a 2.5 mg/kg/h infusion as the anticoagulant for cardiac surgery. The dose was adjusted subsequently to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) > 480 s. Measurements and main results: The mean age and weight were 5.3 months and 5.2 kg, respectively. Out of the 25 children, 16 were cyanotic. Baseline rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) (Tem Innovations GmbH, Munich, Germany) analysis revealed an underlying coagulation defect across EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM, and ADPTEM parameters. The dose of anticoagulant required was 1 mg/kg, followed by a 2.2 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mg/kg/h infusion. Only 1 child required an additional bolus dose. The ACT remained elevated for 4 hours after discontinuation of infusion. The mean 24-h postoperative chest tube drainage was 92 & PLUSMN; 36 mL. Excessive bleeding occurred in 4 children, 1 of whom required re-exploration. The platelet count remained low for 5 days, and, postoperatively, the prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time remained low for 2 days. Conclusions: Effective anticoagulation was achieved with bivalirudin in the neonates and infants undergoing cardiac surgery. The dose required to maintain an ACT > 480 s was 1.0 mg/kg, followed by 2.2 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mg/kg/h. The ACT remained elevated for 4 h after the discontinuation of bivalirudin infusion, resulting in an increased chest-tube output in some patients. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to further evaluate the safety of bivalirudin in the neonates and infants with complex congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the changes in thoracic fluid content, PaO2/FIO2 ratio, plateau pressure, compliance, and postoperative ventilation duration in off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) and on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (ONCAB). Design: Prospective observational study. Setting: Tertiary-care cardiac center. Participants: Over an 18-month period, from December 2019 to May 2021, 111 patients who underwent CAB grafting were enrolled. Group I constituted OPCAB patients and Group II the ONCAB patients. Interventions: After induction, the authors measured thoracic fluid content (TFC), pulmonary compliance, airway pressures, and the PaO2/FIO2 ratio before skin incision (T1) and after skin closure (T2). The input, output, as well as the duration of postoperative ventilation, also were recorded. Results: At T2, the ONCAB group had a significantly higher change in TFC than the OPCAB group (5.4 +/- 1.86 kOhm-1 v 4.32 +/- 1.84 kOhm-1, p = 0.012). The fluid balance was significantly higher in the OPCAB group compared with the ONCAB group (2,159.21 +/- 108.73 mL v 1,792.50 +/- 151.88 mL, p = 0.0001). The decrease in PaO2/FIO(2 )ratio was significantly lower in the OPCAB group compared with the ONCAB group (-71.34 +/- 23.42 v -123.65 +/- 36.81, p = 0.000). The increase in plateau pressure, decrease in compliance, and postoperative ventilation period were significantly higher in the patients who underwent ONCAB than the patients who underwent OPCAB (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The change in TFC was greater in the ONCAB group, despite the fact that the fluid balance was higher in the OPCAB group. A higher TFC in ONCAB led to lower PaO2/FIO2 ratio, lower compliance, higher plateau pressures, and longer postoperative ventilation. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hypothermia is a life-threatening condition where the temperature of the body drops below 35? and is a key source of concern in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Early identification can help to nudge clinical management to initiate early interventions. Despite its importance, very few studies have focused on the early prediction of hypothermia. In this study, we aim to monitor and predict Hypothermia (30 min-4 h) ahead of its onset using machine learning (ML) models developed on physiological vitals and to prospectively validate the best performing model in the pediatric ICU. We developed and evaluated ML algorithms for the early prediction of hypothermia in a pediatric ICU. Sepsis advanced forecasting engine ICU Database (SafeICU) data resource is an in-house ICU source of data built in the Pediatric ICU at the All-India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), New Delhi. Each time-stamp at 1-min resolution was labeled for the presence of hypothermia to construct a retrospective cohort of pediatric patients in the SafeICU data resource. The training set consisted of windows of the length of 4.2 h with a lead time of 30 min-4 h from the onset of hypothermia. A set of 3,835 hand-engineered time-series features were calculated to capture physiological features from the time series. Features selection using the Boruta algorithm was performed to select the most important predictors of hypothermia. A battery of models such as gradient boosting machine, random forest, AdaBoost, and support vector machine (SVM) was evaluated utilizing five-fold test sets. The best-performing model was prospectively validated. A total of 148 patients with 193 ICU stays were eligible for the model development cohort. Of 3,939 features, 726 were statistically significant in the Boruta analysis for the prediction of Hypothermia. The gradient boosting model performed best with an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85% (SD = 1.6) and a precision of 59.2% (SD = 8.8) for a 30-min lead time before the onset of Hypothermia onset. As expected, the model showed a decline in model performance at higher lead times, such as AUROC of 77.2% (SD = 2.3) and precision of 41.34% (SD = 4.8) for 4 h ahead of Hypothermia onset. Our GBM(gradient boosting machine) model produced equal and superior results for the prospective validation, where an AUROC of 79.8% and a precision of 53% for a 30-min lead time before the onset of Hypothermia whereas an AUROC of 69.6% and a precision of 38.52% for a (30 min-4 h) lead time prospective validation of Hypothermia. Therefore, this work establishes a pipeline termed ThermoGnose for predicting hypothermia, a major complication in pediatric ICUs.

AB  - Background and Aims: Brims-Garland syndrome (BGS) continues to be a contentious topic even 100 years after its discovery. Its lifelong incidence is 1% amongst diabetic individuals and affects middle aged-elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (usually not poorly controlled). Methods: The data presented in this review was collated from studies published on PubMed, MEDLINE and Google Scholar in October 2021. The search words included: "Bruns-Garland syndrome", "diabetic amyotrophy" and "diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy" and "proximal diabetic neuropathy". Results: The exact pathophysiology is debatable but an ischemic pathology (non-systemic microvasculitis) is most plausible. Its cardinal symptoms include acute onset of severe proximal lower extiemity pain followed by weakness and wasting, some sensory loss, weight loss and autonomic symptoms. Conclusion: The prognosis is good as most patients improve to nearnormal strength with pain cessation within 18 months of onset.

KW  - PERCEPTION
AB  - Background. Palliative care for children is an innovative approach that helps improve the quality of life of children suffering from life-limiting illnesses, and their family members. The WHO recognized palliative care as a part of universal health coverage. However, there is inadequate availability and inequitable distribution of palliative care services for children in most parts of the world. We reviewed the existing literature to assess (i) the challenges in providing palliative care services for children suffering from life-limiting illnesses and (ii) the strategies or opportunities to overcome these challenges.Methods. We conducted systematic searches in the PubMed and Scopus databases to find articles published in the past 10 years (January 2011 to December 2020). The population, concept and context (PCC) framework was used to devise a search strategy in an electronic database.Results. A total of 1562 articles were found by searching the database and other sources. Title and abstracts of articles were screened, and 206 articles were selected for full-text review. After scrutiny 28 articles met the inclusion criteria. Barriers to and opportunities in the provision of palliative care services for children were identified at policy, organizational, healthcare provider, and patient/family levels.Conclusion. We found that the majority of barriers to provision of palliative care services for children with life -limiting illnesses can be addressed by adopting research -driven strategies. Adequate and equitable distribution of palliative care services is required for improving children and their family members' quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare their outcome with case-matched controls from the prepandemic phase.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective case-control study in which all patients with TBI admitted during COVID-19 pandemic phase (Arm A) from March 24, 2020 to November 30, 2020 were matched with age and Glasgow Coma Scale score-matched controls from the patients admitted before March 2020 (Arm B).
   RESULTS: The total number of patients matched in each arm was 118. The length of hospital stay (8 days vs. 5 days; P < 0.001), transit time from emergency room to operation room (150 minutes vs. 97 minutes; P = 0.271), anesthesia induction time (75 minutes vs. 45 minutes; P = 0.002), and operative duration (275 minutes vs. 180 minutes; P = 0.002) were longer in arm A. Although the incidence of fever and pneumonia was significantly higher in arm A than in arm B (50% vs. 26.3%, P < 0.001 and 27.1% vs. 1.7%, P < 0.001, respectively), outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended) and mortality (18.6% vs. 14.4% respectively; P = 0.42) were similar in both the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of the patients managed for TBI during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar to matched patients with TBI managed at our center before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that the guidelines followed during the COVID-19 pandemic were effective in dealing with patients with TBI. This model can serve as a guide for any future pandemic waves for effective management of patients with TBI without compromising their outcome.

AB  - Objectives: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the next big pandemic that threatens humanity. The One Health approach to AMR requires quantification of interactions between health, demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and geopolitical factors to design interventions. This study is focused on learning health system factors on global AMR.Methods: This study analysed longitudinal data (2004-2017) of AMR having 6 33 820 isolates from 70 middle and high-income countries. We integrated AMR data with the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), Governance (WGI), and Finance data sets to find AMR's unbiased and actionable determinants. We chose a Bayesian decision network (BDN) approach within the causal modelling framework to quantify determinants of AMR. Further, we integrated Bayesian networks' global knowledge discovery approach with discriminative machine learning to predict individual-level antibiotic susceptibility in patients.Results: From MAR (multiple antibiotic resistance) scores, we found a non-uniform spread pattern of AMR. Components-level analysis revealed that governance, finance, and disease burden variables strongly correlate with AMR. From the Bayesian network analysis, we found that access to immunization, obstetric care, and government effectiveness are strong, actionable factors in reducing AMR, confirmed by what-if analysis. Finally, our discriminative machine learning models achieved an individual-level AUROC (Area under receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.94 (SE = 0.01) and 0.89 (SE = 0.002) to predict Staphylococcus aureus resistance to ceftaroline and oxacillin, respectively.Conclusion: Causal machine learning revealed that immunisation strategies and quality of governance are vital, actionable interventions to reduce AMR.

AB  - Acute-onset ophthalmoplegia is a perplexing diagnosis in a young child. When the full-blown picture of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia is evident, the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), is almost certain. However, the same is not true for isolated external ophthalmoplegia as it is etiologically heterogeneous. Only anecdotal case reports of childhood-onset acute ophthalmoplegia exist in the literature. Adult series suggest that acute onset external ophthalmoplegia is often immune-mediated and is secondary to anti-GQ1b antibodies. We present a 30-month-old boy with acute-onset bilateral external ophthalmoplegia with highly elevated serum anti-GQ1b antibodies. The child had a rapid and complete recovery with intravenous immunoglobulin. A review of all published cases of childhood anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome was performed. The case highlights that anti-GQ1b antibody syndrome should be considered even in young children with acute-onset external ophthalmoplegia. The disease has a favorable prognosis. The majority improve on conservative management. Treatment with steroids or IVIG may be considered in some after weighing the risks and benefits.

AB  - Purpose: To study the effect of subthreshold micropulse yellow laser treatment on central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and to compare two laser protocols. As per our knowledge, there are no studies comparing the two protocols of subthreshold laser. Methods: Twenty-three patients with non-resolving CSC of at least three months duration were treated with subthreshold laser (577 nm). Ten patients were treated with 5% duty cycle (group A) and 13 patients with 10% duty cycle (group B). At one month, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), subretinal fluid (SRF), choroidal thickness (CT) and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were evaluated. Results: In group A, BCVA improved from 0.508 +/- 504 to 0.174 +/- 0.171 (P = 0.0058), CMT improved from 349.8 +/- 168.9 micrometers (mu m) to 183.3 +/- 70.312 mu m (P = 0.0093) and SRF reduced from 202.4 +/- 158.024 to 43.8 +/- 46.599 mu m (P = 0.0069). In group B, BCVA improved from 0.437 +/- 0.426 to 0.289 +/- 0.470 (P = 0.0026), CMT improved from 280.846 +/- 72.668 to 196.769 +/- 72.62 mu m (P = 0.0002) and SRF reduced from 110.385 +/- 57.687 mu m to 52.538 +/- 52.111 mu m (P = 0.0064). No significant difference was found in BCVA and CMT between the groups (P = 0.8716 and P = 0.8523, respectively). CSC completely resolved in 50% of cases in group A and in 69.2% of cases in group B. This difference was not statistically significant (0.423); however, the odds ratio of resolution was 2.25 times more with 10% duty cycle. No change was observed on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) following laser. Conclusion: Subthreshold micropulse laser can lead to resolution of SRF in 60.87% of cases (groups A and B combined). Ten per cent duty cycle had higher odds of resolution without causing any RPE damage.

AB  - Simple Summary Although developed anticancer drugs have shown desirable effects in preclinical trials, the clinical efficacy of chemotherapy against brain cancer remains disappointing. One of the important obstacles is the highly heterogeneous environment in tumors. This study aims to evaluate the performance of an emerging treatment using antiangiogenic and cytotoxic drugs. Our mathematical modelling confirms the advantage of this combination therapy in homogenizing the intratumoral environment for better drug delivery outcomes. In addition, the effects of local microvasculature and cell density on this therapy are also discussed. The results would contribute to the development of more effective treatments for brain cancer. Although convection-enhanced delivery can successfully bypass the blood-brain barrier, its clinical performance remains disappointing. This is primarily attributed to the heterogeneous intratumoral environment, particularly the tumor microvasculature. This study investigates the combined convection-enhanced delivery of antiangiogenic drugs and liposomal cytotoxic drugs in a heterogeneous brain tumor environment using a transport-based mathematical model. The patient-specific 3D brain tumor geometry and the tumor's heterogeneous tissue properties, including microvascular density, porosity and cell density, are extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging data. Results show that antiangiogenic drugs can effectively reduce the tumor microvascular density. This change in tissue structure would inhibit the fluid loss from the blood to prevent drug concentration from dilution, and also reduce the drug loss by blood drainage. The comparisons between different dosing regimens demonstrate that the co-infusion of liposomal cytotoxic drugs and antiangiogenic drugs has the advantages of homogenizing drug distribution, increasing drug accumulation, and enlarging the volume where tumor cells can be effectively killed. The delivery outcomes are susceptible to the location of the infusion site. This combination treatment can be improved by infusing drugs at higher microvascular density sites. In contrast, infusion at a site with high cell density would lower the treatment effectiveness of the whole brain tumor. Results obtained from this study can deepen the understanding of this combination therapy and provide a reference for treatment design and optimization that can further improve survival and patient quality of life.

AB  - Background: Identifying ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes clinically may help in situations where neuroimaging is unavailable to provide primary-care prior to referring to stroke-ready facility. Stroke classification-based solely on clinical scores faces two unresolved issues. One pertains to overestimation of score performance, while other is biased performance due to class-imbalance inherent in stroke datasets. After correcting the issues using Machine Learning theory, we quantitatively compared existing scores to study the capabilities of clinical attributes for stroke classification. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, ERIC, ScienceDirect, and IEEE-Xplore from 2001 to 2021 for studies that validated the Siriraj, Guys Hospital/Allen, Greek, and Besson scores for stroke classification. From included studies we extracted the reported cross-tabulation to identify and correct the above listed issues for an accurate comparative analysis of the performance of clinical scores. Results: A total of 21 studies were included. Comparative analysis demonstrates Siriraj Score outperforms others. For Siriraj Score the reported sensitivity range (Ischemic Stroke-diagnosis) 43-97% (Median = 78% [IQR 65-88%]) is significantly higher than our calculated range 40-90% (Median = 70% [IQR 57-73%]), also the reported sensitivity range (Hemorrhagic Stroke-diagnosis) 50-95% (Median = 71% [IQR 64-82%]) is higher than our calculated range 34-86% (Median = 59% [IQR 50-79%]) which indicates overestimation of performance by the included studies. Guys Hospital/Allen and Greek Scores show similar trends. Recommended weighted-accuracy metric provides better estimate of the performance. Conclusion: We demonstrate that clinical attributes have a potential for stroke classification, however the performance of all scores varies across demographics, indicating the need to fine-tune scores for different demographics. To improve this variability, we suggest creating global data pool with statistically significant attributes. Machine Learning classifiers trained over such dataset may perform better and generalise at scale.

AB  - Background: Chiari 1 malformation has crowding at craniovertebral junction (CVJ), treated by Foramen magnum decompression ( FMD) but is associated with high failure rates, which is explained by recently introduced concept of central instability. So, we propose a new concept of relieving this crowding without affecting stability.
   Objective: To derive a threshold for coring out of internal surface of C1 posterior arch instead of complete laminectomy accompanying FMD.
   Methods and Material: We prospectively included nine patients with a mean age of 25.33 +/- 7.97 years, diagnosed with ACM-1 without AAD, who were operated with FMD and lax duraplasty and C1 laminectomy. The preoperative dural diameter and area covered under the dura at the level of C1 were measured and compared with the postoperative state. Results were analyzed to derive a cut-off threshold which could be drilled from the inner aspect of C1 arch.
   Results: The postoperative AP diameter of the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op; however, the AP extension was less than the preoperative diameter with posterior arch included. Likewise, the area spanned by the dura increased statistically significantly from pre-op but was less than the cumulative area of dura with C1 arch included in pre-op. Analyzing all, a mean cut-off of 50.58% was achieved.
   Conclusion: The authors suggest FMD with partial coring (similar to 50%) of the inner part of arch of C1, instead of full-thickness laminectomy with a wider length of coring as the target, and this will serve the purpose intended, without increasing mobility.

TI  - Mortality Associated with Ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> Exposure in India: Results from the Million Death Study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES

KW  - DISEASE
KW  - BURDEN
KW  - MODELS
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies on the extent to which long-term exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) contributes to adult mortality in India are few, despite over 99% of Indians being exposed to levels that he World Health Organization (WHO) considers unsafe.
   OBJECTIVE: We conducted a retrospective cohort study within the Million Death Study (MDS) to provide the first-ever quantification of national mortality from exposure to PM2.5 in India from 1999 to 2014.
   METHODS: We calculated relative risks (RRs) by linking a total of ten 3-y intervals of satellite-based estimated PM2.5 exposure to deaths 3 to 5 y later in over 7,400 small villages or urban blocks covering a total population of 6.8 million. We applied using a model-based geostatistical model, adjusted for individual age, sex, and year of death; smoking prevalence, rural/urban residency, area-level female illiteracy, languages, and spatial clustering and unit-level variation.
   RESULTS: PM2.5 exposure levels increased from 1999 to 2014, particularly in central and eastern India. Among 212,573 deaths at ages 15-69 y, after spatial adjustment, we found a significant RR of 1.09 [95% credible interval (CI): 1.04, 1.14] for stroke deaths per 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure, but no significant excess for deaths from chronic respiratory disease and ischemic heart disease (IHD), all nonaccidental causes, and total mortality (after excluding stroke). Spatial adjustment attenuated the RRs for chronic respiratory disease and IHD but raised those for stroke. The RRs were consistent in Various sensitivity analyses with spatial adjustment, including stratifying by levels of solid fuel exposure, by sex, and by age group, addition of climatic variables, and in supplementary case-control analyses using injury deaths as controls.
   DISCUSSION: Direct epidemiological measurements, despite inherent limitations, yielded associations between mortality and long-term PM2.5 inconsistent with those reported in earlier models used by the WHO to derive estimates of PM2.5 mortality in India. The modest RRs in our study are consistent with near or null mortality effects. They suggest suitable caution in estimating deaths from PM2.5 exposure based on MDS results and even more caution in extrapolating model-based associations of risk derived mostly from high-income countries to India.

AB  - Background: Trace elements have been implicated in pathogenesis of epilepsy. Studies till date have shown altered levels of serum trace elements in children with epilepsy.
   Objective: The objective of the current was to estimate serum levels of trace elements in children with well-controlled and drug refractory epilepsy and compare it with controls.
   Methodology: In a tertiary care teaching hospital of North India, serum selenium, copper, zinc, and iron were estimated in well-controlled and drug refractory epileptic children aged 2-12 years and compared with age and gender matched controls.
   Results: A total of 106 children with epilepsy (55 drug refractory and 51 well controlled) and 52 age and gender matched controls were included in the study. Serum selenium and copper were significantly decreased in cases compared to controls. After classifying epilepsy into well-controlled and drug refractory cases, only in the latter the significant difference for serum selenium and copper levels remained compared to controls. Additionally, in the drug refractory cases, serum iron levels were significantly reduced compared to controls.
   Conclusions: Serum trace elements are altered in children with epilepsy (more so in the drug refractory group) compared to controls. Monitoring of serum trace elements in children with epilepsy should be considered. Up to one-third of epilepsy is drug refractory of which only another third are amenable to surgery. It is worth investigating the therapeutic potential of altered micronutrient status in these patients.

AB  - Background & objectives:Cingulum bundle (CB) is frequently implicated in schizophrenia; however, its role in specific symptoms of schizophrenia such as auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) is less explored. Few studies have reported association between reduced integrity of CB and severity of AVH. Using a symptom-based approach, this diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractographic study was aimed to assess and compare the integrity of CB in schizophrenia with AVH, schizophrenia without AVH and healthy controls.Methods:A total of 92 right-handed adult individuals (aged 18-50 yr) were recruited across three study groups. Those with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophrenia with AVH (group I; n=30) were compared to those with DSM-5 schizophrenia without lifetime AVH (group II; n=32) and healthy controls (group III; n=30; screened using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview version-7.0.0. and negative family history). Clinical assessments (groups I and II) included scale for assessment of positive symptoms, scale for assessment of negative symptoms, clinical global impression-schizophrenia and psychotic symptom rating scale. All participants underwent DTI, and quantitative tract-based measurements of fractional anisotropy (FA) were obtained for images using DTI studio version-3.0.Results:All groups were comparable for age, gender, education and severity of illness. Group I had significantly lower FA values in the cingulate gyrus (CG) part of the left CB compared to groups II and III. No significant difference was found between groups II and III.Interpretation & conclusions:The findings of this study suggest that the disruption in the left CB appears to be specific for AVH-positive schizophrenia. The finding is, however, preliminary subject to replication in future studies. Further investigations are needed to understand its relevance in the context of AVH-positive schizophrenia.

AB  - Current advancements in spine surgery have led to a recent interest in regional anesthesia for spine surgery. Spinal anesthesia, epidural anesthesia, and their combination are commonly used modalities for regional anesthesia in spine surgeries. The successful use of regional anesthesia has led to the emergence of several new concepts such as awake spinal fusion and outpatient spinal surgery. Regarding analgesic techniques, several new modalities have been described recently such as erector spinae and thoracolumbar interfascial plane blocks. These regional analgesic modalities are aimed at decreasing perioperative pain and enhancing early recovery in patients undergoing spine surgery. This narrative review focuses on the techniques, indications and contraindications, benefits, and complications of regional anesthesia in the context of spine surgery.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Background: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the commonest cause of cervical myelopathy. It contributes to high morbidity and consequent economic burden for society. Many measurement tools have been devised to quantify the disease severity, assist in decision-making, and to evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention.
   Objective: Most of the assessment scales are used for research purposes only and rarely in clinical practice. The purpose of this survey was to check the awareness of spine surgeons about these assessment scales and their role in the management of patients with CSM.
   Methods: An online questionnaire using the application "Google Forms" made consisting of 10 questions regarding the experience of treating the CSM patients and their preference for various parameters in assessing these patients. Statistical analysis was done using the statistical programming language R.
   Results: One-hundred and sixty-three responses were analyzed. About 90% of the respondents were aware of the assessment tools and only 57% of them used any in management. Nurick's grade was the most well known among all groups. The commonest reason for surgeons not using any of these assessment scales despite being aware of these scales was their perception that it is very time-consuming to complete these assessment scales.
   Conclusion: Assessment scales have a role in the management and follow-up of CSM patients. While awareness regarding these tools is well spread, time constraint plays a major role in limiting its usage.

AB  - Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a seronegative arthropathy which results in pathological ossification of the ligaments, disc, endplates and apophyseal structures. Cervical spinal fractures are more common in patients with ankylosing spondylitis than in patients without ankylosing spondylitis due to coexistent osteoporosis and kyphotic alignment of the spine. The risk of fracture-dislocation and associated spinal cord injury is also more in these patients. Management of cervical spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is more challenging.
   Case Description: We report a 56-year-old male patient who presented to our emergency department following a road traffic accident. He had ASIA B spinal cord injury at C7 level. CT scan revealed a C6-7 fracture-dislocation with features suggestive of AS. The fracture involved all the three columns and extended through C7 body anteriorly and through the C6-7 disc posteriorly. The treating team was not aware that he had AS, and thus, precautions related to his head position were not taken. He underwent reduction of the fracture-dislocation and 360 degrees fixation.
   Conclusions: The management of cervical spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is challenging. They need long segment fixation in their preoperative spinal alignment. Proper preoperative planning can result in good outcome.

AB  - Background: Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a treatable cause of vertebrobasilar ischemic stroke and can be spontaneous or more commonly traumatic. Craniovertebral junction (CVJ) anomalies are a rare and often overlooked cause of VAD.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to study cases where CVJ anomaly presented as posterior circulation infarct and to conduct a relevant literature review.
   Materials and Methods: The medical records of seven patients who were managed for posterior circulation infarct associated with CVJ anomaly at our center from January 2009 through August 2013 were reviewed. PubMed and MEDLINE databases were also searched for similar cases, and the published case reports/ series were reviewed.
   Results: Seven patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the study. The mean age was 17.4 years (range: 10-35 years). All the patients were males. The most common symptoms were headache, vomiting, and gait ataxia. Slurring of speech was seen in one patient. One patient had repeated episodes of gait ataxia with left-sided weakness with complete recovery in between the episodes. One patient presented in unconscious state. Four patients complained of vertigo. The median duration of symptoms was 7 days (range: 3 days-12 months).
   Conclusions: CVJ anomalies can present as posterior circulation infarct. One must evaluate all patients with posterior circulation stroke, especially young patients, for possible CVJ anomalies. Dynamic lateral cervical spine X-ray is an important tool to diagnose AAD. CVJ anomalies represent a treatable cause of VAD.

AB  - Background: Several scoring systems have been developed for assessment of patients with compressive cervical myelopathy. However, all of these have some shortcomings. We proposed a new modification of the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score-the AIIMS cervical myelopathy score (ACMS).
   Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the ACMS with mJOA score and Nurick score. Methods: We prospectively studied patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. The new ACMS, mJOA, Nurick proposed by Benzel, and Nurick scores were recorded preoperatively and at three months postoperatively in patients.
   Results: Sixty-two patients completed the 3-month follow-up and were included in the final analysis. The mean preoperative and postoperative Nurick, mJOA, and ACMS scores were 3.3 and 3.0, 12.3 and 13.8, and 15.1 and 17.7, respectively. High correlation (Pearson's r > 0.8, 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97, P < 0.005) was observed between ACMS and mJOA scores for all the individual components of both scales, both in pre- and postoperative assessments. A negative correlation was observed between the occupational ability scores ACMS and the Nurick scale (r = -0.76, 95% CI: -0.83 to - 0.68). No correlation was found with cord/canal ratio on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with any of the three scoring systems (preoperative, postoperative, or recovery rates).
   Conclusions: The ACMS score showed a good correlation with the mJOA score for evaluation of functional disability in the setting of cervical myelopathy. The patients could themselves report the scores using the ACMS scoring chart. The occupational component of the ACMS also correlated well with the Nurick score.

AB  - Background: Complete subluxation of >100% of one vertebral body with respect to the adjacent vertebra is defined as spondyloptosis. It is the severest form of injury caused by high-energy trauma. Pediatric patients with a traumatic spine injury, particularly spondyloptosis are surgically demanding as reduction and achieving realignment of the spinal column requires diligent planning and execution.
   Objective: To enlighten readers about this rare but severest form of thoracolumbar spine injury and its management. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients treated here with spondyloptosis between 2008 and 2016 was done.
   Results: Seven children, ranging from 9 to 18 years (mean years) age were included in the study. Five patients had spondyloptosis at thoracolumbar junction and one each in the lumbar and thoracic spine. All patients underwent single-stage posterior surgical reduction and fixation except one patient who refused surgery. Intraoperatively, cord transection was seen in five patients while dura was intact in one patient. The mean follow-up period was 17 months (1-36 months) during which one patient expired due to complications arising from bedsores. All patients remained American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A neurologically.
   Conclusions: Traumatic spondyloptosis is a challenging proposition to treat and the aim of surgery is to stabilize the spine. Rehabilitation remains the most crucial but the neglected part and dearth of proper rehabilitation centers inflict high mortality and morbidity in developing countries.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) and its association with the course and outcome of bipolar disorder (BD).
   Materials and Methods: A total of 773 patients with BD were recruited from 14 centers in different parts of India, and they were evaluated for the prevalence of comorbid substance dependence, course and outcome, subjective cognitive functioning, and disability.
   Results: About one-fourth (22.9%) of the participants had one or more substance dependence. In terms of specific substance of abuse, 136 (17.6%) had nicotine dependence, 80 (10.3%) patients had alcohol dependence, 13 (1.7%) had cannabis dependence, and nine (1.2%) had opioid dependence. Compared to those without comorbid substance dependence, those with a dual diagnosis (i.e., using at least one substance in a dependent pattern) were less educated, more often males, more often currently single, more often employed, had a lower number of depressive episodes per year of illness, had a higher number of manic and mixed episodes per year of illness in the first 5 years of illness, had a higher level of disability, and more often had a history of hospitalization and a history of receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); also, a higher proportion of them had manic predominant polarity, more often had recurrent mania course, and were more often receiving a combination of lithium and valproate.
   Conclusion: About one-fourth of BD patients have comorbid SUDs, and presence of SUD has a negative impact on the course and outcome of BD.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of intranodal lymphangiography using ethiodised oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet Japan, Tokyo, Japan) for the treatment of refractory cases of chylothorax and chylous ascites in the paediatric population.
   Methods: Between 2016 and 2020, eight children having chyle leak resistant to conservative management underwent intranodal lymphangiography using lipiodol injection. After ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board, these patients' data were retrospectively analysed. Technical success was defined by opacification of inguinal and retroperitoneal lymphatics while injection on fluoroscopy. Clinical success was defined as progressively decreasing drain output and eventual cessation of output within a week after the procedure. Long-term follow up was done as feasible.
   Results: Technical success was achieved in all the patients. Complete cessation of drain output was noted within 1 week of procedure in all patients indicating clinical success. One patient had recurrence of chylous leakage after an interval of 1 month and intranodal lymphangiography was repeated for that patient. The child had technical as well as clinical success after the repeat procedure. Hence a total of 9 procedures were performed in 8 patients.
   Conclusion: Intranodal lymphangiography may prove to be a valuable minimally invasive therapeutic tool in cases of refractory chylous leakage in paediatric patients with minimal risk of complications.
   Advances in knowledge: Intranodal lymphangiography using lipiodol may prove to be a minimally invasive alternative in paediatric patients with refractory lymphatic leaks.

AB  - Background & objectives :Due to shortcomings in death registration and medical certification, the excess death approach is recommended for COVID-19 mortality burden estimation. In this study the data from the civil registration system (CRS) from one district in India was explored for its suitability in the estimation of excess deaths, both directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19. Methods: All deaths registered on the CRS portal at the selected registrar's office of Faridabad district in Haryana between January 2016 and September 2021 were included. The deaths registered in 2020 and 2021 were compared to previous years (2016-2019), and excess mortality in both years was estimated by gender and age groups as the difference between the registered deaths and historical average month wise during 2016-2019 using three approaches - mean and 95 per cent confidence interval, FORECAST.ETS function in Microsoft Excel and linear regression. To assess the completeness of registration in the district, 150 deaths were sampled from crematoria and graveyards during 2020 and checked for registration in the CRS portal. Agreement in the cause of death (CoD) in CRS with the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes assigned for a subset of 585 deaths after verbal autopsy was calculated. Results: A total of 7017 deaths were registered in 2020, whereas 6792 deaths were registered till 30 September 2021 which represent a 9 and 44 per cent increase, respectively, from the historical average for that period. The highest increase was seen in the age group >60 yr (19% in 2020 and 56% in 2021). All deaths identified in crematoria and graveyards in 2020 had been registered. Observed peaks of all-cause excess deaths corresponded temporally and in magnitude to infection surges in the district. All three approaches gave overlapping estimates of the ratio of excess mortality to reported COVID-19 deaths of 1.8-4 in 2020 and 10.9-13.9 in 2021. There was poor agreement (kappa<0.4) between CoD in CRS and that assigned after physician review for most causes, except tuberculosis and injuries. Interpretation & conclusions: CRS data, despite the limitations, appeared to be appropriate for all-cause excess mortality estimation by age and sex but not by cause. There was an increase in death registration in 2020 and 2021 in the district.

KW  - trachoma
AB  - Purpose: In the mid-twentieth century, trachoma was endemic in the northwestern states of India. We aimed to generate recent estimates of prevalence of trachomatous inflammation, follicular (TF) and trachomatous trichiasis (TT) in ten suspected-endemic districts across seven previously hyper-endemic states and union territories for trachoma in India including Delhi, Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Methods: Population-based prevalence surveys were undertaken in 10 districts. In each of those districts, two-stage cluster sampling was used to select a sample of 2000 children aged 1-9 years and all adults aged >= 15 years in the enumerated households from a total of 20 clusters per district. Consenting eligible participants were examined for trachoma by trained ophthalmologists using the World Health Organization's simplified grading system. Data were analyzed at the district level. Results: A total of 13,802 households were surveyed in which 19,662 children were examined for TF and 44,135 adults aged >= 15 years were examined for TT. District-level TF prevalence in 1-9-year-olds ranged from 0.1% in Bikaner (95% CI: 0.01-0.3) to 2.1% in Dholpur (95% CI: 1.6-2.8) and that of trichiasis ranged from 0.7 per 1000 in Pauri Garhwal (95% CI: 0.01-1.4) to 22.1 per 1000 (95% CI: 15.8-28.4) in Car Nicobar. In four districts (Car Nicobar, Dholpur, Hoshiarpur, Tonk), trichiasis prevalence in adults aged >= 15 years was >= 0.2%. Conclusion: TF was not a public health problem in any of the districts surveyed; thus, antibiotic mass drug administration is not needed. However, TT among adults was found to be above 0.2% in four districts; thus, further trichiasis surgery interventions at the public health level are warranted to achieve elimination. These findings will facilitate planning for elimination of trachoma as a public health problem in India.

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Renal hydatid is an uncommon finding, reported in less than 5% patients with hydatid infection. Hydatid involvement of ureter and urinary bladder is an even rarer entity. Renal hydatid is typically unilateral, solitary and arises from cortex. It is essential to be aware of the imaging features of the hydatid cyst for proper diagnosis. Knowledge of the imaging features of various stages is essential since treatment decision is based on cyst stage. Hydatid cyst can mimic several entities both benign and malignant. We present a pictorial review to illustrate the radiological imaging features of hydatid disease involving kidney, ureter and bladder region and its complications.

AB  - Advances in kidney genomics in the past 20 years has opened the door for more precise diagnosis of kidney dis-ease and identification of new and specific therapeutic agents. Despite these advances, an imbalance exists between low-resource and affluent regions of the world. Individuals of European ancestry from the United States, United Kingdom, and Iceland account for 16% of the world's population, but represent more than 80% of all genome-wide association studies. South Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Africa together account for 57% of the world population but less than 5% of genome-wide association studies. Implications of this difference include limitations in new variant discovery, inaccurate interpretation of the effect of genetic variants in non-European popu-lations, and unequal access to genomic testing and novel therapies in resource-poor regions. It also further introdu-ces ethical, legal, and social pitfalls, and ultimately may propagate global health inequities. Ongoing efforts to reduce the imbalance in low-resource regions include funding and capacity building, population-based genome sequencing, population-based genome registries, and genetic research networks. More funding, training, and capacity building for infrastructure and expertise is needed in resource-poor regions. Focusing on this will ensure multiple-fold returns on investments in genomic research and technology. Semin Nephrol 42:151314 (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Systematic reviews conducted on sleep disturbances in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have found inconsistent results due to the presence of several moderating variables which were not controlled for in previous studies. The aim of this study was to examine sleep disturbances in children with ADHD compared to their typically developing peers after controlling for moderating variables (age, sex, medication status, body mass index, and psychiatric and medical comorbidities). Methods: ADHD was diagnosed using DSM-IV-TR criteria (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) and Conners' Parent Rating Scales. Children recruited (aged 6-12 years) for the ADHD group (n = 40) met the following criteria: IQ > 80, unmedicated, and no psychiatric or medical comorbidities. The control group consisted of age- and sex-matched typically developing peers (n = 40). Sleep was assessed subjectively (through parent reported questionnaires and sleep logs) and objectively (using video polysomnography). Results: 65% of children with ADHD had a sleep disorder, as compared to 17% of controls. The ADHD group reported more sleep disturbances and disorders, both on subjective measures and objective measures. Conclusions: Sleep disturbances and primary sleep disorders in children with ADHD exist independent of moderating variables and differences in sleep assessment methods, thereby bolstering support for previously documented literature on the ADHD and sleep connection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rational use of medicines as per the World Health Organization (WHO) should be practiced globally. However, data regarding the completeness of the prescriptions and their rational use is lacking from developing countries like India. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the prescribing patterns of drugs and completeness of prescriptions as per WHO core drug use and complementary indicators to provide real-life examples for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) online prescribing skill course for medical graduates. METHODS: Prescriptions of the patients, fulfilling inclusion criteria, attending Outpatient Departments of various specialties of tertiary care hospitals, were collected by thirteen ICMR Rational use of medicines centers located in tertiary care hospitals, throughout India. Prescriptions were evaluated for rational use of medicines according to the WHO guidelines and for appropriateness as per standard treatment guidelines using a common protocol approved by local Ethics committees. RESULTS: Among 4838 prescriptions, an average of about three drugs (3.34) was prescribed to the patients per prescription. Polypharmacy was noted in 83.05% of prescriptions. Generic drugs were prescribed in 47.58% of the prescriptions. Further, antimicrobials were prescribed in 17.63% of the prescriptions and only 4.98% of prescriptions were with injectables. During the prescription evaluation, 38.65% of the prescriptions were incomplete due to multiple omissions such as dose, duration, and formulation. CONCLUSION: Most of the parameters in the present study were out of the range of WHO-recommended prescribing indicators. Therefore, effective intervention program, like training, for the promotion of rational drug use practice was recommended to improve the prescribing pattern of drugs and the quality of prescriptions all over the country.

AB  - Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare, poorly defined sinonasal epithelial neoplasm from which several genetically defined entities are emerging. IDH1/2 mutations were recently identified in a subset of SNUC. However, the ideal method for the detection of these mutations remains to be established. Cases diagnosed as SNUC between 2010 and 2020 were retrieved. Immunohistochemistry was performed using IDH1/2 mutant-specific antibody MsMab-1. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using 2 kits to detect IDH1/2 mutations. Sanger sequencing was performed in a subset of cases. Thirty-eight cases of SNUC were identified, 18 of which showed IDH1/2 mutations by qPCR (47.4%). IDH2 R172K and R140x were most frequent, each seen in 6 cases (33.3%). Sanger sequencing identified IDH1/2 mutations in 4 out of 21 cases (19%) and did not detect mutations identified by qPCR in 7 cases. On immunohistochemistry, strong IDH positivity was present in 2 cases (5.3%), 1 of which had IDH2 mutation, while no mutation was detected in the other. Our results demonstrating IDH2 R172K and IDH2 R140x variants are a novel finding in SNUC. Immunohistochemistry and Sanger sequencing have low sensitivity for detection of IDH1/2 mutations, and qPCR-based assays may be utilized, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to sophisticated sequencing techniques are difficult.

TI  - SMARCA4/BRG1-Deficient Sinonasal Carcinoma Morphologic Spectrum of an Evolving Entity
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
KW  - PERFORMANCE
AB  - Context.-Molecular analysis of poorly differentiated/ undifferentiated sinonasal neoplasms has resulted in identification of a growing number of genetically defined tumors. SMARCA4-deficient sinonasal carcinoma is one such recently described entity that emerged from within sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC), neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC), and teratocarcinosarcoma (TCS).
   Objective.-To identify SMARCA4-deficient sinonasal carcinomas from a large institutional cohort of poorly differentiated/undifferentiated carcinomas and evaluate their clinicopathologic features.
   Design.-SMARCA4/BRG1 immunohistochemistry was performed on all tumors diagnosed as SNUC, poorly differentiated carcinoma, NEC, and TCS during a 12-year period. SMARCA2/BRM and INSM1 immunostaining was performed in SMARCA4-deficient cases.
   Results.-Twelve SMARCA4-deficient sinonasal carcinomas were identified among 299 cases. Morphologically, 5 cases were large cell NEC, 2 cases were small cell NEC, and 5 were TCS. SMARCA4 loss was diffuse and complete in 10 cases, while 2 cases showed focal retention. Most cases showed diffuse cytokeratin staining accompanied by weak, usually focal staining for chromogranin and synaptophysin. INSM-1 showed negativity in most cases. All cases showed retained SMARCA2 expression. IDH1/2 mutation was absent in all cases analyzed. Four of 7 patients died of disease, and aggressive multimodality treatment provided better outcome.
   Conclusions.-SMARCA4-deficient sinonasal carcinomas are morphologically akin to sinonasal poorly differentiated NECs and TCS, display cytokeratin positivity and only focal staining for neuroendocrine markers, and have aggressive biological behavior. Inclusion of SMARCA4 in the immunohistochemical panel for diagnostic workup of all sinonasal NEC and TCS phenotypes will facilitate their early recognition. Comprehensive germline and somatic mutational analyses of these tumors are necessary for further insights into their molecular pathogenesis.

AB  - Objective This study examined profile and treatment outcomes of young patients with tuberculosis (TB) registered at a district TB centre under the National TB Elimination Programme in Faridabad district of Haryana state in India. Methods In this secondary data analysis, we studied the records of young TB patients aged 15-24 years registered under a TB programme during October 2013-December 2017 in Faridabad district of Haryana state. Results We analysed records of 5257 young patients with TB. Majority (58.7%) were patients with pulmonary TB and most of them (83.6%) were registered as new patients. Majority of the young patients with TB (93.2%) had a successful treatment outcome, and patients having sputum result 2+ or less and patients who did not have a previous history of TB were found to be significantly associated with a successful treatment outcome on multivariable analysis. Conclusion There was a high treatment success rate noted in young patients with TB. More focus is needed to patients having a history of TB and sputum result >2+. Targeted interventions can be designed for these groups in future programmatic strategies to reduce disease burden in this section of young population.

AB  - Punicalagin is the most bioactive pomegranate polyphenol with high antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activity and can potentially cure different ailments related to the cardiovascular system. The current research work was envisioned to predict the targeting efficiency of punicalagin (PG) nanoparticles to the macrophages, more specifically to bone marrow macrophages. For this, we selected mannose-decorated PLGA-punicalagin nanoparticles (Mn-PLGA-PG), and before formulating this nanocarrier in laboratory settings, we predicted the targeting efficiency of this nanocarrier by in silico analysis. The analysis proceeded with macrophage mannose receptors to be acquainted with the binding affinity and punicalagin-based nanocarrier interactions with this receptor. In silico docking studies of macrophage mannose receptors and punicalagin showed binding interactions on its surface. PG interacted with hydrogen bonds to the charged residue ASP668 and GLY666 and polar residue GLN760 of the Mn receptor. Mannose with a docking score of -5.811 Kcal/mol interacted with four hydrogen bonds and the mannose receptor of macrophage, and in PLGA, it showed a -4.334 Kcal/mol docking score. Further, the analysis proceeded with density functional theory analysis (DFT) and HOMO-LUMO analysis, followed by an extensive 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation to analyse the trajectories showing the slightest deviation and fluctuation. While analysing the ligand and protein interaction, a wonderful interaction was found among the atoms of the ligand and protein residues. This computational study confirms that this nanocarrier could be a promising lead molecule to regulate the incidence of drug-induced neutropenia. Furthermore, experimental validation is required before this can be stated with complete confidence or before human use.

AB  - Introduction and Objectives: Early dementia diagnosis in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) is challenging due to limited availability of brief, culturally appropriate, and psychometrically validated tests. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the most widely used cognitive screening tests in primary and secondary care globally. In the current study, we adapted and validated MoCA in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam) and determined the optimal cut-off points that correspond to screening for clinical diagnosis of dementia and MCI.
   Methods: A systematic process of adaptation and modifications of MoCA was fulfilled. A total of 446 participants: 214 controls, 102 dementia, and 130 MCI were recruited across six centers.
   Results: Across five languages, the area under the curve for diagnosis of dementia varied from 0.89 to 0.98 and MCI varied from 0.73 to 0.96. The sensitivity, specificity and optimum cut-off scores were established separately for five Indian languages.
   Conclusions: The Indian adapted MoCA is standardized and validated in five Indian languages for early diagnosis of dementia and MCI in a linguistically and culturally diverse population.

AB  - Background: Burn care in India is limited by multiple constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures restricted access to non-COVID emergency conditions, including burns. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the pandemic on burn care in India.
   Methods: Using the qualitative exploratory methods, we conducted in-depth interviews (IDI) with plastic and general surgeons representing burn units from across India. Participants were selected purposively to ensure representation and diversity and the sample size was guided by thematic saturation. Thematic analysis was undertaken adopting an inductive coding using NVivo 12 Pro.
   Results: 19 participants from diverse geographic locations and provider types were interviewed. Three major emerging themes were, change in patient and burn injury characteristics; health system barriers, adaptation, and challenges; and lessons and emerging recommendations for policy and practice. There was change in patient load, risk factors, and distribution of burns. The emergency services were intermittently disrupted, the routine and surgical services were rationally curtailed, follow-up and rehabilitation services were most affected. Measures like telemedicine and decentralising burn services emerged as the most important lesson.

AB  - Clinical features of COVID-19 range from mild respiratory symptoms to fatal outcomes. Autopsy findings are important for understanding COVID-19-related pathophysiology and clinical manifestations. This systematic study aims to evaluate autopsy findings in paediatric cases. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database Reviews. We included studies that reported autopsy findings in children with COVID-19. A total of 11 studies (24 subjects) were included. The mean age of patients was 5.9 +/- 5.7 years. Grossly, there was pericardial and pleural effusion, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiomegaly, heavy soft lung, enlarged kidney, and enlarged brain. The autopsy findings of the lungs were diffuse alveolar damage (78.3%), fibrin thrombi (43.5%), haemorrhage (30.4%), pneumonia (26%), congestion and oedema (26%), angiomatoid pattern (17.4%), and alveolar megakaryocytes (17.4%). The heart showed interstitial oedema (80%), myocardial foci of band necrosis (60%), fibrin microthrombi (60%), interstitial and perivascular inflammation (40%), and pancarditis (30%). The liver showed centrilobular congestion (60%), micro/macrovesicular steatosis (30%), and arterial/venous thrombi (20%). The kidney showed acute tubular necrosis (75%), congestion (62.5%), fibrin thrombi in glomerular capillaries (37.5%), and nephrocalcinosis, mesangial cell hyperplasia, tubular hyaline/granular casts (25% each). The spleen showed splenitis (71.4%), haemorrhage (71.4%), lymphoid hypoplasia (57.1%), and haemophagocytosis (28.6%). The brain revealed oedema (87.5%), congestion (75%), reactive microglia (62.5%), neuronal ischaemic necrosis (62.5%), meningoencephalitis (37.5%), and fibrin thrombi (25%). SARS-CoV-2 and CD68 were positive by immunohistochemistry in 85.7% and 33.3% cases, respectively. Autopsy findings of COVID-19 in children are variable in all important organs. It may help in better understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants are potential threat and posing new challenges for medical intervention due to high transmissibility and escaping neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Many of these variants have mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that interacts with the host cell receptor. Rapid mutation in the RBD through natural selection to improve affinity for host receptor and antibody pressure from vaccinated or infected individual will greatly impact the presently adopted strategies for developing interventions. Understanding the nature of mutations and how they impact the biophysical, biochemical and immunological properties of the RBD will help immensely to improve the intervention strategies. To understand the impact of mutation on the protease sensitivity, thermal stability, affinity for the receptor and immune response, we prepared several mutants of soluble RBD that belong to the variants of concern (VoCs) and interest (VoIs) and characterize them. Our results show that the mutations do not impact the overall structure of the RBD. However, the mutants showed increase in the thermal melting point, few mutants were more sensitive to protease degradation, most of them have enhanced affinity for ACE2 and some of them induced better immune response compared to the parental RBD.

AB  - Background. The traditional coronary calcium score (CCS) is a time-tested tool for the evaluation of coronary atherosclerosis and predictor of future cardiovascular events. Non-traditional tools can also have a value in predicting and detecting subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD).
   Methods. We studied the role of CCS, the traditional CAD risk predictor, and the less-recognized, non-traditional risk factors, i.e. epicardial fat volume (EFV) and thoracic extracoronary calcium (ECC), to assess the degree of subclinical CAD. In this cross-sectional observational study, we included 950 Indian patients (suspected to have CAD). Coronary computed tomography angiography was performed. Estimation of CCS, EFV and thoracic ECC was done.
   Results. A CCS of 0 was seen in 583 patients (61.4%). Of these, 492 patients had normal coronary angiogram but 91 patients had CAD. The median values of EFV were statistically significantly higher in the `CAD present and CCS 0' group compared to the `CAD absent and CCS 0' group (p<0.001). The presence of thoracic ECC involving at least a single site was seen in only 6 of these 91 patients. When both EFV and CCS were considered together for the detection of CAD, the sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were improved compared to either of these in isolation. When ECC was taken together with CCS and EFV, no further improvement in sensitivity or NPV was observed.
   Conclusion. The combined use of traditional CCS along with non-traditional EFV may guide us in better profiling cardiovascular risk and supplement the various traditional cardiovascular risk factors/scores.

AB  - Active pull of the suprahyoid muscle complex (SMC) was thought to be the main contributor of relapse in mandibular or chin advancement, but literature evidence lacks human studies that assess the role of the SMC following genial advancement (GeA). This study therefore aimed to analyse the influence of SMC pull on relapse following GeA by distraction osteogenesis based on electromyographic (EMG) changes. EMG was recorded and analysed preoperatively (T0), at four months (T1), and at one-year follow up (T2) at three submental regions during two different activities. The outcome variables were EMG changes of the SMC, and hard and soft tissue relapse. Assessment was carried out by comparison of EMG and lateral cephalograms taken at T0, T1, and T2. Ten patients (7 male and 3 female; median (SD) age 21.2 (3.99) years, range 18-28) were included. The EMG values revealed a statistically significant reduction between T0 and T1. T2 values were not higher than T0 during any activity. The results of Pearson's correlation demonstrated no significant relation between the amount of relapse and change in EMG values. This study concluded that active pull of the SMC is not the actual reason for skeletal relapse in chin or mandibular advancement. Passive biomechanics such as adnexial or muscular connective tissue, and paramandibular periosteum pull with native bone remodelling might be the prime reasons for relapse. However, further large sample studies are warranted to find the actual causes of relapse. (c) 2022 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anoctaminopathies are a group of autosomal recessive skeletal muscle disorders with various clinical phenotypes, caused by anoctamin 5 (ANO5) gene mutations and the abnormal expression of ANO5 protein. Patients with recessive mutations in ANO5 present with variable symptoms ranging from asymptomatic hyperCKemia and exercise-induced myalgia to proximal and/or distal muscle weakness. Here, we describe the clinical, pathological, and molecular findings of two unrelated patients with ANO5-related muscular dystrophy (MD). Ninety-six histologically identified MD cases were subjected to next-generation sequencing using a customized panel of 54 genes (IIlumina Design Studio). Two patients were diagnosed with ANO5-related MD. One patient had a pathogenic homozygous mutation of c.1406G>A in exon 14, while the other patient had a novel heterozygous mutation of c.2141C>G in exon 19 of ANO5 gene. Both showed two different phenotypes (limb girdle MD and Miyoshi myopathy) and histomorphological patterns. Muscle biopsy of one patient in addition showed amyloid deposit in the walls of interstitial blood vessels. ANO5-related MD is a heterogeneous disease with different clinical phenotypes as well as genotypes. All muscle biopsies with unclassified muscular dystrophies should be subjected to Congo red stain. The results of this study suggest that screening for ANO5 gene should represent an early step in the diagnostic work-up of the patients with undiagnosed MD and persistent asymptomatic hyperCKemia, even when muscle biopsy histomorphology is normal.

AB  - Background: Approximately, 80% of civilian cranial gunshot injuries in India are mainly due to unlicensed mostly country-made guns, called the "Desi-Kattas," manufactured by the traditional gunsmiths. These injuries constitute a unique subgroup, with respect to the make and design along with the unique wound ballistics compared to the factory-made firearms.
   Objective: This study is aimed at defining the prognostic factors in predicting the outcomes related to cranial gunshot injuries due to these desi-kattas. Methods: Ten patients with kata-related cranial gunshot injury underwent surgical intervention at our institution, between 2014 and 2018. Their clinical status, imaging features, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.
   Results: Ten patients with kata-related gunshot injuries to the head were identified. Homicidal injuries were documented in six cases. Five had a GCS of 13-15 at presentation. Exit wounds were noted in 50% of the suicidal cases. Multilobar involvement was seen in 70% of cases, with the bullet crossing the midline in only 40% cases. Decompressive craniectomy was required in five cases. Eight patients had a Glasgow Outcome Score of four or more at 6 months of follow-up. There was one death during the follow-up period, while the other patient remains to be in vegetative state.
   Conclusion: The Katta-related cranial injuries constitute low-muzzle velocity injuries with the majority of the patients sustaining nonfatal injuries, especially homicidal. The presence of positive CT findings and the crossing of the bullet across the midline on CT brain predicts dismal prognosis. Optimal neurosurgical approach should consist of minimal local debridement and attain water seal dural closure.

AB  - Objectives: Different variant of GBM has been reported viz. Epithelioid Glioblastoma (GBM-E), Rhabdoid GBM (GBM-R), Small cell GBM (GBM-SC), Giant cell GBM (GBM-GC), GBM with neuro ectodermal differentiation (GBM-PNET) with unknown behavior.
   Materials: We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data analysis of these rare GBM variants. We searched PubMed, google search, and Cochrane library for eligible studies till July 1st 2016 published in English language and collected data regarding age, sex, subtype and treatment received, Progression Free Survival (PFS), Overall Survival (OS). Statistical Package for social sciences (SPSS) v16 software was used for all statistical analysis.
   Results: We retrieved data of 196 patients with rare GBM subtypes. Among these GBM-GC is commonest (51%), followed by GBM-R (19%), GBM-PNET (13%), GBM-SC (9%) and GBM-E (8%). Median age at diagnosis was 38, 40, 43.5, 69.5 and 18 years, respectively. Male: female ratio was 2:1 for GBM-E, and 1:3 for GBM-SC. Maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant local radiation was used for most of the patients. However, 6 patients with GBM-PNET, 3 each of GBM-E, GBM-SC received adjuvant craniospinal radiation. Out of 88 patients who received chemotherapy, 64 received Temozolomide alone or combination chemotherapy containing Temozolomide. Median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 9 and 16 months. In univariate analysis, patient with a Gross Total Resection had significantly better PFS and OS compared to those with a Sub Total Resection [23 vs. 13 months (p-0.01)]. Median OS for GBM PNET, GBM-GC, GBM-SC, GBM-R and GBM-E were 32, 18.3, 11, 12 and 7.7 months, respectively (P = 0.001). Interestingly, 31.3%, 37.8% of patients with GBM-E, GBM-R had CSF dissemination.
   Conclusion: Overall cohort of rarer GBM variant has equivalent survival compared to GBM not otherwise specified. However, epithelioid and Rhabdoid GBM has worst survival and one third shows CSF dissemination.

AB  - Background BCG vaccines are given to more than 100 million children every year, but there is considerable debate regarding the effectiveness of BCG vaccination in preventing tuberculosis and death, particularly among older children and adults. We therefore aimed to investigate the age-specific impact of infant BCG vaccination on tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) development and mortality.
   Methods In this systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Web of Science, BIOSIS, and Embase without language restrictions for case-contact cohort studies of tuberculosis contacts published between Jan 1, 1998, and April 7, 2018. Search terms included "mycobacterium tuberculosis", "TB", "tuberculosis", and "contact". We excluded cohort studies that did not provide information on BCG vaccination or were done in countries that did not recommend BCG vaccination at birth. Individual-level participant data for a prespecified list of variables, including the characteristics of the exposed participant (contact), the index case, and the environment, were requested from authors of all eligible studies. Our primary outcome was a composite of prevalent (diagnosed at or within 90 days of baseline) and incident (diagnosed more than 90 days after baseline) tuberculosis in contacts exposed to tuberculosis. Secondary outcomes were pulmonary tuberculosis, extrapulmonary tuberculosis, and mortality. We derived adjusted odds ratios (aORs) using mixed-effects, binary, multivariable logistic regression analyses with study-level random effects, adjusting for the variable of interest, baseline age, sex, previous tuberculosis, and whether data were collected prospectively or retrospectively. We stratified our results by contact age and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection status. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020180512.
   Findings We identified 14 927 original records from our database searches. We included participant-level data from 26 cohort studies done in 17 countries in our meta-analysis. Among 68 552 participants, 1782 (2.6%) developed tuberculosis (1309 [2.6%] of 49 686 BCG-vaccinated participants vs 473 [2.5%] of 18 866 unvaccinated participants). The overall effectiveness of BCG vaccination against all tuberculosis was 18% (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.91). When stratified by age, BCG vaccination only significantly protected against all tuberculosis in children younger than 5 years (aOR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.81). Among contacts with a positive tuberculin skin test or IFNy release assay, BCG vaccination significantly protected against tuberculosis among all participants (aOR 0.81, 95% CI 0.69-0.96), participants younger than 5 years (0.68, 0.47-0.97), and participants aged 5-9 years (0.62, 0.38-0.99). There was no protective effect among those with negative tests, unless they were younger than 5 years (0.54, 0.32-0.90). 14 cohorts reported on whether tuberculosis was pulmonary or extrapulmonary (n=57421). BCG vaccination significantly protected against pulmonary tuberculosis among all participants (916 [2. 2%] in 41119 vaccinated participants vs 334 [2.1%] in 16 161 unvaccinated participants; aOR 0.81, 0.70-0.94) but not against extra pulmonary tuberculosis (106 [0.3%] in 40 318 vaccinated participants vs 38 [0 2%]in 15 865 unvaccinated participants; 0.96, 0 - 65-1.41). In the four studies with mortality data, BCG vaccination was significantly protective against death (0.25, 0.13-0-49).
   Interpretation Our results suggest that BCG vaccination at birth is effective at preventing tuberculosis in young children but is ineffective in adolescents and adults. Immunoprotection therefore needs to be boosted in older populations. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background Health-care-associated infections (HAIs) cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, including in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Networks of hospitals implementing standardised HAI surveillance can provide valuable data on HAI burden, and identify and monitor HAI prevention gaps. Hospitals in many LMICs use HAI case definitions developed for higher-resourced settings, which require human resources and laboratory and imaging tests that are often not available.
   Methods A network of 26 tertiary-level hospitals in India was created to implement HAI surveillance and prevention activities. Existing HAI case definitions were modified to facilitate standardised, resource-appropriate surveillance across hospitals. Hospitals identified health-care-associated bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs) and reported clinical and microbiological data to the network for analysis.
   Findings 26 network hospitals reported 2622 health-care-associated bloodstream infections and 737 health-care-associated UTIs from 89 intensive care units (ICUs) between May 1, 2017, and Oct 31, 2018. Central line-associated bloodstream infection rates were highest in neonatal ICUs (>20 per 1000 central line days). Catheter-associated UTI rates were highest in paediatric medical ICUs (4.5 per 1000 urinary catheter days). laebsieUa spp (24.8%) were the most frequent organism in bloodstream infections and Candida spp (29.4%) in UTIs. Carbapenem resistance was common in Gram-negative infections, occurring in 72% of bloodstream infections and 76% of UTIs caused by laebsiella spp, 77% of bloodstream infections and 76% of UTIs caused by Acinetobacter spp, and 64% of bloodstream infections and 72% of UTIs caused by Pseudomonas spp.
   Interpretation The first standardised HAI surveillance network in India has succeeded in implementing locally adapted and context-appropriate protocols consistently across hospitals and has been able to identify a large number of HAIs. Network data show high HAI and antimicrobial resistance rates in tertiary hospitals, showing the importance of implementing multimodal HAI prevention and antimicrobial resistance containment strategies.

AB  - Background: Arachnoid cysts are benign extra-cerebral congenital lesions that are thought to arise from the splitting of the arachnoid membrane. Although most arachnoid cysts remain static with advancing age, occasionally they can become symptomatic due to cyst enlargement or hemorrhage. Hemorrhage into the arachnoid cysts (intra-cystic hemorrhage) with or without associated subdural hematoma is of rare occurrence.
   Case Discussion: A 23-year-old male presented with a history of sudden onset severe headache while sleeping. The patient also noticed double vision, especially when looking towards the left side. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan of the head showed left temporal pole hematoma with left Sylvian fissure bleed and bilateral fronto-temporoparietal (FTP) subacute SDH.
   Conclusion: Every patient with incidentally detected AC, especially in the middle cranial fossa, should be counseled regarding the risk of possible complications including hemorrhage and regular follow-up.

AB  - Background: Although epilepsy is a common neurological condition, there is paucity of nationwide data on treatment patterns and sociodemographic and clinical factors affecting treatment decisions in India.
   Objective: To assess clinical profiles, usage pattern of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and seizure control among patients with epilepsy in India.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study on adult patients with epilepsy who were on AEDs for at least six months before enrollment. Data were collected from patient interviews and medical records.
   Results: Out of 800 enrolled patients, a majority (69.0%) had generalized onset seizure in the six months before enrollment. The median age at epilepsy onset was 20.0 (1.0-64.0) years; 40.0% of the patients were females, 48.5% were married, 99.1% were literate, and 67.0% belonged to the lower or upper-middle socioeconomic class. Overall, 459 patients (57.4%) received AEDs as combination therapy. Most patients received levetiracetam (37.0%), sodium valproate (18.5%), carbamazepine (17.3%), or phenytoin (13.8%) as monotherapy, and clobazam ( 59.7%), levetiracetam (52.9%), carbamazepine (26.4%), sodium valproate (24.8%), or phenytoin (24.0%) in combination therapy. Quality of life was comparable for first- and third-generation AEDs. Adverse drug reactions were mostly attributed to dose modification or switching between drugs. No serious adverse drug reactions or new safety concerns were identified.
   Conclusions: Findings from this large, cross-sectional, observational, multicenter study indicate that first-generation AEDs sodium valproate and phenytoin continued to be used in a substantial number of patients on monotherapy and combination therapy in India, even though an increasing trend toward use of second-generation AEDs was noted in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: Host biomarkers are needed to monitor the response to anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for ensuring effective therapy and preventing drug-resistant tuberculosis. We sought to find the correlation between the serum levels of SAA1 and IL-1beta in response to ATT in adult patients with pulmonary TB (PTB) or extra-pulmonary TB (EPTB).
   Methods: Blood samples of 32 patients with PTB and 28 patients with EPTB were analyzed. The blood samples were collected at baseline, two months and six months following treatment initiation. SAA1 and IL-1beta levels were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
   Results: In the PTB group, the mean levels of SAA1 decreased significantly (p <0.001) after the intensive phase (two months) and continuous phase (six months) of ATT in comparison with the baseline value. IL-1beta values also decreased significantly (p = 0.005) after the intensive phase (two months) compared with the baseline values. In the EPTB group, there was a significant reduction in the mean serum level of SAA1 (p <0.001) and IL-1beta (p = 0.001) after the intensive phase (two months) in comparison with the baseline value, whereas the reduction at six months was not significant.
   Conclusions: SAA1 and IL-1beta may be useful potential treatment-monitoring biomarkers, especially in the intensive phase of therapy for both PTB and EPTB.

AB  - Background: Despite the evolution of endoscopic techniques, large pituitary adenomas with unfavorable characteristics and irregular anatomical configurations continue to pose a challenge for the dexterity, skills, and patience of endoscopic surgeons. Transcranial surgery retains a significant role in these situations where the tumor access, hemostasis, and dissection around adjoining neurovascular tissues can be controlled efficaciously.
   Objective: In this report, we describe our experience with transcranial surgery for pituitary adenomas highlighting its safety and versatility in peripheral centers.
   Methods: We accessed the case files and imaging records of pituitary tumors operated between 2001 and 2019 at a private hospital in a major Indian city. The records were analyzed with emphasis on postoperative clinical course, visual, and endocrinological outcomes. The data was analyzed with respect to differences between transcranial and transsphenoidal procedures. Categorical variables were compared with Chi-square test/Fischer's exact test and difference in means evaluated with Welch's t-test.
   Results: A total of 178 procedures were performed in 173 patients with pituitary adenoma, who were the subjects of this study. Ninety-eight ( 56.7%) patients were treated by transsphenoidal excision whereas 80 (46.2%) underwent transcranial procedures (75 primary and five secondary). In the patients operated transcranially, we observed three deaths and nine patients suffered from significant morbidity. Visual outcomes were similar to the group operated transsphenoidally. However, incidence of panhypopituitarism was significantly higher in transcranial procedures; the extent of resection was poorer than transsphenoidal surgeries owing to more extensive nature of tumors.
   Conclusions: In low-volume centers, the endoscopic skills required for transsphenoidal resection of large and complex pituitary adenomas may be scarce. Transcranial surgery, dependent on familiar microsurgical techniques and equipment, may still be viable, safe, and an effective option.

TI  - Suicide numbers during the first 9-15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-existing trends: An interrupted time series analysis in 33 countries

AB  - Background Predicted increases in suicide were not generally observed in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the picture may be changing and patterns might vary across demographic groups. We aimed to provide a timely, granular picture of the pandemic's impact on suicides globally.
   Methods We identified suicide data from official public-sector sources for countries/areas-within-countries, searching websites and academic literature and contacting data custodians and authors as necessary. We sent our first data request on 22nd June 2021 and stopped collecting data on 31st October 2021. We used interrupted time series (ITS) analyses to model the association between the pandemic's emergence and total suicides and suicides by sex-, age-and sex-by-age in each country/area-within-country. We compared the observed and expected numbers of suicides in the pandemic's first nine and first 10-15 months and used meta-regression to explore sources of variation.
   Findings We sourced data from 33 countries (24 high-income, six upper-middle-income, three lower-middle-income; 25 with whole-country data, 12 with data for area(s)-within-the-country, four with both). There was no evidence of greater-than-expected numbers of suicides in the majority of countries/areas-within-countries in any analysis; more commonly, there was evidence of lower-than-expected numbers. Certain sex, age and sex-by-age groups stood out as potentially concerning, but these were not consistent across countries/areas-within-countries. In the meta-regression, different patterns were not explained by countries' COVID-19 mortality rate, stringency of public health response, economic support level, or presence of a national suicide prevention strategy. Nor were they explained by countries' income level, although the meta-regression only included data from high-income and upper-middle-income countries, and there were suggestions from the ITS analyses that lower-middle-income countries fared less well.
   Interpretation Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater-than-expected, these countries/areas-within-countries are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue.

AB  - Objectives: There is a higher prevalence of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in more recent times, owing to increased awareness, clinical diagnostic skills, and advancements in neuroimaging modalities. This study aimed to identify and characterize the geographical, clinical, and etiological profiles of patients with CVST that may be relevant to planning appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to improve functional recovery. Methods and Results: A retrospective observational study was carried out at a tertiary care hospital between March 2014 and October 2018. The demographics and clinical profile of the hospitalized patients were extracted from the Medical Record Division. Choropleth maps were created to present the geographic distribution of the patients with CVST admitted to our hospital. A total of 145 patients with CVST were included in the study. Etiological factors revealed striking abnormalities in red blood cells counts and serum homocysteine. Analyzing the geographical distribution of the patients with CVST showed most of the patients hailed from Central Karnataka Plateau 106 (73%). Polycythemia was most commonly seen in patients residing in the Central Karnataka Plateau 21(62%). Conclusion: It is inferred that large scale community-based studies to identify a genetic abnormality like a mutant erythropoietin gene should be undertaken to plan effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive measures.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The intramedullary route holds the potential to provide the most concentration of stem cells in cases of spinal cord injury (SCI). However, the safety and feasibility of this route need to be studied in human subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of intramedullary injected bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) in acute complete SCI.METHODS In this prospective study conducted over a 2-year period, 27 patients with acute (defined as within 1 week of injury) and complete SCI were randomized to receive BM-MSC or placebo through an intramedullary route intraopera-tively at the time of spinal decompression and fusion. Institutional ethics approval was obtained, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Safety was assessed using laboratory and clinicoradiological parameters preoperatively and 3 and 6 months after surgery.RESULTS A total of 180 patients were screened during the study period. Of these, 27 were enrolled in the study. Three patients withdrew, 3 patients were lost to follow-up, and 8 patients died, leaving a total of 13 patients for final analysis. Seven of these patients were in the stem cell group, and 6 were in the control group. Both groups were well matched in terms of sex, age, and weight. No adverse events related to stem cell injection were noted for laboratory and radiological parameters. Five patients in the control group and 3 patients in the stem cell group died during the follow-up period.CONCLUSIONS Intramedullary injection of BM-MSCs was found to be safe and feasible for use in patients with acute complete SCI.

AB  - Background: Accuracy of screw placement is one of the important factors necessary for adequate union in odontoid fractures with malposition rates as high as 27.2% with standard techniques.
   Objective: To evaluate efficacy of intraoperative O-arm assistance in improving accuracy of anterior odontoid screw placement and clinco-radiological outcome in type II and III odontoid fractures.
   Material and Methods: In this retrospective study, surgery consisted of anterior odontoid screw fixation under intraoperative O-arm assistance over 5 years. Demographical, clinical, radiological, operative details and postoperative events were retrieved from hospital database and evaluated for fusion and surgical outcome.
   Results: 50 patients (Mean age 34.6 years, SD 14.10, range: 7-70 years; 44 males and 6 females) with Type II and Type III odontoid fracture underwent O-arm assisted anterior screw placement. The mean interval between injury and surgery was 12 days (range 1-65 days). Mean operating time was 132.2 min +/- SD 33.56 with average blood loss of 93 ml. +/- SD 61.46. With our technique, accurate screw placement was achieved in 100% patients. At the mean follow-up of 26.4 month (SD13.75), overall acceptable fusion rate was 97.8% with non-union in 2.2% patients. Morbidity occurred in two patients; one patient developed fixation failure while other patient had nonunion which was managed with posterior C1-C2 arthrodesis. We had surgical mortality in one patient due to SAH. So overall our procedure was successful in 94% patients and among patients whose follow-up was available, acceptable fusion rates of 97.8% were achieved.
   Conclusion: We conclude that use of intraoperative three-dimensional imaging using O-arm for anterior odontoid screw fixation improves accuracy and leads to improved radiological and clinical outcomes. It further enables us to extend the indications of odontoid screw fixation to selected complex Type II and rostral Type III odontoid fractures.

AB  - Background: There is scant literature comparing high tidal volume ventilation (HTV) over low tidal volume (LTV) ventilation in acute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI).
   Objective: The aim of this prospective randomized controlled parallel-group, single-blinded study was to compare the effect of two different tidal volumes (12-15 mL/kg and 6-8 mL/kg) in CSCI on days to achieve ventilator-free breathing (VFB), PaO2/FIO2 ratio, the incidence of complications, requirement of vasopressor drugs, total duration of hospital stay, and mortality.
   Materials and Methods: We enrolled patients with acute high traumatic CSCI admitted to the neurotrauma intensive care unit within 24 h of injury, requiring mechanical ventilation. Participants were randomized to receive either HTV, 12-15 mL/kg (group H) or LTV, 6-8 mL/kg (group L) tidal volume ventilation.
   Results and Conclusions: A total of 56 patients, 28 in each group were analyzed. Patient demographics and injury severity were comparable between the groups. VFB was achieved in 23 and 19 patients in groups H and L, respectively. The median number of days required to achieve VFB was 3 (2, 56) and 8 (2, 50) days, P = 0.33; PaO2: FIO2 ratio was 364.0 +/- 64 and 321.0 +/- 67.0, P = 0.01; the incidence of atelectasis was 25% and 46%, P = 0.16, respectively, in group H and group L. The hemodynamic parameters and the vasopressor requirement were comparable in both groups. There was no barotrauma. The duration of hospital stay (P = 0.2) and mortality (P = 0.2) was comparable in both groups. There was no significant difference in days to achieve ventilator-free breathing with HTV (12-15 mL/kg) ventilation compared to LTV (6-8 mL/kg) ventilation in acute CSCI. The PaO2:FiO(2) ratio was higher with the use of 12-15 mL/kg. No difference in mortality and duration of hospital stay was seen in either group.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to evaluate the longitudinal changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity of the masseter and temporalis muscles before and after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) total joint replacement (TJR) in ankylosis patients. A prospective longitudinal study was designed on patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral TMJ-TJR. EMG activity at rest and maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was recorded for the muscles preoperatively (T0), and at one-week (T1) and six-month (T2) follow up. The study sample was composed of 10 (male: female 2.3:1) patients undergoing TMJ-TJR. The number of unilateral and bilateral cases was three and seven, respectively. In both unilateral and bilateral cases a statistically significant reduction in EMG activity of the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles was observed at T1. At T2, EMG activity of the muscles was found to be approaching the preoperative value. In unilateral cases, when the affected side at T0, T1, and T2 was compared with T0 for the unaffected side, statistically significant differences were seen for the masseter. In the case of the temporalis, similar results were seen except at T2 for the postural rest position. The results indicate that re-attachment of the masseter and temporalis muscles occurs progressively post TMJ-TJR. (c) 2022 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Background: There is dearth of literature on impact of age - pediatric versus adult, Suzuki staging - early versus late, and revascularization type - indirect versus direct on clinical and angiographic outcome in moyamoya disease (MMD). Hence, we intend to comprehensively evaluate factors influencing outcome in MMD following surgical revascularization.
   Methods: MMD patients operated at our institute from January 2011 to August 2018 were followed for an average 24 months. Primary outcomes were modified Rankin score (mRS) and stroke risk reduction. Secondary outcome was angiographic outcome score (AOS).
   Results: A total of 133 patients including 37.6% adults (>18 years; n = 50) underwent 175 revascularizations - 89 direct (DR) and 86 indirect (IR) subgroups. Mean mRS scores improved in pediatric DR (P < 0.001), IR (P < 0.001), adult IR (P = 0.10), and DR (P = 0.25) subgroups. Recurrent stroke rate was similar in pediatric-DR (2.7%) and IR (7.6%, P = 0.61), and adult-DR (0%) and IR (4.1%) subgroups (P = 1.00). AOS scores improved in pediatric DR (P = 0.002) and IR (P = 0.01), and adult-DR (P = 0.02) and IR (P = 0.06) subgroups. Late-stage MMD (Suzuki IV-VI) showed better improvement in mRS scores than early-stage-Suzuki (I-III; P < 0.001). Recurrent stroke rates were similar (P = 0.26) and AOS scores improved significantly in early- and late-stage MMD (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In pediatrics, clinical and angiographic outcome significantly improved after revascularization procedure, and in adults, angiographic improvement was more evident than clinical recovery. Late-stage Suzuki MMD patients demonstrated significantly better clinical improvement than early stage. The angiographic improvement was equivalent to early stage, irrespective of age and type of revascularization.

AB  - Vitamin D's role in combating the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2), the virus causing COVID-19, has been established in unveiling viable inhibitors of COVID-19. The current study investigated the role of pre and pro-vitamin D bioactives from edible mushrooms against Mpro and PLpro proteases of SARS-CoV-2 by computational experiments. The bioactives of mushrooms, specifically ergosterol (provitamin D-2), 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin-D-3), 22,23-dihydroergocalciferol (provitamin-D-4), cholecalciferol (vitamin-D-3), and ergocalciferol (vitamin D-2) were screened against Mpro and PLpro. Molecular docking analyses of the generated bioactive protease complexes unravelled the differential docking energies, which ranged from -7.5 kcal/mol to -4.5 kcal/mol. Ergosterol exhibited the lowest binding energy (-7.5 kcal/mol) against Mpro and PLpro (-5.9 kcal/mol). The Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MMPBSA) and MD simulation analyses indicated that the generated complexes were stable, thus affirming the putative binding of the bioactives to viral proteases. Considering the pivotal role of vitamin D bioactives, their direct interactions against SARS-CoV-2 proteases highlight the promising role of bioactives present in mushrooms as potent nutraceuticals against COVID-19.

AB  - We report the strategy of anesthesia and intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) in a 29-year-old, 22 weeks pregnant patient posted for surgery for aggressive vertebral body hemangioma. We used propofol and fentanyl-based anesthesia for IONM. Motor-evoked potentials (MEP) and somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) were used to monitor the neural tracts during surgery. Fetal heart rate monitoring was done preoperatively and postoperatively. Train of 8, 75 mu s duration pulse, 250-500 Hz stimulus was used for MEP and 30 mA, 200-400 mu s, 3-5 Hz was used for SSEP. No new motor or somatosensory deficits appeared. Our findings suggest that IONM can be safely done in pregnant women.

AB  - Medical health systems continue to be challenged due to newly emerging COVID-19, and there is an urgent need for alternative approaches for treatment. An increasing number of clinical observations indicate cytokine storms to be associated with COVID-19 severity and also to be a significant cause of death among COVID-19 patients. Cytokine storm involves the extensive proliferative and hyperactive activity of T and macrophage cells and the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Stem cells are the type of cell having self-renewal properties and giving rise to differentiated cells. Currently, stem cell therapy is an exciting and promising therapeutic approach that can treat several diseases that were considered incurable in the past. It may be possible to develop novel methods to treat various diseases by identifying stem cells' growth and differentiation factors. Treatment with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in medicine is anticipated to be highly effective. The present review article is organized to put forward the positive arguments and implications in support of mesenchymal stem cell therapy as an alternative therapy to cytokine storms, to combat COVID-19. Using the immunomodulatory potential of the MSCs, it is possible to fight against COVID-19 and counterbalance the cytokine storm.

KW  - striatal necrosis
AB  - Diaphragmatic flutter (DF) is an unusual movement disorder with involuntary and repetitive contractions of the diaphragm with or without other abdominal muscle involvement. The disorder is known to occur across all ages including newborns. The etiology is diverse and so are the therapeutic options. Reaching an etiological diagnosis is considerably delayed. Response to therapy is variable and is governed by the underlying etiology. We describe three children with diaphragmatic flutter. The etiology was diverse with unrelated pathologies such as hypocalcemia, striatal necrosis, and idiopathic. All three children responded promptly and completely to calcium, high dose thiamine and biotin, and clonazepam, respectively. Our case series underscores the importance of clinical identification of such rare movement disorders. It also emphasizes that directed etiological evaluation may lead to successful amelioration of DF which is otherwise considered refractory to therapy.

AB  - Objective: When there is a complete slippage of facet joints of C1 over C2 such that there is no contact between the articulating surfaces of C1 and C2, the condition is known as atlantoaxial spondyloptosis (AAS). AAS represents an extremely rare manifestation of atlantoaxial instability. This study was performed to highlight the presentation, radiological features, and management of unilateral AAS in pediatric patients.
   Material and Methods: We retrospectively identified four pediatric patients with AAS from our hospital records in the last 6 years (2014-2019).
   Results: Among the four patients with unilateral AAS, three were posttraumic and one was diagnosed with craniovertebral junction tuberculosis (CVJ TB). All the patients had a varying degree of spastic quadriparesis on presentation. One patient with CVJ TB presented with neck tilt. All patients with traumatic unilateral AAS were associated with an odontoid fracture. These patients underwent C1-C2 fixation with complete reduction of spondyloptosis using the techniques of joint manipulation and joint remodeling with a posterior only approach. Complete reduction of AAS in patients with trauma was also associated with the realignment of the odontoid fracture. All patients improved neurologically after surgery and achieved excellent correction of the deformity on a follow-up imaging.
   Conclusion: Pediatric unilateral AAS is an extremely rare phenomenon. A single-stage posterior approach with C1-C2 fixation is a feasible technique for the treatment of this seemingly difficult to correct deformity in pediatric patients and the clinical outcomes are excellent.

AB  - Traditional drug development is a tedious process with involvement of enormous cost and a high attrition rate. Outsourcing drug development services to contract research organizations (CROs) has become an important strategy for cost and risk reduction, capacity building, and data generation. The therapeutic and operational expertise of these CROs has allowed pharmaceutical industry to reduce in-house infrastructure as well as research capacity. Working with specialized CROs has not only increased the rate of success but also the speed of drug discovery process. Small firms with promising molecules but limited resources and large firms interested in diversifying their dimensions are utilizing the services of efficient CROs. Globally, approximately one-third of the drug development processes are now being outsourced and the data generated by the independent third party are well appreciated during regulatory submissions. In this article, we discuss the international and national trends, outsourcing services and models, key considerations while selecting CRO, and benefits and challenges of outsourcing. Further, we discuss how the technical expertise of competent CROs was utilized when traditional ways of conducting clinical trials were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, the increasing health-care demands, COVID-19 pandemic or any other such upcoming health crisis, and recent advances in advanced technologies (machine learning and artificial intelligence, etc.) are likely to fuel global CRO market in the coming years.

AB  - Background: Telemedicine is being increasingly used to provide healthcare to patients, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Aims: The study aimed to study patient perception and satisfaction with a smartphone-based hybrid teledermatology service initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This was a cross-sectional telephonic survey including patients >= 18 years of age who had received a teledermatology consultation. After noting the demographic, clinical and teleconsultation details, patients were administered the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire and an additional 6-item questionnaire. Patients were also asked to give qualitative feedback and suggestions for improvement using a semi-structured interview guide. Results: We interviewed 201 subjects. The most common diagnoses were pemphigus (27, 13.4%), superficial fungal infections (24, 11.8%), psoriasis (22, 10.9%) and dermatitis (21, 10.4%). The overall mean Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire score was 4.20 +/- 0.71. One hundred seventy-one (85.1%) patients responded that they would use teledermatology services again, while 168 (83.6%) reported satisfaction with the quality of services. A majority of the patients were largely satisfied with the various components involved, though some concerns were raised about the care perceived as not at par with physical consultations, difficulty in procuring medicines, lack of confidence in photographic diagnoses and the lack of a personal touch. Patients with urticaria (P=0.020), those who were advised a change in treatment (P=0.029) and those with improvement in their skin disease (P=0.026) were more likely to be satisfied. Limitations: Our study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic when patient acceptability was likely to be higher. Only follow-up patients were included in the study. Conclusion: Patient satisfaction levels were generally high with teledermatology. Addressing lacunae that negatively impact patient perception and satisfaction will help in greater acceptance of teledermatology services.

AB  - Lichen planus is a multifaceted disease of complex etiopathogenesis. Nails are involved in up to 10% of patients with lichen planus. Although most cases are mild, serious consequences may occur due to rapid progression of the disease, the high risk of scarring, and the resulting irreversible damage to the nail structure. Permanent damage of at least one nail occurs in approximately 4-12% of patients with nail lichen planus. In this narrative review, we emphasize the pathophysiology of nail lichen planus, the emergent nature of the disease, and the spectrum of different clinical manifestations. Diagnosis of nail disease in general, and of nail lichen planus in particular, is rapidly evolving. This review provides a comprehensive account of the non-invasive and invasive diagnostic techniques and treatment options reported in the literature, with emphasis on the efficacy and safety of the drugs used, the associated evidence, and the factors to be taken into account in planning and providing adequate treatment. The role of aesthetic and camouflage options is also summarized.(c) 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recently diagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in December 2019 commonly affects the respiratory system. The incidence of acute hypoxic respiratory failure varied among epidemiological studies with high percentage of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with a high mortality. Noninvasive ventilation is an alternative tool for ventilatory support instead of invasive mechanical ventilation, especially with scarce resources and intensive care beds. Initially, there were concerns by the national societies regarding utilization of noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure. Recent publications reflect the gained experience with the safe utilization of noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive ventilation has beneficiary role in treatment of acute hypoxic respiratory failure with proper indications, setting, monitoring, and timely escalation of therapy. Patients should be monitored frequently for signs of improvement or deterioration in the clinical status. Awareness of indications, contraindications, and parameters reflecting either success or failure of noninvasive ventilation in the management of acute respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19 is essential for improvement of outcomes.

AB  - To date, studies comparing the genomic characteristics of hospital- and community-acquired hvKp were very few in India. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genomic characteristics of hvKp isolates from hospital and community settings.
   Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) is a hypermucoviscous phenotype of classical Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKp) that causes serious infections in the community. The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant hvKp isolates (producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases) along with other virulence factors in health care settings has become a clinical crisis. Here, we aimed to compare the distribution of virulence determinants and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in relation to various sequence types (STs) among the clinical hvKp isolates from both settings, to reinforce our understanding of their epidemiology and pathogenic potential. A total of 120 K. pneumoniae isolates confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry were selected. hvKp was phenotypically identified by string test and genotypically confirmed by the presence of the iucA gene using PCR. Molecular characterization of hvKp isolates was done by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 11.6% (14/120) isolates were confirmed as hvKp by PCR (9.1% [11/120] string positive and 3.3% [4/120] positive by both methods); these were predominantly isolated from bloodstream infection (50%, 7/14), urinary tract infection (29%, 4/14), and respiratory tract infection (21%, 3/14). For all 14 hvKp infections, for 14.2% the source was in the community and for 85.7% the source was a health care setting. Two virulent plasmids were identified by WGS among the hvKp isolates from both settings. K64 was found to be the commonest capsular serotype (28.5%, 4/14), and ST2096 was the most common ST (28.5%, 4/14) by WGS. Two new STs were revealed: ST231 (reported to cause outbreaks) and ST43. The genome of one isolate was determined to be carrying AMR genes (bla(CTX-M-15), bla(NDM-1), bla(NDM-5), bla(OXA-181), bla(OXA-232), etc.) in addition to virulence genes, highlighting the clonal spread of hvKp in both community and health care settings. IMPORTANCE To date, studies comparing the genomic characteristics of hospital- and community-acquired hvKp were very few in India. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genomic characteristics of hvKp isolates from hospital and community settings. ST2096 was found as the most common ST along with novel STs ST231 and ST43. Our study also revealed the genome is simultaneously carrying AMR as well as virulence genes in isolates from both settings, highlighting the emergence of MDR hvKp STs integrated with virulence genes in both community and health care settings. Thus, hvKp may present a serious global threat, and essential steps are needed to prevent its further dissemination.

T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - Human Kinesin Family Member 5A (KIF5A) gene mutations have been identified as a putative genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Disease modelling using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (HiPSCs) is the next-generation approach to studying numerous human diseases. For the current investigation, we report the generation of patient-specific KIF5A iPSC lines with a mutation at the splice site mutation (c.3020 + 3 A > T) in the intronic region. The resulting line displayed markers for pluripotency, a healthy karyotype, the ability to differentiate into three germ layers in vitro, vector clearance, the KIF5A mutation, STR-based genomic identity, and contamination-free culture.

AB  - Mental health problems among children and adolescents are increasingly reported amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In this umbrella review, we aimed to synthesize global evidence on the epidemiologic burden and correlates of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) problems during this pandemic from existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Adopting the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, we evaluated 422 citations and identified 17 eligible reviews with medium to high methodological quality. Most of the reviews reported a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, suicidal behavior, stress-related disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and other mental health problems. Also, factors associated with CAMH such as age, gender, place of residence, educational attainment, household income, sedentary life-style, social media and internet use, comorbidities, family relationships, parents' psychosocial conditions, COVID-19 related experiences, closure of schools, online learning, and social support were reported across re-views. As most studies were cross-sectional and used nonrepresentative samples, future research on represen-tative samples adopting longitudinal and intervention designs is needed. Lastly, multipronged psychosocial care services, policies, and programs are needed to alleviate the burden of CAMH problems during and after this pandemic.

AB  - With the advent of computed tomographic interrogation, it is increasingly frequent to find venous channels that provide direct connections between the pulmonary and systemic veins. These channels, before the introduction of three-dimensional techniques for clinical imaging, were usually found providing an "overflow" for the obstructed left atrium in settings such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, or divided left atrium. Similar channels, however, had been described almost 100 years ago, with one accurately described as a jugulo-pulmonary vein. Nowadays, however, it is much more usual to find the channels described as levoatrial cardinal veins, even though it is recognized that they are not "levo," often not "atrial," and for sure not "cardinal." In this review, we assemble the evidence supporting the notion that they are better considered as pulmonary-to-systemic collateral channels. We emphasize their similarity, in terms of development, to the sinus venosus and coronary sinus defects.

AB  - Study aimed to characterize the expression of antioxidant genes SOD1 and SOD2 in Chlamydia trachomatis-induced recurrent spontaneous aborters and further determine their role by in silico analysis. First void urine was collected from 130 non-pregnant women with history of recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) (Group I) and 130 non-pregnant women (Group II; control) attending Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, SJH, New Delhi, India. C. trachomatis detection was performed by conventional PCR in urine. Gene expression of SOD1 and SOD2 was performed by quantitative real-time PCR. Further, its interacting partners were studied by in silico analysis. 22 patients were positive for C. trachomatis in Group I. Significant upregulation was observed for SOD2 gene in C. trachomatis-infected RSA patients while SOD1 was found to be downregulated. Increased concentration of oxidative stress biomarkers 8-hydroxyguanosine and 8-isoprostane was found in C. trachomatis-infected RSA patients. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) of SOD proteins and its interacting partners viz.; CCS, GPX1, GPX2, GPX3, GPX4, GPX5, GPX7, GPX8, CAT, PRDX1, TXN, SIRT3, FOXO3, and AKT1 were found to be involved in MAPK, p53 and foxo signaling pathways. Molecular pathways involved in association with SODs indicate reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, apoptotic pathways and cell cycle regulation. Overall data revealed alleviated levels of SOD2 gene and decreased expression of SOD1 gene in response to C. trachomatis-infection leading to production of oxidative stress and RSA.

AB  - Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic gluten-induced enteropathy with plethoric manifestations. The typical manifestations of CeD such as chronic diarrhea and malabsorption are widely recognized, however, many patients have atypical manifestations like iron deficiency anemia, idiopathic short stature, hypertransaminesemia or infertility, etc. These patients often present to the primary care physicians and/or non-gastrointestinal specialties. However, due to a lack of awareness among the healthcare professionals about the various atypical manifestations, many patients are not screened for CeD. In this review, we have summarized the available literature about the prevalence of CeD in various gastrointestinal (chronic diarrhea) and non-gastrointestinal conditions (iron deficiency anemia, short stature, cryptogenic hypertransaminesemia, cryptogenic cirrhosis or idiopathic ataxia etc.) where the diagnosis of CeD should be con-sidered. In addition, we also discuss special scenarios where screening for CeD should be considered even in absence of symptoms such as patients with type 1 diabetes, Down's syndrome, and first-degree relatives of patients with CeD. Further, we discuss the diagnostic performance and limitations of various screening tests for CeD such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies, anti-endomysial antibodies and anti-deamidated gliadin antibodies. Based on the current recommendations, we propose a diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected CeD.

AB  - Lipid-based vesicular nanoparticles, for instance liposomes, conjugated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) have proven to be the closest to an ideal drug delivery vehicle, making way for several PEG-liposomes based nano -medicines in market. However, the synthetic nature of the nanomaterial poses a threat to stimulate immune system. Alternatively, nanovesicles derived from mammalian cells, such as RBCs, have gained interests as they may not elicit much immune response due to the presence of host specific self-recognition markers on their surface. While several reports demonstrating the superior efficacy of these naturally derived vesicles have come out in the last few years, a comparison with clinically established liposomes is still missing. Thus, we conducted an in-vitro and in-vivo comparative studies between PEG-Liposomes and nanovesicles (NVEs) derived from red blood cell (RBC) membrane with an aim to establish a biocompatible nanocarrier for efficient delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs and photothermal agents.

AB  - The mutant p53Y220C (mutp53Y220C) is frequently observed in numerous tumors, including pancreatic cancer. The mutation creates a crevice in the DNA binding core domain and makes p53 a thermally unstable non-functional protein that assists tumor progression and confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Restoring mutp53 function to its wild type by selectively targeting this crevice with small molecules is a pivotal strategy to promote apoptosis. In this study, we have shown through different biophysical and cell-based studies that cur -cumin binds and rescues mutp53Y220C to an active wild-type conformation and restores its apoptotic tran-scription function in BxPC-3-pancreatic cancer cells. In addition, the curcumin-rescued-p53Y220C (CRp53) showed significant hyperphosphorylation at Ser15, Ser20, and acetylation at Lys382 with an 8-fold increase in transcription activity in the BxPC-3 cell lines. We also observed that the active CRp53 escapes Mdm2-mediated proteasomal degradation and the majority of the proteins were localized inside the nucleus with an increased half-life and transcription restoration compared to untreated BxPC-3 cells. By label-free proteomics analysis, we observed that upon curcumin treatment almost 227 proteins were dysregulated with the majority of them being transcriptional targets of p53. Based on our studies, it reflects that apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated by curcumin-rescued mutant p53Y220C.

AB  - Cancer is a devastating disease and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy (CT), and/or radiation therapy (RT) are the treatment of choice for most advanced tumors. Unfortunately, treatment failure due to intrinsic and acquired resistance to the current CT and RT is a significant challenge associated with poor patient prognosis. There is an urgent need to develop and identify agents that can sensitize tumor cells to chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) with minimal cytotoxicity to the healthy tissues. While many recent studies have identified the underlying molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for CRT failure, using small molecule inhibitors to chemo/radio sensitize tumors is associated with high toxicity and increased morbidity. Natural products have long been used as chemopreventive agents in many cancers. Combining many of these compounds with the standard chemotherapeutic agents or with RT has shown synergistic effects on cancer cell death and overall improvement in patient survival. Based on the available data, there is strong evidence that natural products have a robust therapeutic potential along with CRT and their well-known chemopreventive effects in many solid tumors. This review article reports updated literature on different natural products used as CT or RT sensitizers in many solid tumors. This is the first review discussing CT and RT sensitizers together in cancer.

AB  - The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV; HPV6/11/16/18) and 9-valent HPV (9vHPV; HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) vaccines have demonstrated efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety in international clinical trials. We report outcomes from three completed clinical trials in India: a single-arm study (V501-029 [NCT00380367]) in Indian girls (aged 9-15 years; N = 110) evaluating qHPV vaccine immunogenicity and safety; a subgroup analysis (n = 225) of Indian girls/boys (9-15 years) and women (16-26 years) from a global study (V503-002 [NCT00943722]) evaluating 9vHPV vaccine immunogenicity and safety; and a qHPV vaccine post-marketing safety surveillance study (V501-125) in Indian females (aged 9-45 years; N = 188) vaccinated during routine care. In V501-029 and V503-002, HPV vaccines were administered as 3 doses (Day 1, Month 2, Month 6). Serum HPV antibodies were evaluated by competitive Luminex immunoassays at Day 1 and Month 7 (both studies) and Months 12, 24, and 36 (V503-002 only). Adverse events (AEs) were collected by Vaccination Report Card. In V501-125, participants were actively surveilled for serious AEs (SAEs) within 30 days post-qHPV vaccination. In per-protocol analyses, qHPV and 9vHPV vaccines induced robust anti-HPV6/11/16/18 (V501-029) and HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 (V503-002) responses, respectively; >= 97% of participants seroconverted at Month 7 for each vaccine HPV type in both studies, and antibody responses persisted through 36 months in V503-002. The most common AEs were injection-site-associated. Most AEs were mild/moderate; no deaths, vaccine-related SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. In V501-125, no SAE was reported. Overall, the qHPV and 9vHPV vaccines elicited robust antibody responses and were generally well tolerated in Indian participants.

AB  - Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction predominantly occurring in patients of asthma and cystic fibrosis. The typical radiological findings in ABPA include central bronchiectasis and fleeting opacities. In this retrospective study, the aim was to describe cases of ABPA in children who had a mass-like lesion in the lung. There were 5 cases of ABPA in children, who presented as mass-like lesions that responded very well to treatment for ABPA. All cases, except 1, had asthma as the underlying disease. There was a delay in the diagnosis of ABPA in all 5 cases. There had been unnecessary invasive investigations in some of these cases before the diagnosis of ABPA was made. To conclude, children with ABPA may present with a mass-like lesion in the lung and high index of suspicion is required to diagnose ABPA timely to prevent its consequences.

AB  - ObjectiveChildren with developmental disabilities are associated with a high risk of poor school enrollment and educational attainment without timely and appropriate support. Epidemiological data on cerebral palsy and associated comorbidities required for policy intervention in global health are lacking. This paper set out to report the best available evidence on the global and regional prevalence of cerebral palsy (CP) and developmental intellectual disability and the associated "years lived with disability" (YLDs) among children under 5 years of age in 2019. MethodsWe analyzed the collaborative 2019 Rehabilitation Database of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study and World Health Organization for neurological and mental disorders available for 204 countries and territories. Point prevalence and YLDs with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) are presented. ResultsGlobally, 8.1 million (7.1-9.2) or 1.2% of children under 5 years are estimated to have CP with 16.1 million (11.5-21.0) or 2.4% having intellectual disability. Over 98% resided in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). CP and intellectual disability accounted for 6.5% and 4.5% of the aggregate YLDs from all causes of adverse health outcomes respectively. African Region recorded the highest prevalence of CP (1.6%) while South-East Asia Region had the highest prevalence of intellectual disability. The top 10 countries accounted for 57.2% of the global prevalence of CP and 62.0% of the global prevalence of intellectual disability. ConclusionBased on this Database, CP and intellectual disability are highly prevalent and associated with substantial YLDs among children under 5 years worldwide. Universal early detection and support services are warranted, particularly in LMICs to optimize school readiness for these children toward inclusive education as envisioned by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Background To fill the gap in patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment in children with cancer in India, we planned to adapt domains from the HealthMeasures Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) tool. This study attempted to identify and pool outcomes relevant to children with cancer and their caregivers in Northern India. Methods The study was qualitative and conducted through focussed group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews of children with cancer and their caregivers. Content analysis of transcripts from the sessions was done. The collected themes were collated with existing item banks of the PROMIS tool and new concepts unique to our population were compiled. Results A set of three FGDs and 14 interviews each for children and their caregivers were conducted. Following content analysis, 121 themes were identified including 10 new concepts. Themes pertaining to the physical domain were cited most. The theme distribution across the three domains was similar among children and caregivers. In the survivor cohort, the relative frequency of mention of psychological and social themes was higher compared to the whole cohort. Themes pertaining to mobility, cognitive dysfunction and peer relationships were more common among survivors. Conclusions This qualitative study in children with cancer and their caregivers in India has facilitated a better understanding of the issues pertaining to cancer care that are of most importance to its stake holders. The themes collected may be used to formulate a PRO tool uniquely tailored for use in this population.

AB  - Background: Radiation hazards are accountable for extensive damage in the biological system and acts as a public health burden. Owing to the rapid increasing in radiation technology, both Ionizing radiation (IR) from natural and man made source poses detrimental outcome to public health. IR releases free radicals which induces oxidative stress and deleterious biological damage by modulating radiation induced signalling intermediates. The efficacy of existing therapeutic approach and treatment strategy are limited owing to their toxicity and associated side effects. Indian system of traditional medicine is enriched with prospective phytochemicals with potential radioprotection ability.
   Purpose: The present review elucidated and summarized the potential role of plant derived novel chemical compound with prospective radioprotective potential.
   Method: So far as the traditional system of Indian medicine is concerned, plant kingdom is enriched with potential bioactive molecules with diverse pharmacological activities. We reviewed several compounds mostly secondary metabolites from plant origin using various search engines.
   Results: Both compounds from land plants and marine source exhibited antioxidant antiinflammatory, free radical scavenging ability. These compounds have tremendous potential in fine-tuning of several signalling intermediates, which are actively participated in the progression and development of a pathological condition associated with radiation stress.
   Conclusion: Development and explore of an operational radioprotective agent from originated from plant source that can be used as a novel molecular tool to eliminate the widespread damage caused by space exploration, ionizing radiation, nuclear war and radiotherapy has been significantly appreciated. Through extensive literature search we highlighted several compounds from both land plant and marine origin can be implemented for a better therapeutic potential against radiation induced injury. Furthermore, extensive clinical trials must be carried out in near future for better therapeutic modality and clinical efficacy.

AB  - COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM) remains an underdiagnosed entity. Using a modified Delphi method, we have formulated a consensus statement for the diagnosis and management of CAPM. We selected 26 experts from various disciplines who are involved in managing CAPM. Three rounds of the Delphi process were held to reach consensus (>= 70% agreement or disagreement) or dissensus. A consensus was achieved for 84 of the 89 statements. Pulmonary mucormycosis occurring within 3 months of COVID-19 diagnosis was labelled CAPM and classified further as proven, probable, and possible. We recommend flexible bronchoscopy to enable early diagnosis. The experts proposed definitions to categorise dual infections with aspergillosis and mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. We recommend liposomal amphotericin B (5 mg/kg per day) and early surgery as central to the management of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. We recommend response assessment at 4-6 weeks using clinical and imaging parameters. Posaconazole or isavuconazole was recommended as maintenance therapy following initial response, but no consensus was reached for the duration of treatment. In patients with stable or progressive disease, the experts recommended salvage therapy with posaconazole or isavuconazole. CAPM is a rare but under-reported complication of COVID-19. Although we have proposed recommendations for defining, diagnosing, and managing CAPM, more extensive research is required.

AB  - The global cancer cases and mortality rates are increasing and demand efficient biomarkers for accurate screening, detection, diagnosis, and prognosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that variations in epigenetic mechanisms like aberrant promoter methylation, altered histone modification and mutations in ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes play an important role in the development of carcinogenic events. However, the influence of other epigenetic alterations in various cancers was confirmed with evolving research and the emergence of high throughput technologies. Therefore, alterations in epigenetic marks may have clinical utility as potential biomarkers for early cancer detection and diagnosis. In this review, an outline of the key epigenetic mechanism(s), and their deregulation in cancer etiology have been discussed to decipher the future prospects in cancer therapeutics including precision medicine. Also, this review attempts to highlight the gaps in epigenetic drug development with emphasis on integrative analysis of epigenetic biomarkers to establish minimally non-invasive biomarkers with clinical applications.

TI  - Immunogenicity and reactogenicity of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (BBV152) in children aged 2-18 years: interim data from an open-label, non-randomised, age de-escalation phase 2/3 study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
KW  - COVID-19
AB  - Background Despite having milder symptoms than adults, children are still susceptible to and can transmit SARS-CoV-2. Vaccination across all age groups is therefore necessary to curtail the pandemic. Among the available COVID-19 vaccine platforms, an inactivated vaccine platform has the advantage of excellent safety profile across all age groups; hence, we conducted an age de-escalation study to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of an inactivated COVID-19 vaccine, BBV152 (COVAXIN; Bharat Biotech International, Hyderabad, India), in children aged 2-18 years.
   Methods In this phase 2/3 open-label, non-randomised, multicentre study done in six hospitals in India, healthy children (male or female) aged 2-18 years were eligible for inclusion into the study. Children who had positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests at baseline, or any history of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or with known immunosuppressive condition were excluded. Children were sequentially enrolled into one of three groups (>12 to <= 18 years [group 1], >6 to 12 years [group 2], or >= 2 to 6 years [group 3]) and administered with adult formulation of BBV152 as two 0.5 mL intramuscular doses on days 0 and 28. Co-primary endpoints were solicited adverse events for 7 days post-vaccination and neutralising antibody titres on day 56, 28 days after the second dose. Immunogenicity endpoints were compared with Biodefense and Emerging Infections, Research Resources Repository (BEI) reference serum samples and from adults who received two doses of BBV152 in the same schedule in a previously reported phase 2 study. The trial is registered with the Clinical Trials Registry, India (CTRI/2021/05/033752) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04918797).
   Findings From May 27, 2021, to July 10, 2021, we enrolled 526 children sequentially into groups 1 (n=176), 2 (n=175), and 3 (n=175). Vaccination was well tolerated, with no differences in reactogenicity between the three age groups, and no serious adverse events, deaths, or withdrawals due to an adverse event. Local reactions mainly consisted of mild injection site pain in 46 (26%) of 176 participants in group 1, 61 (35%) of 175 in group 2, and 39 (22%) of 175 in group 3 after dose 1; and 39 (22%) of 176 in group 1, 43 of 175 (25%) in group 2, and 14 of 175 (8%) in group 3 after dose 2; there were no cases of severe pain and few reports of other local reactions. After dose 1, the most frequent solicited systemic adverse event was mild-to-moderate fever, reported in eight (5%) of 176 participants in group 1, 17 (10%) of 175 in group 2, and 22 (13%) of 175 in group 3. No case of severe fever was reported, and rates of all fever were all 4% or less after dose 2. Geometric mean titres (GMTs) of microneutralisation antibodies at day 56 in groups 1 (138.8 [95% CI 111.0-173.6]), 2 (137.4 [99.1-167.5]), and 3 (197.6 [176.4-221.4]) were similar to titres in vaccinated adults (160.1 [135.8-188.8]) and with BEI reference serum samples (103.3 [50.3-202.1]). Similar results were obtained using the plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT), in which 166 (95%) of 175 participants in group 1, 165 (98%) of 168 in group 2, and 169 (98%) of 172 in group 3 seroconverted at day 56. The GMT ratio of PRNT titres in children and adults was 1.76 (95% CI 1.32-2.33), indicating a superior response in children compared with adults.
   Interpretation BBV152 was well tolerated in children aged 2-18 years, and induced higher neutralising antibody responses than those observed in adults, in whom the efficacy (ie, the prevention or decrease in the severity of COVID-19 infection) has been demonstrated.

AB  - BackgroundThe world witnessed a highly contagious and deadly disease, COVID-19, toward the end of 2019. India is one of the worst affected countries. We aimed to assess anxiety and depression levels among adult tobacco users and people who recently quit tobacco during COVID-19 lockdown in India. Materials and methodsThe study was conducted across two Indian cities, Delhi and Chennai (July-August, 2020) among adult tobacco users (n = 801). Telephonic interviews were conducted using validated mental health tools (Patient Health Questionnaire-PHQ-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-GAD-7) to assess the anxiety and depression levels of the participants. Descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression were used to study the prevalence and correlates of depression and anxiety. ResultsWe found that 20.6% of tobacco users had depression symptoms (3.9% moderate to severe); 20.7% had anxiety symptoms (3.8% moderate to severe). Risk factors associated with depression and anxiety included food, housing, and financial insecurity. ConclusionDuring COVID-19 lockdown, mental health of tobacco users (primarily women) was associated with food, housing and financial insecurity. The Indian Government rightly initiated several health, social and economic measures to shield the most vulnerable from COVID-19, including a ban on the sale of tobacco products. It is also necessary to prioritize universal health coverage, expanded social security net, tobacco cessation and mental health services to such vulnerable populations during pandemic situations.

AB  - Nanotechnology advancements and applications have paved the way for new possibilities in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. It is a relatively new field that has the potential to improve stem cell differentiation and therapy greatly. Numerous studies have demonstrated that nanomaterials can function as a physiological niche for the formation and differentiation of stem cells. However, quantum dots (QDs), such as carbon quantum dots (CQDs) and graphene quantum dots (GgDs), have shown considerable promise in the field of regenerative medicine. To date, most research has focused on stem cell tracking and imaging using CQDs. However, their interaction with stem cells and the associated possibility for differentiation by selectively focusing chemical signals to a particular lineage has received scant attention. In this mini-review, we attempt to categorize a few pathways linked with the role of CQDs in stem cell differentiation.

AB  - Background: Lipids play a central role in the virus life cycle and are a crucial target to develop antiviral therapeutics. Importantly, among the other lipoproteins, the 'good cholesterol' high-density lipoprotein (HDL) has been widely studied for its role in not only cardiovascular but several infectious diseases as well. Studies have suggested a role of serum lipids and lipoproteins including HDL, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in several viral infections including COVID-19. This disease is currently a major public health problem and there is a need to explore the role of these host lipids/lipoproteins in virus pathogenesis.
   Methodology: A total of 75 retrospective COVID-19 positive serum samples and 10 COVID-19 negative controls were studied for their lipid profiles including TC, HDL, LDL, and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and TG.
   Results: Systematic literature search on dyslipidemia status in India shows that low HDL is the most common dyslipidemia. In this cohort, 65% (49) of COVID-19 patients had severely low HDL levels whereas 35% (26) had moderately low HDL and none had normal HDL levels. On the other hand, similar to 96% of samples had normal TC (72) and LDL (72) levels. VLDL and TG levels were also variable. In the controls, 100% of samples had moderately low HDL but none severely low HDL levels.
   Conclusion: HDL likely plays a crucial role in COVID-19 infection and outcomes. The causal relationships between HDL levels and COVID-19 need to be studied extensively for an understanding of disease pathogenesis and management.

AB  - Background: Non-invasive DECT based characterization of renal stones using their effective atomic number (Zeff) and the electron density (rho e) in patients. Aim: This paper aims to develop a method for in-vivo characterization of renal stone. Differentiation of renal stones in-vivo especially sub types of calcium stones have very important advantage for better judgement of treatment modality. Materials and Methods: 50 extracted renal stones were scanned ex-vivo using dual energy CT scanner. A method was developed to characterize these renal stones using effective atomic number and electron density obtained from dual energy CT data. The method and formulation developed in ex-vivo experiments was applied in in-vivo study of 50 randomly selected patients of renal stones who underwent dual energy CT scan. Results: The developed method was able to characterize Calcium Oxalate Monohydrate (COM) and the combi-nation of COM and Calcium Oxalate Dihydrate (COD) stones non-invasively in patients with a sensitivity of 81% and 83%respectively. The method was also capable of differentiating Uric, Cystine and mixed stones with the sensitivity of 100, 100 and 85.71% respectively. Conclusion: The developed dual energy CT based method was capable of differentiating sub types of calcium stones which is not differentiable on single energy or dual energy CT images.

AB  - We analyzed the data from 363 patients with myeloma to evaluate impact of time on transplant outcomes. Patients in early transplant cohort had higher response rate and superior progression-free survival and OS from date of transplant compared to late transplant cohort. OS from date of diagnosis was similar in the early and late cohort. Engraftment characteristics and regimen-related complications were comparable in the 2 cohorts.
   Background: Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is a standard therapy for transplant eligible patients of multiple myeloma (MM). To evaluate impact of time to transplant on subsequent outcomes, we analyzed data on consecutive MM patients who received novel agents-based induction prior to transplant. Methods: Between 2006 and 2019, 363 MM patients underwent ASCT. Patients' median age was 52 years, ranging from 20 to 72 years, 233 (64.2%) were males. Median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 11.5 months (range, 4-67.5); 201 (55.4%) patients underwent ASCT within 12 months (early) and 162 (44.6%) beyond 12 months since diagnosis (delayed ASCT). Primary objective was progression-free survival. Secondary objectives were-response rate to transplant, overall survival (OS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Results: Post-ASCT complete response (CR) (77.1% vs. 64.8%; P <.025) and CR+ very good partial response rate (89% vs. 81.5%; P <.03) was higher for early ASCT cohort. Engraftment characteristics, regimen-related toxicities, and day +100 TRM (3.5% vs 3.7%; P =.564) were similar in 2 cohorts. Median OS for early versus late cohort from date of diagnosis is 127.0 (95% CI, 98.9-155.1) versus 104.5 months (95% CI, 79.3-129.6; P =.356) and from date of transplant is 119.0 (95% CI, 93.4-144.6) versus 89.5 months (95% CI, 57.4-121.6), P <.02. Median PFS is better for early transplant cohort; 69.5 (95% CI, 56.7-82.3) versus 50.0 months (95% CI, 35.6-64.4), P <.05, respectively. Conclusion: Early transplant for myeloma is associated with higher response rate and better progression-free survival. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Social media use in neurosurgery remains an understudied phenomenon. Our study aims to examine the global membership and engagement of the prominent Neurosurgery Cocktail Facebook group with over 25,000 neurosurgeons and trainees worldwide, specifically during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Neurosurgery Cocktail's numbers of members, posts, comments, and reactions were collected from December 2019 to November 2020. Anonymized aggregate data of members' characteristics, including age, sex, and country of origin in November 2020, were also obtained. The most engaging posts in November 2020 were categorized into topics by a majority consensus of 3 reviewers. RESULTS: The average number of members steadily increased from 21,266 in December 2019 to 25,218 in November 2020. In November 2020, 18.8% of members were women, and 71.3% were between 25-44 years old. With members from 100 countries, 77.9% are from low-and middle-income countries, with the highest representation from India, Egypt, and Brazil. After the COVID-19 pandemic declaration, daily engagement peaked in April 2020 with a daily average of 41.63 posts, 336.4 comments, and 1,914.6 reactions before returning to pre-pandemic levels. Among the 99 top posts in November 2020, the majority (56.5%) were classified as "interesting cases", with "education-related" as the second-most common topic (16.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery Cocktail has shown steady growth since its creation. The COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with a spike in activity without lasting impact. The group demonstrates social media's potential for knowledge exchange and promoting organic international collaborations.

AB  - Background and Objectives The potential role of the transcription factor Differentiated embryo-chondrocyte 2 (Dec2) in the progression of inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis has been unclear. Here, the effect of Dec2 on the expression of RANKL and on osteoclastogenesis was determined. Material and Methods Wild-type (WT) and Dec2 knockout (KO) mice as a model for periodontitis were used to assess alveolar bone resorption by microcomputed tomography (CT). Western blot, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunohistochemical analyses were utilized to detect inflammation and osteoclasts. Luciferase reporter and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays examined the interaction between Dec2 and RANKL. Results Micro-CT showed that the alveolar bone resorption of Dec2KO mice was more severe than WT mice after treatment with P. gingivalis. Immunohistochemistry and Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining showed active osteoclast differentiation in Dec2KO mice. There was an increase in CD11b(+)F4/80(+) and CD4(+)RANKL(+) T cells in Dec2KO mice treated with P. gingivalis. Moreover, inflammatory and immune markers were expressed at significantly higher levels in gingival mononuclear cells in Dec2KO mice. Furthermore, luciferase reporter and ChIP assays confirmed the direct binding of Dec2 protein to the RANKL gene. Conclusion Dec2 has an immune regulation ability that modulates P. gingivalis-induced periodontitis via RANKL.

TI  - Effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy in acute management of delirious mania in COVID-19 positive woman in second trimester pregnancy

AB  - Delirious mania has been described as a state of acute excitement, fluctuating sensorium, affective and catatonic symptoms. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) despite being an effective treatment modality in such cases, has been under-utilised during pregnancy, mainly due to safety concerns. Here, we report the effectiveness of ECT in acute management of delirious mania in a 24 weeks pregnant woman who also tested COVID-19 positive during hospitalisation. Patient presented with three weeks history of acute manic excitement with period of altered sensorium and catatonic symptoms with no response to trials of two antipsychotic agents. After organic causes ruled out, patient was planned for ECT while ongoing antipsychotic was continued. After the first ECT session, patient tested positive for COVID-19, though asymptomatic and had to be shifted to COVID-19 isolation facility. Complete resolution of psychiatric symptoms occurred after fifth ECT. All five ECT sessions, including those in COVID-19 isolation facility were carried out under supervision of a multidisciplinary team. None of the ECT sessions had any major adverse event. Symptom remission sustained even following ECT discontinuation. No neonatal or maternal adverse effects observed after an uneventful delivery at 35 weeks. Both mother and child continued to maintain well in follow-up period of one year on oral olanzapine. In this unusual concurrent presentation of mania, delirium and catatonic symptoms during second trimester pregnancy, we highlighted the effectiveness and safety of ECT as a viable treatment modality. Additionally, management challenges posed by patient testing COVID-19 positive and then, administering ECT in COVID-19 isolation facility using personal protective equipment by multidisciplinary team has been highlighted.

AB  - Background Understanding the magnitude of cancer burden attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors is crucial for development of effective prevention and mitigation strategies. We analysed results from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to inform cancer control planning efforts globally.
   Methods The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment framework was used to estimate cancer burden attributable to behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. A total of 82 risk-outcome pairs were included on the basis of the World Cancer Research Fund criteria. Estimated cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019 and change in these measures between 2010 and 2019 are presented.
   Findings Globally, in 2019, the risk factors included in this analysis accounted for 4.45 million (95% uncertainty interval 4.01-4.94) deaths and 105 million (95.0-116) DALYs for both sexes combined, representing 44.4% (41.3-48.4) of all cancer deaths and 42.0% (39.1-45.6) of all DALYs. There were 2.88 million (2.60-3.18) risk-attributable cancer deaths in males (50.6% [47.8-54.1] of all male cancer deaths) and 1.58 million (1.36-1.84) risk-attributable cancer deaths in females (36.3% [32.5-41.3] of all female cancer deaths). The leading risk factors at the most detailed level globally for risk-attributable cancer deaths and DALYs in 2019 for both sexes combined were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI. Risk-attributable cancer burden varied by world region and Socio-demographic Index (SDI), with smoking, unsafe sex, and alcohol use being the three leading risk factors for risk-attributable cancer DALYs in low SDI locations in 2019, whereas DALYs in high SDI locations mirrored the top three global risk factor rankings. From 2010 to 2019, global risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 20.4% (12.6-28.4) and DALYs by 16.8% (8.8-25.0), with the greatest percentage increase in metabolic risks (34.7% [27.9-42.8] and 33.3% [25.8-42.0]).
   Interpretation The leading risk factors contributing to global cancer burden in 2019 were behavioural, whereas metabolic risk factors saw the largest increases between 2010 and 2019. Reducing exposure to these modifiable risk factors would decrease cancer mortality and DALY rates worldwide, and policies should be tailored appropriately to local cancer risk factor burden.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are subcellular messengers that aid in the formation and spread of cancer by enabling tumor-stroma communication. EVs develop from the very porous structure of late endosomes and hold information on both the intrinsic "status" of the cell and the extracellular signals absorbed by the cells from their surroundings. These EVs contain physiologically useful components, including as nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which have been found to activate important signaling pathways in tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME) cells, aggravating tumor growth. We highlight critical cell biology mechanisms that link EVS formation to cargo sorting in cancer cells in this review.Sorting out the signals that control EVs creation, cargo, and delivery will aid our understanding of carcinogenesis. Furthermore, we reviewed how cancer development and spreading behaviors are affected by coordinated communication between malignant and non-malignant cells. Herein, we studied the reciprocal exchanges via EVs in various cancer types. Further research into the pathophysiological functions of various EVs in tumor growth is likely to lead to the discovery of new biomarkers in liquid biopsy and the development of tumor-specific therapies.

AB  - Barefoot slips and falls are commonly reported in bathrooms in Indian households and apartments. Due to lack of awareness on how to prevent such incidents, they are often neglected, and may lead to recurrent and severe traumatic injuries. To date, there is no way to assess the barefoot slip risk of the bathroom flooring tiles under realistic contaminated conditions such as with water and shampoo. In this work, a novel human heel surrogate was developed for barefoot slip testing, to address this gap. This surrogate was tuned to precisely mimic the frictional and biomechanical properties of the human heel, through three-dimensional (3D) scanning and printing. A mechanical slip testing device was employed with the heel surrogate to test 15 different bathroom floorings in residential apartments in dry and slippery conditions (i.e., wet and with shampoo spill). The barefoot available coefficient of friction (ACOF) was determined for the different floor conditions and tested for repeatability with two modeled heel surrogate samples. Also, the correlation of ACOF with surface roughness and between floorings was studied, across contaminant conditions. High repeatability (r(2) > 0.92) was confirmed in the dry condition, and the ACOF values decreased significantly when going from dry to wet and wet to shampoo spill conditions. The correlation of ACOF with surface roughness was found to be high (r(2) = 0.72), medium (r(2) = 0.62), and low (r(2) = 0.38) for the dry, wet, and shampoo spill conditions, respectively. Across contaminant conditions, several tiles exhibited high correlations in ACOF due to shampoo spills, indicating generalizability of barefoot slip risk. The findings of low barefoot frictional resistance on Indian bathroom floorings in wet and shampoo spill conditions, lack of correlations with surface roughness, and high generalizability of slip risk across floorings in the shampoo spill condition have not been reported to date, and shed light on the significant barefoot slip risks.

AB  - Endometrial cancer (EC) is common malignancy in women and its incidence is slowly on the rise. Accu-rate surgical staging, with aggressive cytoreduction when indicated, remains the most critical step in the treatment. Careful pathological evaluation and/or molecular risk stratification guides for proper systemic adjuvant radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy. Recurrent and metastatic EC has dismal prognosis and palliative therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation) forms the backbone of treatment. There is an un-met need of newer therapies to improve survival in such cases. A number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently under evaluation. Recent data on therapeutic targeting of HER2 positive serous EC is excit-ing. Data on check point inhibitors particularly based on biomarker select population has raised hope for potentially effective treatment for women with high risk endometrial cancer .(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective Three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction of the face has recently been presented as a newer diagnostic tool in coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis. This study was conducted to compare three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction with conventional two-dimensional computed tomography in coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis. Methods A total of 123 mucormycosis patients underwent three-dimensional computed tomography reconstruction after a comprehensive clinical investigation. The involvement of the facial skeleton was noted. Results The anterior maxillary wall was most commonly involved (9.8 per cent). Involvement of the lateral maxillary wall was noted in 6.5 per cent of patients. Sixty-seven patients (54.5 per cent) underwent endoscopic surgery, 22 (17.9 per cent) underwent open surgical procedures, and 12 (9.8 per cent) had combined endoscopic and open surgical procedures. In 21 patients (17.1 per cent), open surgery was performed in the first instance based on additional three-dimensional computed tomography findings, and revision surgical procedures were avoided. Conclusion Three-dimensional computed tomography of the face was found to be superior in determining the extent of disease. It reduces delays in diagnosis, facilitates surgical planning and minimises the need for multiple surgical procedures.

AB  - Objective Microbiome and dietary manipulation therapies are being explored for treating ulcerative colitis (UC).We aimed to examine the efficacy of multidonor faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and anti-inflammatory diet in inducing remission followed by long-term maintenance with anti-inflammatory diet in patients with mild-moderate UC.
   Design This open-labelled randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised patients with mild-moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)>1) on stable baseline medications in 1:1 ratio to FMT and anti-inflammatory diet (FMT-AID) versus optimised standard medical therapy (SMT). The FMT-AID arm received seven weekly colonoscopic infusions of freshly prepared FMT from multiple rural donors(weeks 0-6) with anti-inflammatory diet. Baseline medications were optimised in the SMT arm. Clinical responders (decline in SCCAl >= 3) at 8 weeks in both arms were followed until 48 weeks on baseline medications (with anti-inflammatory diet in the FMT-AID arm). Primary outcome measures were clinical response and deep remission (clinical-SCCAI <2; and endoscopic-UCEIS <1) at 8 weeks, and deep remission and steroid-free clinical remission at 48 weeks.
   Results Of the 113 patients screened, 73 were randomised, and 66 were included in (35-FMT-AID; 31-SMT) modified intention-to-treat analysis (age-35.7 +/- 11.1 years; male-60.1%; disease duration-48 (IQR 24-84) months; pancolitis-34.8%; SCCAI-6 (IQR 5-7); UCEIS-4 (IQR 3-5)). Baseline characteristics were comparable. FMT-AID was superior to SMT in inducing clinical response (23/35 (65.7%) vs 11/31 (35.5%), p=0.01, OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 9.6)), remission (21/35 (60%) vs 10/31 (32.3%), p=0.02, OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.7)) and deep remission (12/33 (36.4%) vs 2/23 (8.7%), p=0.03, OR 6.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 30.2)) at 8 weeks. Anti-inflammatory diet was superior to SMT in maintaining deep remission until 48 weeks (6/24 (25%) vs 0/27, p=0.007).
   Conclusion Multidonor FMT with anti-inflammatory diet effectively induced deep remission in mild-moderate UC which was sustained with anti-inflammatory diet over 1 year.

AB  - Background Hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1 and 2 (HMNDYT1 and 2) are rare, inherited disorders of manganese transport. Objectives We aimed to describe clinical, laboratory features, and outcomes among children with HMNDYT. Methods We conducted a retrospective multicenter study involving tertiary centers across India. We enrolled children between 1 month to 18 years of age with genetically confirmed/clinically probable HMNDYT. Clinical, laboratory profile, genetic testing, treatment details, and outcomes scored by treating physicians on a Likert scale were recorded. Results We enrolled 27 children (19 girls). Fourteen harbored SLC30A10 mutations; nine had SLC39A14 mutations. The SLC39A14 cohort had lower median age at onset (1.3 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.7-5.5] years) versus SLC30A10 cohort (2.0 [IQR, 1.5-5.1] years). The most frequent neurological features were dystonia (100%; n = 27), gait abnormality (77.7%; n = 21), falls (66.7%; n = 18), and parkinsonism (59.3%; n = 16). Median serum manganese (Mn) levels among SLC39A14 (44.9 [IQR, 27.3-147.7] mcg/L) cohort were higher than SLC30A10 (29.4 [17.1-42.0] mcg/L); median hemoglobin was higher in SLC30A10 (16.3 [IQR, 15.2-17.5] g/dL) versus SLC39A14 cohort (12.5 [8.8-13.2] g/dL). Hepatic involvement and polycythaemia were observed exclusively in SLC30A10 variants. A total of 26/27 children underwent chelation with disodium calcium edetate. Nine demonstrated some improvement, three stabilized, two had marked improvement, and one had normalization. Children with SLC39A14 mutations had poorer response. Two children died and nine were lost to follow-up. Conclusions We found female predominance. Children with SLC39A14 mutations presented at younger age and responded less favorably to chelation compared to SLC30A10 mutations. There is emerging need to better define management strategies, especially in low resource settings.

AB  - Background Studies from high income countries suggest improved survival for females as compared to males following trauma. However, data regarding differences in trauma outcomes between females and males is severely lacking from low-and middle-income countries. The objective of this study was to determine the association between sex and clinical outcomes amongst Indian trauma patients using the Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration database.Methods A prospective multicentre cohort study was performed across four urban public hospitals in India April 2016 through February 2018. Bivariate analyses compared admission physiological parameters and mechanism of injury. Logistic regression assessed association of sex with the primary outcomes of 30-day and 24-hour in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU admission, ICU length of stay, ventilator requirement, and time on a ventilator.Results Of 8,605 patients, 1,574 (18.3%) were females. The most common mechanism of injury was falls for females (52.0%) and road traffic injury for males (49.5%). On unadjusted analysis, there was no dif-ference in 30-day in-hospital mortality between females (11.6%) and males (12.6%, p = 0.323). However, females demonstrated a lower mortality at 24-hours (1.1% vs males 2.1%, p = 0.011) on unadjusted anal-ysis. Females were also less likely to require a ventilator (17.3% vs 21.0% males, p = 0.001) or ICU ad-mission (34.4% vs 37.5%, p = 0.028). Stratification by age or by ISS demonstrated no difference in 30-day in-hospital mortality for males vs females across age and ISS categories. On multivariable regression anal-ysis, sex was not associated significantly with 30-day or 24-hour in-hospital mortality.Conclusion This study did not demonstrate a significant difference in the 30-day trauma mortality or 24-hour trauma mortality between female and male trauma patients in India on adjusted analyses. A more granular data is needed to understand the interplay of injury severity, immediate post-traumatic hormonal and immunological alterations, and the impact of gender-based disparities in acute care set-tings.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - SGLT2 inhibitors show promising cardio-protection in the diabetic populace. However, the defending effect of SGLT2 inhibition in diabetes-associated cardiac complications and the molecular mechanism behind this effect are not thoroughly studied. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of Empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, in type-2 diabetic rat hearts.We induced type-2 diabetes in SD rats by giving a high-fructose diet for 20 weeks. We administered Empa-gliflozin (10 mg/kg p.o.) daily from the 12th week to the 20th week, along with high-fructose diet. We weighed the cardiac structure and function by echocardiography, electrocardiography, and blood pressure in diabetic rats. Other parameters like cardiac fibrosis, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dynamics by protein expression were measured. To simulate a similar in-vivo condition, we persuaded insulin resistance in H9c2 cells by palmitic acid (PA) treatment. We then examined glucose uptake, cellular ROS, mitochondrial ROS and membrane potential in the presence and absence of Empagliflozin treatment.We saw a significant perturbation of the majority of the parameters associated with cardiac structure and function in high-fructose diet-induced diabetic rats. We found that administration of Empagliflozin improved all the perturbed parameters by attenuating insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and cardiac fibrosis and also by promoting cardiac mitochondrial fusion in high-fructose diet-induced type-2 diabetic rats. Empagliflozin also reduced palmitate-induced insulin resistance, total cellular ROS, and mitochondrial ROS in H9c2 cells.Our study concluded that SGLT2 inhibition with Empagliflozin prevented the high-fructose diet-insulted cardiac function by suppressing insulin resistance and oxidative stress and promoting mitochondrial fusion.

AB  - Treatment guidelines for management of uncomplicated gonorrhoeae have been recently modified owing to alarming upsurge in azithromycin resistance. This study investigated the prevalence and genetic determinants of gonococcal azithromycin resistance in India. Four (5.7%) of 70 gonococcal isolates were resistant to azithromycin. Of 16 isolates investigated for molecular mechanisms of resistance, 13 (81.3%) and 6 (37.5%) isolates exhibited mutations in coding and promoter regions of mtrR gene, respectively. However, ermA, ermB and ermC genes or mutations in rrl gene were absent in all isolates. Azithromycin resistance is low in India posing no immediate threat to use of dual-therapy for syndromic management.

AB  - Aims Limited data on the uptake of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) and the mortality of acute decompensated HF (ADHF) patients are available from India. The National Heart Failure Registry (NHFR) aimed to assess clinical presentation, practice patterns, and the mortality of ADHF patients in India.
   Methods and results The NHFR is a facility-based, multi-centre clinical registry of consecutive ADHF patients with prospective follow-up. Fifty three tertiary care hospitals in 21 states in India participated in the NHFR. All consecutive ADHF patients who satisfied the European Society of Cardiology criteria were enrolled in the registry. All-cause mortality at 90 days was the main outcome measure. In total, 10 851 consecutive patients were recruited (mean age: 59.9 years, 31% women). Ischaemic heart disease was the predominant aetiology for HF (72%), followed by dilated cardiomyopathy (18%). Isolated right HF was noted in 62 (0.6%) participants. In eligible HF patients, 47.5% received GDMT. The 90 day mortality was 14.2% (14.9% and 13.9% in women and men, respectively) with a re-admission rate of 8.4%. An inverse relationship between educational class based on years of education and 90 day mortality (high mortality in the lowest educational class) was observed in the study population. Patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction who did not receive GDMT experienced higher mortality (log-rank P < 0.001) than those who received GDMT. Baseline educational class, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, dependent oedema, serum creatinine, QRS > 120 ms, atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, haemoglobin levels, serum sodium, and GDMT independently predicted 90 day mortality.
   Conclusion One of seven ADHF patients in the NHFR died during the first 90 days of follow-up. One of two patients received GDMT. Adherence to GDMT improved survival in HF patients with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fractions. Our findings call for innovative quality improvement initiatives to improve the uptake of GDMT among HF patients in India.

AB  - Several new viral infections have emerged in the human population and establishing as global pandemics. With advancements in translation research, the scientific community has developed potential therapeutics to eradicate or control certain viral infections, such as smallpox and polio, responsible for billions of disabilities and deaths in the past. Unfortunately, some viral infections, such as dengue virus (DENV) and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), are still prevailing due to a lack of specific therapeutics, while new pathogenic viral strains or variants are emerging because of high genetic recombination or cross-species transmission. Consequently, to combat the emerging viral infections, bioinformatics-based potential strategies have been developed for viral characterization and developing new effective therapeutics for their eradication or management. This review attempts to provide a single platform for the available wide range of bioinformatics-based approaches, including bioinformatics methods for the identification and management of emerging or evolved viral strains, genome analysis concerning the pathogenicity and epidemiological analysis, computational methods for designing the viral therapeutics, and consolidated information in the form of databases against the known pathogenic viruses. This enriched review of the generally applicable viral informatics approaches aims to provide an overview of available resources capable of carrying out the desired task and may be utilized to expand additional strategies to improve the quality of translation viral informatics research.

AB  - We report two cases of culture positive typhoid fever caused by ceftriaxone resistant Salmonella Typhi. Bacterial isolates from both the cases were positive for ESBL by phenotypic methods. Both patients didn't respond to ceftriaxone and were finally treated with meropenem. Screening of family members of one patient isolated a similar strain from a healthy carrier with the same antibiogram pattern. All isolates were subjected to PCR, which confirmed the presence of blaCTX-M15 ESBL gene. These two cases confirm emergence of ESBL-producing Sal-monella Typhi causing Enteric Fever in India and also their presence in the gut flora of healthy carriers.

AB  - Monkeypox is caused by a pox virus closely related to smallpox virus and spreads from animals to humans, and humans to humans following close contact. Prior smallpox vaccination gives partial protection against monkeypox. The steady increase in monkeypox cases in Africa over the past few decades were ignored by the global scientific community till this year, when more than 16,000 cases have been reported from nonendemic countries. Monkeypox has recently been labelled as a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. While most of the current cases are in men who have sex with men, there is the larger threat of the disease spilling into the general population. The disease is characterized by a short febrile illness with lymphadenopathy followed by a rash which spreads centrifugally and passes through phases of macules, papules, vesicles, and pustules. Recovery occurs in most patients within 2-4 wk. Complications are more likely in children, pregnant women, and the immunocompromised. Specific diagnosis is by detection of viral DNA by PCR. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Tecorivimat is a promising antiviral drug. Vaccination with the currently available smallpox vaccines is recommended for high-risk groups, health care workers, and close contacts. Control of the monkeypox outbreak needs a multipronged effort comprising enhanced surveillance, quick diagnosis, isolation of affected people, ring immunization, and adoption of "one health" approach.

AB  - An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019 and spread so rapidly all around the globe. It's continued and spreading more dangerously in India and Brazil with higher mortality rate. Understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 depends on unraveling of interactional mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and human immune response. The immune response is a complex process, which can be better understood by understanding the immunological response and pathological mechanisms of COVID-19, which will provide new treatments, increase treatment efficacy, and decrease mortality associated with the disease. In this review we present a amalgamate viewpoint based on the current available knowledge on COVID-19 which includes entry of the virus and multiplication of virus, its pathological effects on the cellular level, immunological reaction, systemic and organ presentation. T cells play a crucial role in controlling and clearing viral infections. Several studies have now shown that the severity of the COVID-19 disease is inversely correlated with the magnitude of the T cell response. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 T cell responses is of high interest because T cells are attractive vaccine targets and could help reduce COVID-19 severity. Even though there is a significant amount of literature regarding SARS-CoV-2, there are still very few studies focused on understanding the T cell response to this novel virus. Nevertheless, a majority of these studies focused on peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were specific for viruses. The focus of this review is on different subtypes of T cell responses in COVID-19 patients, Th17, follicular helper T (TFH), regulatory T (Treg) cells, and less classical, invariant T cell populations, such as delta gamma T cells and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells etc that could influence disease outcome.

AB  - Background Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia has emerged as a major success in hemato-oncology. While literature from the developed world boasts of outstanding outcomes, there is a paucity of data from the developing world. This study aimed to assess complications and outcomes of acute promyelocytic leukaemia in a resource-constrained setting. Methods We retrospectively collected data from patients diagnosed with APL from January 2016 to December 2020. Results Sixty-four patients were treated-32 in both the Sanz high and low-risk groups. In the Sanz low-risk group, 12.5% of patients received ATRA with daunorubicin and 81.25% received ATRA with ATO. In the Sanz high-risk group, 18.8% of patients received ATRA with daunorubicin, 34.3% received ATRA with daunorubicin and ATO while 40.6% received ATRA with ATO. 56.25% of patients developed differentiation syndrome. The incidence was higher in Sanz high-risk group as compared to Sanz low-risk group. 57.4% of patients had an infection at the time of presentation. 62.5% of patients developed neutropenic fever during treatment. 17.2% of patients developed pseudotumor cerebri. The 4-year EFS and OS were 71.25 and 73.13%, respectively. Sanz low-risk group had a better 4-year EFS and OS as compared to the Sanz high-risk group. Haemoglobin at presentation and Sanz high-risk group were associated with poorer outcomes with a hazard ratio of 0.8 and 3.1, respectively. Outcomes in high-risk patients were better with the use of ATRA + ATO + daunorubicin. Conclusion In the Indian population, APL patients have a high incidence of differentiation syndrome, pseudotumor cerebri, and infections during induction. CR, EFS, and OS compared to the developed world can be achieved with optimal therapy. Low haemoglobin at presentation and Sanz high-risk group were associated with poorer outcomes. ATRA, ATO, and daunorubicin combination is the preferred protocol for treating high-risk patients.

AB  - Poly [adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose] polymerases (PARPs) are members of a family of 17 enzymes that performs several fundamental cellular processes. Aberrant activity (mutation) in PARP12 has been linked to various diseases including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Herein, a large library of compounds (ZINC-FDA database) has been screened virtually to identify potential PARP12 inhibitor(s). The best compounds were selected on the basis of binding affinity scores and poses. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and binding free energy calculation (MMGBSA) were carried out to delineate the stability and dynamics of the resulting complexes. To this end, root means deviations, relative fluctuation, atomic gyration, compactness, covariance, residue-residue contact map, and free energy landscapes were studied. These studies have revealed that compounds ZINC03830332, ZINC03830554, and ZINC03831186 are promising agents against mutated PARP12.

TI  - "Repair by Primary Closure of Traumatic Blunt Duodenal Injuries: Simple is Not Always Safe"

AB  - Introduction: Recent literature on managing traumatic duodenal injuries suggests the superiority of primary repair. We hypothesized that duodenal trauma repair by primary closure might not be a safe strategy in an environment dealing predominantly blunt injuries with limited resources.
   Methods: Data analysis was done from the prospectively maintained trauma registry. The study period chosen was from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018. Data of 63 patients were analyzed for demographics, injuries, management, and outcome. Logistic regression was used to identify mortality predictors.
   Results: The most common mechanism of injury was blunt (56/63, 88.9%). Forty (63.5%) patients had associated intraabdominal injuries. The most common American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade of injury to the duodenum was three in 21 patients. Univariate analysis showed that mortality was associated with hypotension on presentation, higher duodenal grade, associated abdominal vascular injuries, primary closure, and duodenal leak. Logistic regression showed associated associated abdominal vascular injuries, primary closure, and leak remained significant predictors of mortality.
   Conclusions: Primary repair was found to be an independent predictor of mortality. A patient's physiology is a critical determinant of the outcome. Liberal use of tube duodenostomy over primary repair seems reasonable for blunt duodenal injury management. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a condition in which the fetal weight is below the 10th percentile for its gestational age. Prenatal exposure to metals can cause a decrease in fetal growth during gestation thereby reducing birth weight. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to develop a machine learning model for early prediction of IUGR. A total of 126 IUGR and 88 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) samples were collected from the Gynecology Department, Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi. The predictive models were developed using the Weka software. The models developed using all the features gave the highest accuracy of 95.5% with support vector machine (SMO) algorithm and 88.5% with multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithm. Further, models developed after feature selection using 14 important and statistically significant variables also gave the highest accuracy of 98.5% with SMO algorithm and 99% with Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm. The study concluded SMO_31, SMO_14, MLP_31, and NB_14 to be the better classifiers for IUGR prediction.

AB  - Salmonella Typhi is emerging as a drug-resistant pathogen, particularly in developing countries. Hence, the progressive development of new antibiotics against novel drug targets is essential to prevent the spread of infections and mortality. The cell division protein FtsZ is an ideal drug target as the cell wall synthesis in bacteria is driven by the dynamic treadmilling nature of the FtsZ. The polymerization of the FtsZ provides the essential mechanical constricting force and flexibility to modulate the cell wall synthesis. Any alteration in FtsZ polymerization leads to the bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect. In this study, we have evaluated the secondary metabolites of natural compounds berberine chloride, cinnamaldehyde, scopoletin, quercetin and eugenol as potential inhibitors of FtsZ from Salmonella Typhi (stFtsZ) using computational, biochemical, and in vivo cellbased assays. Out of these five compounds, berberine chloride and cinnamaldehyde exhibited the best binding affinity of Kd = 7 mu M and 10 mu M, respectively and inhibit stFtsZ GTPase activity and polymerization by 70 %. The compound berberine chloride showed the best MIC of 500 mu g/mL and 175 mu g/mL against gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial strains. The findings support that these natural compounds can be used as a backbone structure to develop a broad spectrum of antibacterial agents.

AB  - Whilst data on biochemical networks has increased several-fold, our comprehension of the underlying molecular biology is incomplete and inadequate. Simulation studies permit data collation from disparate time points and the imputed trajectories can provide valuable insights into the molecular biology of complex biochemical systems. Although, stochastic simulations are accurate, each run is an independent event and the data that is generated cannot be directly compared even with identical simulation times. This lack of robustness will preclude a biologically meaningful result for the metabolite(s) of concern and is a significant limitation of this approach. "TemporalGSSA" or temporal Gillespie Stochastic Simulation Algorithm is an R-wrapper which will collate and partition SSA-generated datasets with identical simulation times (trials) into finite sets of linear models (technical replicates). Each such model (time step of a single run, absolute number of molecules for a metabolite) computes several coefficients (slope, intercept, etc.). These coefficients are averaged (mean slope, mean intercept) across all trials of a technical replicate and along with an imputed time step (mean, median, random) is incorporated into a linear regression equation. The solution to this equation is the number of molecules of a metabolite which is used to compute the molar concentration of the metabolite per technical replicate. The summarized (mean, standard deviation) data of this vector of technical replicates is the outcome or numerical estimate of the molar concentration of a metabolite and is dependent on the duration of the simulation. If the SSA-generated dataset comprises runs with differing simulation times, "TemporalGSSA" can compute the time-dependent trajectory of a metabolite provided the trials-per technical replicate constraint is complied with. The algorithms deployed by "TemporalGSSA" are rigorous, have a sound theoretical basis and have contributed meaningfully to our comprehension of the mechanism(s) that drive complex biochemical systems. "TemporalGSSA", is robust, freely accessible and easy to use with several readily testable examples.

AB  - IntroductionObesity is one of the major global problems in today's world, both in children, and the adult age group. Current evidence suggests obesity alters the expression of various genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging. In recent times complementary therapy like yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI) is used as an adjunct therapy to modern medicine. This study examines the efficacy of 12 weeks of yoga-based lifestyle intervention with standard care (SC) on the expression of genes related to oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging in obese adults. MethodsThis was a two-arm parallel randomized control trial implemented at Integral Health Clinic (IHC), an outpatient facility that regularly conducted YBLI programs for the prevention of lifestyle diseases like obesity and diabetes in the Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Blood samples at baseline and weeks 2,4, and 12 were collected from 72 adults (male n = 21; female n = 51) of age 20-45 years with a body-mass index (BMI) of 25-35 kg/m(2) who were randomized to receive either a 12-week SC (n = 36) or YBLI (n = 36). SC included recommendations for the management of obesity as per Indian guidelines including a low-calorie individualized diet and physical activity. Asana (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation were all part of the YBLI. Primary outcomes were relative fold change in the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress [Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-Kappa B)], inflammation [Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6)], and aging [human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the two groups at week-12. ResultsThere were no significant changes in fold change of TERT, IL-6, and NF-kappa B between the groups at week 12. The relative fold change of TERT was significantly greater in the YBLI group (p = <0.0001) vs the SC group at 2 weeks. The relative fold change of TNF alpha was significantly lower at week 12 in YBLI though the change was not continuous and reliable. Within both groups, TERT expression was significantly increased at week 2 though the change was greater in the YBLI group (p < 0.0001). TNF alpha gene expression was significantly lower at weeks 2 and 4, compared to baseline level, in the SC group but it increased at week 12. ConclusionThe results while did not confirm our hypothesis, are important to share with the scientific society, to be able to improve prospective study designs and find optimal time/intervention/biological marker settings for this highly important scientific field. The results are suggestive of a positive impact of YBLI and SC on the fold change of aging-related TERT gene in obesity, though the benefit was not evident till week 12. However, the results should be evaluated with caution and in light of other published studies. To better understand the positive effects of YBLI on oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging-related gene expression in obesity, larger studies are recommended.

AB  - Prostatic malakoplakia (MP) is rare, with only case reports and small series (< five patients) available in the literature. In this study we analysed an international multi-institutional series of 49 patients with prostatic MP to more clearly define its clinicopathological features. The median age was 67 years and the median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.5 ng/ml. MP was clinically manifest in most cases (28 of 45 patients with data available, 62%). Of 43 patients with detailed clinical history available, 21 (49%) had concurrent or metachronous malignancies (including prostate cancer). Diabetes or insulin resistance was present in 11 patients (26%). Additionally, three patients had a history of solid organ transplantation and one had HIV. Of note, six of 34 patients (18%) without concurrent prostate cancer had an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS) scores 4-5. The initial diagnosis was made on core biopsies (25 of 49, 51%), transurethal resection specimens (12 of 49, 24%), radical prostatectomies (10 of 49, 20%), Holmium-laser enucleation (one of 49, 2%) and cystoprostatectomy (one of 49, 2%). Tissue involvement was more commonly diffuse or multifocal (40 of 49, 82%). Von Kossa and periodic acid-Schiff stains were positive in 35 of 38 (92%) and 26 of 27 lesions (96%), respectively. Of note, two cases were received in consultation by the authors with a preliminary diagnosis of mesenchymal tumour/tumour of the specialised prostatic stroma. The present study suggests that prostatic MP is often associated with clinical findings that may mimic those of prostate cancer in a subset of patients. Moreover, MP may be found incidentally in patients with concurrent prostate cancer.

TI  - How and What are Indians Drinking? Findings from the National Family Health Survey
T2  - ALCOHOL AND ALCOHOLISM
AB  - Short Summary: With the caveats of expected limitations of surveys, the findings suggest an overall decrease in alcohol use in India, though the proportion of men with more frequent alcohol has increased. There is a need to strengthen the investment in the initiatives targeted at the harms due to alcohol use.
   Aims To assess recent changes in the extent and pattern of alcohol use in India using the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data. Methods We used unit-level data from both rounds of NFHS. The pattern of alcohol use was categorized as: 'almost every day', 'almost once a week' and 'less than once a week'. The information was segregated for the urban and rural settings. Information was also available on the type of alcoholic beverage used by the respondents. The z test for differences in proportions was carried out for the study variables. Results Findings suggest a 22.37 and 39.02% reduction in the proportion of men and women who reported alcohol use, respectively. The proportion of men reporting 'almost every day' and 'about once a week' consumption of alcohol increased by 24.19 and 7.14%, respectively. Conclusions With the caveats of expected limitations of surveys, the findings suggest an overall decrease in alcohol use in India, though the proportion of men with more frequent alcohol has increased. There is a need to strengthen the investment in the initiatives targeted at the harms due to alcohol use.

AB  - Primary CNS Vasculitis (PCNSV) is a rare inflammatory disorder affecting the blood vessels of the central nervous system. Patients present with a combination of headaches, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. There is usually a diagnostic delay. Treatment is based on observational studies and expert opinion. Our objective was to identify clinical, laboratory, neuroimaging, pathologic or management-related associations with 2 year outcome in patients with primary CNS vasculitis. We conducted a cohort study at a single tertiary care referral centre of prospectively (2018-2019) and retrospectively (2010-2018) identified individuals with primary CNS vasculitis (diagnosis was proven by either brain biopsy or cerebral digital subtraction angiography). Clinical, imaging and histopathologic findings, treatment, and functional outcomes were recorded. Univariate and stepwise multiple logistic regression were applied. P-value<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The main outcome measures were documentation of clinical improvement or worsening (defined by mRS scores) and identification of independent predictors of good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) at 2 years. We enrolled eighty-two biopsy and/or angiographically proven PCNSV cases. The median age at presentation was 34 years with a male predilection and a median diagnostic delay of 23 months. Most patients presented with seizures (70.7%). All patients had haemorrhages on MRI. Histologically lymphocytic subtype was the commonest. Corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide was the commonest medication used. The median mRS at follow-up of 2 years was 2 (0-3), and 65.2% of patients achieved a good functional outcome. Myelitis and longer duration of illness before diagnosis were associated with poorer outcomes. The presence of hemorrhages on SWI sequence of MRI might be a sensitive imaging marker. Treatment with steroids and another immunosuppressant probably reduced relapse rates in our cohort. We have described the third largest PCNSV cohort and multi-centre randomised controlled trials are required to study the relative efficacy of various immunosuppressants. Study registration: CTRI/2018/03/012721.

AB  - Background The prevalence and genetic spectrum of cardiac channelopathies exhibit population-specific differences. We aimed to understand the spectrum of cardiac channelopathy-associated variations in India, which is characterised by a genetically diverse population and is largely understudied in the context of these disorders. Results We utilised the IndiGenomes dataset comprising 1029 whole genomes from self-declared healthy individuals as a template to filter variants in 36 genes known to cause cardiac channelopathies. Our analysis revealed 186,782 variants, of which we filtered 470 variants that were identified as possibly pathogenic (440 nonsynonymous, 30 high-confidence predicted loss of function ). About 26% (124 out of 470) of these variants were unique to the Indian population as they were not reported in the global population datasets and published literature. Classification of 470 variants by ACMG/AMP guidelines unveiled 13 pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants mapping to 19 out of the 1029 individuals. Further query of 53 probands in an independent cohort of cardiac channelopathy, using exome sequencing, revealed the presence of 3 out of the 13 P/LP variants. The identification of p.G179Sfs*62, p.R823W and c.420 + 2 T > C variants in KCNQ1, KCNH2 and CASQ2 genes, respectively, validate the significance of the P/LP variants in the context of clinical applicability as well as for large-scale population analysis. Conclusion A compendium of ACMG/AMP classified cardiac channelopathy variants in 1029 self-declared healthy Indian population was created. A conservative genotypic prevalence was estimated to be 0.9-1.8% which poses a huge public health burden for a country with large population size like India. In the majority of cases, these disorders are manageable and the risk of sudden cardiac death can be alleviated by appropriate lifestyle modifications as well as treatment regimens/clinical interventions. Clinical utility of the obtained variants was demonstrated using a cardiac channelopathy patient cohort. Our study emphasises the need for large-scale population screening to identify at-risk individuals and take preventive measures. However, we suggest cautious clinical interpretation to be exercised by taking other cardiac channelopathy risk factors into account.

AB  - Background: Ischaemic stroke (IS) is associated with various modifiable risk factors but the association of these risk factors based on TOAST classification, which characterises IS into five subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small vessel occlusion (SVO), cardioembolic disease (CE), other determined aetiology (ODE) and undetermined aetiology (UDE), is unknown. We aimed to summarise the published evidence for the association of modifiable risk factors with IS subtypes based on TOAST classification, specifically focussing on the Asian versus Caucasian population.
   Method: A comprehensive search for all the published articles was performed in electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from 01st January 1950 to 10th April 2022 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CIs) along with random-effect models was used to calculate summary estimates.
   Results: In our meta-analysis, 32 studies with a total of 23,404 IS (14,364 in Asian vs. 9040 in Caucasian population), 7121 LAA (5219 in Asian vs. 1902 in Caucasian), 5532 SVO (3604 in Asian vs. 1928 in Caucasian), 3498 CE (1634 in Asian vs. 1864 in Caucasian), 1131 ODE (546 in Asian vs. 585 in Caucasian) and 4519 UDE (2076 in Asian vs. 2443 in Caucasian) were included. Our findings suggest a significant association between LAA and hypertension (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12), smoking (OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.04-1.17), dyslipidemia (OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.06-1.21), diabetes mellitus (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.11-1.25) and atrial fibrillation (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.40-0.75). Significantly strong association of hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation was observed with SVO and CE stroke subtypes. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity revealed a significant association for dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus and atrial fibrillation in LAA for both Asians and Caucasians. Hypertension was significantly associated with SVO and ODE subtypes in both Asians and Caucasians; however, only Asian population showed significant association of hypertension in LAA and CE subtypes. The other risk factors did not show any statistical difference between the ethnic groups for the different stroke subtypes. The majority of the risk factors depicted positive association with LAA and SVO, negative with CE and neutral with ODE and UDE.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest strong association of smoking, dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus with LAA and SVO subtypes in the Caucasian population. However, only diabetes mellitus showed significant association with both LAA and SVO subtypes in Asian population as well. Thus, a majority of the traditional modifiable risk factors had a positive association in LAA and SVO, while a negative protective association was observed in CE subtype, among both the Asian and the Caucasian subgroups.

AB  - Background Retinoblastoma (RB) is initiated by mutation in both alleles of RB1 gene. However, few cases may occur even in the absence of RB1 mutation suggesting the role of genes other than RB1. Methodology The current study was planned to utilize targeted exome sequencing in Indian RB patients affected with unilateral non-familial RB. 75 unilateral RB patients below 5 years of age were enrolled. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood and tumor tissue. From peripheral blood DNA, all coding and exon/intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct sequencing. Cases which did not harbor pathogenic variants in peripheral blood DNA were further screened for mutations in their tumor tissue DNA using targeted exome sequencing. Three pathogenicity prediction tools (Mutation Taster, SIFT, and PolyPhen-2) were used to determine the pathogenicity of non-synonymous variations. An in-house bioinformatics pipeline was devised for the mutation screening by targeted exome sequencing. Protein modeling studies were also done to predict the effect of the mutations on the protein structure and function. Results Using the mentioned approach, we found two novel variants (g.69673_69674insT and g.48373314C>A) in RB1 gene in peripheral blood DNA. We also found novel variants in eight genes (RB1, ACAD11, GPR151, KCNA1, OTOR, SOX30, ARL11, and MYCT1) that may be associated with RB pathogenesis. Conclusion The present study expands our current knowledge regarding the genomic landscape of RB and also highlights the importance of NGS technologies to detect genes and novel variants that may play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, and prognosis.

AB  - Aims Aortic stenosis (AS) and cardiac amyloidosis (CA) frequently coexist but the diagnosis of CA in AS patients remains a diagnostic challenge. We aim to evaluate the echocardiographic parameters that may aid in the detection of the presence of CA in AS patients. Method and results We performed a systematic literature search of electronic databases for peer-reviewed articles from inception until 10 January 2022. Of the 1449 patients included, 160 patients had both AS-CA whereas the remaining 1289 patients had AS-only. The result of our meta-analyses showed that interventricular septal thickness [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.74, 95% CI: 0.36-1.12, P = 0.0001), relative wall thickness (SMD: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.17-1.30, P < 0.0001), posterior wall thickness (SMD: 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.97, P = 0.0011), LV mass index (SMD: 1.62, 95% CI: 0.63-2.62, P = 0.0014), E/A ratio (SMD: 4.18, 95% CI: 1.91-6.46, P = 0.0003), and LA dimension (SMD: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.43-1.02, P < 0.0001)] were found to be significantly higher in patients with AS-CA as compared with AS-only patients. In contrast, myocardial contraction fraction (SMD: -2.88, 95% CI: -5.70 to -0.06, P = 0.045), average mitral annular S ' (SMD: -1.14, 95% CI: -1.86 to -0.43, P = 0.0017), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (SMD: -0.36, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.09, P = 0.0081), and tricuspid annular S ' (SMD: -0.77, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.42, P < 0.0001) were found to be significantly lower in AS-CA patients. Conclusion Parameters based on echocardiography showed great promise in detecting CA in patients with AS. Further studies should explore the optimal cut-offs for these echocardiographic variables for better diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Introduction Tofacitinib has emerged as a useful drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). Areas covered There is an unmet need for cost-effective, non-immunogenic drugs with a safe adverse effect profile to treat patients with ulcerative colitis. In the present review, we evaluate the available literature to inform the appropriate positioning of tofacitinib in the current drug landscape and identify subsets where its use should be done with caution. Expert opinion Tofacitinib is helpful in the treatment of patients where the standard conventional or biological therapies have failed or were not tolerated. With lower costs of the generic drug than the biologicals (or biosimilars), it could be an important therapy in low- to middle-income countries. The risk of infections, especially Herpes Zoster and tuberculosis, needs to be addressed before initiation. Tofacitinib should be avoided in patients with venous thromboembolism and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Due to limited evidence, the use is not recommended in pregnancy, while it should be used with caution in elderly citizens. Future trials should look into the head-to-head comparison of tofacitinib with biologicals. The role of tofacitinib in acute severe colitis needs evaluation with comparative trials with current standards of care.

AB  - Background A bronchoscopy is an essential tool in pediatric pulmonology. However, the practices involved in the procedure are variable. Objective To evaluate prevalent practices and variations in pediatric flexible bronchoscopy in India. Methods An online survey was conducted via Google forms between September 2018 and March 2019. We circulated the survey among members of various respiratory societies and personal contacts. Physicians performing pediatric flexible bronchoscopy were requested to respond. The survey had 95 questions in seven domains: demographics, patient preparation, sedation, procedural aspects, monitoring, bronchoscope cleaning, and complications. Results The survey received 24 complete responses; the respondents were from 14 cities. Pediatric bronchoscopy was done mainly for diagnostic purposes. Most (19, 79%) respondents reported using conscious sedation for the procedure. The preferred regimen for sedation was midazolam plus fentanyl [9 (37.5%)]. Atropine was used routinely by 4 (16%). For topical anesthesia, nebulized lignocaine only, both nebulized and spray as go lignocaine, and spray as go lignocaine only were used by 1 (4.2%), 6 (25%), and 17 (71%) respondents, respectively. The methods of providing oxygen during bronchoscopy were free flow (9, 37.5%), nasal prongs (8, 33.3%), mask (6, 25%), and laryngeal mask airway (1, 4.2%). The common therapeutic procedures included removal of mucus plugs (17, 71%), bronchoscopic intubation (11, 45%), and foreign body removal (10, 41%). The number of aliquots used by respondents for bronchoalveolar lavage varied from 2 to 6, and the volume for each aliquot was also varied (1-2 ml/kg or 5-10 ml). Almost all the respondents reported complication rates of less than 5%. Conclusion There is a considerable variation in pediatric flexible bronchoscopy practices across the country, highlighting the need to develop a uniform guideline.

KW  - Fibrosis
AB  - Purpose The Judet's technique of quadricepsplasty for an extension contracture of the knee joint offers the benefit of a sequential and controlled release of the intrinsic and extrinsic soft tissue constituents restricting the knee flexion. The main principle of our study was to analyze the clinical as well as functional outcome and to assess an extension lag following Judet's quadricepsplasty for the knee extension contracture deformity. Materials and Methods This is a retrospective cohort study comprises of thirty three patients, operated for extension contracture with Judet's quadricepsplasty with the mean follow-up was 30 months. Knee range of motion of the operated knee was recorded preoperatively and at 6, 12 and 24 month follow-up after the surgery. Judet's criteria were used to evaluate the outcomes following the procedure. Results 92.42 degrees (range, 60 degrees-110 degrees) of knee flexion was achieved after an average follow-up of 24 months compared to preoperative knee flexion was 14.09 degrees (range 5 degrees-25 degrees), reflecting a 74.69 degrees average improvement in knee flexion. Twelve patients had excellent results, nineteen had good results as per Judet's criteria but there were no patients with extension lag. The two patients with fair results had superficial wound infection which healed without any further surgical intervention. Conclusions Judet's quadricepsplasty offers sequential release without extension lag of the knee joint. Patients with the knee extension contractures deformity can be successfully managed with the Judet's quadricepsplasty to gain useful knee motion and function.

AB  - Cisplatin is an important chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of solid tumors but often causes nephropathy as part of the off-target toxicity. Iron accumulation and related damage were implicated in cisplatin-induced kidney injury. However, the role of cisplatin in the renal iron sensing mechanism and its target genes responsible for iron uptake, storage, and release have not been investigated. Cellular iron homeostasis is controlled by the interaction of iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2) and iron-responsive elements (IREs) present in the untranslated regions of iron transport and storage components. Here, we report that cisplatin does not influence the expressions of IRP targets such as transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1), divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), and ferroportin in renal cells despite the increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) level. Ferritin subunits (Ft-H and Ft-L) are elevated in different magnitudes due to the increased mRNA expression. Intriguingly, a higher expression of Ft-L mRNA is detected than that of Ft-H mRNA. The inability of cisplatin in altering the IRE-IRP interaction is confirmed by examining IRE containing luciferase activity, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and activation of IRPs. The labile iron pool is depleted but reversed by silencing of either Ft-H or Ft-L, suggesting increased iron storage by ferritin. Silencing of Ft-H or Ft-L promotes cell death, suggesting that ferritin acts to protect the renal cells from cisplatin-mediated toxicity. A differential increase of transcripts and equivalent increase of proteins of Ft-H and Ft-L and unaltered TfR1 and DMT1 transcripts are found in the kidneys of cisplatintreated rats along with iron accumulation. Our results reveal that cisplatin does not influence the IRE-IRP interaction despite alteration of the cellular iron pool in renal cells. This insensitivity of the IRE-IRP system may be implicated in the accumulation of iron to contribute to cisplatin-induced nephropathy.

AB  - Background Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular cancer worldwide. There is some evidence to suggest that major differences exist in treatment outcomes for children with retinoblastoma from different regions, but these differences have not been assessed on a global scale. We aimed to report 3-year outcomes for children with retinoblastoma globally and to investigate factors associated with survival.
   Methods We did a prospective cluster-based analysis of treatment-naive patients with retinoblastoma who were diagnosed between Jan 1,2017, and Dec 31,2017, then treated and followed up for 3 years. Patients were recruited from 260 specialised treatment centres worldwide. Data were obtained from participating centres on primary and additional treatments, duration of follow-up, metastasis, eye globe salvage, and survival outcome. We analysed time to death and time to enucleation with Cox regression models.
   Findings The cohort included 4064 children from 149 countries. The median age at diagnosis was 23.2 months (IQR 11.0-36.5). Extraocular tumour spread (cT4 of the cTNMH classification) at diagnosis was reported in five (0.8%) of 636 children from high-income countries, 55 (5.4%) of 1027 children from upper-middle-income countries, 342 (19. 7%) of 1738 children from lower-middle-income countries, and 196 (42.9%) of 457 children from low-income countries. Enudeation surgery was available for all children and intravenous chemotherapy was available for 4014 (98.8%) of 4064 children. The 3-year survival rate was 99.5% (95% CI 98.8-100.0) for children from high-income countries, 91.2% (89.5-93.0) for children from upper-middle-income countries, 80.3% (78.3-82.3) for children from lower-middle-income countries, and 57.3% (524-63-0) for children from low-income countries. On analysis, independent factors for worse survival were residence in low-income countries compared to high-income countries (hazard ratio 16.67; 95% CI 4.76-50.00), cT4 advanced tumour compared to cT1 (8.98; 4.44-18.18), and older age at diagnosis in children up to 3 years (1.38 per year; 1.23-1.56). For children aged 3-7 years, the mortality risk decreased slightly (p=0.0104 for the change in slope).
   Interpretation This study, estimated to include approximately half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017, shows profound inequity in survival of children depending on the national income level of their country of residence. In high-income countries, death from retinoblastoma is rare, whereas in low-income countries estimated 3-year survival is just over 50%. Although essential treatments are available in nearly all countries, early diagnosis and treatment in low-income countries are key to improving survival outcomes. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Auditory perception and associated cognition involve visual and auditory cortical areas for inference of meaningful soundscape.Objective: To investigate auditory perception of ambiguous and non-ambiguous stimulation in auditory and visual cortical networks for categorical discrimination.Methodology: Functional mapping was carried out in twenty early (EB), twenty late blind (LB) and fifteen healthy children, during auditory ambiguous and non-ambiguous stimulation task in a 3 T MR scanner to estimate hemodynamic signal alteration and its effect on functional connectivity. The degree of amplitude low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), correlation analysis and multiple comparison was carried out to map the impact of duration of education and onset of blindness (EB and LB).Results and Discussion: Increased functional connectivity (FC) and cross-modal reorganization was observed in auditory, visual and language networks in EB children. FC was increased in contralateral hemisphere in both the blind children (EB and LB) groups and was positively correlated with duration of education performance. Cognitive assessment scores correlated (p < 0.01) with cluster coefficient of FC and BOLD response.Conclusion: FC alterations depend on onset age and audio-haptic training in children associated with increased auditory language and memory perception.

AB  - Fracture healing is a physiological process resulting in the regeneration of bone defects by the coordinated action of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoanabolic drugs have the potential to augment the repair of fractures but have constraints like high costs or undesirable side effects. The bone healing potential of a drug can initially be determined by in vitro studies, but in vivo studies are needed for the final proof of concept. Our objective was to develop a femur osteotomy rodent model that could help researchers understand the development of callus formation following fracture of the shaft of the femur and that could help establish whether a potential drug has bone healing properties. Adult male Wistar albino rats were used after Institutional Animal Ethics Committee clearance. The rodents were anesthetized, and under aseptic conditions, complete transverse fractures at the middle one-third of the shafts of the femurs were created using open osteotomy. The fractures were reduced and internally fixed using intramedullary K-wires, and secondary fracture healing was allowed to take place. After surgery, intraperitoneal analgesics and antibiotics were given for 5 days. Sequential weekly x-rays assessed callus formation. The rats were sacrificed based on radiologically pre-determined time points, and the development of the fracture callus was analyzed radiologically and using immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has emerged as one of the most promising platforms for various biosensing applications. These sensing systems encompass the advantages of specificity, ultra-high sensitivity, stability, low cost, repeatability, and easy-to-use methods. Moreover, their ability to offer a molecular fingerprint and identify the target analyte at low levels make SERS a promising technique for detecting circulating cancer biomarkers with greater sensitivity and reliability. Among the various circulating biomolecules, oncomiRs are emerging as prominent biomarkers for the early screening of breast cancers (BCs). In this review, we provide a comprehensive understanding of different SERS-based biosensors and their application to identify BC-specific oncomiRs. We also discuss different SERSbased sensing strategies, nano-analytical frameworks, and challenges to be addressed for effective clinical translation.

AB  - In patients with thalassemia major (TM), cardiac magnetic resonance feature-tracking (CMR-FT) has been shown to be an effective method for diagnosing subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. This study aimed to determine whether CMR-FT could detect abnormal RV dysfunction in patients with a normal right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF). We performed a retrospective analysis of TM patients admitted to Dubai's Rashid Hospital between July 2019 and March 2021. The inclusion criteria were TM patients with SSFP cine with T2* (T2*-weighted imaging), while exclusion criteria included any other cardiovascular disease. When there was no myocardial iron overload (MIO) (T2* >= 20 ms) and when there was significant MIO (T2* < 20 ms), the CMR-FT was used to correlate with EF. Among the 89 participants, there were 46 men (51.7%) and 43 women (48.3%), with a mean age of 26.14 +/- 7.4 years (range from 10 to 48 years). Forty-six patients (51.69%) did not have MIO, while 43 individuals did (48.31%). Thirty-nine patients (32.6%) were diagnosed with severe MIO, while seventeen (19.1%) were diagnosed with mild to moderate MIO. A significant correlation existed between RVEF and T2* values (r = 0.274, p = 0.014) and between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and T2* values (r = 0.256, p = 0.022). Using a multiple logistic regression model with predictors such as right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVGLS), LV ejection fraction (LV EF), and hemoglobin, abnormal myocardial iron overload can be predicted. This model demonstrates an AUC of 78.3%, a sensitivity of 72%, and a specificity of 76%. In the group with preserved RVEF > 53%, the left ventricular radial strain (LVGRS) (p = 0.001), right ventricular radial strain (RVGRS) (p = 0.000), and right ventricular basal circumferential strain (RVGCS-basal) (p = 0.000) CMR-FT strain values are significantly lower than those of the control group (p > 0.05). There was no significant correlation between the LVGLS and T2*. RVGLS was ranked among the most accurate predictors of abnormal myocardial iron overload. The LVGRS, RVGRS, and RVGCS-basal CMR-FT strain values were the best predictors of subclinical RV dysfunction in the group with preserved RVEF. The most accurate way to diagnose MIO is still T2*, but FT-strain can help us figure out how MIO affects the myocardium from a pathophysiological point of view.

AB  - Myopia or short-sightedness is an emerging pandemic affecting more than 50% population in South-Asian countries. It is associated with several sight-threatening complications, such as retinal detachment and choroidal neovascularization, leading to an increased burden of visual impairment and blindness. The pathophysiology of myopia involves a complex interplay of numerous environmental and genetic factors leading to progressive axial elongation. Environmental factors such as decreased outdoor activity, reduced exposure to ambient light, strenuous near work, and role of family history of myopia have been implicated with increased prevalence of this refractive error. While multiple clinical trials have been undertaken to devise appropriate treatment strategies and target the modifiable risk factors, there is no single treatment modality with ideal results; therefore, formulating a comprehensive approach is required to control the myopia epidemic. This review article summarizes the epidemiology, dynamic concepts of pathophysiology, and evolution of the treatment modalities for myopia such as pharmacological (atropine and other agents) and optical methods (spectacles, contact lenses, and orthokeratology).

AB  - The detection and classification of cystic lesions of the jaw is of high clinical relevance and represents a topic of interest in medical artificial intelligence research. The human clinical diagnostic reasoning process uses contextual information, including the spatial relation of the detected lesion to other anatomical structures, to establish a preliminary classification. Here, we aimed to emulate clinical diagnostic reasoning step by step by using a combined object detection and image segmentation approach on panoramic radiographs (OPGs). We used a multicenter training dataset of 855 OPGs (all positives) and an evaluation set of 384 OPGs (240 negatives). We further compared our models to an international human control group of ten dental professionals from seven countries. The object detection model achieved an average precision of 0.42 (intersection over union (IoU): 0.50, maximal detections: 100) and an average recall of 0.394 (IoU: 0.50-0.95, maximal detections: 100). The classification model achieved a sensitivity of 0.84 for odontogenic cysts and 0.56 for non-odontogenic cysts as well as a specificity of 0.59 for odontogenic cysts and 0.84 for non-odontogenic cysts (IoU: 0.30). The human control group achieved a sensitivity of 0.70 for odontogenic cysts, 0.44 for non-odontogenic cysts, and 0.56 for OPGs without cysts as well as a specificity of 0.62 for odontogenic cysts, 0.95 for non-odontogenic cysts, and 0.76 for OPGs without cysts. Taken together, our results show that a combined object detection and image segmentation approach is feasible in emulating the human clinical diagnostic reasoning process in classifying cystic lesions of the jaw.

AB  - Background & objectives: Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is prevalent across all age groups in general population of India but studies among tribal populations are scanty. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of VDD in the indigenous tribal population of the Kashmir valley and examine associated risk factors.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional investigation, a total of 1732 apparently healthy tribal participants (n=786 males and n=946 females) were sampled from five districts of Kashmir valley by using probability proportional to size method. Serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were classified as per the Endocrine Society (ES) recommendations: deficiency (<20 ng/ml), insufficiency (20-30 ng/ml) and sufficiency (>30 ng/ml). The serum 25(OH)D levels were assessed in relation to various demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education, smoking, sun exposure, body mass index and physical activity.
   Results: The mean age of the male participants was 43.79 +/- 18.47 yr with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 20.50 +/- 7.53 kg/m2, while the mean age of female participants was 35.47 +/- 14.92 yr with mean BMI of 22.24 +/- 4.73 kg/m2. As per the ES guidelines 1143 of 1732 (66%) subjects had VDD, 254 (14.71%) had insufficient and 334 (19.3%) had sufficient serum 25(OH)D levels. VDD was equally prevalent in male and female participants. Serum 25(OH)D levels correlated positively with serum calcium, phosphorous and negatively with serum alkaline phosphatase. Gender, sun exposure, altitude, physical activity and BMI did not seem to contribute significantly to VDD risk.
   Interpretation & conclusions:
   VD deficiency is highly prevalent among Kashmiri tribals, although the magnitude seems to be lower as compared to the general population. These preliminary data are likely to pave way for further studies analyzing the impact of vitamin D supplementation with analysis of functional outcomes.

AB  - After the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, unanswered questions remain related to its evolutionary history, path of transmission or divergence and role of recombination. There is emerging evidence on amino acid substitutions occurring in key residues of the receptor-binding domain of the spike glycoprotein in coronavirus isolates from bat and pangolins. In this article, we summarize our current knowledge on the origin of SARS-CoV-2. We also analyze the host ACE2-interacting residues of the receptor-binding domain of spike glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 isolates from bats, and compare it to pangolin SARS-CoV-2 isolates collected from Guangdong province (GD Pangolin-CoV) and Guangxi autonomous regions (GX Pangolin-CoV) of South China. Based on our comparative analysis, we support the view that the Guangdong Pangolins are the intermediate hosts that adapted the SARS-CoV-2 and represented a significant evolutionary link in the path of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also discuss the role of intermediate hosts in the origin of Omicron.

AB  - Evidence from preclinical studies suggests a preventive effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in preeclampsia. Recently, several epidemiological studies have described a conflicting association between the use of PPIs during pregnancy and preeclampsia risk. This study aimed to evaluate the association between PPI use and the risk of preeclampsia. We searched databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Emcare, CINAHL, and the relevant grey literature from inception until 13 September 2021. Studies reporting the preeclampsia risk with the use of PPIs were eligible for inclusion. Literature screening, data extraction, and the risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two investigators. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to generate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The risk of preeclampsia and preterm preeclampsia among women receiving PPIs during pregnancy were the primary outcomes of interest. This meta-analysis comprised three studies involving 4,877,565 pregnant women, of whom 119,017 were PPI users. The included studies were judged to have a low risk of bias. The risk of preeclampsia among pregnant women who received PPIs anytime during pregnancy was significantly increased (RR 1.27 (95% CI: 1.23-1.31)), although the increase was trivial in absolute terms (2 per 1000). The subgroup analysis revealed that the risk was increased in each of the three trimesters. The risk of preterm preeclampsia among pregnant women receiving PPIs anytime during pregnancy was not significantly increased (RR 1.04 (95% CI: 0.70-1.55)). The certainty evaluated by GRADE in these estimates was low. PPI use may be associated with a trivial increase in the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. There is no evidence supporting that PPI use decreases the risk of preeclampsia or preterm preeclampsia.

AB  - History An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents.
   Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 mu IU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 mu IU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 mu g/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 mu g/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries (Figs 1, 2A, 2B). The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand (Fig 3A) and pelvis (Fig 3B) were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of neck was also performed (Fig 4). Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.

AB  - Introduction. Few studies have been done on the burden of minor injuries on trauma centers. Patients with minor injuries require care in the ED, which diverts staff time and resources from patients with more serious injuries and which can sometimes overwhelm the functioning of even the best trauma facility. Objective. This study was conducted to assess the burden of minor trauma and thus emphasize the need to develop further management protocols. Methods. A retrospective observational study was conducted at a level I trauma center for a period of 1 month (February 14, 2020 through March 14, 2020) to assess the burden of minor injuries at that facility. The study population included all patients who required ED care for minor injuries. Data collected included age, sex, time of presentation, anatomical region involved, and interventions done. Results. Of the 3293 patients, 1255 were triaged as green. Seven hundred ninety-one patients with 849 injuries required ED intervention in the minor operation theater. Of the 791 patients, most were male (84.32%), and 61.4% were aged 21 to 40 years. In decreasing order, the most common modes of injury were road traffic injuries (68.4%), fall (15%), and interpersonal violence (13.8%). Maxillofacial injuries were present in 26.15% of patients, 25.8% of patients presented with injuries to the head and neck, 24% with lower extremity injury, and 21.9% with upper extremity injury. Conclusions. The burden of minor trauma should be recognized. Knowledge of local trauma epidemiology and injury patterns is essential for trauma centers to function well. It is important that all trauma centers should have dedicated protocols in place and trained personnel to address these minor trauma cases.

T2  - ANNALS OF VASCULAR SURGERY
KW  - IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA
KW  - THROMBOSIS
KW  - SAFETY
AB  - Background: Development of vaccines with high efficacy against COVID-19 disease has ushered a new ray of hope in the fight against the pandemic. Thromboembolic events have been reported after administration of vaccines. We aim to systematically review thromboembolic events reported after COVID-19 vaccination.
   Methods: The available literature was systematically screened for available data on thromboembolic events after COVID-19 vaccination. Data were extracted from selected studies and analyzed for site of thromboembolism as well as other risk factors. All data were pooled to determine cumulative incidence of thromboembolism at various sites after vaccination.
   Results: A total of 20 studies were selected for the final analysis. The mean age of the population was 48.5 +/- 15.4 years (females - 67.4%). The mean time to event after vaccination was 10.8 +/- 7.2 days. Venous thrombosis (74.8%, n = 214/286) was more common than arterial thrombosis (27.9%, n = 80/286). Cerebral sinus thrombosis was the most common manifestation (28.3%, n = 81/286) of venous thrombosis followed by deep vein thrombosis (19.2%, n = 49/254). Myocardial infarction was common (20.1%, n = 55/274) in patients with arterial thrombosis followed by ischemic stroke (8.02%, n = 22/274). Concurrent thrombosis at multiple sites was noted in 15.4% patients. Majority of patients had thrombocytopenia (49%) and anti-platelet factor 4 antibodies (78.6%). Thromboembolic events were mostly reported after the AstraZeneca vaccine (93.7%). Cerebral sinus thrombosis was the most common among thromboembolic events reported after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Among the reported cases, mortality was noted in 29.9% patients.
   Conclusions: Thromboembolic events can occur after COVID-19 vaccination, most commonly after the AstraZeneca vaccine. Cerebral sinus thrombosis is the most common manifestation noted in vaccinated individuals.

AB  - Background: The plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) is the gold standard to detect the neutralizing capacity of serum antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies confer protection against further infection. The present study measured the antibody level against SARS-CoV-2 among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and evaluated whether the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies indicates virus neutralizing capacity. Methods: One hundred COVID-19 confirmed cases were recruited. Their sociodemographic details and history of COVID-19 vaccination, contact with positive COVID-19 cases, and symptoms were ascertained using a self-developed semi-structured interview schedule. Serum samples of the participants were collected within three months from the date of the positive report of COVID-19. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies), receptor binding domain antibodies (anti-RBD), and neutralizing antibodies were measured. Findings: Almost all the participants had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG and IgM) (99%) and anti-RBD IgG antibodies (97%). However, only 69% had neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Anti-RBD antibody levels were significantly higher among participants having neutralizing antibodies compared with those who did not. Interpretation: The present study highlights that the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, or the presence of anti-RBD antibodies does not necessarily imply the presence of neutralizing antibodies.

AB  - Purpose To report the histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings of tissue samples obtained from patients with radial longitudinal deficiency (RLD) and investigate the contribution of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.Methods Specimens from radial-sided muscles and tendons were obtained at the time of surgery (either radialization or centralization) from 14 patients with 16 limbs affected with Bayne type 3 and type 4 RLD. The specimens were evaluated using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical examination.Results Among the 16 frozen muscle specimens, 6 (37%) showed normal muscle, while 10 (63%) showed the presence of atrophic fibers. The 6 cases with normal muscle showed no abnormality in fiber type distribution. Six patients showed predominance of type 1 muscle fibers. None of the specimens had myofibroblasts; 4 of 16 specimens had mast cells, and 9 of 16 specimens showed the presence of platelet derived growth factor -positive cells. Features of myofibroblasts (the presence of basal lamina, intercellular junctions, or pinocytic vesicles) were not identified in any specimen on electron microscopy.Conclusions The histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings, in particular the absence of myofibroblasts, in tissue samples obtained from patients with RLD, do not support the assumption of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.Clinical relevance This study provides a preliminary insight into a possible role of soft tissues in the development of the deformity in RLD.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CATARACT AND REFRACTIVE SURGERY
KW  - PENETRATING KERATOPLASTY
KW  - COMPLICATIONS
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of tuck-in deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) for the management of post-radial keratotomy (RK) keratectasia.
   Setting: Institution.
   Design: Retrospective.
   Methods: Medical records of all cases presenting with post-RK keratectasia from January 2012 to December 2019 were included. Data on corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refraction, keratometry, ultrasonic pachymetry, corneal topography, endothelial cell count, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination recorded at all follow-up visits were included. Details of surgical steps, including intraoperative and postoperative complications and any secondary procedures performed subsequently, were also recorded.
   Results: 7 eyes of 5 patients that developed corneal ectasia after a previous RK procedure underwent DALK with peripheral tuck-in. All eyes had CDVA <= 6/24, preoperatively. The surgical procedure was successfully performed in all eyes without any intraoperative complications. CDVA at the final follow-up ranged between 6/9 and 6/60, with 6 eyes achieving CDVA of 6/18 or better. The median keratometric cylinder reduced from a preoperative value of 7.2 +/- 9.27 diopters (D) to 2 +/- 1.83 D at the final follow-up. The median central corneal thickness at the final follow-up was 598 +/- 40.01 mu m, and spherical equivalent ranged between -1.75 D and -3.5 D (median -2 +/- 0.57). The percentage of endothelial cell loss ranged between 2.1% and 8.4%. All eyes retained graft clarity, and none showed any evidence of significant interface haze or corneal vascularization.
   Conclusions: Tuck-in DALK could successfully address corneal ectasia developing after RK, achieving visual gains. Moreover, it was able to restore the peripheral corneal thickness with a minimal risk for dehiscence of RK incisions. Copyright (C) 2022 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Performing procedures like gonioscopic assisted transluminal trabeculotomy in eyes with congenital glaucoma may be difficult many a times due to difficult visualization of angle structures. Inaccurate identification of the angle landmark may lead to various inadvertent surgical complications. Hence, there is a need for techniques to improve visualization of surgical landmarks during these procedures. In this study, 0.2% indocyanine green was used to stain the trabecular meshwork before the surgeon proceeded with gonioscopic assisted transluminal trabeculotomy. It yielded excellent differentiation of the trabecular meshwork by imparting a bright green hue. This led to successful identification of the site of incision and subsequent 360 degrees cannulation of Schlemm canal in 5/5 cases. Indocyanine green aided Schlemm canal identification is helpful in children with congenital glaucoma undergoing angle surgeries, especially in eyes with poor structure differentiation.

AB  - Purpose:This study aims to assess the preferred surgical technique of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) among corneal surgeons in India, and barriers in performing DMEK surgeries amongst the non-DMEK surgeons. Methods:An online, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among members of the Cornea Society of India (CSI) (n = 500). Responses on their surgical experience, preferred technique, complications, and outcome of DMEK were collected and analyzed. Barriers in performing DMEK surgeries were assessed amongst the non-DMEK surgeons. Results:A total of 100 responses were obtained and response rate for the survey was 20%. DMEK was performed by 55% of the participants of whom only 40% had formal training in this technique. Surgical video-based learning was the most often used self-training method for others. Lack of training was the most common reason for not performing DMEK by the non-DMEK surgeons. Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) was the most common endothelial keratoplasty (EK) performed by both DMEK and non-DMEK surgeons. High volume (>50 cases) DMEK surgeries were reported by limited surgeons (n = 6). Nearly all the DMEK surgeons prepared the donor tissue by themselves on the day of the surgery, and majority felt that unrolling the graft in the anterior chamber was the most difficult surgical step. Nearly 80% of the DMEK surgeons were more comfortable with DSEK or Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) when compared to DMEK. Conclusion:DMEK practice in India needs improvement with increased accessibility to DMEK training programs, wet lab facilities, and better support from eye banks.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to assess the preferred surgical technique of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) among corneal surgeons in India, and barriers in performing DMEK surgeries amongst the non-DMEK surgeons. Methods: An online, questionnaire-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted among members of the Cornea Society of India (CSI) (n = 500). Responses on their surgical experience, preferred technique, complications, and outcome of DMEK were collected and analyzed. Barriers in performing DMEK surgeries were assessed amongst the non-DMEK surgeons. Results: A total of 100 responses were obtained and response rate for the survey was 20%. DMEK was performed by 55% of the participants of whom only 40% had formal training in this technique. Surgical video-based learning was the most often used self-training method for others. Lack of training was the most common reason for not performing DMEK by the non-DMEK surgeons. Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) was the most common endothelial keratoplasty (EK) performed by both DMEK and non-DMEK surgeons. High volume (>50 cases) DMEK surgeries were reported by limited surgeons (n = 6). Nearly all the DMEK surgeons prepared the donor tissue by themselves on the day of the surgery, and majority felt that unrolling the graft in the anterior chamber was the most difficult surgical step. Nearly 80% of the DMEK surgeons were more comfortable with DSEK or Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) when compared to DMEK. Conclusion: DMEK practice in India needs improvement with increased accessibility to DMEK training programs, wet lab facilities, and better support from eye banks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The longer learning curve and smaller margin of error make nontraditional, or "out of operating room" simulation training, essential in neurosurgery. In this study, the authors propose an evaluation system for residents combining both task- based and procedure-based exercises and also present the perception of residents regarding its utility.
   METHODS Residents were evaluated using a combination of task-based and virtual reality (VR)-based exercises. The results were analyzed in terms of the seniority of the residents as well as their laboratory credits. Questionnaire-based feedback was sought from the residents regarding the utility of this evaluation system incorporating the VR-based exercises.
   RESULTS A total of 35 residents were included in this study and were divided into 3 groups according to seniority. There were 11 residents in groups 1 and 3 and 13 residents in group 2. On the overall assessment of microsuturing skills including both 4-0 and 10-0 microsuturing, the suturing skills of groups 2 and 3 were observed to be better than those of group 1 (p = 0.0014). Additionally, it was found that microsuturing scores improved significantly with the increasing laboratory credits (R-2 = 0.72, p < 0.001), and this was found to be the most significant for group 1 residents (R-2 = 0.85, p < 0.001). Group 3 residents performed significantly better than the other two groups in both straight (p = 0.02) and diagonal (p = 0.042) ring transfer tasks, but there was no significant difference between group 1 and group 2 residents (p = 0.35). Endoscopic evaluation points were also found to be positively correlated with previous laboratory training (p = 0.002); however, for the individual seniority groups, the correlation failed to reach statistical significance. The 3 seniority groups performed similarly in the cranial and spinal VR modules. Group 3 residents showed significant disagreement with the utility of the VR platform for improving surgical dexterity (p = 0.027) and improving the understanding of surgical procedures (p = 0.034). Similarly, there was greater disagreement for VR- based evaluation to identify target areas of improvement among the senior residents (groups 2 and 3), but it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.194).
   CONCLUSIONS The combination of task- and procedure-based assessment of trainees using physical and VR simulation models can supplement the existing neurosurgery curriculum. The currently available VR-based simulations are useful in the early years of training, but they need significant improvement to offer beneficial learning opportunities to senior trainees. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2022.6.FOCUS22199

AB  - Management of gynecological cancers has suffered during the pandemic, partly due to lockdown and partly due to directing resources to manage COVID-19 patients. Modification of gynecological cancer management during this pandemic is recommended. Cervical cancer patients who present with stage IA1 disease can have a delay of up to 8 weeks for surgical treatment, considering the slow tumor growth rate. Women with stages IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA1 must undergo radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy within 6 to 8 weeks. In areas where surgical treatment is not available, patients should be referred for radiation therapy/areas with adequate surgical expertise. The surgical option is attractive for early cancers during the COVID era, as it involves a single visit compared to the multiple visits required for chemoradiation. The value of lymph node staging needs to be reconsidered. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy should be given preference over primary cytoreductive surgery for advanced ovarian cancers. Surgeries, which demand extended surgical time such as Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy and pelvic exenterations, should be avoided during this pandemic. For patients scheduled for interval surgery after two or three neoadjuvant cycles, six cycles of chemotherapy should be considered before surgery is performed. For early-stage, low-grade endometrial cancer, consideration should be given to medical management until surgery is possible. The above recommendations have been made keeping in mind the geography, patient load, and availability of resources available to health care providers from southeast Asia. They might not be applicable globally and every practitioner should take call regarding patient's management as per availability of resources and loco-regional circumstances. The implementation of recommended international guidelines for the management of gynecologic cancers should take precedence. Each modification to the standard approach should be approved by a multidisciplinary team depending on the condition of the patients and the locoregional circumstances.

AB  - Objective To compare the average birthweights and the weight centiles of the 'new' growth charts with the 'old' (1974) charts developed in the same unit four decades ago. Methods Birthweight and gestation data of the eligible 12,355 singleton neonates born between 2009 and 2016 at a level-3 neonatal unit at a public sector hospital were used to develop the new growth chart. We then compared the prevalence of small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) classified by the new charts and the old charts, the incidence of short-term adverse outcomes among them, and the diagnostic performance of both the charts to identify the adverse outcomes in a separate validation cohort. Results The mean birthweights of boys and girls across all gestations were higher by 150-200 g and 100-150 g, respectively, in the new chart. The prevalence of SGA doubled (9.8% vs 4.7%), but LGA decreased by one-third (17.5% vs 25.9%) with the new chart. However, the proportion of SGA and LGA having one or more short-term adverse outcomes, and the diagnostic performance of both the charts to identify neonates with short-term adverse outcomes, were comparable. Conclusion There was an upward shift in the birthweights by about 150 g across all gestations in the new chart compared to the old chart developed 40 years ago. The findings imply the need to consider using updated growth charts to ensure accurate classification of size at birth of neonates.

AB  - Together, SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis have killed approximately 5.7 million people worldwide over the past 2 years. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the non -pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate COVID-19 transmission (including social distancing regulations, partial lockdowns and quarantines), have disrupted healthcare services and led to a reallocation of resources to COVID-19 care. There has also been a tragic loss of healthcare workers who succumbed to the disease. This has had consequences for TB services, and the fear of contracting COVID-19 may also have contributed to reduced access to TB services. Altogether, this is projected to have resulted in a 5-year setback in terms of mortality from TB and a 9-year setback in terms of TB detection. In addition, past and present TB disease has been reported to increase both COVID-19 fatality and incidence. Similarly, COVID-19 may adversely affect TB outcomes. From a more positive perspective, the pandemic has also created opportunities to improve TB care. In this review, we highlight similarities and differences between these two infectious diseases, describe gaps in our knowledge and discuss solutions and priorities for future research.

AB  - Exosomes derived from biological fluids have the potential to serve as a biomarker for the early detection of various cancers. However, the lack of reliable enrichment and detection methods posed a challenge for its clinical utility. In this work, we designed a rapid co-capture-based approach for targeted enrichment and detection of lung cancer-derived exosomes from human plasma. This method relies on the formation of a sandwich complex around the exosomes that involves magnetic nanoparticles coupled to CD151 to assist in the immunomagnetic selection of lung-derived exosomes and a secondary detection antibody (CD81) coupled to horseradish peroxi-dase for signal amplification. The performance of the co-capture method to detect exosomes has been optimized with known exosome concentrations in human plasma and exhibited good linearity (108-105 exosomes mL-1) with a detection limit of 60.4 exosomes mu L-1. This study further investigated the potential of the developed assay to differentiate healthy and lung cancer patients using 18 clinical samples by quantifying the CD151+/ CD81+ lung-derived exosomes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a rapid co-capture-based approach that offers simultaneous isolation and detection of exosomes compatible with low sample volume for detecting lung cancer patients.

AB  - Background: There are around 250 million adolescents in India. Adolescents are vulnerable to common mental disorders with depression and self-harm accounting for a major share of the burden of death and disability in this age group. Around 20% of children and adolescents are diagnosed with/ or live with a disabling mental illness. A national survey has found that suicide is the third leading cause of death among adolescents in India. The authors hypothesise that an intervention involving an anti-stigma campaign co-created by adolescents themselves, and a mobile technology-based electronic decision support system will help reduce stigma, depression, and suicide risk and improve mental health for high-risk adolescents living in urban slums in India.
   Methods: The intervention will be implemented as a cluster randomised control trial in 30 slum clusters in each of the cities of Vijayawada and New Delhi in India. Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years will be screened for depression and suicide ideation using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Two evaluation cohorts will be derived-a high-risk cohort with an elevated PHQ-9 score >= 10 and/or a positive response (score >= 2) to the suicide risk question on the PHQ-9, and a non-high-risk cohort comprising an equal number of adolescents not at elevated risk based on these scores.
   Discussion: The key elements that ARTEMIS will focus on are increasing awareness among adolescents and the slum community on these mental health conditions as well as strengthening the skills of existing primary healthcare workers and promoting task sharing. The findings from this study will provide evidence to governments about strategies with potential for addressing the gaps in providing care for adolescents living in urban slums and experiencing depression, other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints or increased suicide risk/self-harm and should have relevance not only for India but also for other low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Background SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious respiratory virus associated with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Discoveries in the field revealed that inflammatory conditions exert a negative impact on bone metabolism; however, only limited studies reported the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on skeletal homeostasis. Inflammatory immune cells (T helper-Th17 cells and macrophages) and their signature cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are the major contributors to the cytokine storm observed in COVID-19 disease. Our group along with others has proven that an enhanced population of both inflammatory innate (Dendritic cells-DCs, macrophages, etc.) and adaptive (Th1, Th17, etc.) immune cells, along with their signature cytokines (IL-17, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-6, etc.), are associated with various inflammatory bone loss conditions. Moreover, several pieces of evidence suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects various organs of the body via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors including bone cells (osteoblasts-OBs and osteoclasts-OCs). This evidence thus clearly highlights both the direct and indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the physiological bone remodeling process. Moreover, data from the previous SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002-2004 revealed the long-term negative impact (decreased bone mineral density-BMDs) of these infections on bone health. Methodology We used the keywords "immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2," "SARS-CoV-2 and bone cells," "factors influencing bone health and COVID-19," "GUT microbiota," and "COVID-19 and Bone health" to integrate the topics for making this review article by searching the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Conclusion Current evidence and reports indicate the direct relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and bone health and thus warrant future research in this field. It would be imperative to assess the post-COVID-19 fracture risk of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals by simultaneously monitoring them for bone metabolism/biochemical markers. Importantly, several emerging research suggest that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota-GM (established role in inflammatory bone loss conditions) is further involved in the severity of COVID-19 disease. In the present review, we thus also highlight the importance of dietary interventions including probiotics (modulating dysbiotic GM) as an adjunct therapeutic alternative in the treatment and management of long-term consequences of COVID-19 on bone health.

AB  - Objectives: India introduced BBV152/Covaxin and AZD1222/Covishield vaccines in January 2021. We estimated the effectiveness of these vaccines against severe COVID-19 among individuals aged >= 45 years.
   Methods: We did a multi-centric, hospital-based, case-control study between May and July 2021. Cases were severe COVID-19 patients, and controls were COVID-19 negative individuals from 11 hospitals. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated for complete (2 doses >= 14 days) and partial (1 dose >= 21 days) vaccination; interval between two vaccine doses and vaccination against the Delta variant. We used the random effects logistic regression model to calculate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjusting for relevant known confounders.
   Results: We enrolled 1143 cases and 2541 control patients. The VE of complete vaccination was 85% (95% CI: 79-89%) with AZD1222/Covishield and 71% (95% CI: 57-81%) with BBV152/Covaxin. The VE was highest for 6-8 weeks between two doses of AZD1222/Covishield (94%, 95% CI: 86-97%) and BBV152/Covaxin (93%, 95% CI: 34-99%). The VE estimates were similar against the Delta strain and sub-lineages.
   Conclusion: BBV152/Covaxin and AZD1222/Covishield were effective against severe COVID-19 among the Indian population during the period of dominance of the highly transmissible Delta variant in the second wave of the pandemic. An escalation of two-dose coverage with COVID-19 vaccines is critical to reduce severe COVID-19 and further mitigate the pandemic in the country. (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Plain language summary Despite substantial advancements in prognosis and diagnostic approaches, epithelial ovarian cancer is still the most lethal gynecological malignancy worldwide. In addition to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and surgery, immunotherapy in the clinical setting is promising. Tumor-restricted expression and strong immunogenic potential make cancer-testis/germline antigen (CTA) a potential candidate for efficient T-cell and dendritic cell-mediated cancer immunotherapy. The expression of CTAs is shown to be modulated by a specific epigenetic fine-tuning mechanism. However, the expression and role of CTA in epithelial ovarian cancer immunotherapy are poorly understood. Therefore, in the current work, the authors thoroughly highlight and explore the possible epigenetic mechanisms associated with CTA expression and their implication in T-cell and dendritic cell-based immunotherapy approaches to ovarian cancer. Understanding such a paradigm is essential to adopting a precision medicine approach for better therapeutic options.
   Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in women. The phenotype is characterized by delayed diagnosis, recurrence and drug resistance. Inherent immunogenicity potential, oncogenic function and expression of cancer-testis/germline antigen (CTA) in ovarian cancer render them a potential candidate for immunotherapy. Revolutionary clinical findings indicate that tumor antigen-mediated T-cell and dendritic cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches provide an excellent strategy for targeting tumors. Currently, dendritic cell vaccination for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma and CTA-based T-cell receptor transduced T-cell therapy involving MAGE-A4 and NY-ESO-1 are well documented and shown to be effective. This review highlighted the mechanical aspects of epigenetic drugs that can elicit a CTA-based humoral and cellular immune response and implicate T-cell and dendritic cell-based immunotherapeutic approaches.

AB  - Cancer stem cells (CSC) are the minor population of cancer originating cells that have the capacity of self-renewal, differentiation, and tumorigenicity (when transplanted into an immunocompromised animal). These low-copy number cell populations are believed to be resistant to conventional chemo and radiotherapy. It was reported that metabolic adaptation of these elusive cell populations is to a large extent responsible for their survival and distant metastasis. Warburg effect is a hallmark of most cancer in which the cancer cells prefer to metabolize glucose anaerobically, even under normoxic conditions. Warburg's aerobic glycolysis produces ATP efficiently promoting cell proliferation by reprogramming metabolism to increase glucose uptake and stimulating lactate production. This metabolic adaptation also seems to contribute to chemoresistance and immune evasion, a prerequisite for cancer cell survival and proliferation. Though we know a lot about metabolic fine-tuning in cancer, what is still in shadow is the identity of upstream regulators that orchestrates this process. Epigenetic modification of key metabolic enzymes seems to play a decisive role in this. By altering the metabolic flux, cancer cells polarize the biochemical reactions to selectively generate "onco-metabolites " that provide an added advantage for cell proliferation and survival. In this review, we explored the metabolic-epigenetic circuity in relation to cancer growth and proliferation and establish the fact how cancer cells may be addicted to specific metabolic pathways to meet their needs. Interestingly, even the immune system is re-calibrated to adapt to this altered scenario. Knowing the details is crucial for selective targeting of cancer stem cells by choking the rate-limiting stems and crucial branch points, preventing the formation of onco-metabolites.

AB  - BackgroundThe global inclination of stroke onset in earlier years of life and increased lifespan have resulted in an increased chronic post-stroke-related disability. The precise and simplistic approach such as the correlation of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) parameters, Resting Motor Threshold (RMT) and Motor Evoked Potential (MEP), in patients with stroke might play a critical role, given the prognostic value of MEP, a measure of cortical excitability, and might be the key point in prescribing appropriate therapeutic strategies. ObjectiveThe study aimed to determine the correlation of FMA-based impairment in the upper extremity function specifically of the wrist and hand with respect to the neurophysiological parameters of corticospinal tract integrity. Materials and methodsThe Institutional Review Board approved the study and 67 (n) patients with stroke were enrolled in the Department of Neurology, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The motor assessment was performed on patients by the upper extremity subset of Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and the clinical history was obtained. RMT and MEP of Extensor Digitorum Communis (EDC) muscle were measured via TMS. ResultsA significant positive correlation was observed between Fugl-Meyer Assessment Wrist/Hand (FMA W/H) and MEP scores (r = 0.560, <0.001). Also, Fugl-Meyer Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA UE) scores demonstrated a moderate positive association with MEP responsiveness (r = 0.421, <0.001). ConclusionMEP of the EDC muscle was found to be associated with sensorimotor control as measured by FMA. Moreover, FMA W/H score values might be a better prognostic indicator of EDC MEP responsiveness. Interestingly, a novel element comprising the range of FMA UE and FMA W/H components was observed to be a potential indicator of MEP responsiveness and could also indicate establishing FMA as a surrogate for TMS in resource-limited settings for prognostification.

AB  - Background Device-assisted and neuromodulatory therapies are the standard of care for Parkinson's disease (PD) with disabling motor complications. We aimed to compare and rank the currently available advanced therapies for PD on patient relevant outcomes. Methods We searched various databases for randomized controlled trials that studied subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS), globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS, pallidotomy, subthalamotomy, continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusion (CSAI), or intrajejunal levodopa infusion (IJLI), in patients with PD and motor complications. Primary outcome was the quality of life (QOL) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III and II, ON time, OFF time, levodopa equivalent daily doses, and adverse events (AE). Data were pooled using a Bayesian network meta-analysis, summarized as mean difference (MD) with 95% credibility intervals (CrI) and visualized in forest plots/league tables. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve plots determined the ranking probability. Results We identified 6745 citations and included 26 trials. STN-DBS (MD, -8.0; 95% CrI, -11, -5.8), GPi-DBS (MD, -7.1; 95% CrI, -11, -2.9), and IJLI (MD, -7.0; 95% CrI, -12, -1.8) led to better QOL than medical therapy alone, without significant differences among them. STN-DBS had the highest probability of being ranked the best treatment for QOL (79.6%), followed by IJLI (63.5%) and GPi-DBS (62.8%). Conclusions In advanced PD, STN-DBS alleviates more patient and clinician relevant outcomes, followed by GPi-DBS and IJLI. In resource limited settings, unilateral pallidotomy may improve motor symptoms and activities of daily living, although overall QOL may not be improved.

AB  - Background Human genetics research lacks diversity; over 80% of genome-wide association studies have been conducted on individuals of European ancestry. In addition to limiting insights regarding disease mechanisms, disproportionate representation can create disparities preventing equitable implementation of personalized medicine. Objective This systematic review provides an overview of research involving Parkinson's disease (PD) genetics in underrepresented populations (URP) and sets a baseline to measure the future impact of current efforts in those populations. Methods We searched PubMed and EMBASE until October 2021 using search strings for "PD," "genetics," the main "URP," and and the countries in Latin America, Caribbean, Africa, Asia, and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand). Inclusion criteria were original studies, written in English, reporting genetic results on PD from non-European populations. Two levels of independent reviewers identified and extracted information. Results We observed imbalances in PD genetic studies among URPs. Asian participants from Greater China were described in the majority of the articles published (57%), but other populations were less well studied; for example, Blacks were represented in just 4.0% of the publications. Also, although idiopathic PD was more studied than monogenic forms of the disease, most studies analyzed a limited number of genetic variants. We identified just nine studies using a genome-wide approach published up to 2021, including URPs. Conclusion This review provides insight into the significant lack of population diversity in PD research highlighting the immediate need for better representation. The Global Parkinson's Genetics Program (GP2) and similar initiatives aim to impact research in URPs, and the early metrics presented here can be used to measure progress in the field of PD genetics in the future.

AB  - Nanoparticles are used in various biomedical applications like in vitro diagnostics, imaging, drug delivery, and other therapeutic uses. The performance of such applications requires accurate knowledge of size distribution that needs precise characterization techniques. In this study, a single-nanoparticle characterization system based on the total internal reflected scattering signal (SNC-TIRS) is demonstrated for the size estimation of synthetic nanoparticles and exosomes. A compact waveguide-based evanescent field illumination is used to convert a digital microscope into a nanoparticle characterization system based on scattering signals from diffusing nanoparticles in Brownian motion. By analyzing single-particle trajectories, the system estimates the hydrodynamic size, average number of particles observed per unit volume, and the distribution of sample heterogeneity. SNC-TIRS is benchmarked with inorganic nanoparticles and biomaterials in size range of 80-250 nm. Its utility to characterize the size of exosomes isolated from plasma using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is shown. The hydrodynamic size of bare MNPs (123.83 +/- 29.19 nm), antibody-bound-MNPs (161.33 +/- 29.47 nm), and antibody-exosome-bound-MNP conjugates (224.82 +/- 25.89) are estimated and the results obtained agree with standard methods such as dynamic light scattering and nanoparticle tracking analysis. SNC-TIRS can enable the label-free characterization of nanomaterials and clinically relevant biomarkers.

TI  - Diversity in HIV epidemic transitions in India: An application of HIV epidemiological metrices and benchmarks

KW  - DISEASE
AB  - Background The Joint United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) has emphasized on the incidence-prevalence ratio (IPR) and incidence-mortality ratio (IMR) to measure the progress in HIV epidemic control. In this paper, we describe the status of epidemic control in India and in various states in terms of UNAIDS's recommended metrices.
   Method The National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) of India spearheads work on mathematical modelling to estimate HIV burden based on periodically conducted sentinel surveillance for providing guidance to program implementation and policymaking. Using the results of the latest round of HIV Estimations in 2019, IPR and IMR were calculated.
   Results National level IPR was 0.029 [0.022-0.037] in 2019 and ranged from 0.01 to 0.15 in various States and Union Territories (UTs). Corresponding Incidence-Mortality Ratio was at 0.881 [0.754-1.014] nationally and ranged between 0.20 and 12.90 across the States/UTs.
   Conclusions Based on UNAIDS recommended indicators for HIV epidemic control, namely IPR and IMR; national AIDS response in India appears on track. However, the program success is not uniform and significant heterogeneity as well as expanding epidemic was observed at the level of States or UTs. Reinforcing States/UTs specific and focused HIV prevention, testing and treatment initiatives may help in the attainment of 2030 Sustainable Development Goals of ending AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.

AB  - Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is defined as a syndrome of an immunological response of graft to the host that occurs early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). This disease is frequently observed even in HCT matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles at multiple gene loci. Although the HLA region represents complex and diverse genomic characteristics, detailed association analysis is required for the identification of uncharacterized variants that are strongly associated with aGVHD. We genotyped three loci, OR2H2, HLA-F-AS1, and HLA-G, that are located in the 460 kb of HLA telomeric region and statistically analyzed the genotypes including HLA-DPB1 with clinical and transplantation outcomes using 338 unrelated bone marrow transplantation (UR-BMT) patient-donor pairs who were matched for HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, and HLA-DQB1 (HLA-10/10). Multivariate analyses demonstrated that HLA-F-AS1 and HLA-DPB1 mismatches were associated with grade II-IV aGVHD (hazard ratio (HR), 1.76; 95% CI, 1.07-2.88; p = 0.026; and HR, 1.59; CI, 1.02-2.49; p = 0.042, respectively). There was no confounding between HLA-F-AS1 and HLA-DPB1 (p = 0.512), suggesting that the HLA-F-AS1 mismatch has a strong effect on aGVHD independently of HLA-DPB1. Moreover, a stratified analysis suggested possible associations of HLA-F-AS1, HLA-DPB1, and/or HLA-G mismatches with grade II-IV aGVHD and the more severe grade III-IV aGVHD. These findings provide new insights into understanding the molecular mechanism of aGVHD caused by HLA-matched UR-BMT.

AB  - Purpose To determine the prevalence and risk factors for pterygium in geographically diverse regions of India.
   Methods A population-based, cross-sectional multicentric study was conducted in adults aged >= 40 years in plains, hilly and coastal regions of India. All participants underwent a detailed questionnaire-based assessment for sun exposure, usage of sun protective measures, exposure to indoor smoke, and smoking. Detailed ocular and systemic examinations were performed. Pterygium was diagnosed and graded clinically by slit-lamp examination. Association of pterygium with sociodemographic, ophthalmological, and systemic parameters was assessed. Physical environmental parameters for the study period were estimated.
   Results Of the 12,021 eligible subjects, 9735 (81% response rate) participated in the study. The prevalence of pterygium in any eye was 13.2% (95% CI: 12.5%-13.9%), and bilateral pterygium was 6.7% (95% CI: 6.2-7.2). The prevalence increased with age (<0.001) irrespective of sex and was highest in those aged 60-69 years (15.8%). The prevalence was highest in coastal (20.3%), followed by plains (11.2%) and hilly regions (9.1%). On multi-logistic regression, pterygium was positively associated with coastal location (P<0.001), illiteracy (P = 0.037), increasing lifetime sun exposure (P<0.001), and negatively associated with BMI >= 25 kg/m2 (P = 0.009).
   Conclusion Pterygium prevalence is high in the rural Indian population. The association of pterygium with several potentially modifiable risk factors reflects its multifactorial etiology and provides targets for preventive measures.

AB  - Introduction Avoidable blindness is a significant public health problem in India. Nationally representative RAAB surveys (Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness) are being conducted periodically in the country to know the current status of blindness in the country. The current study describes the findings from the RAAB survey conducted during 2015-19 in India.
   Methodology A cross-sectional, population-based survey was conducted across the entire country among persons aged 50 years and above using RAAB version 6 methodology. Presenting and pinhole visual acuity was recorded followed by lens examination using a torchlight. In order to estimate the prevalence of blindness and visual impairment in overall population in India, district weights were assigned to each of the 31 surveyed districts and the prevalence was standardized using the RAAB software.
   Results The overall weighted, age-gender standardized, prevalence of blindness (presenting visual acuity <3/60 in better eye) in population aged >= 50 years was 1.99% (95% CI 1.94%, 2.13%) and of visual impairment (VI) (presenting visual acuity <6/12 in better eye) was 26.68% (95% CI 26.57-27.17%). On multivariate analysis, adjusted odds ratio showed that blindness was associated with age >= 80 years (OR = 20.3, 95% CI: 15.6-26.4) and being illiterate (OR = 5.6, 95% CI: 3.6-8.9). Blindness was not found to be significantly associated with either gender or locality.
   Conclusion The results of the survey demonstrate that currently more than one fourth of persons aged 50 years and above are visually impaired (PVA<6/12 in better eye) in India. The prevalence of blindness among them is 1.99%, and older age and illiteracy are significantly associated with blindness. Major causes of blindness included cataract (66.2%), corneal opacity (CO) (8.2%), cataract surgical complications (7.2%), posterior segment disorders (5.9%) and glaucoma (5.5%). The proportion of blindness and visual impairment that is due to avoidable causes include 92.9% and 97.4% respectively.

AB  - Despite several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors of hormone-associated cancers have been established, less heed has been paid to chemicals, those having the potential to thwart the body's normal detox system and affect the endocrine-hormonal pathways. Phthalates are endocrine-disrupting chemicals, most widely manufactured and used indiscriminately in several industries, including processed, ultra-processed and packaged food, single-use plastics, household and personal care/cosmetic products including diapers and electronics. The general population is regularly being exposed to phthalates on contact with these products, especially women and children are most vulnerable. It is therefore highly crucial to monitor and evaluate the biological burden of plasticizing phthalates in humans and understand the potential mechanisms of etiological link between pervasive exposure to phthalates and development of chronic diseases such as cancer through epigenetic and/or genetic alterations. It is also important to identify sustainable and scalable interventions for increasing public awareness, and restricting chronic phthalate exposure to individual and the population at large through relevant policy legislations, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, such as India.

AB  - Chemotherapeutic agents may adversely affect the nervous system, including the neural precursor cells as well as the white matter. Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, several hypotheses connecting inflammation and oxidative stress with neurotoxicity are now emerging. The proposed mechanisms differ depending on the class of drug. For example, toxicity due to cisplatin occurs due to activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa B), which alters hippocampal long-term potentiation. Free radical injury is also involved in the cisplatin-mediated neurotoxicity as dysregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been seen which protects against the free radical injury by regulating glutathione S-transferases and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). Thus, correcting the imbalance between NF-kappa B and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways may alleviate cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. With newer agents like bortezomib, peripheral neuropathy occurs due to up-regulation of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the sensory neurons. Superoxide dismutase dysregulation is also involved in bortezomib-induced neuropathy. This article reviews the available literature on inflammation and oxidative stress in neurotoxicity caused by various classes of chemotherapeutic agents. It covers the conventional medicines like platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, and methotrexate, as well as the newer therapeutic agents like immunomodulators and immune checkpoint inhibitors. A better understanding of the pathophysiology will lead to further advancement in strategies for management of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background The clinical impact of the influenza vaccination on cardiovascular outcomes in people with established cardiovascular disease (CVD) is still debated. Aim The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the effect of influenza vaccination on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular outcomes among patients with established CVD. Methods We systematically searched all electronic databases from inception until 15 April 2022. Primary clinical outcomes were all-cause mortality, and major adverse clinical events (MACEs). Secondary endpoints were heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, and stroke. Results Eighteen articles (five randomized trials and thirteen observational studies), with a total of 22 532 165 patients were included in the analysis. There were 217 072 participants included in the high cardiovascular risk or established CVD population (vaccinated n = 111 073 and unvaccinated n = 105 999). The mean age of the patients was 68 years old, without any difference between groups (69 vs. 71) years. At a mean follow-up of 1.5 years, the vaccinated group was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR), 0.71(95% CI, 0.63-0.80), P < 0.001], MACE [HR, 0.83(95% CI:0.72-0.96), P = 0.01], CV mortality [HR, 0.78(95% CI:0.68-0.90), P < 0.001], and MI [HR, 0.82 (95% CI:0.74-0.92), P < 0.001] compared to the unvaccinated group. While the incidence of stroke [HR, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.92-1.06), P = 0.61] and heart failure [HR, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.51-1.08), P = 0.12] did not differ between the two groups. Conclusion Influenza vaccination reduced MACEs, all-cause mortality, CV mortality, and MI. These highlighted the importance of influenza vaccination in established CVD or high cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Mitochondria are one of the essential cellular organelles. Apart from being considered as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria have been widely known to regulate redox reaction, inflammation, cell survival, cell death, metabolism, etc., and are implicated in the progression of numerous disease conditions including neurodegenerative diseases. Since brain is an energy-demanding organ, mitochondria and their functions are important for maintaining normal brain homeostasis. Alterations in mitochondrial gene expression, mutations, and epigenetic modification contribute to inflammation and neurodegeneration. Dysregulation of reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria and aggregation of proteins in neurons leads to alteration in mitochondria functions which further causes neuronal death and progression of neurodegeneration. Pharmacological studies have prioritized mitochondria as a possible drug target in the regulation of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the present review article has been intended to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial role in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases mainly Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis followed by possible intervention and future treatment strategies to combat mitochondrial-mediated neurodegeneration.

AB  - sgRNA/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) provide a site-specific robust gene-editing approach avoiding the mutagenesis and unwanted off-target effects. However, the high molecular weight (similar to 165 kDa), hydrophilicity and net supranegative charge (similar to-20 mV) hinder the intracellular delivery of these RNPs. In the present study, we have prepared cationic RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes that showed a size of 117.3 +/- 7.64 nm with +6.17 +/- 1.04 mV zeta potential and >90% entrapment efficiency of RNPs. Further, these RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes showed good complexation efficiency and were found to be stable for 12 h with fetal bovine serum. These RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes did not induce any significant cytotoxicity in HEK293T cells, and were efficiently uptaken via a clathrin-mediated pathway with optimal transfection efficiency and nuclear localization after 48 h. Further, HEK293T cells having the mGFP insert were used as a cell line model for gene editing, wherein the loss of the mGFP signal was observed as a function of gene editing after transfection with mGFP targeting RNPs lipopolymeric nanoplexes. Further, the T7 endonuclease and TIDE assay data showed a decent gene editing efficiency. Additionally, the lipopolymeric nanoplexes were able to transfect muscle cells in vivo, when injected intra-muscularly. Collectively, this study explored the potential of cationic lipopolymeric nanoplexes for delivering gene-editing endonucleases.

AB  - Background The ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has a significant mortality rate of 3-5%. The principal causes of multiorgan failure and death are cytokine release syndrome and immune dysfunction. Stress, anxiety, and depression has been aggravated by the pandemic and its resultant restrictions in day-to-day life which may contribute to immune dysregulation. Thus, immunity strengthening and the prevention of cytokine release syndrome are important for preventing and minimizing mortality in COVID-19 patients. However, despite a few specific remedies that now exist for the SARS-CoV-2virus, the principal modes of prevention include vaccination, masking, and holistic healing methods, such as yoga. Currently, extensive research is being conducted to better understand the neuroendocrinoimmunological mechanisms by which yoga alleviates stress and inflammation. This review article explores the anti-inflammatory and immune-modulating potentials of yoga, along with its role in reducing risk for immune dysfunction and impaired mental health. Methods We conducted this narrative review from published literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE databases. Screening was performed for titles and abstracts by two independent review authors; potentially eligible citations were retrieved for full-text review. References of included articles and articles of major non-indexed peer reviewed journals were searched for relevance by two independent review authors. A third review author checked the excluded records. All disagreements were resolved through discussion amongst review authors or through adjudication by a fourth review author. Abstracts, editorials, conference proceedings and clinical trial registrations were excluded. Observations Yoga is a nonpharmacological, cost-effective, and safe intervention associated with several health benefits. Originating in ancient India, this vast discipline consists of postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), meditation (dhyana/dharana), and relaxation. Studies have demonstrated yoga's ability to bolster innate immunity and to inhibit cytokine release syndrome. As an intervention, yoga has been shown to improve mental health, as it alleviates anxiety, depression, and stress and enhances mindfulness, self-control, and self-regulation. Yoga has been correlated with numerous cardioprotective effects, which also may play a role in COVID-19 by preventing lung and cardiac injury. Conclusion and relevance This review paves the path for further research on yoga as a potential intervention for enhancing innate immunity and mental health and thus its role in prevention and adjunctive treatment in COVID-19.

AB  - Background: HYPORT adjuvant trial is a randomised phase III open-label noninferiority trial comparing standard moderately hypofractionated 3 week adjuvant radiation therapy in breast cancer with a novel 1-week schedule. The trial was initiated in March 2019 and is open to recruitment with a total sample size of 2100. We report the results of dosimetric quality assurance, acute toxicity and pre planned first interim safety analysis in the first 271 patients.Methods: Stage I-III breast cancer planned for adjuvant radiation therapy to the breast/chest-wall (along with regional nodes as indicated) were randomised to receive 40 Gy/15 fractions/3 weeks or 26 Gy/5 frac-tions/1 week. For simultaneous integrated boost, the patients in the control arm received 8 Gy/15 frac-tions/3 weeks, while those in the experimental arm received 6 Gy/5 fractions/1 week (to the tumour bed). For sequential boost, the prescribed dose was 12 Gy/4 fractions/4 days in both arms. Compliance to pre specified dosimetric parameters and acute toxicities were evaluated.Result: Data of the first 271 patients was analysed of whom 104 patients received tumour bed boost using SIB. All mandatory dosimetric criteria were met apart from one patient with a higher contralateral breast dose due to optimal internal mammary nodal coverage. Overall three patients (1.1%) experienced grade 3 radiation dermatitis (none received SIB), no other Grade 3 or higher toxicities reported.Conclusion: This acute toxicity interim analysis demonstrates that hypofractionated adjuvant radiother-apy with SIB for patients with breast cancer is feasible, and associated with minimal severe acute toxicities.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - IKK gamma prototypically promotes NF kappa Bp65 activity by regulating the assembly of the IKK holocomplex. In hyper-trophied cardiomyocytes, the p65-p300 complex-induced regenerative efforts are neutralized by the p53-p300 complex-mediated apoptotic load resulting in compromised cardiac function. The present study reports that nitrosative stress leads to S-Nitrosylation of IKK gamma in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes in a pre-clinical model. Using a cardiomyocyte-targeted nanoconjugate, IKK gamma S-Nitrosylation-resistant mutant plasmids were delivered to the pathologically hypertrophied heart that resulted in improved cardiac function by amelioration of cardiomyocyte apoptosis and simultaneous induction of their cell cycle re-entry machinery. Mechanistically, in IKK gamma S-Nitrosyl mutant-transfected hypertrophied cells, increased IKK gamma-p300 binding downregulated the binding of p53 and p65 with p300. This shifted the binding preference of p65 from p300 to HDAC1 resulting in upregulated expression of cyclin D1 and CDK2 via the p27/pRb pathway. This approach has therapeutic advantage over mainstream anti-hypertrophic remedies which concomitantly reduce the regenerative prowess of resident cardiomyocytes during hypertrophy upon downregulation of myocyte apoptosis. Therefore, cardiomyocyte-targeted delivery of IKK gamma S-Nitrosyl mutants during hypertrophy can be exploited as a novel strategy to re-muscularize the diseased heart.

AB  - An excessive amount of fat deposition in the body leads to obesity which is a complex disease and poses a generic threat to human health. It increases the risk of various other diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and multiple types of cancer. Genomic studies have shown that the expression of the fat mass obesity (FTO) gene was highly altered and identified as one of the key biomarkers for obesity. This study has been undertaken to investigate the mutational profile of the FTO gene and elucidates its effect on the protein structure and function. Harmful effects of various missense mutations were predicted using different independent tools and it was observed that all mutations were highly pathogenic. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to study the structure and function of FTO protein upon different mutations and it was found that mutations decreased the structure stability and affected protein conformation. Furthermore, a protein residue network analysis suggested that the mutations affected the overall residues bonding and topology. Finally, molecular docking coupled with MD simulation suggested that mutations affected FTO substrate binding by changing the protein-ligand affinity. Hence, the results of this finding would help in an in-depth understanding of the molecular biology of the FTO gene and its variants and lead to the development of effective therapeutics against associated diseases and disorders.

AB  - Background and aims Limited data exist regarding outcomes of acute variceal bleeding (AVB) in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), especially in those with hepatic failure. We evaluated the outcomes of AVB in patients with ACLF in a multinational cohort of APASL ACLF Research Consortium (AARC). Methods Prospectively maintained data from AARC database on patients with ACLF who developed AVB (ACLF-AVB) was analysed. This data included demographic profile, severity of liver disease, and rebleeding and mortality in 6 weeks. These outcomes were compared with a propensity score matched (PSM) cohort of ACLF matched for severity of liver disease (MELD, AARC score) without AVB (ACLF without AVB). Results Of the 4434 ACLF patients, the outcomes in ACLF-AVB (n = 72) [mean age-46 +/- 10.4 years, 93% males, 66% with alcoholic liver disease, 65% with alcoholic hepatitis, AARC score: 10.1 +/- 2.2, MELD score: 34 (IQR: 27-40)] were compared with a PSM cohort selected in a ratio of 1:2 (n = 143) [mean age-44.9 +/- 12.5 years, 82.5% males, 48% alcoholic liver disease, 55.7% alcoholic hepatitis, AARC score: 9.4 +/- 1.5, MELD score: 32 (IQR: 24-40)] of ACLF-without AVB. Despite PSM, ACLF patients with AVB had a higher baseline HVPG than without AVB (25.00 [IQR: 23.00-28.00] vs. 17.00 [15.00-21.75] mmHg; p = 0.045). The 6-week mortality in ACLF patients with or without AVB was 70.8% and 53.8%, respectively (p = 0.025). The 6-week rebleeding rate was 23% in ACLF-AVB. Presence of ascites [hazard ratio (HR) 2.2 (95% CI 1.03-9.8), p = 0.026], AVB [HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-2.5, p = 0.03)], and MELD score [HR 1.7 (95% CI 1.1-2.1), p = 0.001] independently predicted mortality in the overall ACLF cohort. Conclusion Development of AVB confers poor outcomes in patients with ACLF with a high 6-week mortality. Elevated HVPG at baseline represents a potential risk factor for future AVB in ACLF.

AB  - Background The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year.
   Methods For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.
   Findings The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0.603 (0.400-1.00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0.002 (0-0) and 1.75 (0.698-4.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0.114 (0-0.403) to 1.87 (0.500-3.30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0.193 (0-0.900) and 6.94 (3.40-8.30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59.1% (54.3-65.4) were aged 15-39 years and 76.9% (73.0-81.3) were male.
   Interpretation There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Laparoscopic surgery has almost replaced open surgery in many areas of Gastro-Intestinal (GI) surgery. There is currently no published expert consensus statement on the principles of laparoscopic GI surgery. This may have affected the training of new surgeons. This exercise aimed to achieve an expert consensus on important principles of laparoscopic GI surgery. Methods: A committee of 38 international experts in laparoscopic GI surgery proposed and voted on 149 state-ments in two rounds following a strict modified Delphi protocol. Results: A consensus was achieved on 133 statements after two rounds of voting. All experts agreed on tailoring the first port site to the patient, whereas 84.2% advised avoiding the umbilical area for pneumoperitoneum in patients who had a prior midline laparotomy. Moreover, 86.8% agreed on closing all 15 mm ports irrespective of the patient's body mass index. There was a 100% consensus on using cartridges of appropriate height for stapling, checking the doughnuts after using circular staplers, and keeping the vibrating blade of the ultrasonic energy device in view and away from vascular structures. An 84.2% advised avoiding drain insertion through a >= 10 mm port site as it increases the risk of port-site hernia.There was 94.7% consensus on adding laparoscopic retrieval bags to the operating count and ensuring any surgical specimen left inside for later removal is added to the operating count. Conclusion: Thirty-eight experts achieved a consensus on 133 statements concerning various aspects of laparo-scopic GI Surgery. Increased awareness of these could facilitate training and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Background: Various controversial practices in the management of Esophageal atresia-tracheoesophageal fistula (EA-TEF) can be noticed among pediatric surgeons. Routine intraoperative chest drain (IOCD) in-sertion is often debated and lacks any concrete evidence. This meta-analysis aims to compare the post-operative outcomes among newborns with and without IOCD insertion.
   Methods: The authors searched EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science on 30th April 2021. The requirement for chest drain in the postoperative period (POCD), anastomotic leak (and/or pneumotho-rax), mortality rate, and revisit(s) to the operation room (RVOR) were compared among two groups of newborns, i.e. groups A and B with and without IOCD insertion respectively. The statistical analysis was performed using a fixed-effects model. The pooled risk ratio (RR) and heterogeneity (I 2 ) were calculated. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Downs and Black scale.
   Results: A total of 498 newborns were included in the present analysis. As compared to group B, new-borns within group A showed no significant difference in the requirement for POCD (RR 2.47; 95% CI 0.88-6.98, p = 0.09), the occurrence of anastomotic leak and/or pneumothorax (RR 1.35; 95% CI 0.89-2.06, p = 0.16), and mortality rate (RR 2.24; 95% CI 0.81-6.26, p = 0.12). However, RVOR was significantly higher in group A (RR 1.75; 95% CI 1.07-2.87, p = 0.03). All included studies had a moderate risk of bias.
   Conclusions: The present meta-analysis revealed no additional benefit of prophylactic IOCD insertion. However, due to moderate risk of bias, further studies need to be conducted for an optimal comparison between the two groups. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cancer is emerging as a major public health challenge globally. Recently, IARC (International Association of Research on Cancer) published global cancer burden using GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates for 36 cancers in 185 countries of the world. As per the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019, cancer is the first or second leading cause of death in 112 of 183 countries. The major takeaways of the GLOBOCAN 2020 report relevant to the surgical oncology community include the rising global burden of cancer, global disparity in cancer incidence and mortality in different geographic regions, and the impact of the human development index (HDI) on cancer incidence and projected global cancer burden by 2040. In this article, we discuss the implications of the GLOBOCAN report on future global cancer control strategies and the role of surgical oncologists in the fight against cancer.

AB  - Objectives Unbiased and full disclosure of trial results is vital to evidence-based medicine. Non-publication and selective publication leads to publication bias and unrealistic risk-benefit ratio. In the present study, we aim to determine the publication rate of clinical trials related to neurology registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI), compare the characteristics of published and unpublished trials, and evaluate the adherence of investigators to ethics-approved criteria and outcomes. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional search using the keyword "neurology" was carried out in CTRI registry. Two independent investigators searched Pubmed, Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar for published manuscripts. The final literature search occurred in November 2021. Results Out of 325 trials, 102 trials were published (31.4%). Ninety-one trials were beyond 3 years of expected time of trial completion and were still unpublished. Randomized trials had a slightly higher publication rate than non-randomized ones (56% vs. 46%, p = .223); however the difference was not statistically significant. Majority of trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were not published, while majority of those sponsored by non-pharmaceutical institutions were published (34.5% vs. 69.3%, p < .001). Feedback to CTRI about trial status was particularly poor (31.5% - informed vs. 68.5% - not informed, p < .001). 52 (50.9%) and 65 (63.7%) of the 102 published trials had changed the registered inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively, in the CTRI registry compared to those in the published manuscript. In 29 (28.3%) of the 102 trials, the primary outcome did not match with that registered in the CTRI and in 73 (57.8%) trials, the secondary outcomes did not match. Conclusion A large proportion of neurology registered trials are still unpublished, with a majority of pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials not being published. There is scope for improving the provisions in CTRI for enlisting trial results, that may prevent publication bias and also ensure the investigators adhere to the pre-specified ethics approved trial procedures and outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: Although unexpected airway difficulties are reported in patients with mucormycosis, the literature on airway management in patients with mucormycosis associated with Coronavirus disease is sparse.Methods: In this retrospective case record review of 57 patients who underwent surgery for mucormycosis associated with coronavirus disease, we aimed to evaluate the demographics, airway management, proce-dural data, and in-hospital mortality records. Results: Forty-one (71.9%) patients had a diagnosis of sino-nasal mucormycosis, fourteen (24.6%) patients had a diagnosis of rhino-orbital mucormycosis, and 2 (3.5%) patients had a diagnosis of palatal mucormycosis. A total of 44 (77.2%) patients had co-morbidities. The most common co-morbidities were diabetes mellitus in 42 (73.6%) patients, followed by hypertension in 21 (36.8%) patients, and acute kidney injury in 14 (28.1%) patients. We used the intubation difficulty scale score to assess intubating conditions. Intubation was easy to slightly difficult in 53 (92.9%) patients. In our study, mortality occurred in 7 (12.3%) patients. The median (range) mortality time was 60 (27-74) days. The median (range) time to hospital discharge was 53.5 (10 -85) days. The median [interquartile range] age of discharged versus expired patients was 47.5 [41,57.5] ver-sus 64 [47,70] years (P = 0.04), and median (interquartile range) D-dimer levels in discharged versus expired patients was 364 [213, 638] versus 2448 [408,3301] ng/mL (P = 0.03).Conclusion: In patients undergoing surgery for mucormycosis associated with the coronavirus disease, airway management was easy to slightly difficult in most patients. Perioperative complications can be minimized by taking timely and precautionary measures.(c) 2022 SFMM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms comprise a heterogeneous group of tumors that differ in their pathogenesis, hormonal syndromes produced, biological behavior and consequently, in their requirement for and/or response to specific chemotherapeutic agents and molecular targeted therapies. Various imaging techniques are available for functional and morphological evaluation of these neoplasms and the selection of investigations performed in each patient should be customized to the clinical question. Also, with the increased availability of cross sectional imaging, these neoplasms are increasingly being detected incidentally in routine radiology practice. This article is a review of the various imaging modalities currently used in the evaluation of neuroendocrine neoplasms, along with a discussion of the role of advanced imaging techniques and a glimpse into the newer imaging horizons, mostly in the research stage.

AB  - Purpose Withdrawal of thiopurines after remission is associated with an increased risk of relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, long-term data on thiopurine withdrawal is limited, especially from developing countries where the cost of long-term therapy poses a significant burden on patients.
   Methods Patients with IBD on thiopurine monotherapy for >= 4 months, who stopped thiopurines while in clinical remission and were not on any other immunomodulator or biologics at the time of withdrawal, were included in this retrospective analysis.
   Results Among 1093 patients with IBD on thiopurine monotherapy, 461 patients stopped thiopurine due to various reasons. Among these, 218 (ulcerative colitis (UC) = 179; Crohn's disease (CD) = 39) patients were in clinical remission and were continued on mesalamine. Overall, 36.7% (n = 80) relapsed after a median duration of 20 months (IQR: 9-49). Relapse rate was higher in UC than CD (39.7% vs 23%, p = 0.055). Cumulative probabilities of relapse were 17%, 34%, and 44% at the end of 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. The relapse rate at 5 years was significantly lower in patients who had stopped azathioprine after 4 years of therapy (31% vs 54%, p = 0.007). On multi-variate cox regression analysis, male sex [HR: 1.6(1.0-2.6), p = 0.02] and short duration of therapy with thiopurines [HR: 1.02 (1.01-1.02), p = 0.004] before withdrawal were associated with increased risk of relapse.
   Conclusion Approximately 50% patients with IBD in remission would relapse after 5 years of thiopurine withdrawal. Male sex and shorter treatment duration predict relapse. Treatment should be continued in patients who tolerate and maintain remission on long-term thiopurine.

AB  - At early stages, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is quite hard to be distinguished from healthy (HC) subjects by the naked eye. AIS demands multiple corrective surgeries when detected later, thereby causing significant physical and psychological trauma as no mathe-matical models exist for the classification of mild AIS (MS) (20 degrees < Cobb's angle <40 degrees) from HC, we propose a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) method based model. In this work, we collected both the EMG and GRF data from nine severe AIS (SS), three MS and four female HC during gait. Delayed muscle activation in Erector spinatus Iliocostalis, Gluteus Medius and Gastroc-nemius lateralis was observed in SS compared to HC. However, no such distinction was noticed between MS and HC motivating for a mathematical model. Eighteen time-domain and nine frequency-domain features were computed from the EMG data of 14 lower extrem-ity muscles, while five time-domain features were calculated from GRF data during gait. Out of all the features computed for each subject, the principal component analysis (PCA) yielded 15 principal components that coupled both time and frequency domains (TFD). Further, the kNN model classified SS, MS and HC from each other by these 15 TFD features. The model was trained and validated using 32 and 21 EMG and GRF data datasets during gait, respectively. The classification and validation accuracy of 90.6% and 85.7% were obtained among SS, MS and HC. The proposed model is capable of early detection of AIS and can be used by medical professionals to plan treatments and corrective measures.(c) 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background: The ankle and foot are among the most critical load-bearing joints in the human anatomy. Anatomically accurate human body models are imperative to understanding the mechanics of injury and musculoskeletal disorders. A typical human ankle-foot anatomy consists of 25 DOFs, 112 dense connective tissues (DCTs) (92 ligaments, one capsule and 19 fasciae), 30 tendons, and 65 muscles. Existing models possess less than half of the DOFs and physiological elements. In this work, we have developed an ankle -foot joint complex musculoskeletal model for the OpenSim (R) platform by incorporating 24 degrees of freedom (DOF) comprising of 66 DCTs (46 ligaments, one 1 capsule and 19 fasciae), 30 tendons, and 65 muscles.Methods: Computed tomography (CT) data of human ankle joint-foot complex was segmented using Mimics (R) (Version 17.0, Materialise, Belgium) to obtain models of the cartilages and bones of the an-kle joint-foot complex. The position and resting lengths of the DCTs were attained from the MRI data and literature. Five joints, namely, tibiotalar, subtalar, chopart, tarsometatarsal (TMT), and metatarsopha-langeal (MTP) joints and their joint axes were formulated to yield 24 DOFs. A forward simulation was carried out at each joint of the ankle-foot complex within their respective range of motions. The strains, instantaneous strain rates, and forces developed in the ligaments during the simulation were studied. Results: During plantar-dorsiflexion of the tibiotalar joint, the anterior tibio-talar ligament (aTTL) yielded the maximum strain compared to all other ligaments. Anterior tibio-fibular ligament (aTFL) experienced extreme strain during subtalar inversion. Hence, the coupled kinematics of subtalar inversion and plantar flexion are failure-prone activities for aTFL. The chopart, TMT, and MTP joints yielded maximum strains or forces for several bundles at the extremes of the range of motion. This signifies that rotations of these joints to their extreme range of motion are prone to failure for the bundles attached to the joint complex.Conclusion: The results illustrate the potential application of the proposed OpenSim (R) ankle-foot model in understanding the ligament injury mechanism during sports activity and its prevention. Researchers can use the proposed model or customise it to study complex kinematics, understanding injury mechanisms, testing fixtures, orthosis or prosthesis, and many more in the domain of musculoskeletal research.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This systematic review was planned to assess the clinical outcomes of transport distraction osteogenesis (TDO) compared with autogenous grafts for reconstruction of the ramus condyle unit (RCU). We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrial.gov, and the references of included trials. The primary outcome was maximal incisal opening (MIO). Of the 148 studies retrieved, five were included (TDO = 49, autogenous grafts =123). The mean difference in MIO between TDO and autogenous graft RCU reconstruction, based on the random-effects model was 1.28 mm (95% CI 0.167 to 2.403) in favour of TDO. Re-ankyosis was observed in four cases in the costochondral graft group and none in the TDO group. Reconstruction of the RCU using TDO is comparable to autogenous grafts after the release of TMJ ankylosis, though the evidence is weak considering the small number of trials, high risk of bias, and absence of long-term results.

AB  - The epidemiology of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Mp) is poorly understood in India. The present study was conducted to identify the prevalence of Mp in a large set of patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in an Indian tertiary hospital. During 2015-2020, we tested throat swab specimens from patients with the clinical diagnosis of ARI (n = 1,098) by a real-time PCR and compared the demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data of Mp-positive and Mp-negative patients. During the study period, 5% (55/1,098) of the tested samples were positive for Mp by PCR. School-aged children and young adults represented 36% (20/55) of the cases and 47.3% (26/55) of the cases were registered during the summer and monsoon. Among the Mp-positive patients, 61.8% (34/55) had underlying conditions; the most common were malignancy (n = 12; 21.8%) and hypertension (n = 6; 10.9%). Fever (98.2% versus 84.9%; P = 0.006), and pharyngitis (27.3% versus 16.3%; P = 0.034) were significantly common in the Mp-positive group than Mp-negative group. Among the Mp-positive group, 20% (11/55) of patients were admitted to an intensive care unit and a total of 7/55 (12.7%) patients received ventilatory support. The mortality in the Mp-positive cohort was 13.3%. The study provides baseline data regarding Mp prevalence and clinical characteristics. The application of molecular assays for diagnosing this pathogen among hospitalized patients with ARI could reduce inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment and improve patient outcomes. Further large-scale studies are required to avoid the underdiagnosis of Mp infections in India and such studies should address some research gaps, such as macrolide resistance and molecular typing.
   IMPORTANCE M. pneumoniae (Mp) is a significant pathogen causing atypical pneumonia but by far these infections are underreported clinical entities in India. In the present study, we report the prevalence of Mp and describe the demographic and baseline clinical data of Mp-positive cases in an Indian tertiary care hospital. Our study may improve the clinician's awareness of this important agent of respiratory infection therefore timely and accurate diagnostic tools can be applied for patient management decisions and outcomes.

TI  - Persistence of immunity and impact of third dose of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine against emerging variants
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - SARS-COV-2
AB  - This is a comprehensive report on immunogenicity of COVAXIN (R) booster dose against ancestral and Variants of Concern (VOCs) up to 12 months. It is well known that neutralizing antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines wane within 6 months of vaccination leading to questions on the effectiveness of two-dose vaccination against breakthrough infections. Therefore, we assessed the persistence of immunogenicity up to 6 months after a two or three-dose with BBV152 and the safety of a booster dose in an ongoing phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04471519). We report persistence of humoral and cell mediated immunity up to 12 months of vaccination, despite decline in the magnitude of antibody titers. Administration of a third dose of BBV152 increased neutralization titers against both homologous (D614G) and heterologous strains (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Delta Plus and Omicron) with a slight increase in B cell memory responses. Thus, seronversion rate remain high in boosted recipients compared to non-booster, even after 6 months, post third dose against variants. No serious adverse events observed, except pain at the injection site, itching and redness. Hence, these results indicate that a booster dose of BBV152 is safe and necessary to ensure persistent immunity to minimize breakthrough infections of COVID-19, due to newly emerging variants.

AB  - Objective Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) population-based BRCA testing is acceptable, cost-effective and amplifies primary prevention for breast & ovarian cancer. However, data describing lifestyle impact are lacking. We report long-term results of population-based BRCA testing on lifestyle behaviour and cancer risk perception. Design Two-arm randomised controlled trials (ISRCTN73338115, GCaPPS): (a) population-screening (PS); (b) family history (FH)/clinical criteria testing. Setting North London AJ-population. Population/Sample AJ women/men >18 years. Exclusions: prior BRCA testing or first-degree relatives of BRCA-carriers. Methods Participants were recruited through self-referral. All participants received informed pre-test genetic counselling. The intervention included genetic testing for three AJ BRCA-mutations: 185delAG(c.68_69delAG), 5382insC(c.5266dupC) and 6174delT(c.5946delT). This was undertaken for all participants in the PS arm and participants fulfilling FH/clinical criteria in the FH arm. Patients filled out customised/validated questionnaires at baseline/1-year/2-year/3-year follow-ups. Generalised linear-mixed models adjusted for covariates and appropriate contrast tests were used for between-group/within-group analysis of lifestyle and behavioural outcomes along with evaluating factors associated with these outcomes. Outcomes are adjusted for multiple testing (Bonferroni method), with P < 0.0039 considered significant. Outcome measures Lifestyle/behavioural outcomes at baseline/1-year/2-year/3-year follow-ups. Results 1034 participants were randomised to PS (n = 530) or FH (n = 504) arms. No significant difference was identified between PS- and FH-based BRCA testing approaches in terms of dietary fruit/vegetable/meat consumption, vitamin intake, alcohol quantity/ frequency, smoking behaviour (frequency/cessation), physical activity/exercise or routine breast mammogram screening behaviour, with outcomes not affected by BRCA test result. Cancer risk perception decreased with time following BRCA testing, with no difference between FH/PS approaches, and the perception of risk was lowest in BRCA-negative participants. Men consumed fewer fruits/vegetables/vitamins and more meat/alcohol than women (P < 0.001). Conclusion Population-based and FH-based AJ BRCA testing have similar long-term lifestyle impacts on smoking, alcohol, dietary fruit/vegetable/meat/vitamin, exercise, breast screening participation and reduced cancer risk perception.

AB  - Objective To estimate the prevalence and determinants of hypertension among adolescents in a rural area in North India. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among community-dwelling adolescents (10-19 y) and defined blood pressure as per the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2017 criteria. A pretested, semistructured questionnaire was used to elicit sociodemographic details and risk factors of hypertension. Association of factors with hypertension, z scores of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were assessed by logistic and linear regression. In multivariable regression model, for both logistic and linear regression, variables with p value < 0.2 were included, excluding collinear variables. Results Eight hundred sixty-four adolescents participated with mean (SD) age, BMI of 14.0 +/- 2.6 y, 18.3 +/- 3.5 kg/m(2). Hypertension prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 19.7, 25.5) as per AAP and 15.2% (95% CI: 12.9, 17.8) as per NHBPEP criteria. Being hypertensive as per the AAP was associated with family history of noncommunicable disease (NCD) (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.86) and BMI (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14), and as per the NHBPEP, was only associated with BMI (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.17). SBP z score was significantly associated with male sex (adjusted beta coefficient AC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.90), and weight z scores (AC = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 3.28); DBP z score was significantly associated with z scores of height (AC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.96) and waist (AC = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.30). Conclusion The prevalence of hypertension among adolescents was high and was associated with BMI and family history of NCD.

AB  - Objective Commercially available suction devices are expensive, large and heavy, and need electricity, and thus restrict the outdoor activity of tracheostomised children and their carers. This study evaluated the efficacy and usability of a simple suction assembly using a syringe and feeding tube in paediatric tracheostomised patients. Methods Following the domiciliary usage of this suction assembly instead of their existing suction device for a minimum of 15 days, carers responded to a set of questionnaires containing a subjective scoring system. Results Ninety-three per cent of the carers considered this assembly as average, good or very good in cleaning the tracheostomy tube. Eighty per cent of the carers considered that this assembly would be suitable when their existing suction machines are unavailable, indicating high usability, and 66.67 per cent of the carers would be confident using this assembly in outdoor settings. Conclusion Larger studies with objective evaluation methods can validate the high efficacy of this simple, inexpensive and easy-to-use, hand-held suction apparatus as reported by the carers of 15 paediatric tracheostomised patients in this study.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Yoga nidra is a technique sages use to self-induce sleep. Classically, sleep is characterized by three cardinal electrophysiological features, namely, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG). As the literature on electrophysiological characterization of Yoga nidra is lacking, it is not known whether it is a sleep or awake state. The objective of the study was to electrophysiologically characterize yoga nidra practice. Materials and Methods: Thirty subjects underwent five initial supervised yoga nidra sessions and then continued practice on their own. The subjects completed their sleep diaries for 2 weeks before and during the intervention. The electrophysiological characterization was done after 2 weeks of yoga nidra practice using 19 EEG channels polysomnography for pre-yoga nidra, yoga nidra practice and post-yoga nidra. Polysomnographic data were scored for sleep-wake stages as per standard criteria. Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated from various frequency bands in different time bins. EEG data were grouped by areas, namely, central, frontal, prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital in time bins. Sleep diary parameters were also compared for pre-post-yoga nidra training. Results: After 2 weeks of yoga nidra practice, awake was scored throughout the session (n = 26). PSD results (mean difference in dB between different time bins; P value) showed significant changes. When compared to pre-yoga nidra, there was an increase in delta power in the central area (1.953; P = 0.033) and a decrease in the prefrontal area (2.713; P = 0.041) during yoga nidra. Sleep diary showed improvement in sleep duration (P = 0.0001), efficiency (P = 0.0005), quality (P = 0.0005), and total wake duration (P = 0.00005) after 2 weeks of practice. Interpretations and Conclusions: Yoga nidra practice in novices is electrophysiologically an awake state with signs of slow waves locally, often referred to as local sleep.

AB  - Radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAIR-DTC), though uncommon, presents a considerable therapeutic challenge with poor long-term outcomes. Currently, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the mainstay of treatment for advanced RAIR-DTC patients. However, these agents are associated with a multitude of adverse events with resultant deterioration in the quality-of-life of the patients. Targeted theranostic approaches with radiolabelled integrin binders and fibroblast activation protein- (FAP)-inhibitors seem to have a promising role in the management of such patients. This mini-review focuses on these novel theranostic strategies in RAIR-DTC, with emphasis on recent advances, existing challenges, and future directions.

AB  - Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and its severe form Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are the major cause of ICU death worldwide. ALI/ARDS is characterized by severe hyp-oxemia and inflammation that leads to poor lung compliance. Despite many advances in under -standing and management, ALI/ARDS is still causing significant morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) is a fast-growing topic in lung inflammation and injury. lncRNA is a class of non-coding RNA having a length of more than 200 nucleotides. It has been a center of research for understanding the pathophysiology of various diseases in the past few years. Multiple studies have shown that lncRNAs are abundant in acute lung injury/injuries in mouse models and cell lines. By targeting these long non-coding RNAs, many investigators have demonstrated the alleviation of ALI in various mouse models. Therefore, lncRNAs show great promise as a therapeutic target in ALI. This review provides the current state of knowledge about the relationship between lncRNAs in various biological processes in acute lung injury and its use as a potential therapeutic target.Copyright (c) 2021, Chongqing Medical University.

AB  - Objective To evaluate metabolic and genetic abnormalities in children with nephrolithiasis attending a referral center in North India. Methods The patients aged 1-18 y old with nephrolithiasis underwent biochemical evaluation and whole-exome sequencing. The authors evaluated for monogenic variants in 56 genes and compared allele frequency of 39 reported polymorphisms between patients and 1739 controls from the GenomeAsia 100 K database. Results Fifty-four patients, aged 9.1 +/- 3.7 y were included. Stones were bilateral in 42.6%, familial in 33.3%, and recurrent in 25.9%. The most common metabolic abnormalities were hypercalciuria (35.2%), hyperoxaluria (24.1%), or both (11.1%), while xanthinuria (n = 3), cystinuria (n = 1), and hyperuricosuria (n = 1) were rare. Exome sequencing identified an etiology in 6 (11.1%) patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic causative variants. Three variants in MOCOS and one in ATP7B were pathogenic; likely pathogenic variants included MOCOS (n = 2), AGXT, and SLC7A9 (n = 1, each). Causality was not attributed to two SLC34A1 likely pathogenic variants, due to lack of matching phenotype and dominant family history. Compared to controls, allele frequency of the polymorphism TRPV5 rs4252402 was significantly higher in familial stone disease (allele frequency 0.47 versus 0.53; OR 3.2, p = 0.0001). Conclusion The chief metabolic abnormalities were hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria. A monogenic etiology was identified in 11% with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants using a gene panel for nephrolithiasis. Heterozygous missense variants in the sodium-phosphate cotransporter SLC34A1 were common and required evaluation for attributing pathogenicity. Rare polymorphisms in TRPV5 might increase the risk of familial stones. These findings suggest that a combination of metabolic and genetic evaluation is useful for determining the etiology of nephrolithiasis.

AB  - Shock is one of the major killers in intensive care units, and early interventions can potentially reverse it. In this study, we advance a noncontact thermal imaging modality for continuous monitoring of hemodynamic shock working on 1,03,936 frames from 406 videos recorded longitudinally upon 22 pediatric patients. Deep learning was used to preprocess and extract the Center-to-Peripheral Difference (CPD) in temperature values from the videos. This time-series data along with the heart rate was finally analyzed using Long-Short Term Memory models to predict the shock status up to the next 6 h. Our models achieved the best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 +/- 0.06 and area under the precision-recall curve of 0.78 +/- 0.05 at 5 h, providing sufficient time to stabilize the patient. Our approach, thus, provides a reliable shock prediction using an automated decision pipeline that can provide better care and save lives.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with poorly defined environmental influences. Genomic studies of PD patients have identified disease-relevant monogenic genes, rare variants of significance, and polygenic risk-associated variants. In this study, whole genome sequencing data from 90 young onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) individuals are analyzed for both monogenic and polygenic risk. The genetic variant analysis identifies pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in eight of the 90 individuals (8.8%). It includes large homozygous coding exon deletions in PRKN and SNV/InDels in VPS13C, PLA2G6, PINK1, SYNJ1, and GCH1. Eleven rare heterozygous GBA coding variants are also identified in 13 (14.4%) individuals. In 34 (56.6%) individuals, one or more variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in PD/PD-relevant genes are observed. Though YOPD patients with a prioritized pathogenic variant show a low polygenic risk score (PRS), patients with prioritized VUS or no significant rare variants show an increased PRS odds ratio for PD. This study suggests that both significant rare variants and polygenic risk from common variants together may contribute to the genesis of PD. Further validation using a larger cohort of patients will confirm the interplay between monogenic and polygenic variants and their use in routine genetic PD diagnosis and risk assessment.

AB  - We report a novel Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) immunosensor for sensitive detection of whole cell H. pylori, a causative organism for gastric carcinoma. Highly fluorescent and well-dispersed functionalized carbon dots (FCDs) were synthesized and chemically conjugated with anti-H. pylori antibody to fabricate a fluorescent probe (FCDs-Ab). The fluorescence of FCDs-Ab gets quenched upon interaction with graphene oxide (GO), whereas in presence of H. pylori, the interaction between the FCD-Ab and GO gets interrupted and gradual restoration of fluorescence was observed due to the specific affinity and binding of Ab towards H. pylori. The immunosensor was characterized at each step of fabrication. The assay exhibits a linear detection range of 5-107 cells mL-1 with limit of detection (LOD) of 10 cells mL-1 with high specificity and selectivity to target pathogen. The analytical performance of the developed immunosensor was evaluated with different spiked food samples and the substantial recovery validates its potential for risk assessment in food testing, thus ensuring general safety of public health.

AB  - Background: Statins and aspirin have been proposed for treatment of COVID-19 because of their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Several observational studies have shown favourable results. There is a need for a randomised controlled trial.
   Methods: In this single-center, open-label, randomised controlled trial, 900 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalisation, were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 40 mg (Group A, n = 224), aspirin 75 mg (Group B, n = 225), or both (Group C, n = 225) in addition to standard of care for 10 days or until discharge whichever was earlier or only standard of care (Group D, n = 226). The primary outcome variable was clinical deterioration to WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement >= 6. The secondary outcome was change in serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and troponin I.
   Results: The primary outcome occurred in 25 (2.8%) patients: 7 (3.2%) in Group A, 3 (1.4%) in Group B, 8 (3.6%) in Group C, and 7 (3.2%) in Group D. There was no difference in primary outcome across the study groups (P = 0.463). Comparison of all patients who received atorvastatin or aspirin with the control group (Group D) also did not show any benefit [Atorvastatin: HR 1.0 (95% CI 0.41-2.46) P = 0.99; Aspirin: HR 0.7 (95% CI 0.27-1.81) P = 0.46]. The secondary outcomes revealed lower serum interleukin-6 levels among patients in Groups B and C. There was no excess of adverse events.
   Conclusions: Among patients admitted with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, additional treatment with aspirin, atorvastatin, or a combination of the two does not prevent clinical deterioration.

AB  - Objectives Limited treatment options are available for advanced stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Moreover, patients' relapse after a short remission period, which prompts them to identify a potent drug with the least toxicity. An Unani herbal formulation, Itrifal-e-Aftimoon (IEA) is used for certain neurological disorders, however, its antitumor potential has not been reported yet in any malignancy, including CML. Methods The aqueous extract of IEA was characterized by HPLC/LC-MS and used alone or in combination with standard drug, imatinib in CML cell lines (K562, KU812) in vitro to assess its effect on cancer-associated parameters such as cytotoxicity, cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, angiogenesis, and certain signalling pathways. Results LC-MS characterization of IEA showed the presence of antitumor compounds including catechin and caffeic acid. Treatment with IEA caused cytotoxicity and arrested cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase. Subsequent assays confirmed apoptosis-mediated cell death with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and alleviation of oxidative stress. IEA abrogates IL-6, VEGF, angiopoietin-2, and alters Th1/Th2 cytokines. IEA potentiated the effect of imatinib even at lower doses by affecting FAK/STAT/Akt/ERK pathways. Conclusion IEA possesses antitumor potential against CML and increases the efficacy of imatinib when used in combination, suggesting utilization of IEA as an adjuvant therapy for better management of CML in the future.

AB  - A regio and stereoselective synthesis of a new class of spirooxindolopyrrolidine embedded indandione heterocycles was obtained in excellent yield employing a three-component cascade reaction protocol. The key step for this protocol is a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction involving azomethine ylide generated in situ from isatin and L-phenylalanine. The structure of newly synthesized compound was assigned based on the NMR spectroscopic analysis and the stereo/regiochemistry was undoubtable assigned by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. Further, the structural determination of the compound was assigned through density functional theory (DFT) and Hirshfeld surface analysis. It is found that the compound was highly stabilized by intermolecular interactions such as X-H-H-X (X = C and O) and also by hydro-gen bonding interaction.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Diversion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been used for decades as a treatment for children with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is recommended by evidenced-based guidelines. However, these recommendations are based on limited studies.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether CSF diversion is associated with improved Glasgow Outcome Score-Extended for Pediatrics (GOS-EP) and decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) in children with severe TBI.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This observational comparative effectiveness study was performed at 51 clinical centers that routinely care for children with severe TBI in 8 countries (US, United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India) from February 2014 to September 2017, with follow-up at 6 months after injury (final follow-up, October 22, 2021). Children with severe TBI were included if they had Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 8 or lower, had intracranial pressure (ICP) monitor placed on-site, and were aged younger than 18 years. Children were excluded if they were pregnant or an ICP monitor was not placed at the study site. Consecutive children were screened and enrolled, data regarding treatments were collected, and at discharge, consent was obtained for outcomes testing. Propensity matching for pretreatment characteristics was performed to develop matched pairs for primary analysis. Data analyses were completed on April 18, 2022.
   EXPOSURES Clinical care followed local standards, including the use of CSF diversion (or not), with patients stratified at the time of ICP monitor placement (CSF group vs no CSF group).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was GOS-EP at 6 months, while ICP was considered as a secondary outcome. CSF vs no CSFwas treated as an intention-to-treat analysis, and a sensitivity analysis was performed for children who received delayed CSF diversion.
   RESULTS A total of 1000 children with TBI were enrolled, including 314 who received CSF diversion (mean [SD] age, 7.18 [5.45] years; 208 [66.2%] boys) and 686 who did not (mean [SD] age, 7.79 [5.33] years; 437 [63.7%] boys). The propensity-matched analysis included 98 pairs. In propensity score-matched analyses, there was no difference between groups in GOS-EP (median [IQR] difference, 0 [-3 to 1]; P =.08), but there was a decrease in overall ICP in the CSF group (mean [SD] difference, 3.97 [0.12] mmHg; P <.001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this comparative effectiveness study, CSF diversion was not associated with improved outcome at 6 months after TBI, but a decrease in ICP was observed. Given the higher quality of evidence generated by this study, current evidence-based guidelines related to CSF diversion should be reconsidered.

TI  - Ultra-high resolution, multi-scale, context-aware approach for detection of small cancers on mammography
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - BREAST-CANCER
AB  - While detection of malignancies on mammography has received a boost with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), detection of cancers of very small size remains challenging. This is however clinically significant as the purpose of mammography is early detection of cancer, making it imperative to pick them up when they are still very small. Mammography has the highest spatial resolution (image sizes as high as 3328 x 4096 pixels) out of all imaging modalities, a requirement that stems from the need to detect fine features of the smallest cancers on screening. However due to computational constraints, most state of the art CNNs work on reduced resolution images. Those that work on higher resolutions, compromise on global context and work at single scale. In this work, we show that resolution, scale and image-context are all important independent factors in detection of small masses. We thereby use a fully convolutional network, with the ability to take any input size. In addition, we incorporate a systematic multi-scale, multi-resolution approach, and encode image context, which we show are critical factors to detection of small masses. We show that this approach improves the detection of cancer, particularly for small masses in comparison to the baseline model. We perform a single institution multicentre study, and show the performance of the model on a diagnostic mammography dataset, a screening mammography dataset, as well as a curated dataset of small cancers < 1 cm in size. We show that our approach improves the sensitivity from 61.53 to 87.18% at 0.3 False Positives per Image (FPI) on this small cancer dataset.

AB  - Globally, populations are ageing and the estimated number of hip fractures will increase from 1.7 million in 1990 to more than 6 million in 2050. The greatest increase in hip fractures is predicted in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs), largely in the Asia-Pacific region where direct costs are expected to exceed $US15 billion by 2050. The aims of this qualitative study are to identify barriers to, and enablers of, evidence-informed hip fracture care in LMICs, and to determine if the Blue Book standards, developed by the British Orthopaedic Association and British Geriatrics Society to facilitate evidence-informed care of patients with fragility fractures, are applicable to these settings. This study utilized semi-structured interviews with clinical and administrative hospital staff to explore current hip fracture care in LMICs. Transcribed interviews were imported into NVivo 12 and analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted with 35 participants from 11 hospitals in 5 countries. We identified five themes-costs of care and the capacity of patients to pay, timely hospital presentation, competing demands on limited resources, delegation and defined responsibility and utilization of available data-and within each theme, barriers and enablers were distinguished. We found a mismatch between patient needs and provision of recommended hip fracture care, which in LMICs must commence at the time of injury. This study describes clinician and administrator perspectives of the barriers to, and enablers of, high-quality hip fracture care in LMICs; results indicate that initiatives to overcome barriers (in particular, delays to definitive treatment) are required. While the Blue Book offers a starting point for clinicians and administrators looking to provide high-quality hip fracture care to older people in LMICs, locally developed interventions are likely to provide the most successful solutions to improving hip fracture care.

AB  - Purpose: We report findings from a survey on the mental health impact of COVID-19 factoring environmental adversities among older adolescents (15-19 years) living in urban slums in India.Methods: We report survey results of 3490 older adolescents. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression, slum adversity questionnaire for slum conditions, and for COVID-19 infection we recorded self -reported positivity status. Sociodemographic details were also collected. Additional sub-group analyses of sample who had depression and tested positive for COVID-19 infection was conducted. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors and COVID-19 infection that were associated with depression.Results: Adolescents with adversities were three times more likely to report depression. Adolescents who reported COVID-19 infection were about two times more likely to have depression. Sub-group analyses showed that ad-olescents having experienced adversities and girls were more likely to report depression following COVID-19 infection.Conclusions: There is a need for an intersectional research framework that incorporates stress arising out of a pandemic, social disadvantage, and systemic inequities. Such a framework will help to assess mental health issues of developmentally vulnerable groups residing in disadvantageous conditions.

AB  - Early detection of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a serious issue for the healthcare system. It is essential to develop potential non-invasive, low-cost molecular biomarkers. The present study explored specific serum proteins of inflammatory, MAPK, and cytoskeletal signaling pathways involved in the progression of MBC to establish a panel of blood-based diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Healthy-control (HC), non-metastatic (NM), and metastatic (M) (pre- and post-therapy) breast cancer (BC) patients were recruited. LOX5, Rac1, Rac1b, p38 alpha, phospho-p38 alpha (Y182), LIMK1, phospho-LIMK1 (T508), cofilin1, and phospho-cofilin1 (S3) were quantified in the serum of the study group by real-time label-free surface plasmon resonance technology and verified by Western blot. Proteins were found to be significantly elevated in the serum of BC patients compared to HC and also higher in M compared to NM, which further downregulated in post-therapy M patients. Elevation of phospho-LIMK1 and phospho-cofilin1, which are critical for M, was also indicated in the serum level and can differentiate from NM. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) derived area under the curve (AUC) (0.9) is very strong to differentiate between HC and BC. Moreover, the combined ROC of 3 molecules phospho-LIMK, p38 alpha, and phospho-p38 alpha were found to be a potent predictive panel of biomarkers between M and NM with AUC0.95. The panel of inflammatory cytoskeleton signaling regime proteins specified in this study can have significant clinical utility for diagnosis as well as prognosis of MBC at an early stage. The study may have a high translational value in a simple and cost-effective way by avoiding frequent CT/PET scans.

AB  - PurposeStudies have reported that knowledge and skills to operate smartphones among people with profound visual loss are limited especially in low- to middle-income countries as many important functions of smartphones are unknown to them. This report presents smartphone use, its challenges, and enablers in two persons with profound visual impairment while executing their daily routine and instrumental living activities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Case selection and interviewDuring the lockdown period, we provided tele (vision) rehabilitation service. From the list of the callers, we purposely selected two callers with significant visual impairment, one woman and one man, to allow us to gather rich information related to smartphone use, enablers, and challenges faced during the usage. A semistructured interview was done to obtain insights into the information. The selection criteria were (1) continuous smartphone use independently for more than 5 years; (2) graduation-level education or higher; and (3) no additional disabilities. DiscussionWe found substantial use of smartphones in executing their daily and instrumental daily living activities by these two participants. The extent of the use of mainstream apps for various tasks was almost equivalent to what we observed among sighted persons. The most important enabling factors were the presence of a screen reader "TalkBack" on Android phones and data connection of the mobile, followed by the ability to assess multiple languages using the text-to-speech feature. A supportive environment from peers or family members is important for the beginner. Poor battery backup, frequent unwanted ads or pop-ups while using the phone, not readable contents with a screen reader, e.g., CAPTCHA, and slow or unresponsiveness of the screen reader were frequent challenges faced by them. Both cases reported that around 80% of daily solutions were helped by using a smartphone. ConclusionsThe current advances in accessible technology of smartphones enable an individual with profound visual loss to use them almost equivalently as a sighted person. To reduce the gap in digital inclusion, people with visual impairment should be encouraged to use the smartphone for their daily solutions with attention to proper training.

AB  - The Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-alpha (PPAR alpha) is a member of the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor superfamily known for their crucial role in lipid metabolism. The expression and role of PPAR alpha in trophoblast cells are not very well known. Trophoblast invasion is one of the most critical processes required for successful implantation of the developing embryo into the maternal endometrium. Defects in this process are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as FGR(Fetal Growth Restriction), Preeclampsia, and choriocarcinoma. In this present study, we investigated the role of the ligand-activated transcription factor, Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR alpha) in regulating trophoblast cell invasion using cell lines and explants-based models. Immunohistological localization of PPAR alpha in human placental tissues showed a gestational variation with relatively low expression at term as compared to early trimester. PCR and Western Blot also confirmed this. Further to delineate the effect of PPAR alpha on trophoblast invasion, EVT derived HTR8/SVneo cell lines were stimulated with PPAR alpha agonist, i.e., fenofibrate (FF). Fenofibrate stimulation led to an increased activation and nuclear translocation of PPAR alpha, followed by reduced migration and invasion of these cells in a matrigel invasion assay (Boyden chamber). PPAR alpha stimulation also led to a reduced MMP-2/9 expression following our previous observation. Thus, we may conclude that PPAR alpha to be playing a very important regulatory role in orchestrating the invasive trophoblast programme and hence it seems plausible for it to be associated with PE, which is often characterized by a shallow trophoblast invasion.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a predominant life-threatening cancer, with liver and peritoneal metastases as the primary causes of death. Intestinal inflammation, a known CRC risk factor, nurtures a local inflammatory environment enriched with tumor cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cells, and secretory growth factors. The complex interactions of aberrantly expressed cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and matrix-remodeling enzymes promote CRC pathogenesis and evoke systemic responses that affect disease outcomes. Mounting evidence suggests that these cytokines and chemokines play a role in the progression of CRC through immunosuppression and modulation of the tumor microenvironment, which is partly achieved by the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. These cells impart features such as cancer stem cell-like properties, drug resistance, invasion, and formation of the premetastatic niche in distant organs, promoting metastasis and aggressive CRC growth. A deeper understanding of the cytokine- and chemokine-mediated signaling networks that link tumor progression and metastasis will provide insights into the mechanistic details of disease aggressiveness and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics for CRC. Here, we summarized the current knowledge of cytokine- and chemokine-mediated crosstalk in the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which drives immunosuppression, resistance to therapeutics, and metastasis during CRC progression. We also outlined the potential of this crosstalk as a novel therapeutic target for CRC. The major cytokine/chemokine pathways involved in cancer immunotherapy are also discussed in this review.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative hematological malignancy wherein the increased relapsed cases and lack of drug effectiveness generates a need to identify an effective treatment regimen. A unani formulation, Habb-e-Asgandh (HEA) is being used for treatment of ailments such as arthritis, however, its role in CML therapeutics has not been reported yet. Hence, anti-leukemic efficacy of HEA was assessed alone or in combination with standard chemotherapeutic, imatinib in CML cell line K562.Methods: The anti-leukemic effect of HEA was evaluated on cell cytotoxicity by MTT assay, cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining, apoptotic assay by Annexin-V assay, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by JC1 staining. Further, effect of drug treatment on oxidative stress and cell migration was determined by ORAC assay and transwell migration assay respectively. Lastly, changes in angiogenic marker (VEGF) and inflammatory marker (IL-6) were examined by ELISA.Results: HEA induced cytotoxicity of leukemic cells which increased further when co-treated with imatinib. The combinatorial treatment of HEA with imatinib potentiates anti-tumor effect by inducing cell apoptosis with disruption of MMP even at low concentrations. Subsequent studies revealed that tumor killing property of HEA increased the ROS generation. Furthermore, HEA in combination with imatinib dramatically reduced cell migration along with expression of VEGF and IL-6.Conclusion: This maiden study demonstrated that HEA possesses anti-leukemic potential in vitro. This formula-tion potentiates the effect of imatinib even at low concentrations suggesting the utilization of HEA as a novel adjuvant therapy for the better management of CML in future.

AB  - Human leukemic T cells show decreased surface CD5 (sCD5) and increased cytoplasmic CD5 (cCD5). When we examined their expressions in the Jurkat T cells, it showed increased sCD5 and decreased cCD5, which is in sharp contrast with the pattern of CD5 expression observed for human leukemic T cells. Furthermore, this opposite pattern was due to the absence of an exonal switch between E1A and E1B. This study suggests that Jurkat cell does not retain all characteristics of T-ALL cells; thus, we should carefully interpret the data obtained using Jurkat T cell as a model cell line of T-ALL.

AB  - Nature and nurture have always been a prerogative of evolutionary biologists. The environment's role in shaping an organism's phenotype has always intrigued us. Since the inception of humankind, twinning has existed with an unsettled parley on the contribution of nature (i.e. genetics) versus nurture (i.e. environment), which can influence the phenotypes. The study of twins measures the genetic contribution and that of the environmental influence for a particular trait, acting as a catalyst, fine-tuning the phenotypic trajectories. This is further evident because a number of human diseases show a spectrum of clinical manifestations with the same underlying molecular aberration. As of now, there is no definite way to conclude just from the genomic data the severity of a disease or even to predict who will get affected. This greatly justifies initiating a twin registry for a country as diverse and populated as India. There is an unmet need to set up a nationwide database to carefully curate the information on twins, serving as a valuable biorepository to study their overall susceptibility to disease. Establishing a twin registry is of paramount importance to harness the wealth of human information related to the biomedical, anthropological, cultural, social and economic significance.

AB  - Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) comprise a group of complex and heterogeneous hereditary neurodegenerative disorders characterized by cerebellar ataxia, with ophthalmoplegia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal features, peripheral neuropathy, motor neuron disease, pigmentary retinopathy, epilepsy, and dementia in varying proportions. Cognitive impairment is not frequent in SCAs but is rarely noticed since it gets camouflaged behind the exorbitant ataxic manifestations of the disease. The exact incidence and extent of cognitive impairment in these rare disorders are not known due to the heterogeneity between different SCA types and different modalities of testing employed in different studies. Through our review, we have summarized the cognitive aspects of SCA and can safely conclude that cognitive dysfunction is common in some SCA types when compared to others. Not only is it important to appreciate its presence as a symptom complex in SCA but also is the need to actively search and treat it to improve the patients' quality of life.

AB  - (1) Introduction: Adult-onset pilocytic astrocytoma (APA) accounts for only 1.5% of all brain tumors, and studies regarding APA are limited. This review is focused on the history, clinical course, cytogenetics, neuroimaging features, management, and outcome of APAs. (2) Methods: Using a systematic search protocol in Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct databases, the authors extracted cases of APA predilecting the temporal lobe from inception to December 2020. Articles lacking necessary data were excluded from this study. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 23 statistical package software. (3) Results: A total of 32 patients, 14 (43.8%) males and 18 (56.2%) females, with a male/female ratio of 0.77/1, were grouped. The mean age of the patients was 34.22 +/- 15.17 years, ranging from 19 to 75. The tumors were predominantly located in the left side. We have also discussed the clinical presentation, and headache was the most common complaint, followed by visual disturbance. Preoperative neuroimaging features demonstrated cystic lesions in 16 patients, with mural nodule in 5 patients; intracerebral hemorrhage was present in 1 patient, and solid enhancing mass was observed in 3 patients. Only our reported case presented as a solid calcified mass. Most of the patients (78.1%) underwent a gross total resection (GTR), only 5 (21.9%) underwent subtotal resection (STR). The outcome and prognosis history were excellent, and no recurrence was observed. (4) Conclusion: Most of the APAs of the temporal lobe follow benign clinical courses, but some patients exhibit aggressive clinical behavior. There was no history of recurrence after treatment at up to 27 years of follow-up.

AB  - Background: Acute appendicitis in the pediatric population remains a diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Despite many biochemical markers, imaging modalities and scoring systems, initial misdiagnosis and complication rates are high in children. This suggests the need for investigations directed towards new diagnostic tools to aid in the diagnosis. Recent studies have shown a correlation between serum sodium levels and complicated appendicitis. Although the exact reasons for hyponatremia in patients with complicated appendicitis are not known, there is persuasive data to support the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 in the non-osmotic release of antidiuretic hormone. This meta-analysis aims to investigate all available data on hyponatremia as a diagnostic marker of complicated appendicitis in the pediatric population. Methods: The literature search was conducted by two independent investigators according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The scientific databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched for relevant studies using the keywords (hyponatremia) AND (appendicitis) AND (children). The methodological quality was assessed using a validated scale, and RevMan 5.4 software was utilized for pooled analysis. Results: Seven studies were included in the final meta-analysis, five of which were retrospective. A total of 1615 and 2808 cases were distributed into two groups: group A with complicated appendicitis and group B with uncomplicated acute appendicitis, respectively. The studies compared serum sodium levels of patients among the groups. Pooling the data demonstrated significantly lower serum sodium levels in children with complicated appendicitis vs. the non-complicated appendicitis (WMD: -3.29, 95% CI = -4.52 to -2.07, p < 0.00001). The estimated heterogeneity among the included studies was substantial and statistically significant (I-2 = 98%, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: The results of the present meta-analysis indicate that hyponatremia has potential to be utilized as a biochemical marker in the diagnosis of complicated appendicitis in the pediatric population. However, well designed prospective diagnostic efficiency studies are essential to consolidate the association between hyponatremia and complicated acute appendicitis.

AB  - Although chronic otitis media is a major cause of conductive and mixed hearing loss, auditory rehabilitation is currently not optimal for this patient group. Planning for hearing rehabilitation must accompany strategies for infection control when surgically managing patients with chronic otitis media. Several barriers prevent adequate hearing restoration in such a heterogeneous patient population. A lack of standardized reporting of surgical interventions, hearing, and quality of life outcomes impedes meta-analyses of existing data and the generation of high-quality evidence, including cost-effectiveness data, through prospective studies. This, in turn, prevents the ability of clinicians to stratify patients based on prognostic indicators, which could guide the decision-making pathway. Strategies to improve reporting standards and methods have the potential to classify patients with chronic otitis media preoperatively, which could guide decision-making for hearing restoration with ossiculoplasty versus prosthetic hearing devices. Appropriately selected clinical guidelines would not only foster directed research but could enhance patient-centered and evidence-based decision-making regarding hearing rehabilitation in the surgical planning process.

TI  - Histologic Changes in Core-Needle Liver Biopsies From Patients With Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure and Independent Histologic Predictors of 28-Day Mortality
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
AB  - Context. -The histologic features in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are evolving, and histologic indicators of patients' poor prognosis are not yet fully established.
   Objective.-To evaluate the independent histologic predictors of 28-day mortality in ACLF patients on core-needle liver biopsies.
   Design.-Core-needle biopsies from patients with a diagnosis of ACLF (n = 152) as per the European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria were included during 8 years. Liver biopsies from 98 patients with compensated chronic liver disease were included as disease controls for histologic comparison. Features of ongoing changes, such as hepatic necrosis, hepatic apoptosis, cholestasis, hepatocyte degeneration, bile ductular proliferation, Mallory-Denk bodies, steatosis, and extent of liver fibrosis, were analyzed for predicting short-term mortality (28 days). A P value of <.05 was considered significant.
   Results.-In our cohort of ACLF patients, the following etiologies for acute decompensation were identified: alcohol, 47 of 152 (30.9%); sepsis, 24 of 152 (15.7%); hepatotropic viruses, 20 of 152 (13.1%); drug-induced liver injury, 11 of 152 (7.2%); autoimmune flare, 9 of 152 (5.9%); mixed etiologies, 5 of 152 (3.2%); and cryptogenic, 36 of 152 (23.6%). On histologic examination, hepatic necrosis (P < .001), dense lobular inflammation (P = .03), cholestasis (P < .001), ductular reaction (P = .001), hepatocyte degeneration (P < .001), and absence of advanced fibrosis stages (P < .001) were identified significantly more othen in ACLF patients than in disease controls on univariate analysis. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, the absence of advanced Ishak histologic activity index fibrosis stages (P = .02) and the presence of dense lobular inflammation (P = .04) were associated with increased 28-day mortality in ACLF patients. After adjusting the clinical causes of acute decompensation, only dense lobular inflammation was found as an independent predictor of short-term mortality (P = .04) in ACLF patients.
   Conclusions.-Dense lobular necroinflammatory activity is a clinically independent histologic predictor of 28-day short-term mortality in patients with ACLF.

AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) belongs to a group of pigmentary retinopathies. It is the most common form of inherited retinal dystrophy, characterized by progressive degradation of photoreceptors that leads to nyctalopia, and ultimately, complete vision loss. RP is distinguished by the continuous retinal degeneration that progresses from the mid-periphery to the central and peripheral retina. RP was first described and named by Franciscus Cornelius Donders in the year 1857. It is one of the leading causes of bilateral blindness in adults, with an incidence of 1 in 3000 people worldwide. In this review, we are going to focus on the genetic heterogeneity of this disease, which is provided by various inheritance patterns, numerosity of variations and inter-/intra-familial variations based upon penetrance and expressivity. Although over 90 genes have been identified in RP patients, the genetic cause of approximately 50% of RP cases remains unknown. Heterogeneity of RP makes it an extremely complicated ocular impairment. It is so complicated that it is known as "fever of unknown origin ". For prognosis and proper management of the disease, it is necessary to understand its genetic heterogeneity so that each phenotype related to the various genetic variations could be treated.

AB  - Introduction: In India, a national program for stroke (national programme for the control of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and stroke) and stroke management guidelines exist. Its successful implementation would need an organized system of stroke care in practice. However, many challenges exist including lack of awareness, prehospital notification systems, stroke ready hospitals, infrastructural weaknesses, and rehabilitation. We present here a protocol to investigate the feasibility and fidelity of implementing a uniform stroke care pathway in medical colleges of India. Methods and Analysis: This is a multicentric, prospective, multiphase, mixed-method, quasi-experimental implementation study intended to examine the changes in a select set of stroke care-related indicators over time within the sites exposed to the same implementation strategy. We shall conduct process evaluation of the implementation process as well as evaluate the effect of the implementation strategy using the interrupted time series design.During implementation phase, education and training about standard stroke care pathway will be provided to all stakeholders of implementing sites. Patient-level outcomes in the form of modified Rankin Scale score will be collected for all consecutive patients throughout the study. Process evaluation outcomes will be collected and reported in the form of various stroke care indicators. We will report level and trend changes in various indicators during the three study phases. Discussion: Acute stroke requires timely detection, management, and secondary prevention. Implementation of the uniform stroke care pathway is a unique opportunity to promote the requirements of homogenous stroke care in medical colleges of India.

AB  - Introduction Leucocyte telomere length (LTL) is linked to accelerate aging and premature mortality. In this research, we aimed to explore the relations between biochemical and anthropometry markers and LTL in Asian Indian women with abnormal fasting glycemia (impaired fasting glucose).
   Research design and methods In this study, 797 pre-diabetic women (obese, 492; non-obese, 305) were recruited. Demographic and clinical profiles, anthropometry, and fasting blood glucose were evaluated. LTL was quantified by a quantitative PCR. LTL was expressed as the relative telomere length or telomere repeat:single copy gene (T:S) ratio. The subjects were separated into quartiles according to the LTL.
   Results The average LTL was significantly decreased with increasing age. The average LTL was significantly shorter in obese women with abnormal fasting glycemia (p<0.05). R-squared (R-2) statistic for multivariable linear model after adjusted for age, family income, education and hypertension showed that LTL was inversely correlated with body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumference, waist-hip and waist-to-height ratio, truncal skinfolds (subscapular, and subscapular/triceps ratio, central and total skinfolds), fat mass (kg) and % body fat. The relationship between obesity measures and LTL (using the LTL quartile 1 as reference) identified central skinfolds (R-2=0.92, p<0.0001), sigma 4SF (R-2=0.90, p<0.0001), BMI (R-2=0.93, p<0.0001) and % body fat (R-2=0.91, p<0.0001) as independent predictors of LTL.
   Conclusions Besides age, obesity and subcutaneous adiposity (predominantly truncal) are major contributors to telomere shortening in Asian Indian women with abnormal fasting glycemia (impaired fasting glucose).

AB  - Oral cancer is usually preceded by oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) and early detection can downstage the disease. The majority of OPMDs are asymptomatic in early stages and can be detected on routine oral examination. Though only a proportion of OPMDs may transform to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), they may serve as a surrogate clinical lesion to identify individuals at risk of developing OSCC. Currently, there is a scarcity of scientific evidence on specific interventions and management of OPMDs and there is no consensus regarding their management. A consensus meeting with a panel of experts was convened to frame guidelines for clinical practices and recommendations for management strategies for OPMDs. A review of literature from medical databases was conducted to provide the best possible evidence and provide recommendations in management of OPMDs.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the potential therapeutic value of early passive polyclonal immunotherapy using high-titer convalescent plasma (CCP). Human polyclonal hyperimmune immunoglobulin (HIG) has several advantages over CCP. Unlike CCP, HIG can provide stan-dardized and controlled antibody content. It is also subjected to robust pathogen reduction rendering it virally safe and is purified by technologies demonstrated to preserve immunoglobulin neutralization ca-pacity and Fc fragment integrity. This document provides an overview of current practices and guidance for the collection and testing of plasma rich in antibodies against Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its industrial fractionation for the manufacture of quality-assured and safe HIG. Con-siderations are also given to the production of HIG preparations in low-and middle-income countries.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objective
   Saroglitazar is a newer antidiabetic agent approved to manage dyslipidemia. The objective is tevaluate the efficacy and safety profiles of saroglitazar in patients with dyslipidemia.
   Methods
   A systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar from the inception until January 2022. Interventional studies comparing the anti-hyperlipidaemic effect and safety of saroglitazar with or without a control group(s) were included. The efficacy of saroglitazar was assessed concerning its effect on total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol. The effects on serum creatinine levels, bodyweight reduction, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were considered to be safety endpoint.The Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used to assess the methodological quality of the included studies.
   Results
   A total of six studies with 581 adults with a mean age ranging from 40.2 to 62.6 years were included in this study. A significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed with saroglitazar 4 mg therapy compared to saroglitazar 2 mg [standardized mean difference (SMD): - 0.23 mg/dL, 95% CI: - 0.47 to 0.00; p = 0.05; 2 studies], and control [SMD: - 0.36 mg/dL, 95% CI - 0.59 to -0.12; p = 0.0026; 3 studies]. Also, a significant decrease in the total cholesterol was observed with saroglitazar 4 mg therapy compared to saroglitazar 2 mg [SMD - 0.28 mg/dL, 95% CI: - 0.52 to -0.04; p < 0.01; 2 studies], and control [SMD - 0.49 mg/dL, 95% CI: - 0.72 to -0.26; p < 0.0001; 3 studies]. Saroglitazar was not associated with adverse effects such as increase in serum creatinine levels, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and bodyweight reduction.
   Conclusion
   Saroglitazar appeared to be an effective and safer therapeutic option for improving dyslipidemia in patients. However, comparative studies of saroglitazar with the other pharmacological agents are warranted.

AB  - Background: Spinocerebellar ataxia is a neurodegenerative disease. Information on comparative assessment of quality of life (QoL) among SCAs, particularly SCA 12, is scarce. We aimed to compare health-related QoL in SCA 1, 2 and 12. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among individuals with genetically-confirmed SCAs. Ataxia severity was assessed using Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), independence in activities of daily living (ADL) using Katz index (Katz ADL) and depression using Beck's Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). QoL was assessed via Short Form Health Survey version 2.0 (SF-36). Results: We enrolled 89 individuals (SCA1 = 17, SCA2 = 43, SCA12 = 29; 56% males). Mean age at onset (41.0 +/- 11.6 for SCA12 versus 24.9 + 7.0 for SCA1 and 28.8 +/- 9.8 years for SCA2) was significantly higher among SCA12. SCA12 had lower BARS (mean score 4.1 +/- 4.5 versus 10.6 +/- 4.6 for SCA1 and 12.5 +/- 4.5 for SCA2). SCA12 scored better on all SF-36 subdomains including Physical (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores. PCS score amongst SCA12 was 44.4 +/- 9.0 versus 30.4 +/- 9.1 for SCA1 and 33.3 +/- 8.9 for SCA2. MCS score for SCA12 was 51.4 +/- 11.4 versus 41.8 +/- 11.5 for SCA1 and 41.8 +/- 11.2 for SCA2. SCA12 had lower mean BDI scores (5.0 +/- 6.0) versus SCA1 (9.5 +/- 11.6) and SCA2 (10.9 +/- 10.3). BARS and BDI emerged as significant predictors of most SF-36 subdomains. Conclusions: Our study suggests that despite older age and comparable disease duration, SCA12 patients experience better QoL, less severe depression and ataxia versus SCA1 and SCA2. Severity of ataxia and depression are significant predictors of QoL among the three SCA types.

AB  - Purpose: Tessier classification is used to classify congenital facial cleft disorders utilizing the anatomical location of the cleft and its extension. The orbital and ocular morbidities associated with the birth disorder are numerous. The authors decided to perform a retrospective analysis of the clinical features of the patients who presented to a tertiary care hospital with orbito-cranial clefts. Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated the records of patients with craniofacial clefts who had presented to a tertiary eye care hospital in northern India in the last 2 years (January 2019-December 2020). The clinical features were studied, entered in MS Excel, and the data were evaluated. Results: The data of 40 patients with Tessier cleft were found. The majority of the patients were male and presented in the pediatric age group. Unilateral involvement was more common, with maxillary hypoplasia being the most common facial anomaly associated. Eyelid coloboma and euryblepharon was the most common periocular finding; lateral epibulbar dermoid and corneal opacity were the most common ocular surface anomaly. The majority of patients had presented for cosmetic correction. The syndromic association was with Goldenhar syndrome (n = 13), Fraser (n = 2), and one each of Treacher Collins, blepharocheilodontic, organoid nevus, and oculo-dento-digital syndrome. Combined clefts were also seen. Conclusion: Tessier cleft classification is a useful tool to classify cranio-facial left anomalies. Multitudes of ocular and orbital anomalies can be associated with their different forms. Better knowledge and understanding of the classification will aid immensely in predicting the ocular defects and planning their management.

AB  - Purpose: Fraser syndrome is a rare congenital disorder comprising cryptophthalmos, syndactyly, and many times, urogenital anomalies. Herein, the authors aimed to study and report the clinical features and orbital anomalies in cases diagnosed with Fraser syndrome. Methods: The authors retrospectively evaluated the records of patients with Fraser syndrome who had presented to a tertiary eye care hospital in northern India in the last 2 years (from January 2019 to December 2020). The clinical features were studied, entered in MS Excel, and the data was evaluated. Results: Data of 15 patients with Fraser syndrome were found. Majority of the patients were males and presented in the pediatric age group. Bilateral involvement was more common, and the most common variant of cryptophthalmos was abortive. Complete and medial madarosis of the eyebrows was the most common periocular finding. Complete cryptophthalmos was associated with cystic globes, whereas abortive forms had superior symblepharon. Common systemic features included syndactyly, bifid nose, and urogenital anomaly. Conclusion: Fraser syndrome is an extremely rare developmental disorder; it encompasses a wide range of ocular, periocular, and orbital anomalies, along with multiple pre-existing systemic anomalies. The treating ophthalmologist should always be careful in examining these patients.

AB  - Background : Intraventricular pilocytic astrocytomas are a rare occurrence, accounting for approximately 4%-15.6% of all pilocytic astrocytomas.The aim of the study was to describe the radiology, surgical management and outcome in 15 patients with histopathologically proven intraventricular pilocytic astrocytoma(IVPA).
   Objective : To study the clinical presentation radiology and operative challenges in rare intra ventricular pilocytic astrocytomas.
   Materials and Methods: Between January 2010 and August 2018, 15 patients with histopathologically proven IVPA were identified. The radiological images were obtained from PACS. Patient and surgical details were obtained from the computerized discharge summary, OT records and operative notes, whereas follow up was obtained from the record section.
   Results: Headache with progressive loss of vision was the most common presentation. Duration of symptoms varied from 4 months to 2 years (mean 9.88 months). Except one patient, all patients with preoperative CT scan revealed calcifications in the lesion, with extensive calcification in 3 patients. All the tumors were predominantly hypointense on T1WI and iso to hyperintense on T2WI. Lesion in all patients showed heterogenous contrast enhancement on post gadolinium images. Mean blood loss in the series was 1969 ml (range 250 ml- 4500 ml). There was one death in this series due to meningitis and septic shock.
   Conclusion: IVPAs are rare tumors and are difficult to diagnose in the preoperative period based on the radiologic profile alone. These tumors can be extremely vascular with potential for massive blood loss. These tumors can be associated with extensive calcification and the calcified tumors have less bleeding as expected.

AB  - Objectives: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is widely used in dermatol-ogy for skin depigmentation. However, there are very few clinical studies on the efficacy of vitamin C in gingival depigmentation. This preliminary case series aims to present the clinical effective-ness, histologic changes, and patient-reported outcomes of intra-epidermal vitamin C injections (oral mesotherapy) for managing patients with gingival melanin hyperpigmentation. Method and materials: Five patients were administered locally injectable vi-tamin C (once per week for 4 to 5 visits) in maxillary or mandib-ular anterior pigmented gingiva. The depigmentation effect was evaluated using the Dummett Oral Pigmentation Index (DOPI) and Gingival Pigmentation Index (GPI). Digital photographs were used to assess gingival luminescence (L*) and pigmented surface area (PSA). Parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1 and 3 months. Melanocyte histopathologic count was deter-mined at baseline and at 3 months. Pain, gingival color change, and patient satisfaction scores were also assessed. Results: Me-dian GPI, DOPI, and PSA were significantly reduced (P <= .05) from baseline to 1 month. There was no statistically significant change from 1 month to 3 months. L* value significantly increased from baseline to 3 months. A median pain score of 3 (scale of 0 to 10) was observed on the day of the procedure. A score of 3 (scale of 0 to 4) was reported for the gingival color and scores 3 and 4 (scale of 0 to 4) for the overall patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Oral mesotherapy using locally injectable vitamin C is a nonsur-gical, minimally invasive, and efficient technique for gingival depigmentation. Indian patients were satisfied with the gingival color obtained and the overall treatment experience. Clinical importance: As all the branches of medicine, specifically den-tistry, direct to minimally invasive approaches, mesotherapy shows great importance to reduce the surgical interventions, especially when esthetic outcomes are needed. Oral mesother-apy using locally injectable vitamin C can be a useful nonsurgical technique for achieving gingival depigmentation in the esthetic zone.

KW  - IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY
AB  - Background: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH) accounts for 7.5%-30% of all strokes and carries higher morbidity and mortality. Raised blood urea nitrogen and creatinine ratio (BUNR) is a marker of dehydration and related to poor outcome in stroke patients. However, the ratio varies between 15 and 80 in different studies. The aim of the present study was to assess BUNR as an independent predictor of mortality and its sensitivity and specificity in predicting outcome in the SICH population.
   Materials and Methods: Patients above the age of 18 years with SICH who were admitted in the Department of Neurology at Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Banaras Hindu University between January 2018 and July 2020 were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed up. Demographic, clinical, radiological, and outcome parameters were recorded.
   Results: A total of 217 patients were included. Of these, 137 (63%) were males. Seventy-one patients died during the initial 30 days. Number of patients with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH; P = 0.003), higher mean intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume (P < 0.001) and midline shift (P = 0.021), and poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (<9) (P = 0.040) was more in the group which did not survive. Mean level of urea was significantly lower among survivors than in those who died (P = 0.001). BUNR was also significantly higher in those who died than in those who survived (P = 0.001). BUNR with a cutoff value of 39.17 was significantly associated with mortality at 30 days with a sensitivity and specificity of 61.97% and 62.33%, respectively. On performing two different multivariable logistic studies, it was found that model B with BUNR ratio as a predictor of mortality out performed model A (without BUNR).
   Conclusions: The study showed that SICH was associated with significant mortality. Independent predictors of death at 30 days were lower GCS on admission, larger hematoma volume, and BUNR of more than 39.17.

AB  - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a subcategory of the mature T-cell neoplasm characterized by sheets of cluster of differentiation (CD)30-positive pleomorphic large cells mostly present as lymphadenopathy. Here, we describe a case of Small cell variant ALCL with leukemic presentation without lymphadenopathy. A 68-year-old male presented with fatigue and weakness; examination revealed a total leukocyte count of 295,000/uL. The peripheral smear showed cells having cerebriform nuclei comprising 90% of the leukocytes. The flow cytometry showed that the cells were immunopositive for CD3 (weak), CD4, CD7, and negative for the rest of the markers. The cell blocks from the peripheral blood showed cells with immunopositivity for CD30, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), and Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). A diagnosis of the small cell variant of ALK-positive ALCL was made. Due to the presence of atypical pleomorphic cells without lymphadenopathy, the case has a diagnostic dilemma with differential diagnosis of Sezary syndrome, T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Karyotyping and additional immunohistochemistry help for the confirmation of the diagnosis.

AB  - Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is performed in patients with minor strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) to prevent further strokes. However, most operators do not intervene in older adults. We had a 92-year patient with recurrent minor strokes with two possible proximate causes - cardioembolism and significant symptomatic left carotid stenosis. This patient continued to have recurrent ischemic events in the left carotid territory despite optimum management of the cardioembolic source with dual antiplatelets and anticoagulation and was successfully treated with left CAS. The role of carotid revascularization in older patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis and cardiac comorbidities is discussed.

AB  - A Abstract: BackgroundDisease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.

AB  - Background and Objective: Hemispherotomy surgery in adults is shrouded in doubts regarding the functional outcome. The age at surgery alone should not be the deciding factor for surgery. Language paradigms were used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to confirm the role played by the age at the onset of seizures to predict the postoperative functional outcome. The objective of the study was to formulate an optimal strategy for patient selection for the left-sided hemispherotomy in adults, based on functional outcome analysis.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 20 participants (age at surgery 1-26 years) who underwent left hemispherotomy (over a 5-year period) was conducted. The language and motor functional assessments of 18 participants (13 pediatric and five adult participants; attrition of participants- two) were recorded at presentation and during follow-up visits. After approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee, 13 cooperative participants (eight pediatric and five adult participants) underwent language fMRI. Motor fMRI with both active and passive paradigms was done in 16 participants.
   Results: All 18 participants with a mean follow-up of 24 months had class I seizure-free outcome. Of these 18, five were adults (mean age = 21 years, range: 18-22 years) and 13 were in the pediatric age group (mean age = 8 years, range: 2-15 years). Postoperatively, four adults retained both verbal fluency and language comprehension at a mean follow-up period of 38 months (range: 24-48 months). Their pre- and post-op language fMRI showed word generation and regional activations for semantic comprehension in the right hemisphere. The motor area activations were seen in the right hemisphere in two and in the left hemisphere in two participants. Among the pediatric participants, four (group I [n = 4/13]) who had good language outcome showed activations in the right hemisphere. In two participants (group II [n = 2/13]) who deteriorated postoperatively, the activations were in the left hemisphere. Five participants (group III [n = 5/13]) who retained the telegraphic language postoperatively had bilateral activations of semantic comprehension areas in fMRI. All 13 pediatric participants had motor area activations seen in the left hemisphere, similar to controls.
   Conclusion: Left hemispherotomy can be advised to adults with comparably good postoperative language and motor outcome as in the pediatric age group, provided the weakness is acquired perinatally or below the age of 7 years. The fMRI is a valuable tool to aid in patient selection.

AB  - Craniopagus conjoined twins are extremely rare, reported 1 in 2.5 million live births. To date, 62 separation attempts in 69 well-documented cases of craniopagus twins have been made. Of these, 34 were performed in a single-stage approach, and 28 were attempted in a multistage approach. One or both twins died of massive intraoperative blood loss and cardiac arrest in 14 cases. We report our surgical experience with conjoined craniopagus twins (JB) with type III total vertical joining and shared circumferential/circular sinus with left-sided dominance. A brief review of the literature is also provided. In our twins, the meticulous preoperative study and planning by the multidisciplinary team consisting of 125-member, first-staged surgical separation consisted of creation of venous conduit to bypass part of shared circumferential sinus and partial hemispheric disconnection. Six weeks later, twin J manifested acute cardiac overload because of one-way fistula development from blocked venous bypass graft necessitating emergency final separation surgery. Unique perioperative issues were abnormal anatomy, hemodynamic sequelae from one-way fistula development after venous bypass graft thrombosis, cardiac arrest after massive venous air embolism requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and return of spontaneous circulation at 15 minutes immediately after separation. This is the first Indian craniopagus separation surgery in a complex total vertical craniopagus twin reported by a single-center multidisciplinary team. Both twins could be sent home, but one remained severely handicapped. Adequate perioperative planning and multidisciplinary team approach are vital in craniopagus twin separation surgeries.

AB  - Purpose: To compare posterior corneal morphology between older treated and younger untreated children with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and intraoperative OCT (iOCT), respectively. Methods: In this comparative study, ASOCT of older PCG children were compared with iOCT of younger untreated PCG patients. Differences between the two groups with respect to posterior corneal morphology were studied. Results: Observed morphological patterns within posterior cornea in older treated (age: 72-300 months) children (87 eyes) included Descemet's membrane (DM) excrescences (70%), thickened DM (35%), intracameral twin protuberances (92%), and DM detachment (26%). Changes within pre-Descemet's layer (PDL) (28%) included thickening, breaks, and detachments. Extent of Haab's striae was associated with thickness of DM/PDL complex (P = 0.008) when analyzed in the treated group. In contrast, in the untreated group (n = 53 eyes, age 1-63 months), posterior corneal changes were limited to diffuse hyper-reflectivity of the DM/PDL complex, with absence of DM tears. Conclusion: Posterior cornea thickens and Haab's striae become more circumscribed in eyes of older treated children compared to untreated PCG eyes, probably reflecting a healing response of posterior cornea over time.

AB  - Pain, a physiological protective mechanism, turns into a complex dynamic neural response when it becomes chronic. The role of neuroplastic brain changes is more evident than the peripheral factors in the maintenance, modulation and amplification of chronic low back pain (cLBP). In this background, we summarise the brain changes in cLBP in a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Databases ('PubMed', 'Scopus' and 'Sleuth') were searched till May 2022 and the activity pattern was noted under the 'without stimulation' and 'with stimulation' groups. A total of 312 studies were selected after removing duplicates. Seventeen (553 cLBP patients, 192 activation foci) studies were fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included in the 'without stimulation' group. Twelve statistically significant clusters are localized in the prefrontal cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus amygdala, occipital lobe, temporal lobe and associated white matter in this group. Ten studies (353 cLBP patients, 125 activation foci) were selected in the' with stimulation' groups. In this group, seven statistically significant clusters were found in the frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, premotor cortex, parietal cortex, claustrum and insula. These statistically significant clusters indicate a probable imbalance in GABAergic modulation of brain circuits and dysfunction in the descending pain modulation system. This disparity in the pain neuro-matrix is the source of spontaneous and persisting pain in cLBP.

TI  - Development and use of low-fidelity, low-cost, animal tissue-based simulators for surgical training during the Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - SURGERY
AB  - Background. The Covid-19 pandemic severely affected surgical training as the number of surgeries being done was reduced to a bare minimum. Teaching and training of clinical skills on a simulator are desirable as they may have an even larger role during the Covid-19 pandemic. Commercially available simulators with optimum fidelity are costly and may be difficult to sustain because of their recurring cost. The development of low-cost simulators with optimum fidelity is the need of the hour.Methods. We developed animal tissue-based simulators for imparting skills training to surgical residents on some basic and advanced general surgical procedures. Porcine tissue and locally available materials were used to prepare these models. The models were pilot-tested. Standard operating procedures were developed for each skill that was shared with the participants well before the 'hands-on' exercise. An online pre-test was conducted. The training was then imparted on these models under faculty guidance adhering to Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. This was followed by a post-test and participant feedback. The entire exercise was paperless.Results. Sixty residents were trained in 10 sessions. Most of the participants were men (44; 73%). The mean pre-test and post-test scores were 40.92 (standard deviation [SD] 6.27) and 42.67, respectively (SD 4.06). Paired sample t -test suggested a significant improvement in the post-test score (p<0.001). The activity and the models were well appreciated by the residents.Conclusion. The animal tissue-based indigenous models are easy to prepare, cost-effective and provide optimum fidelity for skill training of surgical residents. In addition to skill acquisition, training on such modules may alleviate the stress and anxiety of the residents associated with the loss of surgical training during a time-bound residency period.

AB  - Purpose: The study sought to describe the clinical presentation pattern of pediatric cataracts and factors leading to delay in surgery at a tertiary care center in North India. Methods: A cross-sectional, interview-based study was conducted from January 2020 to October 2020, that included pediatric patients < 12 years, with unilateral or bilateral congenital or developmental cataract. A pre-validated questionnaire was used to record data. The parameters recorded were age at first symptoms, age at diagnosis of cataract, age at surgery, laterality of cataract, first symptom, first family member noticing the abnormality, the morphology of cataract, association of perinatal complications, family history, systemic diseases, and cause (s) of delay in surgery. Results: A total of 89 patients were included. The mean age of subjects was 4.75(+/- 3.51) years. A white pupil was the most common symptom (64.04%) and appeared in infancy in 30.3% of cases. Parents first detected the problem in 60.67%, and the pediatrician was the first medical contact in 11.23% of cases. The median (IQR) delay period between diagnosis of cataract and cataract surgery was 4 (3-6) months, the major causes were long GA waiting (30.33%), and delay due to systemic ill health (14.61%). Conclusion: Parental education on cataract detection is recommended to help in the timely detection and hence, improved outcomes of pediatric cataract surgery. Pediatricians, consulted for any systemic illness, have the role of the second most important contact in the detection of pediatric cataract.

KW  - PREVALENCE
AB  - Background & objectives: The National Monitoring Framework for the prevention and control of NCDs in India has set targets for reduction of risk factors relative to the measure recorded in 2010. Estimates for 2010 and 2015 were established using meta-analyses in the absence of a national risk factor survey till 2017.
   Methods: We searched national survey reports and also articles published in English from India between 2008 and 2017 in PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane review databases for specific risk factors among 18-69 yr Indians. Quality of studies was evaluated using Joanna-Briggs tool, but all studies were included in analyses. Estimates for each of the eight strata by age, gender and place of residence, respectively, were generated. MetaXL was used to calculate the pooled estimate for 2010 and 2015 using a random effects model. Strata-specific estimates were combined to arrive at national estimate using population weight of each stratum. The credibility of the estimates was determined using four parameters - average Briggs score; representativeness of the contributing studies and precision and stability of the estimates.
   Results: The estimates [95% confidence interval (CI)] for 2010 for different risk factors were as follows: current alcohol use, 15.7 per cent (13.2-18.2); current tobacco use, 27 per cent (21.4-32.6); household solid fuel use, 61.5 per cent (50.2-72.5); physical inactivity, 44.2 per cent (37.8-50.6); obesity, seven per cent (3.8-10.2) and raised blood pressure, 20.2 per cent (18.4-22.1). In 2015, compared to 2010, tobacco use showed a relative decline of 18 per cent, household solid fuel use of nine per cent and physical inactivity of 15 per cent. The estimates were stable for alcohol use, raised blood pressure and obesity between 2010 and 2015. All estimates varied between moderate and high degrees of credibility.
   Interpretation & conclusions: The estimates are consistent with other available estimates and with current national-level initiatives focused on tobacco control and improving access to clean fuel. These estimates can be used to monitor progress on non-communicable disease risk factor targets for India.

AB  - Background: Mean Platelet Volume (MPV) has been suggested as a biomarker for acute appendicitis (AA) in the adult population. The utility of MPV in pediatric AA remains vague. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematically summarize and compare all relevant data on MPV as a diagnostic biomarker for AA in children. Methods: Databases were systematically searched using keywords ((mean platelet volume) OR mpv) AND (appendicitis). The inclusion criteria were all comparative studies of MPV in children aged less than 18 years and diagnosed with AA. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality using the Downs and Black scale. Results: We included fourteen studies in the final meta-analysis; most were retrospective. Eight studies compared the MPV values between AA and non-AA; four studies compared the same between AA and healthy controls; two studies compared the MPV values among all three groups. The estimated heterogeneity among the studies for all outcomes was high and statistically significant. The pooling the data showed no statistically significant difference in MPV (weighted mean difference (WMD) = -0.42, 95% CI = (-1.04, 0.20), p = 0.19) between AA and healthy controls or AA and non-AA cases (WMD = 0.01, 95% CI = (-0.15, 0.17), p = 0.90). Conclusion: While MPV levels seem to have some utility in adult AA diagnosis, MPV levels should not dictate treatment options in pediatric AA.

AB  - Aims: There is no consensus for palliative chemotherapy regimen in metastatic gallbladder cancer. We did a retrospective study to compare the treatment outcome in patients of metastatic gallbladder cancer treated with either gemcitabine + cisplatin (regimen A) or oral capecitabine (regimen B) alone. Subjects and Methods: A total of 67 patients between January 2015 and September 15 treated with either regimen A or regimen B were retrospectively evaluated. Statistical analysis was done in June 2019. Kaplan-Meir and Log rank test were used to compare survival between two arms. Results: Out of 67 patients, 31/67 (46%) received regimen A, and 36/67 (54%) received regimen B. Male to female ratio was 1:3. About 42% patients in regimen A and 20% in regimen B required palliative stenting. Median number of chemotherapy cycles was 4 in both regimen A (range 1-> 6) and regimen B (range 1-> 6). Patients receiving 3 cycles and 6 cycles of chemotherapy in regimen A and regimen B was 68% and 31% versus 70% and 63%, respectively (P = 0.86). Response assessment as any response (complete response + partial response + disease was stable) after 3 cycles and 6 cycles was 71% and 57% (P = 0.20), 44% and 39% (P = 0.29), in regimen A and B, respectively. Median survival was 23 weeks (range 2-106 weeks) in regimen A and 15 weeks (range 4-83 weeks) in regimen B (P = 0.40). Conclusions: The present study shows gemcitabine and cisplatin has nonsignificant better survival compared to oral capecitabine. However, oral capecitabine is more convenient and easy to administer. Studies with larger sample size are needed to further establish the standard chemotherapy guidelines.

AB  - Purpose: To compare pneumatic vitreolysis and pars plana vitrectomy in the management of focal symptomatic vitreomacular traction (VMT). Method: Patients aged 18 years or older, with idiopathic focal symptomatic VMT and best-corrected visual acuity <20/40, without any other retinal pathology were randomized to undergo pneumatic vitreolysis (Group 1) or pars plana vitrectomy (Group 2). The primary outcome measure was resolution of traction confirmed with optical coherence tomography at 3 months. Secondary outcome measures were to compare changes in best-corrected visual acuity, central foveal thickness, and complications if any. Results: A total of 30 eyes of 30 patients were included with 15 eyes in each group. Vitreomacular traction resolved successfully in 12 of 15 (80%) eyes in Group 1 and in all (100%) eyes in Group 2 (P = 0.224). The mean visual acuity improved from 0.80 +/- 0.26 (20/126 Snellen's equivalent) to 0.70 +/- 0.46 logMAR (20/100 Snellen's equivalent) in Group 1 (P = 0.71) and from 0.904 +/- 0.44 (20/160 Snellen's equivalent) to 0.47 +/- 0.26 logMAR (20/59 Snellen's equivalent) in Group 2 (P = 0.0016). Although 4 of 15 (26.66%) eyes in Group 1 had formation of full-thickness macular hole and 7 eyes required resurgery (4 for full-thickness macular hole and 3 for unresolved VMT), none in the pars plana vitrectomy group had any complications requiring resurgery (P = 0.0063). Two eyes in the pars plana vitrectomy group had intraoperative deroofing of the fovea leading to full-thickness macular hole. Conclusion: Pars plana vitrectomy is better than pneumatic vitreolysis as a single intervention in the management of focal symptomatic VMT.

AB  - IDH wild-type (wt) grade 2/3 astrocytomas are a heterogenous group of tumors with disparate clinical and molecular profiles. cIMPACT-NOW recommendations incorporated in the new 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors urge minimal molecular criteria to identify a subset that has an aggressive clinical course similar to IDH-wt glioblastomas (GBMs). This paper describes the use of a panel of molecular markers to reclassify IDH-wt grade 2/3 diffuse astrocytic gliomas (DAGs) and study median overall survival concerning for to IDH-wt GBMs in the Indian cohort. IDH-wt astrocytic gliomas (grades 2, 3, and 4) confirmed by IDHR132H immunohistochemistry and IDH1/2 gene sequencing, 1p/19q non-codeleted with no H3F3A mutations were included. TERT promoter mutation by Sanger sequencing, epidermal growth factor receptor amplification, and whole chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss by fluorescence in situ hybridization was assessed and findings correlated with clinical and demographic profiles. The molecular profile of 53 IDH-wt DAGs (grade 2: 31, grade 3: 22) was analyzed. Eleven cases (grade 2: 8, grade 3: 3) (20.75%) were reclassified as IDH-wt GBMs, WHO grade 4 (TERT promoter mutation in 17%, epidermal growth factor receptor amplification in 5.5%, and whole chromosome 7 gain and chromosome 10 loss in 2%). Molecular GBMs were predominantly frontal (54.5%) with a mean age of 36 years and median overall survival equivalent to IDH-wt GBMs (18 vs. 19 mo; P=0.235). Among grade 2/3 DAGs not harboring these alterations, significantly better survival was observed for grade 2 versus grade 3 DAGs (25 vs. 16 mo; P=0.002). Through the incorporation of a panel of molecular markers, a subset of IDH-wt grade 2 DAGs can be stratified into molecular grade 4 tumors with prognostic and therapeutic implications. However, IDH-wt grade 3 DAGs behave like GBMs irrespective of molecular profile.

TI  - Update on Coronavirus 2019 Vaccine Guidelines for Transplant Recipients
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
KW  - COVID-19
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine and its utility in solid organ transplantation need to be timely revised and updated. These guidelines have been formalized by the experts- the apex technical committee members of the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organiza-tion and the heads of transplant societies-for the guidance of transplant communities. We rec-ommend that all personnel involved in organ transplantation should be vaccinated as early as possible and continue COVID-19-appropriate behavior despite a full course of vaccination. For specific guidelines of recipients, we suggest completing the full schedule before transplantation whenever the clinical condition permits. We also suggest a single dose, rather than proceeding unvaccinated for transplant, in case a complete course is not feasible. If vaccination is planned before surgery, we recommend a gap of at least 2 weeks between the last dose of vaccine and sur-gery. For those not vaccinated before transplant, we suggest waiting 4 to 12 weeks after trans-plant. For the potential living donors, we recommend the complete vaccination schedule before transplant. However, if this is not feasible, we suggest receiving at least a single dose of the vac-cine 2 weeks before donation. We suggest that suitable transplant patients and those on the wait-ing list should accept a third dose of the vaccine when one is offered to them. We recommend that organs from a deceased donor with suspected/proven vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombo-cytopenia should be avoided and are justified only in cases of emergency situations with informed consent and counseling.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the outcomes of surgical intervention in cases of ectopia lentis. Methods: This retrospective study included all cases of ectopia lentis that presented between June 2015 and March 2019 in a tertiary care center. They were reviewed retrospectively. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), severity of lens subluxation, type of surgery, intra-operative and post-operative complication, and specular count were recorded. Results: Seventy-eight eyes of 57 cases with a mean age at surgery of 14.73 years were analyzed. Intra-lenticular lens aspiration was the most common (n-62/78; 79.5%) surgical procedure followed by lens aspiration, intra-capsular cataract extraction, phaco-aspiration, and pars-plana lensectomy. Simultaneous intra-ocular lens (IOL) implantation was performed in 46.2% (n-32/78) of the eyes. The mean CDVA improved from 0.85 +/- 0.55 logMAR to 0.44 +/- 0.29 logMAR at 6 weeks follow-up. The post-operative CDVA was significantly better in the pseudo-phakic group compared to the aphakic group (p-0.02). The patient's age at the time of surgery and the degree of subluxation did not impact the final visual outcome. Intra-operative complication included vitreous hemorrhage (n-1) and lens matter drop (n-1). Post-operative complications were noted in 26.9% of the eyes (n-21/78) with a higher complication rate in the pseudo-phakic group (p-0.00). A second intervention was required in 7.7% of the eyes (n-6/78). Conclusion: Age and degree of subluxation at the time of surgery do not influence the final visual outcome in cases of ectopia lentis undergoing lens extraction surgery. IOL implantation results in better visual outcomes but is associated with a high complication rate.

Three cases of Kindler syndrome with ocular changes were reviewed. Case 1 (10 years, female) had recurrent epithelial breakdown with severe dry eye and corneal opacity secondary to keratitis. Case 2 (28 years, male) had symblepharon , ocular surface keratinization , and severe dry eye. Case 3 (16 years , female ) had partial limbal stem cell deficiency with dry eye. All cases were treated with topical lubricants, short course of low-potency steroids and immuno-modulators. Attention must be paid to the eye in addition to the oro-an-genital mucosa to avoid longterm ocular sequelae.

AB  - Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated disease caused by ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Coeliac disease has been thought to affect mainly people of European origin but subsequently many studies revealed that it affects people living in North America, Oceania, South America, Asia as well as Africa. The global pooled seroprevalence and prevalence of biopsy-confirmed coeliac disease are 1.4% and 0.7% respectively. The pooled incidence rates in women and men are 17.4 (95% CI: 13.7-21.1) and 7.8 (95% CI: 6.3-9.2) per 100 000 person-years respectively. The systematic reviews, based on many population-based data, suggest that both the prevalence and the incidence of coeliac disease has increased over past three decades, which may be attributable not only to an increase in the detection rate (improvement in diagnostic tests, simplification of diagnostic criteria and increase in awareness about the disease) but also because of modernisation and globalisation related changes in the dietary practices including increase in the use of convenience food and dietary gluten. In addition to genetic factors, while there are many environmental risk factors, including age at the first introduction of gluten, breastfeeding, caesarean section, exposure to antibiotics and gut microbiome; the amount of gluten ingestion during early part of life, however, has been shown to increase the risk of coeliac disease, and this is relevant from the point of view of primary prevention. In this review, we have reviewed and summarised the literature, up till year 2021, related to the global and continent-wise epidemiology and risk factors associated with coeliac disease.

AB  - Screen-based media usage among young people is blooming rapidly due to technological and digital revolution. We conducted community-based cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of excess screen time and its association with sociodemographic and behavioral patterns in a rural block of Haryana, India. A semi-structured interview schedule was administered by trained physicians to ascertain screen time in a typical day and various socioeconomic and behavioral factors among a random sample of 860 young men aged 18-24 years. The prevalence of excess screen time was 61.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 58.4-65.1). It was significantly associated with education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.6) and occupation (AOR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-3.9) of the father and their sleep duration of =8 h (AOR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.3). Limiting the screen time as per international standards and behavioral interventions are needed for this young population.

AB  - PURPOSE
   Systemic to pulmonary vasculature shunting (SPS) is an important finding to identify the probable site of bleeding, especially in multicentric parenchymal lung disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the value of imaging findings, which can locate SPS on dual-energy computed tomography angiography (DECTA), and correlate with digital subtraction angiography (DSA), which was considered as a gold standard.
   METHODS
   Retrospective analysis of 187 patients (148 males, 39 females, mean age: 43.7 +/- 15.1 years) between October 2014 and November 2018 who underwent both DECTA and DSA. Computed tomography angiography was performed using dual-source (80 and 140 kV), 2 x 128 slice equipment, using 50-80 mL iodinated contrast (400 mg iodine/mL). These patients were divided into shunting (group A) and non-shunting groups (group B), based on the presence or absence of signs of shunting on DECTA. Group A had 98 and group B had 89 patients. We analyzed the following imaging signs for identifying SPS: (1) non-tapering pulmonary artery sign, (2) clustering of vessels sign, and (3) significant differential attenuation sign (>25 HU difference in attenuation between segmental pulmonary arteries of shunting side and normal non-shunting side was considered significant). The correlation was done with DSA to identify the presence of SPS.
   RESULTS
   In 187 patients, 281 lobes were evaluated to look for the signs of shunting from systemic artery to pulmonary vessels on DECTA. A total of 98 patients who showed signs of shunting on DECTA presented 135 lobes with parenchymal, with or without pleural, abnormalities. Of these, 84 patients had one or more aspergilloma in the lobe where shunting was seen. In one patient, a specific artery could not be cannulated due to a tortuous course; hence, all arteries which were seen on CTA causing shunting were also seen on DSA. Non-tapering pulmonary artery segmental branches were seen in 97 (99%) patients, clustering of systemic vessels was seen in 90 (91.8%) patients, and significant attenuation difference was seen in 74 (75.5%) patients. In the rest of the 89 patients, 146 lobes were assessed but no signs of shunting were seen on DECTA. Nine arteries in 8 patients showed shunting on DSA, while the rest did not show any shunting. Digital subtraction angiography correlation showed 96.4%, 100%, 100%, and 93.8% of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively, for DECTA in detecting SPS on a per artery basis.
   CONCLUSION
   The proposed signs on DECTA help in identifying the systemic vessels that cause shunting, and hence, the most likely bleeding site, which aids in planning the endovascular management by targeting specific arteries in case of multicentric disease. Being the gold standard, DSA is an ideal modality for detecting very small SPSs and in classifying the latter.

AB  - Background: Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain. Conservative treatment is often effective, but in many cases, invasive procedures may be required. Local corticosteroid injection is the most frequently used invasive technique and can be given under ultrasound (USG) or palpation guidance. We sought to compare the outcome of local corticosteroid injection by USG and palpation guidance in plantar fasciitis.Methods: This was a prospective randomized study of patients who presented with heel pain between July 2015 and November 2016 and were screened for plantar fasciitis by USG. Patients with confirmed plantar fasciitis were managed conservatively for 4 weeks. The 60 consecutive patients not responding to the conservative treatment were randomized into two groups. Group A (n = 30) received a corticosteroid injection under USG guidance. Group B (n = 30) received a corticosteroid injection under palpation guidance. Patients were followed up at 3 and 6 weeks. We compared the visual analog scale score, plantar fascia thickness, and heel pad thickness in both groups.Results: There was significant pain relief in both groups after 3 and 6 weeks of local corticosteroid injection, with greater relief noted in the USG-guided group. There was a significant decrement in plantar fascia thickness in both groups after 3 and 6 weeks; however, a greater decrement was observed in the USG-guided group. Neither group showed a significant difference in heel pad thickness after 3 and 6 weeks.Conclusions: Ultrasound-guided injection provided better pain relief and a greater reduction in plantar fascia thickness than palpation-guided injection.

AB  - Objective The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the use of telemedicine to maintain continuity of care for patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing a nurse-led teleconsultation strategy for CVD management during the COVID-19 pandemic in India and evaluated the impact of nurse-led teleconsultations on patient treatment satisfaction. Design, setting and participants We developed a two-stage teleconsultation strategy and tested the feasibility of implementing a nurse-led teleconsultation strategy to manage CVD in a northern state (Punjab) in India. A multidisciplinary team of experts developed the treatment protocol used for teleconsultations to manage CVD. Nurses were trained to provide teleconsultation, triaging of patients and referrals to the physicians. Patients with CVD who had an outpatient visit or hospitalisation between September 2019 and March 2020 at the Dayanand Medical College Hospital, Ludhiana, India, were contacted by phone and offered teleconsultations. Telemedicine strategy comprised: stage 1 nurse-led teleconsultations and stage 2 physician-led teleconsultations. Descriptive analysis was performed to report the proportion of patients triaged by the two-stage telemedicine strategy, and patient's clinical characteristics, and treatment satisfaction between the nurse-led versus physician-led teleconsultations. Results Overall, nurse-led stage 1 teleconsultations were provided to 12 042 patients with CVD. The mean (SD) age of the participants was 58.9 years (12.8), and men were 65.4%. A relatively small proportion of patients (6.3%) were referred for the stage-2 physician-led teleconsultations and of these only 8.4% required hospitalisations. During stage 1 nurse-led teleconsultations, patients were referred to the physicians due to uncontrolled diabetes (24.9%), uncontrolled hypertension (18.7%) and congestive heart failure (16.2%). The patient's treatment satisfaction was similar between the nurse-led versus physician-led teleconsultations (p=0.07). Conclusion This study showed that a nurse-led telemedicine strategy is feasible to implement in a resource-constraint setting for triaging patients with CVD and reduces physician's burden.

AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) is a group of genetic disorders with seven types and 13 subgroups which are characterized by an inherent deficiency of the enzymes responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Defective breakdown of GAG products leads to their widespread accumulation within the lysosomes of various organs involving the eye, central nervous system, skeletal, ocular, nervous, respiratory, cardiac, and the gastrointestinal systems. Clinical spectrum varies from mild systemic and ocular abnormalities with a normal life span to severe phenotype, fatal in the first few months of life. Visual disability due to corneal clouding, retinopathy, and optic nerve involvement causes additional impairment of physical and cognitive functions. Treatment modalities such as bone marrow transplantation and enzyme replacement therapies help in increasing the life span as well as the quality of life of the affected patients. For patients with significant corneal clouding, keratoplasty is the answer. The decision to proceed with keratoplasty is governed by various factors such as the motivation of the patient and his family, other systemic affections and anesthesia concerns. A detailed preoperative counseling should be done regarding the expected visual outcomes in the presence of other ocular comorbidities and the postoperative complication such as graft re-opacification, rejection and glaucoma. Future treatment options such as targeted gene therapy and substrate reduction therapy hold promise to reverse corneal clouding, thereby obviating the need for corneal transplantation. These treatment therapies are still in the experimental stages and human trials are needed to validate their outcomes.

AB  - Simple Summary Exploring the barriers and facilitators of cervical cancer screening is essential to reduce the incidence and mortality, particularly in India. There is a paucity of studies presenting the mediation effects of known barriers and facilitators. The study investigates individual-level social barriers, facilitators, and the factors that mediate the relationships between suspected factors and cervical cancer screening. Understanding the mediation analysis and the effect of mediators will help us acquire a profound understanding of the mechanism of action, which will facilitate in devising strategies keeping the most important factor and their mediators in mind. Exploring the barriers and facilitators of cervical cancer screening (CCS) is essential to reduce the incidence and mortality, particularly in low and middle-income countries. The present study investigates the direct, indirect, and total effects of the barriers and facilitators on CCS in India through the generalized structural equation modeling using data from women files of the fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). Generalized structural equation models were used to quantify the hypothetical pathway via fitting a series of regression equations. Age, body mass index, religion, years of schooling, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, contraception use, lifetime number of sex partners, number of children, and wealth index were shown to have significant direct effects on the CCS. Older women had 1.16 times the odds of getting screened for cervical cancer as compared to their younger counterpart. The odds of CCS among the women in richest wealth quintile is 2.50 times compared to the poorest. Those who are aware of STIs have 1.39 times the odds of getting screened for cervical cancer. Wealth index, years of schooling, and religion have a substantial indirect and total impact on the CCS. The findings will aid in policy formulations for enhancing the CCS in India.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a slowly progressive and disabling disorder, so the cost of illness may change with time. We aimed this study to know the annual cost of care of PD in India. Methods: After ethics approval, a prospective cohort study was conducted at the movement disorder clinic of tertiary care hospital for 2 years (2014-2016). The outcomes were a description of the total annual direct cost of Parkinson's disease including health care as well as non-health care cost. We also did correlation analysis to know the determinants of the total cost. Results: A total of 200 consecutive patients of PD with 141 (70.50%) males and 59 (29.50%) females with a mean age of 56.84 +/- 10.51 years were enrolled. The annual Median Direct cost of care was INR 27,315.0 (IQR 13636.6-44908.4), whereas the Indirect cost was INR 21,400 (IQR 9800 - 96800). Cost on drugs (Direct health care) formed 68.50% (Median) of the total Direct cost. Total direct cost formed 11.38% of the Median total yearly income of our patients. Of the direct cost, the Median expenditure on drugs was INR 18,712.8 (8064.0 -30696.0). Only 5% of patients had health care insurance. The total direct cost was determined by the stage of Parkinson's disease and duration of disease (P = < 0.01) but not predicted by age, gender, age at onset, and the yearly income of patients. Conclusion: Annual cost of care of Parkinson's disease is high and increases with the duration of the disease as well as the progression of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: Pyogenic granulomas are benign vascular lesions of the skin and mucosa which are often a source of concern because of their recurrent bleeding even with minimal trauma. Current treatment for pyogenic granuloma is ablative; no medical therapy is standardized to date. Timolol, due to its vasoconstrictive effect, vascular growth factor inhibition and apoptosis promotion properties, is a potential therapeutic option. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of topical timolol in the treatment of pyogenic granulomas. Methods: A two-centre, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial (Registration CTRI/2019/04/018581) was conducted. Patients of either sex were recruited with pyogenic granuloma lesions of less than eight weeks duration. Topical treatment with 0.5% timolol or matching glycerin placebo was continued for six weeks. Changes in color, size, bleeding tendency, physicians' and patients' global assessments and adverse events were assessed. Results: Forty subjects were randomized between the two groups which were comparable in age, sex, duration of illness and baseline lesion size.Significant improvement was noted with timolol, with color change from first follow-up onwards and lesion size reduction from second follow-up onward. Patients' assessment of bleeding tendency also showed imrovement from the second visit onward. Between-group comparison showed significant difference with respect to percentage reduction in size (timolol 40.9%, placebo 3.4%; P = 0.002). Rescue treatment (electrosurgery) was required in five patients on placebo and in one in the timolol group (P = 0.182). Complete resolution occurred in 2 (10%) patients with timolol and in no patients on placebo (P = 0.231). Limitations: We observed effects of treatment for only six weeks. Conclusion: Topical timolol may be a treatment option for early pyogenic granulomas but complete resolution is unlikely in six weeks. Studies of longer duration are required to assess resolution and recurrence rates.

AB  - This study explored the profile of HIV positive patients seeking treatment at a tertiary care addiction treatment facility. A retrospective study was done to collet detailed information on clinical characteristics: drug use (type, age of initiation, duration), general medical condition and past treatment history. The study included 138 patients with mean (SD) age 30.2 (8.3) years. Opioid dependence with injecting drug use (IDU) was diagnosed in 97% of the patients. The median age of injecting onset was 24.5 years (IQR 20-31 years). The most frequently injected substances were pheniramine (60.1%) and buprenorphine (59.4%). Past treatment seeking was reported by 57% patients and interestingly they were less likely to present any medical condition (2 =69.611, p < 0.001). Variability in the age of onset of drug use indicates the need for broad based approach to prevent IDU and motivation to seek treatment may lead to better health conditions.

AB  - X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is a rare, recently characterized type of autophagic vacuolar myopathy caused by mutations in the VMA21 gene. It is characterized by slowly progressive weakness restricted to proximal limb muscles and generally has a favorable outcome. The characteristic histological and ultrastructural features distinguish this entity from other mimics, notably Danon disease. XMEA is an under recognized disease and should be considered in the differentials of slowly progressive myopathy in children. Awareness of this rare entity is also important for the pathologists in order to distinguish it from other causes of vacuolar myopathy in view of its favourable prognosis. We report the first genetically confirmed case of XMEA from India in an 8-year-old boy which was diagnosed based on the characteristic light microscopic and ultrastructural findings on muscle biopsy and subsequently confirmed by mutation analysis. The differential diagnostic considerations are also discussed.

AB  - Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease perceived as a motor disorder. It is most commonly associated with autonomic dysfunction, affecting multiple systems. This altered autonomic control might be reflected by a parallel change in the airway caliber of these patients. Aim: To correlate the pulmonary impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease with the underlying dysautonomia. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 patients with Parkinson's disease participated in the study. Heart rate (HR) variability was recorded for 5 min to assess the autonomic dysfunction, followed by impulse oscillometry (IOS) and spirometry. IOS being an effort independent technique uses sound waves at different frequencies (5-25 Hz) to measure the airway impedance. Results: There was a significant decrease in SDSD (6.60 (10.18-6.01) vs. 12.22 (13.95-11.30); P = 0.04), RMSSD (6.59 (10.17-5.50) vs. 12.20 (13.93-11.28); P = 0.04), and total power (315.8 (506.3-120.7) vs. 771.3 (799.0-643.6); P = 0.04) in stage II as compared to stage I. Resistance at 20 Hz (R20) was found to be positively correlated with SDSD (r = 0.40, P = 0.04), RMSSD (r = 0.40, P = 0.04), and HF (r = 0.41, P = 0.03). Conclusion: Amongst the PD population, any changes in the parasympathetic component (responsible for bronchoconstriction) due to the underlying dysautonomia might be reflected as increased airway resistance in the pulmonary system.

AB  - Background: Epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a rare but acute severe drug reaction associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.Aims: To describe the clinical, molecular, biochemical, and therapeutic profile of these patients.Methods: A total of 24 acute SJS/TEN patients were recruited during their hospital stay and detailed clinical history and treatment course recorded. Blood samples collected were subjected to DNA and serum separation for molecular and biochemical analysis.Results: Of 24 patients, 18 (75%) were females and six (25%) were males with six SJS, six SJS-TEN overlap, and 12 TEN cases. The inciting drugs were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (87.50%; n = 21) followed by antibiotics (66.67%; n = 16), antiepileptics (37.50%; n = 9), and others (37.50%; n = 9). Seventeen patients (77.2%) showed skin eruptions within 7 days after drug intake. Different co-morbidities were observed in 22 (91.6%) and 20 (83.3%) patients showed ocular manifestations. Length of hospital stay ranged from 8 to 55 days, 20 (83.3%) patients were treated with corticosteroids, and four (16.6%) received antimicrobial therapy. Interleukin polymorphisms revealed significantly low frequency of IL-4 in the patients, HLA-A locus typing revealed higher frequency of HLA-A*3301 (20.8%), HLA-A*02 (25%), HLA-A*2402 (14.6%), and sera showed raised levels of granulysin and sFas L in the patients compared to controls.Conclusions: The preliminary study illustrates the clinical, molecular, and biochemical features of acute SJS/TEN and provides a better understanding that helps to improve patient care at an earlier stage. It also highlights the use of corticosteroids and antimicrobial therapy for effective treatment of patients.

AB  - Patients with relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have a poor prognosis and a median overall survival of less than 6 months. Outcomes and responses were evaluated in 134 patients with DLBCL administered selinexor. Our findings demonstrate that selinexor treatment in DLBCL patients can safely induce durable responses and improve outcomes regardless of prior treatments and refractory status.
   Background: Despite a number of treatment options, patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) whose disease has become refractory to treatment have a poor prognosis. Selinexor is a novel, oral drug that is approved to treat patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL. In this post hoc analysis of the SADAL study, a multinational, open-label study, we evaluated subpopulations to determine if response to single agent selinexor is impacted by number of lines of prior treatment, autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), response to first and most recent therapies, and time to progressive disease. Patients: Patients (n = 134) with DLBCL after 2-5 prior therapies were enrolled in SADAL and received 60mg selinexor twice weekly. Results: The median overall survival was 9.0 months and median progression free survival was 2.6 months. Patients who had the best overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate were those who had prior ASCT (42.5% and 50.0%) or responded to last line of therapy (35.9% and 43.5%). Patients with primary refractory DLBCL also showed responses (ORR 21.8%). Adverse events between subgroups were similar to the overall study population, the most common being thrombocytopenia (29.1%), fatigue (7.5%), and nausea (6.0%). Conclusion: Regardless of prior therapy and disease refractory status, selinexor treatment demonstrated results consistent with its novel mechanism of action and lack of cross-resistance. Thus, single agent oral selinexor can induce deep, durable, and tolerable responses in patients with DLBCL who have recurrent disease after several chemoimmunotherapy combination regimens.

AB  - The LpqY-SugABC transporter of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) salvages residual trehalose across the cell membrane, which is otherwise lost during the formation of cell-wall glycoconjugates in the periplasm. LpqY, a substrate-binding protein from the SugABC transporter, acts as the primary receptor for the recognition of trehalose, leading to its transport across the cell membrane. Since trehalose is crucial for the survival and virulence of Mtb, trehalose receptors should serve as important targets for novel drug design against tuberculosis. In order to comprehend the detailed architecture and substrate specificity, the first crystal structures of both apo and trehalose-bound forms of M. tuberculosis LpqY (Mtb-LpqY) are presented here at 2.2 and 1.9 angstrom resolution, respectively. The structure exhibits an N-lobe and C-lobe and is predominantly composed of a globular alpha/beta domain connected by a flexible hinge region concealing a deep binding cleft. Although the trehalose-bound form of Mtb-LpqY revealed an open ligand-bound conformation, the glucose moieties of trehalose are seen to be strongly held in place by direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds within the binding cavity, producing a K-d of 6.58 +/- 1.21 mM. These interactions produce a distinct effect on the stereoselectivity for the alpha-1,1-glycosidic linkage of trehalose. Consistent with the crystal structure, molecular-dynamics simulations further validated Asp43, Asp97 and Asn151 as key residues responsible for strong and stable interactions throughout a 1 ms time frame, thus capturing trehalose in the binding cavity. Collectively, the results provide detailed insights into how the structure and dynamics of MtbLpqY enable it to specifically bind trehalose in a relaxed conformation state.

AB  - Background: H. pylori-associated gastritis in patients from the high-altitude area of Ladakh showed severe gastritis, mucosal nodularity, atrophy, and cancer in comparison to those from North India. This study served to analyze if differences in the H. pylori virulence genotypes decide the extent of gastric mucosal inflammation. Methods: Fifty gastric biopsies each from patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis from Ladakh and a tertiary care center in North India were included. The presence of H. pylori strain was confirmed with Warthin starry stain and polymerase chain amplification of the H. pylori-specific 16S rRNA. The cagA, vacA s1, s2, and m1, m2 alleles, and dupA virulence genotypes were studied in all archival samples, followed by their histological correlations. Results: cagA (P 0.009) and vacAs1 m1 (P 0.009) genes were distinctly more in H. pylori strains colonizing the biopsies of North Indian patients. In contrast, the cagA -ve vacAs2 m2 strains were significantly more in H. pylori strain colonizing the biopsies from Ladakhi patients. dupA genotype was almost similarly present in strains from both regions. Among these, only cagA and dupA virulence genes were associated with severe mucosal neutrophilic activity and deep infiltration of H. pylori strains in North Indian patients. Conclusions: Differences in virulence genotypes of H. pylori in gastric biopsies from North Indian and Ladakhi patients were found not significant in deciding the severity of H. pylori-associated gastritis.

AB  - Background The incidence of invasive disease caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) has increased in multiple countries in the past 15 years. However, despite these reports, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews and combined estimates of the incidence of invasive GAS have been done in key high-risk groups. To address this, we estimated the incidence of invasive GAS disease, including death and disability outcomes, among two high-risk groups-namely, pregnant women and children younger than 5 years.
   Methods We did a systematic review and meta-analyses on invasive GAS outcomes, including incidence, case fatality risks, and neurodevelopmental impairment risk, among pregnant women, neonates (younger than 28 days), infants (younger than 1 year), and children (younger than 5 years) worldwide and by income region. We searched several databases for articles published from Jan 1, 2000, to June 3, 2020, for publications that reported invasive GAS outcomes, and we sought unpublished data from an investigator group of collaborators. We included studies with data on invasive GAS cases, defined as laboratory isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes from any normally sterile site, or isolation of S pyogenes from a non-sterile site in a patient with necrotising fasciitis or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. For inclusion in pooled incidence estimates, studies had to report a population denominator, and for inclusion in pooled estimates of case fatality risk, studies had to report aggregate data on the outcome of interest and the total number of cases included as a denominator. We excluded studies focusing on groups at very high risk (eg, only preterm infants). We assessed heterogeneity with I-2.
   Findings Of the 950 published articles and 29 unpublished datasets identified, 20 studies (seven unpublished; 3829 cases of invasive GAS) from 12 countries provided sufficient data to be included in pooled estimates of outcomes. We did not identify studies reporting invasive GAS incidence among pregnant women in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) nor any reporting neurodevelopmental impairment after invasive GAS in LMICs. In nine studies from high-income countries (HICs) that reported invasive GAS in pregnancy and the post-partum period, invasive GAS incidence was 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.11 to 0.14; I-2 =100%). Invasive GAS incidence was 0.04 per 1000 livebirths (0.03 to 0.05; I-2 =100%; 11 studies) for neonates, 0.13 per 1000 livebirths (0.10 to 0.16; I-2 =100%; ten studies) for infants, and 0.09 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 0.07 to 0.10; I-2 =100%; nine studies) for children worldwide; 0.12 per 1000 livebirths (95% CI 0.00 to 0.24; I-2 =100%; three studies) in neonates, 0.33 per 1000 livebirths (-0.22 to 0.88; I-2 =100%; two studies) in infants, and 0.22 per 1000 person-years (0.13 to 0.31; I-2 =100%; two studies) in children in LMICs; and 0.02 per 1000 livebirths (0.00 to 0.03; I-2 =100%; eight studies) in neonates, 0.08 per 1000 livebirths (0.05 to 0.11; I-2 =100%; eight studies) in infants, and 0.05 per 1000 person-years (0.03 to 0.06;I-2 =100%; seven studies) in children for HICs. Case fatality risks were high, particularly among neonates in LMICs (61% [95% CI 33 to 89];I-2 =54%; two studies).
   Interpretation We found a substantial burden of invasive GAS among young children. In LMICs, little data were available for neonates and children and no data were available for pregnant women. Incidences of invasive GAS are likely to be underestimates, particularly in LMICs, due to low GAS surveillance. It is essential to improve available data to inform development of prevention and management strategies for invasive GAS. Copyright Crown Copyright (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: World report on vision makes integrated people-centered eye care as care model of choice. Integrating eye care with the existing public health system makes services available, accessible, affordable, and sustainable. Being from the community, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are better suited to improve people's eye health-seeking behavior.Objectives: This study aims to assess the eye care-seeking behavior of community and to understand their response toward the approach of integrated vision centers (VC) with ASHA involvement.Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in South Delhi district where integrated VC were functional for more than a year. These centers were supervised by medical officer in-charge, under whom ophthalmic assistants, ASHAs, auxiliary nurse midwives, and pharmacist work. ASHAs were trained in community-based primary eye care. The community survey was conducted on eye health-seeking behavior and utilization of VC services. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis.Results: Out of 1571 study participants, 998 reported any ophthalmic illness in family in the past 6 months as against 1302 who reported nonophthalmic illness in family. The majority (1461, 90%) were aware about integrated VC and half of them (748, 51.2%) visited it. Of them, 64.2% were motivated through ASHAs. ASHAs spread awareness about eye diseases, eye treatment facility, and referred patients from the community. The majority (93%) were happy with the integrated VC and 87.8% were happy with ASHAs. Conclusion: Integrated VC with ASHA engagement could pave the way for universal eye health. Understanding people's needs and engaging community would increase the demand for eye care.

AB  - Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein released from mucous secreting cells and neutrophils. LF can be used in a broad range of eye diseases related to the retina, cornea, and optic nerve. The retina is particularly affected by oxidative stress inside the photoreceptor being constantly exposed to light which induces accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) causing damage to photoreceptor recycling. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular degeneration are inherited retinopathies that consist of different disease-causing genes, that cause mutations with highly varied clinical consequences. Age-related macular degeneration is a chronic disease of the retina and one of the major causes of sight loss. This review provides an application of lactoferrin and LF-based nano-formulations or nanoparticles in the field of retinal diseases or corneal diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, retinoblastoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), keratoconus and uveitis. Several studies have found that lactoferrin's antibacterial activity is not limited to its iron sequestration, but also its ability as a nanoparticle that acts as a carrier to deliver drugs by crossing the blood-retina barrier (BRB) and its involvement in cell cycle control, which is not possible by many transferrin proteins.

KW  - neuroendoscopy
AB  - Background: Minimally invasive neurosurgery poses several challenges to surgeons due to constrained working environment, and its implications on the surgical outcome are an area of growing concern. The instrument handle design directly affects surgeon's performance, and the conventional ring handle causes ergonomic discomfort.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to design and validate a palm grasping-based ergonomic handle for skull-base neuroendoscopic instruments.
   Materials and Methods: The handle was designed based on the palm grasping technique and to naturally match the contours of hand. The ergonomic handle was fabricated and assembled with the end-effector of biopsy forceps. Fifteen participants with no experience of neuroendoscopic procedures validated the ergonomic handle. During data collection, participants performed the ring transfer task on straight, right tilt (+30 degrees) and left tilt (-30 degrees) of activity plates of neuro-endo-trainer (NET) with 0 degrees and 30 degrees endoscopes.
   Results: Feedback from participants indicated that there was significant improvement in degree of discomfort in performing the task on straight (P = 0.006) and tilted plate (P = 0.001) and degree of pain (0.0001) using the ergonomic handle. Furthermore, video analysis of the performed task shows that there was statistical improvement in hitting events (P = 0.001, P = 0.04), tugging events (P = 0.00001, P = 0.00001,) and picking attempts (P = 0.04, P = 0.0004) on straight and tilted plates, respectively. There was reduction in ring drop, jerk, and average moving time, but results were not significant.
   Conclusion: The subjective validation of ergonomic handle by neurosurgeons shows that the designed handle offers ergonomic advantages. Objective validation by video analysis shows that the ergonomic handle results in better task performance on NET surgical trainer.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of immunological factors responsible for discordant virological responses postcombination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive children aged < 5 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunological profiling of enrolled 30 HIV-positive children was done at enrollment, 6 and 12 months. Flow cytometric analysis was performed for enumeration of counts and percentage of CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD19(+ )cells; expression of CD19, CD86, PD-1, CD3, CD8 and CD28 on lymphocytes was evaluated using whole blood staining technique with monoclonal antibodies. HIV-1 viral load was quantified using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Serum levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin A (IgA), immunoglobulin (IgM), and interleukin (IL)-7 were quantitated using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The HIV-infected children were categorized into virological responders (VRs; HIV-1 plasma viral load < 47 copies/mL) and virological nonresponders (VNRs; HIV-1 plasma viral load > 1000 copies/mL) following 1-year cART. RESULTS: The frequency of CD28+ CTLs cells was higher (P < 0.0001), and the frequency of CD28-CTLs cells was lower (P < 0.0001) in VRs than VNRs. CD28+ and CD28-CTLs cells correlated with HIV-1 plasma viremia (r = -0.4695, P = 0.01; r = 0.40, P = 0.03, respectively). VRs had higher CD19 percentage (P = 0.04) and count (P = 0.01) than VNRs. CD19+ B cells in the VRs had lower expression of CD86 (P = 0.03) and PD-1 (P = 0.002) than VNRs. VR had lower levels of serum IgG (P = 0.03), IgM (P = 0.04), and IL-7 (P = 0.01) than VNRs. CONCLUSIONS: High baseline B-cell counts, lower serum IgG, IgM, IL-7 levels, lower activation and exhaustion of B cells, and higher frequency of CD28+ CTLs are associated with positive virological response, whereas elevated CD28-CTLs are associated with the poor virological outcomes in HIV-infected children.

AB  - Site-specific drug delivery has the potential to reduce drug dosage by 3- to 5-folds. Given the propensity of drugs used in the treatment of tuberculosis and cancers, the increased drug dosages via oral ingestion for several months to a few years of medication is often detrimental to the health of patients. In this study, the sustained delivery of drugs with multiscale structured novel Neovius lattices was achieved. 3D Neovius open cell lattices (NOCL) with porosities of 40%, 45%, and 50% were fabricated layer-by-layer on the laser bed fusion process. Micron-sized Ti6Al4V ELI powder was used for 3D printing. The Young's modulus achieved from the novel Neovius lattices were in the range of 1.2-1.6 GPa, which is comparable to human cortical bone and helps to improve implant failure due to the stress shielding effect. To provide sustained drug delivery, nanotubes (NTs) were fabricated on NOCLs via high-voltage anodization. The osteogenic agent icariin was loaded onto the NOCL-NT samples and their release profiles were studied for 7 d. A significantly steady and slow release rate of 0.05% per hour of the drug was achieved using NOCL-NT. In addition, the initial burst release of NOCL-NT was 4 fold lower than that of the open-cell lattices without NTs. Cellular studies using MG63 human osteoblast-like cells were performed to determine their biocompatibility and osteogenesis which were analyzed using Calcein AM staining and Alamar Blue after 1, 5, and 7 d. 3D printed NOCL samples with NTs and with Icariin loaded NTs demonstrated a significant increase in cell proliferation as compared to as printed NOCL samples.

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Background: Lack of pediatric triage and emergency care system in peripheral healthcare centers leads to unnecessary referral of low-and medium-risk patients. This study was conducted to study the risk factors predicting mortality within 48 h of admission in neonates and under-five children referred to the pediatric emergency of a tertiary care hospital in India. Methods: This prospective study was conducted on children (0-5 years) referred to the pediatric emergency who were enrolled and followed up. The outcome was defined as "survival" or "death" at 48 hours. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the predictors of early in-hospital mortality. Results: A total of 246 consecutive pediatric (62 neonates, 52 young infants, and 132 children aged 1-5 years) referral cases were enrolled; mortality within 48 hours was 20%. Lack of pediatric intensive care (odds ratio [OR] 4.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0, 8.32, P = 0.02), lack of neonatal intensive care (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.01,4.28, P = 0.001), distance from referral center >20 km (OR 4.61, 95% CI 2.01, 10.58, P = 0.0003), >1 h taken during transport (OR 7.75, 95% CI 2.93, 20.46, P < 0.001), lack of ambulance facility (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.009, 0.143, P < 0.0001), very sick condition on arrival (OR 210.1, 95% CI 12.1, 3643.41, P = 0.0002), and unstable temperature-oxygenation-perfusion-sugar on arrival were the independent risk factors predicting in early in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Developing a pediatric triage and monitoring system, tele-pediatric intensive care unit, regionalizing referral-back-referral services with robust interhospital communication, and strengthening pediatric emergency services are the need of the hour to reduce early in-hospital mortality.

TI  - Willingness of medical students to volunteer during the Covid-19 pandemic: Assessment at a tertiary care hospital in India
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - INFLUENZA
KW  - EPIDEMIC
AB  - Background. The involvement of medical students in strategies to control Covid-19 might be considered to cope with the shortage of healthcare workers. We assessed the knowledge about Covid-19, willingness to volunteer, potential areas of involvement and reasons for hesitation among medical students towards volunteering.
   Methods. We did this cross-sectional study among undergraduate students at a tertiary care teaching hospital in New Delhi. We used a web-based questionnaire to elicit demographic information, knowledge of Covid-19, willingness to volunteer and reasons deterring them from working during the Covid-19 pandemic, and self-declared knowledge in six domains.
   Results. A total of 292 students participated in the study with a mean (SD) age of 19.9 (3.1) years. The mean (SD) knowledge score of Covid-19 was 6.9 (1.1) (maximum score 10). Knowledge score was significantly different among preclinical (6.5), paraclinical (7.18) and clinical groups (7.03). Almost three-fourth (75.3%) participants were willing to volunteer in the Covid-19 pandemic, though 67.8% had not received any training in emergency medicine or public health crisis management. Willingness to work was maximum in areas of social work and indirect patient care (62.3% each). Lack of personal protective equipment was cited as a highly deterring factor for volunteering (62.7%) followed by fear of transmitting the infection to family members (45.9%), fear of causing harm to the patient (34.2%) and the absence of available treatment (22.2%).
   Conclusions. A majority of the students were willing to volunteer even though they had not received adequate training. Students may serve as an auxiliary force during the pandemic, especially in non-clinical settings.

AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most prevalent life-threatening blood monogenic disorder. Currently, there is no cure available, apart from bone marrow transplantation. Early and efficient diagnosis of SCD is key to disease management, which would make considerable strides in alleviating morbidity and reducing mortality. However, the cost and complexity of diagnostic procedures, such as the Sanger sequencing method, impede the early detection of SCD in a resource-limited setting. To address this, the current study demonstrates a simple and efficient proof-of-concept assay for the detection of patients and carriers using extraction-free non-invasive buccal swab samples by isothermal DNA Amplification coupled Restrictase-mediated cleavage (iDAR). This study is a first of its kind reporting the use of buccal swab specimens for iDA in molecular diagnosis of a genetic disease, all the while being cost effective and time saving, with the total assay time of around 150 min at a cost of USD 5. Further, iDAR demonstrates 91.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity for detecting all three alleles: SS, AS, and AA, having a 100% concordance with Sanger sequencing. The applicability of the iDAR assay is further demonstrated with its adaptation to a one-pot reaction format, which simplifies the assay system. Overall, iDAR is a simple, cost-effective, precise, and non-invasive assay for SCD screening, with the potential for use in a limited resource setting.

AB  - Aims: To compare the predicted response with observed response to treatment by measuring gross tumor volume-primary (GTVp) using onboard kilovoltage (kV) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), to analyze the serial tumor volumes during radiotherapy (RT) with serial tumor volumes during follow-up, and to identify the variables associated with survival outcomes. Materials and Methods: Between June 2017 and December 2019, 23 patients of histologically proven locally advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) received definitive chemoradiation. Serial kV-CBCT images X-ray volume imaging (XVI) were generated weekly for image guidance and were used to generate serial GTVp. Posttreatment follow-up images were used to generate follow-up GTVp. Relative volume regression (VR) during RT and relative response assessment (RA) during follow-up were defined from Avg Vol, of planning CT. The predicted progression model was generated from VR and analyzed against observed progression events. Regression-response model was generated to analyze VR against RA. Results: The median XVI vol(1), XVI vol(2), and XVI vol3 were 78.123, 56.571, and 48.513 cc during the 2nd, 4th, and 6th weeks of RT, respectively. The median VR0 was 11.777% in the 2nd-week, VR1 was 20.959% in the 4th week, and 33.661% in the 6th week. The predicted responders and progression using the VR were similar to the observed response during the follow-up. The prediction of both RA(0) and RA(1) obtained from VR2 was statistically significant. Predication of RA(0) from VR1 tended towards significant (P=0.084). VR2 was statistically significant in predicting RA2 (P = 0.04). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached and the median overall survival (OS) was 24.2 months (95% confidence interval, 20.3-28.2 months). There was no statistically significant difference in PFS and OS between Avg Vol <= 99.5 cc and > 99.5 cc or other clinical parameters. Conclusions: Tumor regression during RT is a potential predictor of response in LA-NSCLC. kV-CBCT is a strong tool in assessing tumor regression during RT.

AB  - Transfemoral amputee often encounters reduced toe clearance resulting in trip-related falls. Swing-phase joint angles have been shown to influence the toe clearance; therefore, training intervention that targets shaping the swing phase joint angles can potentially enhance toe clearance. The focus of this study was to investigate the effect of the shift in the location of the center of pressure (CoP) during heel strike on modulation of the swing-phase joint angles in able-bodied participants (n = 6) and transfemoral amputees (n = 3). We first developed a real-time CoP-based visual feedback system such that participants could shift the CoP during treadmill walking. Next, the kinematic data were collected during two different walking sessions-baseline (without feedback) and feedback (shifting the CoP anteriorly/posteriorly at heel strike to match the target CoP location). Primary swing-phase joint angle adaptations were observed with feedback such that during the midswing phase, posterior CoP shift feedback significantly increases (p < 0.05) the average hip and knee flexion angle by 11.55 deg and 11.86 deg, respectively, in amputees, whereas a significant increase (p < 0.05) in ankle dorsiflexion, hip and knee flexion angle by 3.60 deg, 3.22 deg, and 1.27 deg, respectively, compared to baseline was observed in able-bodied participants. Moreover, an opposite kinematic adaptation was seen during anterior CoP shift feedback. Overall, results confirm a direct correlation between the CoP shift and the modulation in the swing-phase lower limb joint angles.

AB  - Data on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), in chronic kidney disease (CKD) are scarce. In a prospective interventional study, the effect of vitamin D supplementation on cFGF23 (C-terminal FGF23) levels in children with CKD stages 2-4 was examined. Forty-one children with CKD and vitamin D insufficiency were administered 600,000 units of cholecalciferol over 3 d; 88% of patients achieved sufficiency at 8 wk. Significant increase in serum cFGF23 and phosphate levels was observed in CKD stage 2 after supplementation, but not in CKD stages 3 and 4. There was no correlation of the change in cFGF23 level with baseline or change in bone health parameters (calcium, phosphate, parathormone or alkaline phosphatase) or with change in flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery. It is concluded that cholecalciferol supplementation increases serum calcium and reduces PTH, but does not adversely affect FGF23 levels in CKD.

AB  - Objective: This multi-center randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a context-specific transition intervention program to improve clinic visit adherence and clinical outcomes among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Delhi, India. Methods: We will recruit patients with T1DM of duration >= 1 year and age 15-19.5 years from the participating pediatric sites. After a baseline assessment and a "basic introductory session", which apprises participants about the concept of transition, study participants (proposed sample size =156) will be randomly allocated into an intervention and control arm. Participants in the intervention arm will receive a structured transition program delivered over 15 months. On the other hand, control arm participants will continue to receive usual care from the pediatric site till the time of transfer to the adult site. The study assessments will be done at baseline, at the time of transfer, and at 1 and 2 years following the transfer. The primary outcome is the difference in clinic attendance rate between intervention and control arms at the end of 1 year post-transfer. The secondary outcomes include the difference in clinic attendance rate at the end of 2 years, the difference in proportion of participants with a minimum of 4 visits in the first follow-up year, and process indicators such as diabetes knowledge and self-management skills, diabetes treatment satisfaction, overall quality of life, diabetes-related distress, hospitalization for acute complications and screening for chronic diabetes complications, and HbA1c. Conclusion: This study will provide important new evidence about a potential strategy to improve clinical care among adolescents and emerging adults with T1DM in lower resource contexts during the vulnerable phase of transition from pediatric to adult healthcare. The trial is registered on the Clinical Trials Registry of India (http://ctri.nic.in) under the CTRI registration number CTRI/2020/10/028379.

AB  - Background Femoral shaft fracture in patients of post-polio syndrome (PPS) represents an uncommon yet complex injury pattern. Poorly developed soft-tissue envelope, decreased muscle bulk, reduced vascularity, regional osteopenia, joint contractures, and altered bony anatomy impose significant surgical challenges. Thorough pre-operative planning is imperative as each case requires individualized approach and method of fixation. The aim of the study was to analyze the clinical outcomes in such patients following fracture fixation and to assess the surgical challenges encountered and provide solutions. Materials and Methods A retrospective case series of 33 patients with femoral shaft fracture in PPS limbs was undertaken. Mode of injury, method of fixation, surgical time, intra-operative blood loss, union time, and complications were recorded. Results Low-energy fall was the most common mechanism of injury (73%). Thirty-three patients underwent fixation with intramedullary nailing being the most common mode (79%). Femoral canal diameter, femoral bow, fracture location and morphology and clinical deformities of the patients are key governing factors that determine the choice of implant. Locking plates, pre-contoured anatomical plates, and titanium elastic nailing system offer an alternative in patients unsuitable for nailing. With no difference between various implants, average time for bone healing was 13.8 +/- 4.4 weeks. All patients resumed full weight-bearing mobilization and returned to pre-injury activity status at the end of 6 months post-surgery. Conclusion With detailed pre-operative work-up, contemplating intra-operative difficulties, individualized surgical plan, careful handling of soft tissues, and availability of back-up implants, good clinical outcomes can be achieved in femur fractures in PPS patients.

AB  - The management of traumatic dental injury aims at functional and esthetic rehabilitation. After luxation injury, a displaced tooth must be replaced into its normal position as soon as possible. Incorrect tooth repositioning can cause discomfort to the patient and compromise the outcome. This report documents a novel digital technology-based approach for the management of teeth following luxation injury with displacement. A 25-year-old female reported 2 days after traumatic dental injury to her maxillary right central incisor tooth #8. After clinical and radiographic examination, a diagnosis of lateral luxation of tooth #8 was made. The preoperative high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image data set confirmed palatal luxation of tooth #8 with fractured and displaced labial cortical plate. The CBCT data were imported into a medical image processing software program, and a segmentation tool was used to segment the fractured cortical plate, luxated tooth, and alveolar process. The socket is reconstructed by realigning fractured cortical bone over the alveolar process and repositioning the tooth in the virtual planning software. A three-dimensional (3D) guiding template was designed over the repositioned tooth and adjacent teeth and printed. This 3D printed guide was used for the repositioning of luxated tooth #8 and stabilizing it during the splinting procedure. This technique of using CBCT and 3D guide for repositioning is an objective, precise, and predictable approach. The 3D printed model of the dental arch after virtual tooth alignment can be used by the dentist to determine the exact splint length and contour before splinting.

AB  - PURPOSE To evaluate the severity of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) among children born of consanguineous marriage.
   METHODS In this case-control study, the medical records of unrelated consanguineous patients and unrelated nonconsanguineous (control) PCG patients seen at a single tertiary eye care facility were retrospectively reviewed. Those with a minimum of 5 years' follow-up were included. Data collected included age at presentation, corneal diameter, axial length, corneal haze at presentation and its persistence after surgery, need for repeat surgery, and final visual acuity.
   RESULTS A total of 130 PCG patients were included: 30 patients born of consanguineous marriage and 100 nonconsanguineous control patients. The median age of presentation for consanguineous cases was 3 months (range, 1-36) compared with 10 months (range, 2-24) for nonconsanguineous cases (P<0.001). Mean corneal diameter for consanguineous cases was 13 +/- 0.82 mm and for nonconsanguineous cases was 12.41mm +/- 1.18 mm (P=0.002). Consanguineous cases also had a significantly higher prevalence of corneal haze persisting after surgery (P<0.001) and need for repeat IOP-lowering surgery (P=0.039). The consanguineous group had 44 eyes (73%) with severe PCG compared with 69 (34.5%) in the nonconsanguineous group (P<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS In this study cohort, children with PCG born of consanguineous parents were more severely affected at presentation compared with children born of nonconsanguineous parents; they also had poorer outcomes with IOP-lowering surgery independent of severity at presentation. It is however possible that a founder effect with consanguinity over multiple generations could account for our observations.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a heterogeneous plasma cell proliferative disorder that arises from its premalignant precursor stages through a complex cascade of interactions between clonal mutations and co-evolving microenvironment. The temporo-spatial evolutionary trajectories of MM are established early during myelomatogenesis in precursor stages and retained in MM. Such molecular events impact subsequent disease progression and clinical outcomes. Identification of clonal sweeps of actionable gene targets in MM could reveal potential vulnerabilities that may exist in early stages and thus potentiate prognostication and customization of early therapeutic interventions. We have evaluated clonal evolution at multiple time points in 76 MM patients enrolled in the MMRF CoMMpass study. The major findings of this study are (a) MM progresses predominantly through branching evolution, (b) there is a heterogeneous spectrum of mutational landscapes that include unique actionable gene targets at diagnosis compared to progression, (c) unique clonal gains/ losses of mutant driver genes can be identified in patients with different cytogenetic aberrations, (d) there is a significant correlation between co-occurring oncogenic mutations/ co-occurring subclones e.g., with mutated TP53+SYNE1, NRAS+MAGI3, and anticorrelative dependencies between FAT3+FCGBP gene pairs. Such co-trajectories may synchronize molecular events of drug response, myelomatogenesis and warrant future studies to explore their potential for early prognostication and development of risk stratified personalized therapies in MM.

AB  - Maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection can adversely affect the birth and neonatal outcomes. The authors prospectively enrolled 196 neonates born to 193 SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers to determine the rate of mother-to-baby transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on short-term neonatal outcomes in Indian population. Nineteen babies turned out to be RT-PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2, carrying a perinatal transmission rate of 9.8%. Rates of prematurity and low birth weight were 12.8% and 18.9% in the neonatal group, respectively. On comparing SARS-CoV-2-positive (n = 19) and negative (n = 177) neonatal groups, rate of prematurity, hospital admission rate, and death rate were higher in the former group. The placental positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 8.1%, but no relation was found between placental and neonatal infection.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Preparations derived from the plant Calotropis procera, have been used for medicinal purpose though the plant is known for its toxic effects. The aerial parts of the plant contain latex in plenty and have been found effective in treating disorders of gastrointestinal system and cancER.
   Aim of the study: This study evaluated the efficacy of C. procera dried latex extract prepared in methanol (MeDL) against inflammation and oxidative stress in experimental model of colorectal carcinoma (CRC).
   Materials and methods: Two subcutaneous injections of chemical carcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH; 150 mg/kg) were given at an interval of one week to induce CRC in rats. The MeDL (50 and 150 mg/kg) and aspirin (60 mg/kg) were given daily and their effect was evaluated on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation after completion of 8 weeks following second injection of carcinogen. A comparison was made with normal and experimental control groups. The colon tissue levels of glutathione (GSH), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), nitrite and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to determine the levels of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNIF-alpha) and immunohistochemical analysis was performed for IL-1 beta.
   Results: Induction of cancerous changes in the colon resulted in altered oxidative homeostasis as evident from a reduction in GSH level and SOD activity and rise in TBARS level when compared with normal rats. Elevated levels of nitrite, MPO, TNIF-alpha, PGE(2) and immunoreactivity of IL-1 beta were also observed in these rats. The levels of these markers were normalized when the rats were treated with MeDL or anti-inflammatory drug, aspirin.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation contributes to the beneficial effect of MeDL in rat model of colon carcinogenesis.

AB  - Nutritional vitamin D deficiency is the most frequent cause of rickets followed by genetic causes, that include entities like classic hypophosphatemic rickets (FGF23 related), Dent disease, Fanconi syndrome, renal tubular acidosis, and vitamin D dependent rickets. Hypophosphatemia is a feature in all these forms. The diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical, biochemical and radiological features, but genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. We screened 66 patients with hypophosphatemic rickets referred to this center between May 2015 and July 2019 using whole exome sequencing (WES) in addition to the measurement of their intact serum fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) levels. WES revealed 36 pathogenic and 28 likely pathogenic variants in 16 different genes (PHEX, FGF23, DMP1, ENPP1, CLCN5, CTNS, SLC2A2, GATM, SLC34A1, EHHADH, SLC4A1, ATP6V1B1, ATP6V0A4, CYP27B1, VDR and FGFR1) in 63 patients which helped differentiate between the various forms of hypophosphatemic rickets. Intact serum FGF23 levels were significantly higher in patients with variations in PHEX, FGF23, DMP1 or ENPP1 genes. The major genetic causes of rickets were classic hypophosphatemic rickets with elevated FGF23 levels, distal renal tubular acidosis, and vitamin D dependent rickets. Based on the present results, we propose a customized gene panel for targeted exome sequencing, which will be useful for confirming the diagnosis in most patients with hypophosphatemic rickets.

AB  - Carcinogens present in smokeless tobacco (SLT) like tobacco-specific nitrosamines can be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme. Functionally, the CYP450 enzyme resides in a heme pigment to perform the catalytic activity. The CYP1A1 is one of the main extrahepatic CYP450 enzymes known to detoxify toxic substances and activate carcinogens. The CYP1A1 inhibition by potential inhibitors reduce the chance of oral cancer. The current study aimed to explore more about the inhibitor binding site and identification of lead alkaloids, that could work as putative inhibitors against target CYP1A1. In respect, we have performed docking studies, virtual screening of alkaloids, and natural product libraries against CYP1A1 followed by molecular dynamic simulations and binding free energy calculations. Docking studies of tobacco-specific nitrosamine (TSNA) products and their similar carcinogen analogs revealed that the heme group is bound to the floor of the bowl-shaped cavity whereas carcinogens are bound to the roof of the rounded shape cavity. Furthermore, virtual screening and binding free energy calculations revealed Tomatidine as a putative inhibitor against CYP1A1. On the basis of altogether outcomes of the current study, we have concluded that the addition of lead-hit alkaloid Tomatidine and others in SLT products may be working as a supplement that could be able to reduce the expression of human CYP1A1 and suppresses carcinogenic by-products formations.

AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) pose major challenges for treatment due to the acquired, adaptive, and intrinsic resistance developed by the bacteria. Accumulation of mutations, the ability to form biofilms, and the presence of lipopolysaccharides in the outer bacterial membranes are the key mechanisms of drug resistance. Here, we show that a polyaspartate-derived synthetic antimicrobial polymer (SAMP) with a hexyl chain (TAC6) is an effective adjuvant for a hydrophobic antibiotic, rifampicin. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that the combination of TAC6 and rifampicin is effective against clinically isolated multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa. Membrane permeabilization studies showed that TAC6 allows the permeabilization of bacterial membranes, and the accumulation of rifampicin inside the cells, thereby enhancing its activity. The combination of TAC6 and rifampicin can also degrade the P. aeruginosa biofilms, and therefore can mitigate the adaptive resistance developed by bacteria. We further demonstrated that the combination of TAC6 and rifampicin can clear P. aeruginosa-mediated wound infections effectively. Therefore, our study showed polyaspartate-derived SAMP to be an effective antibiotic adjuvant against P. aeruginosa infections.

AB  - Background High pharyngo-esophageal strictures following corrosive ingestion continue to pose a challenge to the surgeon, particularly in the developing world. With the advancements and increased experience with microsurgical techniques, free jejunal flaps offer a viable reconstruction option in patients with high corrosive strictures with previous failed reconstruction. We review our experience with free jejunal flap in three cases with high pharyngo-esophageal stricture following corrosive ingestion, with previous failed reconstruction. Materials and methods A total of three patients underwent salvage free jejunal flap after failed reconstruction for high pharyngo-esophageal strictures following corrosive acid ingestion. All the three patients developed anastomotic leak and subsequent stricture, two following a pharyngo-gastric anastomosis and one following a pharyngo-colic anastomosis. The strictured segment was bridged using a free jejunal graft with microvascular anastomosis to the lingual artery and common facial vein. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals. Results and conclusions The strictured pharyngeal anastomotic segment was successfully reconstructed with free jejunal flap in all the three patients. Patients were able to take food orally and maintain nutrition without the need of jejunostomy feeding. On long-term follow-up (median: 5 years), there was no recurrence of dysphagia and all the patients had good health-related quality of life.

AB  - The high prevalence and persistence of microplastics (MPs) in pristine habitats along with their accumulation across environmental compartments globally, has become a matter of grave concern. The resilience conferred to MPs using the material engineering approaches for outperforming other materials has become key to the challenge that they now represent. The characteristics that make MPs hazardous are their micro to nano scale dimensions, surface varied wettability and often hydrophobicity, leading to non-biodegradability. In addition, MPs exhibit a strong tendency to bind to other contaminants along with the ability to sustain extreme chemical conditions thus increasing their residence time in the environment. Adsorption of these co-contaminants leads to modification in toxicity varying from additive, synergistic, and sometimes antagonistic, having consequences on flora, fauna, and ultimately the end of the food chain, human health. The resulting environmental fate and associated risks of MPs, therefore greatly depend upon their complex interactions with the co-contaminants and the nature of the environment in which they reside. Net outcomes of such complex interactions vary with core characteristics of MPs, the properties of co-contaminants and the abiotic factors, and are required to be better understood to minimize the inherent risks. Toxicity assays addressing these concerns should be ecologically relevant, assessing the impacts at different levels of biological organization to develop an environmental perspective. This review analyzed and evaluated 171 studies to present research status on MP toxicity. This analysis supported the identification and development of research gaps and recommended priority areas of research, accounting for disproportionate risks faced by different countries. An ecological perspective is also developed on the environmental toxicity of contaminated MPs in the light of multi-variant stressors and directions are provided to conduct an ecologically relevant risk assessment. The presented analyses will also serve as a foundation for developing environmentally appropriate remediation methods and evaluation frameworks.

AB  - T1 and T2 mapping techniques on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) provide insights into the myocardial tissue characterisation. We sought to establish the normal reference values of native T1 and T2 mapping in Indian population which can be used subsequently in clinical practice for addressing various cardiac pathologies. This prospective study included consecutive healthy volunteers (18-60 years) who underwent CMR on a 1.5 Tesla scanner using standard protocol. T1 mapping sequence was performed using MOLLI sequence with two different flip angles (FA) (35 degrees and 50 degrees). T2 mapping was performed using a hybrid gradient and spin-echo sequence sequence with two different FA (70 degrees and 12 degrees). Images were analysed with ROIs drawn in all the 16 AHA myocardial segments. 50 volunteers (average age-34 years, males-72%) were included. All the scans were normal. The mean T1 value at 35-degree FA was 946.86 + 14.16 ms and at 50-degree FA was 941.60 + 11.89 ms. The mean T2 mapping value at 70-degree FA was 45.67 + 1.39 ms and at 12-degree FA was 45.61 + 1.47 ms. The mapping values were not statistically different between males and females (all p > 0.2). The T1 and T2 mapping values did not show any significant correlation with LVEF, age, BMI or heart rate (all r < 0.33). The T1 mapping values significantly differ at 35- and 50-degree FAs (p = 0.002). The results establish the normal reference T1 and T2 mapping value for Indian population in institutes using the same protocol and parameters at 1.5 Tesla and may guide future research.

AB  - Purpose To highlight the magnitude of ocular higher order aberrations (HOA) and lower order aberrations (LOA), including component contributions from corneal and internal planes in Primary Congenital Glaucoma (PCG) patients. Methods Consecutive treated PCG patients co-operative for ocular examination and aberrometry, were enrolled over two years for this cross-sectional, comparative, single-center, unmasked study. Best-corrected visual acuity, refraction, IOP, wavefront aberrometry and topography (iTrace) were performed and results were compared with unaffected fellow eyes of unilateral glaucoma patients as well as age and sex-matched controls with no ocular anomalies other than treatable refractive error. Results Both eyes of 32 consecutive PCG patients (17 unilateral, 15 bilateral) and 39 controls were enrolled. The median LogMAR corrected distance visual acuity of PCG eyes was 0.68 (IQR: 0.2-1.8). Total ocular (Root mean square (RMS) 1.7 mu m vs 0.3 mu m, p = 0.014), corneal (RMS 1.1 mu m vs 0.3 mu m, p = 0.004) and internal (RMS 1.1 mu m vs 0.2 mu m, p = 0.013) aberrations, as well as HOAs and LOAs at each plane, were significantly higher in PCG eyes than in controls. Component HOAs from corneal and internal planes were positively correlated with each other (p < 0.001; rs: 0.7). Total aberrations were greater in the affected eyes of PCG compared to the rest. The predominant subtype of HOAs in PCG was coma and trefoil. PCG with corneal opacity/Haab's striae had significantly higher astigmatism than the affected eyes with clear corneae at the corneal plane (p = 0.02). The aberrations were not statistically associated with the corneal diameter or refractive error in PCG eyes. Conclusions Significantly greater aberrations (Total, HOAs and LOAs, at corneal as well as an internal plane) were seen among eyes affected with PCG. Though the exact impact of these aberrations on the final visual outcome is difficult to determine, these could play a pertinent role in compromising visual function, thus impacting the management of visual rehabilitation in these patients.

AB  - Introduction: The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis is not well known. The magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in rheumatoid arthritis demonstrates non-specific findings, and in the majority of cases, magnetic resonance imaging fails to detect an abnormality, even in rheumatoid arthritis patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations. Therefore, we aimed to assess microstructural integrity changes of white matter in patients with rheumatoid arthritis by using different diffusion tensor imaging parameters.
   Methods: Eighteen rheumatoid arthritis patients (10 with neuropsychiatric symptoms and 8 without any neuropsychiatric symptoms) and 14 controls were included. The volume of the T2 hyperintense lesions was assessed. Different diffusion tensor imaging parameters such as fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficient, trace, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were obtained from six different regions of white matter. Inter group significant difference was determined by one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. The accuracy of diffusion tensor imaging matrices was evaluated from the receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Results: No significant difference in lesions' volume was detected between rheumatoid arthritis patients with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms. There was an increased apparent diffusion coefficient and radial diffusivity (p < 0.05) as well as decreased fractional anisotropy and axial diffusivity (p < 0.5) in rheumatoid arthritis patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms compared to controls. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (p < .05) was increased in both positive and negative MRI of patients with neuropsychiatric features compared to the control group. The sensitivity and specificity of the apparent diffusion coefficient parameters was 73% and 72%, respectively.
   Conclusions: The various anisotropic metrics were altered in rheumatoid arthritis patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms by using diffusion tensor imaging analysis, representing that central nervous system vasculitis leads to tissue hypoxia resulting in vasogenic edema. This may lead to axonal and myelin degeneration of white matter fibers and neuronal cell disruption.

AB  - Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers the most lethal characteristics to cancer cells i.e., metastasis and resistance to chemo-and-radio-therapy, and therefore exhibit an appealing target in the field of oncology. Research in the past decade has demonstrated the crucial role of aerobic glycolysis in EMT, which is generally credited as the glucose metabolism for the creation of biomass such as fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleotides thereby providing building blocks for limitless proliferation. In the present review, apart from discussing EMT's evident role in the metastatic process and cancer stemness, we also talked about the vital role of glycolytic enzymes viz. GLUTs, HKs, PGI, PFK-1, aldolase, enolase, PK, LDHA, etc. in the induction of the EMT process in cancerous cells.

AB  - Aging has been reported to deteriorate the quantity and quality of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which affect their therapeutic use in regenerative medicine. A dearth of age-related stem cell research further restricts their clinical applications. The present study explores the possibility of using MSCs derived from human gingival tissues (GMSCs) for studying their ex vivo growth characteristics and differentiation potential with respect to donor age. GMSCs displayed decreased in vitro adipogenesis and in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis with age, but in vitro neurogenesis remained unaffected. An increased expression of p53 and SIRT1 with donor age was correlated to their ability of eliminating tumorigenic events through apoptosis or autophagy, respectively. Irrespective of donor age, GMSCs displayed effective immunoregulation and regenerative potential in a mouse model of LPS-induced acute lung injury. Thus, we suggest the potential of GMSCs for designing cell-based immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches and their further extrapolation for acute inflammatory conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19.

AB  - Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) gene Rv1515c encodes a conserved hypothetical protein exclusively present within organisms of MTB complex and absent in non-pathogenic mycobacteria. In silico analysis revealed that Rv1515c contain S-adenosylmethionine binding site and methyltransferase domain. The DNA binding and DNA methyltransferase activity of Rv1515c was confirmed in vitro. Knock-in of Rv1515c in a model mycobacteria M. smegmatis (M. s_Rv1515c) resulted in remarkable physiological and morphological changes and conferred the recombinant strain with an ability to adapt to various stress conditions, including resistance to TB drugs. M. s_Rv1515c was phagocytosed at a greater rate and displayed extended intra-macrophage survival in vitro. Recombinant M. s_Rv1515c contributed to enhanced virulence by suppressing the host defense mechanisms including RNS and ROS production, and apoptotic clearance. M. s_Rv1515c, while suppressing the phagolysosomal maturation, modulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and also inhibited antigen presentation by downregulating the expression of MHC-I/MHC-II and co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86. Mice infected with M. s_Rv1515c produced more Treg cells than vector control (M. s_Vc) and exhibited reduced effector T cell responses, along-with reduced expression of macrophage activation markers in the chronic phase of infection. M. s_Rv1515c was able to survive in the major organs of mice up to 7 weeks post-infection. These results indicate a crucial role of Rv1515c in M. tb pathogenesis.

AB  - Amphicrine phenotype in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare phenomenon characterized by tumor cells that show both endocrine differentiation (calcitonin secretion) and exocrine differentiation (mucin production and secretion). Not much is known about the pathobiology of amphicrine MTCs. This report undertook a case-based review approach by discussing the cytological, histopathological, and ultrastructural features of this rare enigmatic entity, expanding on the radiological and novel MUC immunohistochemistry findings from a 28-year-old MEN2B syndrome patient with C cell hyperplasia and multifocal MTC with amphicrine features. The patient had widespread hematogenous metastases at presentation. MUC immunoexpression analysis revealed evidence of micro-lumina formation, and unique to-date unreported expression patterns of MUC1, MUC5AC, and MUC6 in an amphicrine subtype of MTC. Review of the literature identified five other MTC cases with well-documented amphicrine features. Of these six cases, two were associated with MEN2B syndrome, and four had metastatic disease. Follow-up was available in three patients, and two died of disease. Recognition of this rare subtype of MTC may be of clinical interest given their frequent link to MEN2B syndrome and biological aggressiveness.

AB  - A multiplex-nested PCR (M-nested PCR) targeting mpt64 (Rv1980c) + IS6110 was designed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) DNA within urine (n = 35), endometrial biopsies (n = 22) and menstrual blood (n = 3) of male/female UGTB patients, and results were compared with M-PCR using the same targets. Detection limit of the purified Mtb DNA was found to be 1 fg by M-nested PCR, which was 10(6)-fold lower than M-PCR. Moreover, sensitivities of 100% and 81 center dot 8% were obtained in confirmed (n = 5) and clinically suspected UGTB (n = 55) cases, respectively, by M-nested PCR, with a specificity of 97 center dot 1% (n = 70). Sensitivities attained by M-nested PCR were significantly higher (p < 0 center dot 05) than M-PCR in both clinically suspected and total UGTB (n = 60) cases. To confirm the true PCR-negative results, an internal amplification control, that is, human beta-globin gene (hbb) was incorporated in the M-nested PCR/M-PCR assays, wherein all the clinical specimens (positive/negative for mpt64/IS6110) were found to be positive for hbb. Some UGTB specimens (n = 35) were also subjected to GeneXpert (R) MTB/RIF assay that revealed a significantly lower (p < 0 center dot 001) sensitivity (17 center dot 1 vs 88 center dot 6%) than M-nested PCR, although high specificity (100%) was attained with GeneXpert. After validating the results in a higher number of UGTB specimens, our M-nested PCR may be translated into an attractive diagnostic kit.

AB  - Aims/Introduction We aimed to evaluate and compare continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)-based glycemic parameters in women in early pregnancy (<20 weeks of gestation) who were classified as: (i) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), but normoglycemia by alternate (UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Canadian Diabetes Association and Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India) criteria; and (ii) normoglycemia by both (IADPSG and alternate) criteria. Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, eligible women underwent standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, followed by the placement of a CGMS. Glycemia-related parameters were calculated using the standard approach for CGMS data in pregnancy. Results We enrolled 96 women at 14.0 +/- 3.2 weeks of gestation. Of the women diagnosed as GDM by IADPSG criteria, 34.2%, 26.3% and 44.7% were classified as normoglycemic by UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Canadian Diabetes Association and Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India criteria, respectively. Mean 1-h postprandial glucose and time above range were significantly higher in women who were GDM by IADPSG, but normoglycemia by Canadian Diabetes Association criteria, compared with women with normoglycemia using both criteria. Similarly, mean 1-h postprandial glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose, peak postprandial glucose, 1-h postprandial glucose excursion and time above range were significantly higher in women who were not identified as GDM by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria. Finally, women missed by the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India criteria had significantly higher mean 1-h postprandial glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose, peak postprandial glucose, postprandial glucose excursion, 24-h glucose and time above range parameters. Conclusions More than one-quarter of women diagnosed as GDM by IADPSG criteria are not identified by alternate criteria. Such women are significantly different from normoglycemic women in terms of several CGMS-based glycemic parameters of clinical significance.

AB  - Anaemia control programmes in India are hampered by a lack of representative evidence on anaemia prevalence, burden and associated factors for adolescents. The aim of this study was to: (1) describe the national and subnational prevalence, severity and burden of anaemia among Indian adolescents; (2) examine factors associated with anaemia at national and regional levels. Data (n = 14,673 individuals aged 10-19 years) were from India's Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS, 2016-2018). CNNS used a multistage, stratified, probability proportion to size cluster sampling design. Prevalence was estimated using globally comparable age- and sex-specific cutoffs, using survey weights for biomarker sample collection. Burden analysis used prevalence estimates and projected population from 2011 Census data. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse factors (diet, micronutrient deficiencies, haemoglobinopathies, sociodemographic factors, environment) associated with anaemia. Anaemia was present in 40% of girls and 18% of boys, equivalent to 72 million adolescents in 2018, and varied by region (girls 29%-46%; boys 11%-28%) and state (girls 7%-62%; boys 4%-32%). Iron deficiency (ferritin < 15 mu g/L) was the strongest predictor of anaemia (odds ratio [OR]: 4.68, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [3.21,6.83]), followed by haemoglobinopathies (HbA2 > 3.5% or any HbS) (OR: 2.81, 95% CI: [1.66,4.74]), vitamin A deficiency (serum retinol <20 ng/ml) (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: [1.23,2.80]) and zinc deficiency (serum zinc < 70 mu g/L) (OR: 1.32, 95% CI: [1.02,1.72]). Regional models show heterogeneity in the strength of association between factors and anaemia by region. Adolescent anaemia control programmes in India should continue to address iron deficiency, strengthen strategies to identify haemoglobinopathies and other micronutrient deficiencies, and further explore geographic variation in associated factors.

AB  - Background and Aim To review the anatomical details, diagnostic challenges, associated cardiovascular anomalies, and techniques and outcomes of management, including re-interventions, for the rare instances of transposition physiology with concordant ventriculo-arterial connections. Methods We reviewed clinical and necropsy studies on diagnosis and surgical treatment of individuals with transposition physiology and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections, analyzing also individuals with comparable flow patterns in the setting of isomerism. Results Among reported cases, just over two-thirds were diagnosed during surgery, after initial palliation, or after necropsy. Of the patients, four-fifths presented in infancy with either cyanosis or congestive cardiac failure, with complex associated cardiac malformations. Nearly half had ventricular septal defects, and one-fifth had abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, including hypoplasia of the morphologically right ventricle. A small minority had common atrioventricular junctions We included cases reported with isomerism when the flow patterns were comparable, although the atrioventricular connections are mixed in this setting. Management mostly involved construction of intraatrial baffles, along with correction of coexisting anomalies, either together or multistaged. Overall mortality was 25%, with one-fifth of patients requiring pacemakers for surgically-induced heart block. The majority of survivors were in good functional state. Conclusions The flow patterns produced by discordant atrioventricular and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections remain an important, albeit rare, indication for atrial redirection or hemi-Mustard's procedure with bidirectional Glenn. The procedure recruits the morphologically left ventricle in the systemic circuit, producing good long-term functional results. The approach can also be used for those with isomeric atrial appendages and comparable hemodynamic circuits.

AB  - Ultrasonography (US) is the workhorse of pediatric imaging; however, lung US is only a recently developed application. US of the lung is based predominantly on the imaging of chest wall-air-fluid interfaces. In this review, we summarize the available literature on applications of lung US in neonatal as well as pediatric care. We describe the imaging appearance of various commonly encountered pathologies including pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome, among others, and provide illustrative images. Finally, we describe the limitations of the technique that are essential knowledge for radiologists, critical care physicians, sonographers and technologists attempting to use lung US effectively for diagnosis and management.

AB  - Microalgae are natural biotic models for exploring the genotoxic effect of heavy metals, irradiation, other external stimuli and the toxicant elimination. The effective removal of heavy metals from the aquatic environment using microalgae has gained considerable attention. However, limited research was carried out on cadmum toxicity in microalgae and their use as bio-accumulants. Previous research suggested that low-dose priming with non-ionizing radiations, such as gamma radiation, increased heavy metal tolerance in plants and aquatic photosynthetic microalgae. In the present study, we have hypothesized the growth inhibitory physiochemical properties of cadmium (Cd) in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and analyzed the protective role of low-dose gamma radiations priming against Cd-induced growth inhibition by emphasizing mechanism of cell survival by antioxidant defence system. Experimentally, the gamma-primed C. reinhardtii exhibited higher cell survival and Cd tolerance with effective modulation of biochemical responses such as antioxidant enzymes. The current investigation revealed that low-dose priming of gamma radiation masks Cd-mediated oxidative stress and enhances cellular detoxification via intracellular antioxidant enzymes in C. reinhardtii.

AB  - Monocytes are known to play a critical role in dengue pathophysiology. However, which monocyte subset expresses what inflammatory mediator(s) and what transcriptional features distinguish each of the monocyte subset in vivo remain poorly understood. In this study we provide a detailed transcriptional analysis of the three human monocyte subsets in healthy children and in children with dengue febrile illness. Notably, we found that the CD14(+) CD16high intermediate monocyte subset from dengue patients highly upregulated key genes involved inmediating inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, vascular permeability, tissue extravasation, and clot prevention compared to healthy children. The CD14+ CD16low classical monocytes shared some of these features. These two subsets increased massively in patients with severe dengue. By contrast, the CD14(-)CD16high nonclassical monocyte subset upregulated key genes involved in vasoconstriction, endothelial barrier stability, and are involved in endothelial patrolling while showing a significant decline from circulation. These findings improve our understanding of monocyte responses in dengue.

AB  - The overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases and low extracellular pH are two key physiological parameters involved in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. These have been the targets for several cancer detection and imaging modalities. Here, dual-sensitive nanoprobes have been fabricated from carbon nanoparticles decorated with a MMP-9 sensitive peptide sequence. Carbon nanoparticles are known for their intrinsic fluorescence properties and hence used as a pH-sensing moiety in the nanoprobes. In addition to this, selective-cleavage of the peptide sequence by MMP-9 results in the generation of a fluorescence signal due to separation of the quencher molecule from the fluorophore attached onto the MMP-9 sensitive peptide sequence, resulting in its detection. This protease-specific activation of the nanoprobes helps in precise tumor environment detection and imaging. The nanoprobes were thoroughly characterized for their chemical, physical and biological activities. The potential of these dual-sensitive nanoprobes to distinguish tumor-like microenvironments (low pH and elevated MMP-9 levels) from non-cancerous ones was evaluated in vitro in 2D cell culture as well as in 3D microscaffolds. The fluorescence microscopy images obtained in both in vitro systems revealed that low pH and high MMP-9 levels could be successfully visualised using these dual-sensitive nanoprobes. Therefore, these nanoprobes would find potential applications as a non-invasive imaging tool for visualising tumor margins in real-time.

AB  - BACKGROUD Ethambutol hydrochloride (EMB) is used in the treatment of tuberculosis and is used as first line modality in combination with other medications. Ethambutol optic neuropathy (EON) is a rare but well-recognised adverse ocular event in patients who receive ethambutol for the treatment of mycobacterial infections and may be potentially devastating with reversible to irreversible changes in visual acuity. KEY FINDINGS Optical coherence tomography has been used to evaluate the thickness of retinal nerve fibre and ganglion cell layers to look for degenerative changes and early markers. Electrophysiological tests like multifocal electroretinogram, visual evoked potentials and visual fields have been used to understand the functional changes associated with established EON and also whether these can be used to detect subclinical EON and correlate them with the structural changes. In this review, we have summarised evidence published till December 2021 related to evaluation of structural and functional changes in the retina and optic nerve in eyes with EON.

AB  - Purpose To systematically summarize all relevant data and to define the current evidence on the utility of Pentraxin-3 (PTX3) as a biomarker for acute appendicitis (AA) in children. Methods This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies comparing the levels of PTX3 in patients with AA vs healthy controls or non-specific abdominal pain (NSAP). Mean differences were calculated for all outcomes and the inverse variance method was used for weighted mean difference. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Downs and Black scale. Results Five comparative studies were included. Significantly elevated levels of PTX3 in cases with AA vs healthy controls (WMD: 9.56, 95% CI 7.24-11.88, p < 0.00001), and patients with AA vs NSAP (WMD: 8.05, 95% CI 6.81-9.29, p < 0.00001) were demonstrated. Similarly, in separate meta-analyses, the levels of PTX3 were significantly elevated in children with AA vs healthy controls (WMD: 11.18, 95% CI 10.03-12.34, p < 0.00001), and children with AA vs NSAP (WMD: 8.35, 95% CI 6.88-9.82, p < 0.00001). Conclusions PTX3-levels are elevated in AA, but differentiation between perforated and non-perforated appendicitis demands other methods.

TI  - Pre-existing antibody levels negatively correlate with antibody titers after a single dose of BBV152 vaccination
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
KW  - SARS-COV-2
AB  - Many adults in India have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine with or without a prior history SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is limited information on the effect of prior immunity on antibody response upon vaccination in India. As immunization of individuals continues, we aimed to assess whether pre-existing antibodies are further boosted by a single dose of BBV152, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and, if these antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Here we show that natural infection during the second wave in 2021 led to generation of neutralizing antibodies against other lineages of SARS-CoV-2 including the Omicron variant, albeit at a significantly lower level for the latter. A single dose of BBV152 boosted antibody titers against the Delta and the Omicron variants but the antibody levels remained low against the Omicron variant. Boosting of antibodies showed negative correlation with baseline neutralizing antibody titers.
   Serosurveillance studies show a heterogenous mix of the Indian population with immunity to COVID-19 due to vaccination or natural infection. Here, the authors enrol subjects representative of the general population, to assess whether pre-existing antibodies are further boosted by a single dose of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, BBV152.

AB  - Introduction: The evaluation of plasma cell (PC) compartment is influenced by the quality of bone marrow aspirate (BMA). Herein, we evaluated the impact of sequence of pull on quality of clinical assessment in plasma cell proliferative disorders (PCPDs).
   Methods: Histomorphology along with smears from first pull and second pull BMA and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCMI) data from second pull aspirate were evaluated for cellularity and PC%.
   Results: Of the 484 samples, BMA smears were adequate in 87.4% of first pull (median PC = 7%; IQR = 2-25%) and 51.2% of second pull samples (median PC = 2%; IQR = 0.5-12%; p < 0.001). Recovery of PC was least on FCMI (median PC = 0.59%; IQR = 0.14-3.07%), however, sample adequacy was met in 42.6% of samples with acquisition of >= 3 million events. Second pull smears under-reported PC% in 34% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) (<10% PC) and 46% of MM on therapy (<5% PC), resulting in suboptimal assessment. Bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) was evaluated in a total of 309 cases (median PC = 10.0%; IQR 4.0-40.0%) with significantly higher numbers of BMPC% on BMBx compared with first pull smears (Mean +/- 2SD: 25.9% +/- 30.54 vs. 20.77% +/- 20.20; p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: First pull BMA smears were of superior quality but inadequate in one-tenth of samples. Second pull smears underreported PC% and recovery of PC compartment was poorest on FCMI. Concurrent bone marrow biopsy and use of the first pull sample for FCMI along with acquisition of a higher number of cells on FCMI may enhance the quality of assessment in PCPDs.

AB  - Aims To examine clinical and social correlates of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with heart failure (HF) from high- (HIC), upper middle- (UMIC), lower middle- (LMIC) and low-income (LIC) countries. Methods and results Between 2017 and 2020, 23 292 patients with HF (32% inpatients, 61% men) from 40 countries were enrolled in the Global Congestive Heart Failure study. HRQL was recorded at baseline using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)-12. In a cross-sectional analysis, we compared age- and sex-adjusted mean KCCQ-12 summary scores (SS: 0-100, higher = better) between patients from different country income levels. We used multivariable linear regression examining correlations (estimated coefficients) of KCCQ-12-SS with sociodemographic, comorbidity, treatment and symptom covariates. The adjusted model (37 covariates) was informed by univariable findings, clinical importance and backward selection. Mean age was 63 years and 40% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV. Average HRQL was 55 SD 27. It was 62.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.0-63.1) in HIC, 56.8 (56.1-57.4) in UMIC, 48.6 (48.0-49.3) in LMIC, and 38.5 (37.3-39.7) in LICs (p < 0.0001). Strong correlates (estimated coefficient [95% CI]) of KCCQ-12-SS were NYHA class III versus class I/II (-12.1 [-12.8 to -11.4] and class IV versus class I/II (-16.5 [-17.7 to -15.3]), effort dyspnoea (-9.5 [-10.2 to -8.8]) and living in LIC versus HIC (-5.8 [-7.1 to -4.4]). Symptoms explained most of the KCCQ-12-SS variability (partial R-2 = 0.32 of total adjusted R-2 = 0.51), followed by sociodemographic factors (R-2 = 0.12). Results were consistent in populations across income levels. Conclusion The most important correlates of HRQL in HF patients relate to HF symptom severity, irrespective of country income level.

AB  - Aim: Diagnosis of urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) is difficult and there is an immediate need to develop a reliable diagnostic test. Methods: A real-time immuno-PCR (RT-I-PCR) was developed to identify a cocktail of MPT-64 + ESAT-6 in both male/female UGTB patients comprising five confirmed cases, 40 clinically suspected cases and 37 non-TB controls, from whom mid-stream urine specimens were collected, while endometrial biopsies of female patients were obtained on day 1 of their menstrual cycle. Results obtained by RT-I-PCR were compared with I-PCR/ELISA and GeneXpert. Results: A wide range (500 fg/ml-10 ng/ml) of MPT-64 + ESAT-6 was detected in UGTB specimens by RT-I-PCR, although ELISA showed a narrow range (2.5-11 ng/ml). Sensitivities of 80% and 82.2% were obtained by RT-I-PCR in clinically suspected and total UGTB cases, respectively, whereas 94.6% specificity was obtained. Concurrently, RT-I-PCR revealed significantly higher (p < 0.05-0.001) sensitivity than I-PCR/ELISA and GeneXpert. Conclusion: After improving the specificity, the authors may develop RT-I-PCR into a diagnostic kit.
   Plain language summary Urogenital tuberculosis (UGTB) involves infection of the urinary tract and genital organs of male/female patients by Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Delayed diagnosis and therapy of UGTB lead to infertility and kidney failure. The routine tests used to detect the bacteria are not very sensitive due to low levels of bacteria present in UGTB specimens. Moreover, most nucleic acid amplification tests, such as PCR tests, give false-positive and false-negative results. The authors designed a real-time immuno-PCR test for detecting a cocktail of M. tuberculosis proteins in UGTB patients that revealed quite promising results, which were superior to immuno-PCR/ELISA and GeneXpert tests. After further improvement in the specificity and reduction of the price, this real-time immuno-PCR test could be used in routine diagnosis.

AB  - With the excessive genome plasticity, Acinetobacter baumannii can acquire and disseminate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes often associated with mobile genetic elements (MGEs). Analyzing the genetic environment of resistance genes often provides valuable information on the origin, emergence, evolution, and spread of resistance. Thus, we characterized the genomic features of some clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAb) to understand the role of diverse MGEs and their genetic context responsible for disseminating carbapenem resistance genes. For this, 17 clinical isolates of A. baumannii obtained from multiple hospitals in India between 2018 and 2019 were analyzed. AMR determinants, the genetic context of resistance genes, and molecular epidemiology were studied using whole-genome sequencing. This study observed an increased prevalence of bla(OXA-23) followed by dual carbapenemases, bla(OXA-23), and bla(NDM). This study identified three novel Oxford MLST sequence types. The majority of the isolates belonged to the dominant clone, IC2, followed by less prevalent clones such as IC7 and IC8. This study identified variations of AbaR4 and AbGRI belonging to the IC2 lineage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides comprehensive profiling of resistance islands, their related MGEs, acquired AMR genes, and the distribution of clonal lineages of CRAb from India.

AB  - Objective To determine the outcomes in children with MIS-C receiving different immunomodulatory treatment. Methods In this multicentric, retrospective cohort study, data regarding treatment and outcomes of children meeting the WHO case definition for MIS-C, were collected. The primary composite outcome was the requirement of vasoactive/inotropic support on day 2 or beyond or need of mechanical ventilation on day 2 or beyond after initiation of immunomodulatory treatment or death during hospitalization in the treatment groups. Logistic regression and propensity score matching analyses were used to compare the outcomes in different treatment arms based on the initial immunomodulation, i.e., IVIG alone, IVIG plus steroids, and steroids alone. Results The data of 368 children (diagnosed between April 2020 and June 2021) meeting the WHO case definition for MIS-C, were analyzed. Of the 368 subjects, 28 received IVIG alone, 82 received steroids alone, 237 received IVIG and steroids, and 21 did not receive any immunomodulation. One hundred fifty-six (42.39%) children had the primary outcome. On logistic regression analysis, the treatment group was not associated with the primary outcome; only the children with shock at diagnosis had higher odds for the occurrence of the outcome [OR (95% CI): 11.4 (5.19-25.0), p < 0.001]. On propensity score matching analysis, the primary outcome was comparable in steroid (n = 45), and IVIG plus steroid (n = 84) groups (p = 0.515). Conclusion While no significant difference was observed in the frequency of occurrence of the primary outcome in different treatment groups, data from adequately powered RCTs are required for definitive recommendations.

AB  - Environmental and lifestyle factors play an important role in the natural history of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A group of international experts from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases voted on a series of consensus statements to inform the management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The recommendations include avoiding traditional cigarette smoking in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, screening for symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosocial stressors at diagnosis and during flares (with referral to mental health professionals when appropriate), and encouraging regular physical activity as tolerated. Patients using dietary approaches for treatment of their IBD should be encouraged to adopt diets that are best supported by evidence and involve monitoring for the objective resolution of inflammation. We recommend formal assessment for obesity and nutritional deficiencies, and patients should be encouraged to maintain a normal body-mass index. A shared decision-making approach to contraception should include the consideration of IBD-related factors, and risk factors for venous thromboembolism. Long-term or frequent use of high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. For primary prevention of disease in the offspring of patients with IBD, we recommend avoiding passive exposure to tobacco, using antibiotics judiciously, and considering breastfeeding when able.

AB  - Lp-PLA2 is an enzyme encoded by the PLA2G7 gene located at chromosome 6p12-21, which is included in different signal transduction pathways. The potential of serum levels of Lp-PLA2 as a marker of inflammation quantifying cardio-metabolic risk, renal impairment and oxidative stress has been explored in earlier studies. It has also been used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, metabolic conditions and exercise tolerance. Additionally, it shows promising evidence for the assessment of risk for certain cardiovascular conditions in otherwise seemingly healthy individuals. COVID-19 has affected life and the economy globally. The identification of biomarkers to assess the sickness and treatment plan is the need of the hour. This review summarizes the pathophysiological inter-relationship between serum levels of Lp-PLA2 and COVID-19. The authors hypothesize that the estimation of Lp-PLA2 levels may help in the early identification of risk and thus may play a beneficial role in the proactive management of COVID-19.

KW  - congenital heart disease
AB  - We report a case of a 3-month-old boy transposition of great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis where computed tomography (CT) angiography detected a "levoatriocardinal vein" connecting the left superior pulmonary vein and the left brachiocephalic vein with a preserved normal connection between the left superior pulmonary vein and left atrium. This case highlights the hemodynamic implications of a "levoatriocardinal vein" as well as the role of CT angiography in detecting such associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with complex congenital heart defects.

AB  - Background Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Given the recent increasing trends in colorectal cancer incidence globally, up-to-date information on the colorectal cancer burden could guide screening, early detection, and treatment strategies, and help effectively allocate resources. We examined the temporal patterns of the global, regional, and national burden of colorectal cancer and its risk factors in 204 countries and territories across the past three decades.
   Methods Estimates of incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for colorectal cancer were generated as a part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 by age, sex, and geographical location for the period 1990-2019. Mortality estimates were produced using the cause of death ensemble model. We also calculated DALYs attributable to risk factors that had evidence of causation with colorectal cancer.
   Findings Globally, between 1990 and 2019, colorectal cancer incident cases more than doubled, from 842 098 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 810 408-868 574) to 2.17 million (2.00-2.34), and deaths increased from 518 126 (493 682-537 877) to 1.09 million (1.02-1.15). The global age-standardised incidence rate increased from 22.2 (95% UI 21.3-23.0) per 100 000 to 26.7 (24.6-28.9) per 100 000, whereas the age-standardised mortality rate decreased from 14.3 (13.5-14.9) per 100 000 to 13.7 (12.6-14.5) per 100 000 and the age-standardised DALY rate decreased from 308.5 (294.7-320.7) per 100 000 to 295.5 (275.2-313.0) per 100 000 from 1990 through 2019. Taiwan (province of China; 62.0 [48.9-80.0] per 100 000), Monaco (60.7 [48.5-73.6] per 100 000), and Andorra (56.6 [42.8-71.9] per 100 000) had the highest age-standardised incidence rates, while Greenland (31.4 [26.0-37.1] per 100 000), Brunei (30.3 [26.6-34.1] per 100 000), and Hungary (28.6 [23.6-34.0] per 100 000) had the highest age-standardised mortality rates. From 1990 through 2019, a substantial rise in incidence rates was observed in younger adults (age <50 years), particularly in high Socio-demographic Index (SDI) countries. Globally, a diet low in milk (15.6%), smoking (13.3%), a diet low in calcium (12.9%), and alcohol use (9.9%) were the main contributors to colorectal cancer DALYs in 2019.
   Interpretation The increase in incidence rates in people younger than 50 years requires vigilance from researchers, clinicians, and policy makers and a possible reconsideration of screening guidelines. The fast-rising burden in low SDI and middle SDI countries in Asia and Africa calls for colorectal cancer prevention approaches, greater awareness, and cost-effective screening and therapeutic options in these regions.

AB  - Objectives. Transition from cardiac hypertrophy to failure involves adverse metabolic reprogramming involving mitochondrial dysfunction. We have earlier shown that vitamin D deficiency induces heart failure, at least in part, through insulin resistance. However, whether activation of vitamin D receptor (VDR) can attenuate heart failure and underlying metabolic phenotype requires investigation. Thus, we aimed to assess the cardioprotective potential of paricalcitol, a vitamin D receptor-activator, against cardiac hypertrophy and failure in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats. Methods. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed control (Con) or high-fat high-fructose (HFHFrD) diet for 20 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats from HFHFrD group were divided into the following: HFHFrD, HFHFrD+P (paricalcitol i.p. 0.08 mu g/kg/day) and HFHFrD+E (enalapril maleate i.p. 10 mg/kg/day). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, blood pressure measurement, and 2D echocardiography were performed. Cardiac fibrosis was assessed by Masson's trichrome staining of paraffin-embedded heart sections. Mitochondrial DNA and proteins, and citrate synthase activity were measured in rat hearts. VDR was silenced in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, and immunoblotting was performed. Results. Paricalcitol improved glucose tolerance, serum lipid profile, and blood pressure in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats. Paricalcitol reduced cardiac wall thickness and increased ejection fraction in high-fat high-fructose-fed rats but had no effect on perivascular fibrosis. PGC1-alpha was upregulated in the HFHFrD+P group compared to the HFHFrD group, but there was no significant difference in mitochondrial content. Citrate synthase activity was significantly higher in the HFHFrD+P group compared to the HFHFrD group. Rat hearts of the HFHFrD+P group had significantly higher expression of mitofusins. H9c2 cells with VDR knockdown showed significantly lower expression of Mfn2. Improvement in the HFHFrD+P group was comparable with that in the HFHFrD+E group. Conclusions. Paricalcitol reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with metabolic syndrome by enhancing mitochondrial fusion. We demonstrate repurposing potential of the drug currently used in end-stage kidney disease.

AB  - Patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have a high risk of subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes, particularly within the first 30 days. Although it is well documented that initiation of statin therapy in the setting of ACS improves short-and long-term cardiovascular outcomes, and achievement of lower levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) incrementally improves outcomes, many patients with ACS have persistent hypercholesterolemia after discharge from the hospital. Thisis a missed opportunity that prompted the Lipid Association of India to develop recommendations for earlier initiation of more aggressive LDL-C lowering treatment, particularly for patients of South Asian descent who are well-documented to have earlier onset of more aggressive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The Lipid Association of India recommends individualized aggressive LDL-C goals after ACS, which can be rapidly achieved with high intensity statin therapy and subsequent goal-directed adjunctive treatment with ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors. Improved treatment of hypercholesterolemia achieved within weeks after ACS has the potential to reduce the high rate of morbidity and mortality in these high risk patients.

AB  - Tuberculous Meningitis (TBM) diagnosis remains a grave challenge. We evaluated the utility of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a source of cell-free transrenal-mycobacterial DNA (cf-Tr-MTB DNA) for TBM diagnosis from urine samples. We developed a qPCR-assay targeting a highly repetitive 36-bp sequence specific to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. EVs were isolated from urine samples of suspected TBM groups (n = 44) [categorized using composite reference standard as 'Definite' TBM (n = 8), 'Probable' TBM (n = 15), 'Possible' TBM (n = 21)] and 'Non-TBM' group (n = 26). cf-Tr-MTB DNA-based qPCR assay was applied to DNA isolated from EVs (EV-DNA) and EV-free-fraction (EV-free DNA). ROC-curves were generated using qPCR results of 'Definite' TBM and 'Non-TBM' category in both EV-DNA and EV-free DNA samples and cut-off values were selected to provide 100% (95%CI:69.1-100) specificity. The cf-Tr-MTB DNA assay gave a sensitivity of 54.5% (95%CI:38.8-69.6) for EV-DNA and 77.3% (95%CI:62.1-88.5) for EV-free DNA in the TBM group (n = 44). The combination of EV-DNA and EV-free DNA results (corresponding to performance cf-Tr MTB DNA assay in urine), gave an overall sensitivity of 81.8% (95%CI:67.2-91.8) in the TBM group. Our results confirmed EVs as one of the sources of cf-Tr-MTB DNA and we believe the cf-Tr-MTB DNA-based qPCR assay has a potential application for TBM diagnosis.

AB  - Aims: Various factors can influence the learning curve of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Initiating CRS and HIPEC programmes in low-and middle-income countries is challenging due to resource constraints and limited availability of expertise. We present our experience of CRS and HIPEC from a learning curve perspective among a cohort 155 peritoneal surface malignancy patients.
   Materials and methods: Patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC between May 2015 and February 2019 were included in the study. Patients were divided into two consecutive cohorts: the first 73 cases comprised the learning phase, group 1; the subsequent cohort of 82 patients were considered as the implementation phase, group 2. A comparative analysis of clinical and surgical outcome parameters was carried out between the two groups.
   Results: The clinical spectrum was comparable among group 1/group 2. Most were ovarian (56.8%), colorectal (13.5%) and appendiceal (11.0%) malignancies. Group 2 had a higher number of moderate to high peritoneal cancer index patients (34.1% versus 19.1%), total peritonectomies (48.8% versus 45.2%), multi visceral resections (colonic 41.5% versus 27.4%, small bowel 25.6% versus 19.1%, diaphragmatic 8.5% versus 6.5% and hepatic resections 8.5% versus 2.7%) and completeness of cytoreduction 0/1 rates (97.6% versus 93.1%). A lower incidence of intraoperative urological injuries (2.6% versus 12.3%) was noticed in group 2 (P 1/4 0.007). Non-significant improvements seen in group 2 included surgery duration (6.0 +/- 1.3 h versus 6.4 +/- 1.7 h), intensive care unit stay (1.3 +/- 1.1 days versus 1.8 +/- 1.5 days), overall hospital stay (8.1 +/- 0.9 days versus 8.8 +/- 1.4 days) and reduction in Clavien-Dindo grade 3-4 complications (25.4% versus 36.9%).
   Conclusions: The results of the current study indicate that by implementing standard protocols and mentoring by an experienced team, a learning curve of CRS and HIPEC can be achieved in fewer than 75 cases. The baseline expertise of the treating team can also influence the learning curve. (C) 2022 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundDuring the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks of Zika were reported from Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra, India in 2021. The Dengue and Chikungunya negative samples were retrospectively screened to determine the presence of the Zika virus from different geographical regions of India. MethodsDuring May to October 2021, the clinical samples of 1475 patients, across 13 states and a union territory of India were screened and re-tested for Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika by CDC Trioplex Real time RT-PCR. The Zika rRTPCR positive samples were further screened with anti-Zika IgM and Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test. Next generation sequencing was used for further molecular characterization. ResultsThe positivity was observed for Zika (67), Dengue (121), and Chikungunya (10) amongst screened cases. The co-infections of Dengue/Chikungunya, Dengue/Zika, and Dengue/Chikungunya/Zika were also observed. All Zika cases were symptomatic with fever (84%) and rash (78%) as major presenting symptoms. Of them, four patients had respiratory distress, one presented with seizures, and one with suspected microcephaly at birth. The Asian Lineage of Zika and all four serotypes of Dengue were found in circulation. ConclusionOur study indicates the spread of the Zika virus to several states of India and an urgent need to strengthen its surveillance.

AB  - Objectives: Clostridioides difficile is an important pathogen responsible for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea (AAD). This study was aimed to perform multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) of C. difficile isolates from AAD cases and to understand the clonal relationship between these C. difficile strains.Methods: Thirty five strains and a standard strain C.difficile ATCC 9689 were characterized by polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) for toxin genes (tcdA and tcdB gene) detection and MLST.Results: MLST results revealed that the most common sequence types were ST-17, ST-54, ST-63. The cluster analysis revealed that strains isolated from AAD patients generated 12 MLST sequence types grouped into two distinct evolutionary lineages.Conclusions: ST 17 is most prominent sequence type. This is the first report of MLST based study of C. difficile from India. Further studies from diverse geographical regions can help better understand the epidemiology of CDI in India.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The role of epigenetics in the etiology of cancer progression is being emphasized for the past two decades to check the impact of chromatin modifiers and remodelers. Histone modifications, DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, nucleosome positioning, regulation by non-coding RNAs and precisely microRNAs are influential epigenetic marks in the field of progressive cancer sub-types. Furthermore, constant epigenetic changes due to hyper or hypomethylation could efficiently serve as effective biomarkers of cancer diagnosis and therapeutic development. Ongoing research in the field of epigenetics has resulted in the resolutory role of various epigenetic markers and their inhibition using specific inhibitors to arrest their key cellular functions in in-vitro and preclinical studies. Although, the mechanism of epigenetics in cancer largely remains unexplored. Nevertheless, various advancements in the field of epigenetics have been made through transcriptome analysis and in-vitro genome targeting technologies to unravel the applicability of epigenetic markers for future cancer therapeutics and management. Therefore, this review emphasizes on recent advances in epigenetic landscapes that could be targeted/explored using novel approaches as personalized treatment modalities for cancer containment.

AB  - BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated vaccine based on the Asp614Gly variant. BBV152 is the first alum-imidazoquinolin-adjuvanted vaccine authorized for use in large populations. Here we characterized the magnitude, quality and persistence of cellular and humoral memory responses up to 6 months post vaccination. We report that the magnitude of vaccine-induced spike and nucleoprotein antibodies was comparable with that produced after infection. Receptor binding domain-specific antibodies declined against variants in the order of Alpha (B.1.1.7; 3-fold), Delta (B.1.617.2; 7-fold) and Beta (B.1.351; 10-fold). However, pseudovirus neutralizing antibodies declined up to 2-fold against the Delta followed by the Beta variant (1.7-fold). Vaccine-induced memory B cells were also affected by the Delta and Beta variants. The SARS-CoV-2-specific multicytokine-expressing CD4(+) T cells were found in similar to 85% of vaccinated individuals. Only a similar to 1.3-fold reduction in efficacy was observed in CD4(+) T cells against the Beta variant. We found that antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells were present in the central memory compartment and persisted for at least up to 6 months post vaccination. Vaccine-induced CD8(+) T cells were detected in similar to 50% of individuals. Importantly, the vaccine was capable of inducing follicular T helper cells that exhibited B-cell help potential. These findings show that inactivated vaccine BBV152 induces robust immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern that persists for at least 6 months after vaccination.

AB  - Introduction: Many Ayurvedic medicines have the potential for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with previous systematic reviews demonstrating effectiveness and safety for specific Ayurvedic medicines. However, many of the reviews need updating and none provide a comprehensive summary of all the Ayurvedic medicines evaluated for managing T2DM. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness and safety of Ayurvedic medicines for managing T2DM. Inclusion criteria: Published and unpublished RCTs assessing the effectiveness and safety of Ayurvedic medicines for managing T2DM in adults. Methods: The JBI systematic review methodology was followed. A comprehensive search of sources (including 18 electronic databases) from inception to 16 January 2021 was made. No language restrictions were applied. Data synthesis was conducted using narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analyses, where appropriate. Pooled results are reported as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Out of 32,519 records identified from the searches, 219 articles were included in the systematic review representing 199 RCTs (21,191 participants) of 98 Ayurvedic medicines. Overall, in the studies reviewed the methodology was not adequately reported, resulting in poorer methodological quality scoring. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was reduced using Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa (MD -1.6%; 95% CI -3 to -0.3), Boswellia serrata Roxb. (-0.5; -0.7 to -0.4), Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.) Makino (-1; -1.5 to -0.6), Momordica charantia L. (-0.3; -0.4 to -0.1), Nigella sativa L. (-0.4; -0.6 to -0.1), Plantago ovata Forssk. (-0.9; -1.4 to -0.3), Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Hook.f. and Thomson (-0.5; -0.6 to -0.5), Trigonella foenum-graecum L. (-0.6; -0.9 to -0.4), and Urtica dioica L. (-1.3; -2.4 to -0.2) compared to control. Similarly, fasting blood glucose (FBG) was reduced by 4-56 mg/dl for a range of Ayurvedic medicines. Very few studies assessed health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Adverse events were not reported in many studies, and if reported, these were mostly none to mild and predominately related to the gastrointestinal tract. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests the benefit of a range of Ayurvedic medicines in improving glycemic control in T2DM patients. Given the limitations of the available evidence and to strengthen the evidence base, high-quality RCTs should be conducted and reported.

AB  - Histological interpretation of the rare pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) has been the holy grail for treatment options. However, no stand-alone clinical interventions have been developed owing to the lack of gene expression profiling data in PXA/APXA patients. We first time report the comprehensive analyses of the coding as well as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signatures of PXA/APXA patients. Several genes such as IGFBP2, NF1, FOS, ERBB2, and lncRNAs such as NEAT1, HOTAIRM1, and GAS5 known to play crucial roles in glioma patients were also deregulated in PXA patients suggesting the commonality in the molecular signatures. PPI network, co-expression, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction studies unraveled hub genes (such as ERBB2, FOS, RPA1) and networks that may play a critical role in PXA biology. The most enriched pathways based on gene profiles were related to TLR, chemokine, MAPK, Rb, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The lncRNA targets were enriched in glucuronidation, adipogenesis, TGF-beta signaling, EGF/EGFR signaling, and cell cycle pathways. Interestingly, several mRNAs like PARVG, and ABI2 were found to be targeted by multiple lncRNAs suggesting a tight control of their levels. Some of the most prominent lncRNA-mRNA pairs were LOC728730: MRPL9, XLOC_l2_011987: ASIC2, lnc-C1QTNF5-1: RNF26. Notably, several lncRNAs such as lnc-CETP-1, lnc-XRCC3-1, lnc-RPL31-1, lnc-USP13-1, and MAPKAPK5-AS1, and genes such as RPA1, NTRK3, and CNRP1 showed strong correlation to the progression-free survival of PXA patients suggesting their potential as novel biomarkers. Overall, the findings of this study may facilitate the development of a new realm of RNA biology in PXA that may have clinical significance in the future.

AB  - Background: To achieve better academic performance, students should improve their cognitive faculties and overcome anxiety. Therefore, the present research was conducted to assess the effect of yoga on the cognitive functions of female adolescents with low academic performance. Methods: The present study is a randomized control trial (RCT). Eighty-nine female students in the age range of 12-14 years were randomly assigned into two groups [yoga (n = 45); physical exercise (n = 44)] at a school setting. Both groups were assessed before and after on Raven's standard progressive matrices (RSPM), Corsi Block Tapping Test (CBTT), Six Letter Cancellation Test (SLCT), Digit Letter Substitution Test (DLST), Stroop Color and Word Test (SCWT), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). Results: Findings of the present study showed significant (p < .05) differences in scores of forward CBTT, SWCT, and SLCT in group x time interaction. Both the groups showed significant (p < .05) improvement in SLCT, backward scores of CBTT, and STAIC-T. All outcomes measured were significantly (p < .05) improved in the yoga group except STAIC-S. Conclusion: Yoga improves general intelligence, visuospatial working memory, and attention, as well as reduces the anxiety of students with low academic performance. Similarly, physical exercise was also found to be improving visuospatial working memory, sustained attention, and reduce trait anxiety. However, the finding of the present study indicated yoga to be more effective compared to physical exercise in regards to students' fluid intelligence and executive function. Improvement in general intelligence, visuospatial working memory, and attention is expected to positively influence students' academic performance.

AB  - Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the host genome's epigenetic modifications are essential for living organisms to adapt to extreme conditions. DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histone and interassociation of noncoding RNAs facilitate the cellular manifestation of epigenetic changes in the genome. Out of various factors involved in the epigenetic programming of the host, noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNA (miRNA), long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), circular RNA, snoRNA and piRNA are new generation noncoding molecules that influence a variety of cellular processes like immunity, cellular differentiation and tumor development. During tumor development, temporal changes in miRNA/lncRNA rheostat influence sterile inflammatory responses accompanied by the changes in the carcinogenic signaling in the host. At the cellular level, this is manifested by the upregulation of inflammasome and inflammatory pathways, which promotes cancer-related inflammation. Given this, we discuss the potential of lncRNAs, miRNAs, circular RNA, snoRNA and piRNA in regulating inflammation and tumor development in the host.

AB  - Background. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the symptomatic compression neuropathy of the median nerve at the wrist level that may become a reason for upper limb disability, in the women and men population. Objective. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of the neurodynamic technique (NT) and carpal bone mobilization technique (CBMT) incorporated with tendon gliding exercises (TGE) as an effect-enhancing adjunct while managing the participants with chronic CTS. Methods. The study followed a two-arm parallel-group randomized comparative design. Thirty participants (aged 30-59 years) with chronic CTS were recruited randomly to both the NT and CBMT groups. In addition to the TGE (a common adjunct), NT and CBMT were performed in the NT and CBMT groups, respectively, for three weeks. The primary outcome measures including pain intensity, functional status, grip strength, and motor nerve conduction study were assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS), Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ), hand-held dynamometer, and electromyograph, respectively, at baseline, 3 weeks postintervention, and follow-up at one week post end of the intervention. Paired and unpaired t-test were used to calculate the differences in intervention effects within and between the groups with keeping the level of significance alpha at 0.05. Results. The data analysis revealed a significant (95% CI, p < 0.05) difference for all outcomes within each group compared across different time intervals. Similarly, a significant difference was found for all outcomes except pain and grip strength compared between groups at 3 weeks postintervention and follow-up at one week post end of the intervention. Conclusions. The NT revealed more effectiveness than the CBMT when incorporated with TGE to improve nerve conduction velocity and functional status of the hand. However, both NT and CBMT were equally effective in improving pain and grip strength while managing the participants with chronic CTS. In addition, the TGE contributed as a beneficial, effect-enhancing adjunct to the NT and CBMT differently. Significance. The study will guide the physiotherapist in applying either of the combination techniques suitable for achieving treatment objectives while managing the participants with chronic CTS.

AB  - Background: Phthalates are known endocrine-disrupting chemicals used indiscriminately as constituents in consumer products including food processing, and packaging, cosmetics, personal care and household items. Although, few studies have assessed the risk of breast cancer on exposure to phthalates, their association with breast cancer risk in Indian women have not yet been evaluated. Methods: We conducted a case-control study involving 171 participants. Urinary concentrations of six phthalate dieters; DMP (Dimethyl phthalate), DEP (Diethyl phthalate), DBP (Dibutyl phthalate), BBP (benzyl butyl phthalate), DEHP (Di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate), DINOP (Di-n-octyl phthalate) were estimated by GC-MS and geometric means were calculated. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess breast cancer risk on exposure to phthalates. Genes responsive to phthalates were identified through literature search and matched with NGS data, and gene-enrichment analysis was performed. Results: Significant associations were observed between urinary phthalate concentrations and increased risk of breast cancer for di-butyl phthalate (OR=1.5, 95% CI; 1.06, 2.11, p = 0.002) and di-2-ethyl-hexyl phthalate (>median vs <= median; OR=2.97, 95% CI; 1.18, 7.47, p = 0.005) in multivariable analyses. We also found several phthalate-responsive gene mutations in paired breast tumor tissues, which include PTPRD (76.19%), AR (42.86%), CYP1A1 (42.86%), CYP19A1 (23.81%), AHRR (19.05%), PIK3CA (19.05%), CYP1B1 (9.52%), RB1 (9.52%) and MMP9 (9.52%). Gene-enrichment analysis revealed that these genes form a major part of ER/PR, PPAR and HIF-1 alpha-TGF-beta signaling cascades involved in breast cancer Conclusion: Although the sample size is small, in this first case-control study from India, DBP and DEHP were found to be associated with increased risk of invasive breast cancer and tumor tissues revealed mutations in several phthalate-responsive genes. It is, therefore suggested that human biomonitoring in India and larger studies evaluating the early life genetic and epigenetic alterations on phthalates exposure are required to establish their role in breast carcinogenesis.

AB  - Objective The majority of lung cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage; the reasons for which are variable and unclear. Methods Lung cancer patients were evaluated prospectively to quantify various timelines and establish reasons for delays. Timelines were defined as time intervals between symptom onset, first physician visit, first specialist visit, date of diagnosis and treatment. Results A total 410 patients were included, majority having advanced disease. The median period for a first visit to a physician was 30 days (interquartile range [IQR] 20-90), 50 days (IQR 20-110) for referral to our centre, 23 days (IQR 14-33) to reach diagnosis, and 24 days (IQR 14.5-34) to initiate treatment. Administration ofanti-tuberculosis treatment further delayed referral to specialist centre. Treatment delays were related to performance status, disease stage and treatment type. On multivariate analysis, education and histology affected diagnosis delay and treatment delay. Treatment delay was less in those who received targeted therapy compared to chemotherapy. Various time delays did not affect the overall survival. Conclusion Poor education status and inappropriate anti-tubercular treatment were primary factors associated with longer diagnostic delays. Creating disease awareness and high clinical suspicion are essential to overcome these lacunae in lung cancer care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Azithromycin has immunomodulatory actions, and its beneficial effects have been demonstrated in asthmatic adults. Data on children are limited.
   RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the addition of oral azithromycin to standard therapy in children with poorly controlled asthma improve asthma control compared with standard treatment alone?
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label randomized controlled trial included children (5-15 years of age) with poorly controlled asthma defined by Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT) score of <= 19. They were randomized to receive azithromycin (10 mg/kg) three times weekly for 3 months along with standard treatment or standard treatment alone. The primary outcome was the ACT and CACT scores at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were asthma control according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the number of exacerbations, change in spirometry parameters, change in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (F-ENO) level, positive throat swab results, and side effects.
   RESULTS: The trial included 120 children (89 boys; 60 in each group). The mean +/- SD age was 9.9 +/- 3 years. The baseline parameters were similar between the groups. Mean +/- SD ACT and CACT scores (available for 115 children) at 3 months of intervention were 21.71 +/- 2.17 vs 18.33 +/- 2.19 (P < .001) in the azithromycin and control groups, respectively. The numbers of children with well-controlled asthma according to GINA guidelines were 41 of 56 vs 10 of 56 in the azithromycin and control groups, respectively (P < .001). The median number of exacerbations requiring emergency visit and steroid use were fewer in the azithromycin group: 0 (interquartile range [IQR], 3) vs 1 [IQR, 6]; P < .001). No difference was found in F-ENO level, spirometry parameters, positive throat swab results, and adverse effects between the groups.
   INTERPRETATION: The use of azithromycin in children with poorly controlled asthma resulted in improved asthma control and reduced exacerbations.

AB  - Background Pneumonia acquired in the community is a leading cause of hospitalization and death in under-five children. Predicting mortality in children remains a challenge. There is a need of consolidated scoring system to predict mortality in under-five children in developing nations. Methods This is a hospital-based prospective nested case-control study, conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital of north India. Included were under-five hospitalized children due to WHO defined severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Those who did not survive were categorized as cases, while those who were discharged were categorized as controls. Results The mortality rate among the recruited 180 hospitalized children with severe CAP was 9.4%. The mortality in under-five children was higher among infants, children who resided in rural areas and were unimmunized or partially immunized for the present age. Mortality was also statistically significantly higher among under-five children with weight for age and weight for length/height below -2Z score; SpO(2) < 90% at room air at admission, cyanosis, convulsion, high C-reactive protein (CRP), blood culture positive sepsis and end point consolidation. These predictors were found to be independent risk factors for the mortality after analyzing in multivariate model while presence of wheeze and exclusive breast feeding for first six months of life were found to be protective. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for respiratory index of severity in children (RISC) score has area under curve (AUC) 0.91 while AUC of RISC score with King George's Medical University (KGMU) modification has 0.88 for prediction of mortality. At the cut-off level of 3, the sensitivity of the RISC score in predicting mortality was 94.1% while the specificity was 73.6%. However, the sensitivity of the RISC score with KGMU modification in predicting mortality at cut-off level of 3 was 88.4% with a specificity of 74.8%. Conclusion Various predictors for mortality under-five children are young age, malnutrition, cyanosis, high CRP, blood culture positive sepsis and end point consolidation. It is also possible to predict mortality using RISC score which comprises simple variables and can be easily used at centers of periphery. Similar accuracy had been also found through the use of an age independent modified score (RISC score with KGMU modification). Lay summary Pneumonia is a primary cause of hospitalization as well as death among the children under the age of five. A variety of severity or mortality predicting scores have been produced for adults, but such scores for children are scarce. Furthermore, their utility in developing nations has not been proven. This is a hospital-based prospective study. Included were children under five (2 to 59 months) hospitalized due to severe community acquired pneumonia (CAP) defined as per World Health Organization (WHO) and were not hospitalized in last 14 days elsewhere. Those who did not survive were classified as cases while those who were discharged were classified as controls. A total of 200 consecutively hospitalized children with severe CAP based on WHO were screened and 180 children were recruited. Among recruited children, the percentage of mortality was 9.4% while 90.6% were discharged. The mortality was higher among children younger than 12 months, those belonged to rural area and were unimmunized or partially immunized for the present age.
   Mortality was also higher among under-five children with severe malnutrition, anemia, SpO(2) < 90% at room air at admission, cyanosis, convulsion, thrombocytopenia, high CRP, blood culture positive sepsis and end point consolidation. After assessing in a multivariate model, these predictors were determined to be independent risk factor for death, while wheezing and exclusive breast feeding throughout the first six months of life were found to be protective. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for respiratory index of severity in children (RISC) score has an area under curve (AUC) of 0.91 while AUC of RISC score with King George's Medical University (KGMU) modification was 0.88 for the prediction of death in under-five children hospitalized due to severe CAP.

AB  - Aim Bacteriophages are effective natural antimicrobial agents against drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, identification and detailed characterization of bacteriophages become essential to explore their therapeutic potential. This study aims to isolate and characterize a lytic bacteriophage against drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods and Results The Pseudomonas phage AIIMS-Pa-A1, isolated from the river Ganga water against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa, showed a clear lytic zone on spot assay. The phage revealed an icosahedral head (58.20 nm diameter) and a small tail (6.83 nm) under a transmission electron microscope. The growth kinetics showed an adsorption constant of 1.5 x 10(-9) phage particles cell(-1) ml(-1) min(-1) and a latent period of approximately 15 min with the burst size of 27 phages per infected cell. The whole-genome sequencing depicted a GC-rich genome of 40.97 kb having a lysis cassette of holin, endolysin and Rz protein, with features of the family Autographiviridae. The comparative genome analysis, Ortho-average nucleotide identity value, and phylogenetic analysis indicated the novelty of the phage AIIMS-Pa-A1. Conclusions The study concludes that the Pseudomonas phage AIIMS-Pa-A1 is a novel member of the Autographiviridae family, truly lytic in nature for drug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Significance and Impact of the Study The Pseudomonas phage AIIMS-Pa-A1 is having promising potential for future therapeutic intervention to treat drug-resistant P. aeruginosa infections.

AB  - T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is a genetically heterogeneous disease, characterized by an abnormal transformation of T cells into highly proliferative leukemic lymphoblasts. Identification of common genetic alterations has provided promising opportunities for better risk stratification in T-ALL. Current treatment in T-ALL still poses the major challenge of integrating the knowledge of molecular alterations in the clinical setting. We utilized the Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) method to determine the frequency of common copy number alterations (CNAs) in 128 newly diagnosed T-ALL patients. We also studied the association of these CNAs with patient's clinical characteristics and survival. The highest frequency of deletion was observed in CDKN2A (59.38%), followed by CDKN2B (46.88%), LMO1 (37.5%), and MTAP (28.12%). PTPN2 (22.66%), PHF6 (14.06%), and MYB (14.06%) had the highest number of duplication events. A total of 89.06% patients exhibited CNAs. STIL::TAL1, NUP214::ABL1, and LMO2::RAG2 fusions were observed in 5.47%, 3.12%, and 0.78% of patients, respectively. CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and PTPN2 gene deletions were mainly observed in pediatric patients, while CNAs of NF1 and SUZ12 were observed more frequently in adults. In pediatric patients, alterations in CDKN2B, CASP8AP2, and AHI1 were associated with poor prognosis, while SUZ12 and NF1 CNAs were associated with favorable prognosis. In adult patients, ABL1 CNA emerged as an independent indicator of poor prognosis. The observed molecular heterogeneity in T-ALL may provide the basis for variations observed in clinical response in T-ALL and MLPA based CNA detection may help in risk stratification of these patients.

AB  - Introduction There is a significant lack of palliative care access and service delivery in the Indian cancer institutes. In this paper, we describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a palliative care capacity-building program in Indian cancer institutes. Methods Participatory action research method was used to develop, implement and evaluate the outcomes of the palliative care capacity-building program. Participants were healthcare practitioners from various cancer institutes in India. Training and education in palliative care, infrastructure for palliative care provision, and opioid availability were identified as key requisites for capacity-building. Researchers developed interventions towards capacity building, which were modified and further developed after each cycle of the capacity-building program. Qualitative content analysis was used to develop an action plan to build capacity. Descriptive statistics were used to measure the outcomes of the action plan. Results Seventy-three healthcare practitioners from 31 cancer treatment centres in India were purposively recruited between 2016 and 2020. The outcome indicators of the project were defined a priori, and were audited by an independent auditor. The three cycles of the program resulted in the development of palliative care services in 23 of the 31 institutes enrolled in the program. Stand-alone palliative care outpatient services were established in all the 23 centres, with the required infrastructure and manpower being provided by the organization. Morphine availability improved and use increased in these centres, which was an indication of improved pain management skills among the participants. The initiation and continuation of education, training, and advocacy activities in 20 centres suggested that healthcare providers continued to remain engaged with the program even after the cessation of their training cycle. Conclusion This program illustrates how a transformational change at the organizational and individual level can lead to the development of sustained provision of palliative care services in cancer institutes.

AB  - Introduction: International IgA nephropathy (IgAN) network (IIgANN) prediction tool was developed to predict risk of progression in IgAN. We attempted to externally validate this tool in an Indian cohort because the original study did not include Indian patients.Methods: Adult patients with primary IgAN were stratified to low, intermediate, higher, and highest risk groups, as per the original model. Primary outcome was reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by > 50% or kidney failure. Both models were evaluated using discrimination: concordance statistics (C-statistics), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, R2d, Kaplan-Meier survival curves between risk groups and calibration plots. Reclassification with net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) was used to compare the 2 models with and without race.Results: A total of 316 patients with median follow-up of 2.8 years had 87 primary outcome events. Both models with and without race showed reasonable discrimination (C-statistics 0.845 for both models, R2d 49.9% and 44.7%, respectively, and well-separated survival curves) but underestimated risk of progression across all risk groups. The calibration slopes were 1.234 (95% CI: 0.973-1.494) and 1.211 (95% CI: 0.954- 1.468), respectively. Both models demonstrated poor calibration for predicting risk at 2.8 and 5 years. There was limited improvement in risk reclassification risk at 5 and 2.8 years when comparing model with and without race.Conclusion: IIgANN prediction tool showed reasonable discrimination of risk in Indian patients but underestimated the trajectory of disease progression across all risk groups.

AB  - Background Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease. Smaller sample size and complex nature of the disease pathogenesis has made it challenging to perform well-powered genetic investigations. We performed a systematic review based meta-analysis in GPA to investigate the genetic susceptibility conferred by non-human leukocyte antigen (non-HLA) candidate genes. Methods A systematic review was performed using web-based literature search and eligible studies were included following inclusion-exclusion criteria. Studies were evaluated for their quality of evidence and study outcome was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Grades of Research, Assessment, Development and Evaluation tools. Reviewer's agreement was accessed through Cohen's kappa value. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5 tool. Meta-odds ratio (meta-OR) and Z test P value were evaluated to estimate the genetic susceptibility for each of the variants. Results Eighteen studies were found eligible and 7 genetic variants from only 4 genes, namely CTLA4, PRTN3, SERPINA1 and PTPN22 could be studied for meta-analysis. rs231775-G (49-G) (Meta-OR = 1.42 [1.14-1.76]; P = .001) of CTLA4 and rs7151526-A (Meta-OR = 2.70 [1.51-4.85]; P = .0008) of SERPINA1 were confirmed to be predisposing alleles, and rs5742909-C (318-C) (Meta-OR = 0.65 [0.44-0.97]; P =.03) of CTLA4 was found to be protective for GPA. In concordance with the genetic association of rs7151526-A, serological marker for the same variant "Z" allele of SERPINA1 was found to be predisposing (Meta-OR = 12.60 [5.01-31.68]; P < .00001) for GPA. Conclusion Genetic variants confirmed in this study play critical roles in T-cell mediated immune function and could be significantly implicated in GPA. Molecular pathology studies are warranted to confirm their role. These markers could be used for efficient patient classification and disease management.

AB  - Background & aims: Impact of micronutrient deficiency on childhood malignancy is unexplored. We estimated the prevalence of baseline micronutrient deficiency in children with cancer and its impact on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted at a tertiary cancer centre in India. Children ( 18 years) with de novo malignancy were enrolled between October 2012 and May 2014. Baseline levels of vitamin B12, folate, zinc, selenium, copper, and iron were measured and values below 150 pmol/L, 6 ng/ mL, International Zinc Nutrition Collaborative Group cut-off, 0.5 mmol/L, 10 mmol/L, and 50 mg/dL, respectively, indicated deficiency. Results: Total 535 children [326 (60.9%) haematological and 209 (39.1%) solid malignancies] were enrolled with median follow-up of 66 months. Vitamin B12, folate, zinc, selenium, copper and iron deficiencies were found in 209 (39.1%), 89 (16.6%), 173 (32.3%), 39 (7.3%), 12 (2.2%), and 231 (43.2%) children, respectively. Selenium deficiency independently predicted poor EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.56; p = 0.038) and OS (HR = 1.65; p = 0.027) in the cohort. In haematological malignancies, selenium deficiency predicted poor EFS (HR = 1.81; p = 0.023) and OS (HR = 2.12; p = 0.004). In solid malignancies, vitamin B12 (HR = 1.55; p = 0.028) and zinc (HR = 1.74; p = 0.009) deficiencies predicted poor EFS, and zinc deficiency predicted poor OS (HR = 1.77; p = 0.009). Multiple micronutrient ( 3) deficiencies also predicted poor EFS (HR = 1.69; p = 0.001) and OS (HR = 1.83; p < 0.001) in the whole cohort. Conclusions: Selenium deficiency was independently predictive of adverse outcomes in childhood cancer, particularly in haematological malignancies. Zinc deficiency adversely affected solid tumours. The adjunct use of micronutrient supplementation in paediatric malignancies should be explored. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cinnamomum zeylanicum is a tropical plant with traditional medicinal significance that possesses antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-parasitic, and anti-tumor properties. Here, we have elucidated the anti-tumor effects of Cinnamomum zeylanicum extract (CZE) and its bioactive compound cinnamaldehyde (CIN) on oral cancer and elucidated underlying molecular mechanisms. Anti-tumor activities of CZE and CIN were demonstrated by various in vitro experiments on oral cancer cells (SCC-4, SCC-9, SCC-25). The cell proliferation, growth, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy were analyzed by MTT, clonogenic assay, propidium iodide, annexin-V-PI, DAPI, and acridine orange staining, respectively. The binding affinity of CIN towards dihydrofolate reductase and p38-MAP kinase alpha was analyzed by molecular docking. Western blot assay was performed to assess the alteration in the expression of various proteins. CZE and CIN treatment significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of oral cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. These treatments further induced apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy. CZE and CIN inhibited the invasion and cytoplasmic translocation of NF-kappa B in these cell lines. CIN showed a high affinity to MAP kinase P38 alpha and dihydrofolate reductase with binding affinities of -6.8 and -5.9 kcal/mol, respectively. The cancer cells showed a decreased expression of various PI3k-AKT-mTOR pathways related to VEGF, COX-2, Bcl-2, NF-kappa B, and proteins post-treatment.

AB  - Banded sleeve gastrectomy (BSG) was developed to restrict progressive dilation of the gastric sleeve, which remains a commonly implicated reason for weight regain following SG. The present study attempted to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the two procedures. Literature search was performed across PubMed and Google Scholar, using the keywords "Banded Sleeve Gastrectomy", "Sleeve gastrectomy", "Banded", "BSG" and "LSG". It yielded 4267 articles, six of which have been included in this review. Better weight loss outcomes at 3 and 5 years are noted following BSG, with a margin of 6.39% and 9.97% in %TWL at respective time points. No difference in impact on co-morbidities was noted. A revision rate of 7.1% was seen after BSG, with increased regurgitation as the most common indication.

AB  - Aim To estimate the prevalence, socio-demographic determinants, common disease combinations, and health impact of multimorbidity among a young rural population. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey among participants aged >= 30 years in rural Punjab, North India, from Jan 2019 to April 2019. Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of >= two conditions using a 14-condition tool validated in India. We also calculated a multimorbidity-weighted index (MWI), which provides a weight to each disease based on its impact on physical functioning. Logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the association with sociodemographic variables, mental health (PHQ-9), physical functioning (ADL scale), and self-rated health (SRH). Results We analyzed data from 3213 adults [Mean age 51.5 (+/- 13), 54% women]. Prevalence of single chronic condition, multimorbidity, and MWI was 28.6, 18% and - 1.9 respectively. Age, higher wealth index and ever use alcohol were significantly associated with multimorbidity. Overall, 2.8% of respondents had limited physical functioning, 2.1% had depression, and 61.5% reported low SRH. Poorer health outcomes were more prevalent among the elderly, women, less educated, and those having lower wealth index and multimorbidity, were found to be significantly associated with poor health outcomes. Conclusions The burden of multimorbidity was high in this young rural population, which portends significant adverse effects on their health and quality of life. The Indian health system should be reconfigured to address this emerging health priority holistically, by adopting a more integrated and sustainable model of care.

KW  - DIAGNOSIS
AB  - Cholestatic jaundice characterized by elevated conjugated bilirubin can be due to multitude of factors in neonates and childhood. Extrahepatic biliary atresia (EHBA), choledochal cyst, neonatal hepatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and biliary plug are some of the common causes in neonate and early infancy. Causes in late infancy and childhood comprises viral hepatitis, choledochal cyst, cholelithiasis, worm infestation, and biliary compression secondary to extrinsic causes (node, collection, tumor). Some serious disorders like biliary atresia must be considered with the emphasis on early diagnosis of treatable causes. In the modern era, with multiple diagnostic modalities available including high-resolution ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT scan, and nuclear imaging [hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan], rapid diagnosis can be made in many surgically treatable cases. The authors will discuss the imaging modality available with advantages, disadvantages, and common indications of each modality, and overview of obstructive jaundice discussing the wide spectrum of causes in neonates and late childhood. Combining available knowledge with careful and meticulous search can help narrow down the diagnosis and initiate prompt treatment.

AB  - Background Aprepitant has been shown to reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC). In this study, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of aprepitant for children receiving HEC in India, United Kingdom, and the United States. Procedure We utilized individual patient-level outcome data from a pediatric randomized trial, which demonstrated the superiority of an aprepitant-based anti-emetic prophylaxis over standard ondansetron and dexamethasone for HEC. Health state for each day of follow-up was analyzed and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net monetary benefit (NMB) for each country were estimated. Sensitivity analyses by varying cost of aprepitant, hospitalization, and health state utility values by +/- 25% were conducted. Results Use of the aprepitant-based regimen resulted in gain of 0.0019 QALY per chemotherapy cycle along with cost savings of $22.25, $1335.52, and $6612.10 for India, United Kingdom, and the United States, respectively. The cost savings per QALY was estimated to be $12,355.84 for India, $734,282.90 for the United Kingdom, and $3,567,564.11 for the United States. The cost savings for 50% gain in the percentage of days without grade 3 vomiting was $124.18 for India, $7451.63 for the United Kingdom, and $36,892.76 for the United States. The NMB for gain in QALY was $33.62, $1418.60, and $6727.01 for India, United Kingdom, and the United States, respectively. The estimates remained cost-effective across all scenarios of the sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Aprepitant-based anti-emetic regimen is cost-effective for children receiving HEC. It results in overall cost savings and reduced healthcare-resource utilization.

AB  - Background: Topical fluoride is used for prevention of dental caries. However, its effectiveness and more specifically its formulation and frequency of application in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy are still debatable. The aim of this systematic review was to pool the evidence of effectiveness of various topical fluorides in preventing radiation caries or change in bacterial growth in adult patients of head and neck cancer.
   Methods: Three databases (PubMed and Google Scholar and Cochrane) were searched for randomized controlled or uncontrolled trials or quasi randomised trials published till February 2021. Two independent reviewers screened 346 abstracts finally 14 articles were included in the current systematic review. Primary outcome evaluated was the prevention of radiation caries or change in bacterial growth in saliva. Meta-analysis was performed for the sub groups formed on the basis of fluoride formulations and adjuncts used with it. Results: Studies included were highly heterogeneous. Majority of studies found different fluoride formulations to be effective in controlling radiation caries to a variable extent up to 70% depending upon the intervention, patient compliance, rate of attrition and follow up period. Sodium fluoride was the most commonly used caries preventive agent. Meta-analysis showed no significant difference between sodium fluoride formulations and other fluoride agents. Fluoride treatment when incorporated with re-mineralising agent had no significant effect on caries prevention
   Conclusion: Fluoride prevents radiation caries. However, to delineate its exact formulation, dosage or frequency, there is need for more well conducted randomised controlled trials.

AB  - Purpose: To analyze the pattern of bacterial pathogens causing infective keratitis and their resistance to the recommended antibiotics over six years. Methods: It was a retrospective study of 9,357 cases of bacterial keratitis from January 2015 to December 2020, at a tertiary care ophthalmic center. A total of 9,547 corneal specimens were obtained from the study subjects. Demographic details of the patients, pathogenic bacteria isolated, and their antimicrobial susceptibility were noted and analyzed. Results: Bacterial pathogens were identified in 23.52% of the specimens. The most common isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococci (60.75%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.23%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.92%), gram negative bacilli of the family Enterobacterales (8.64%), Streptococcus spp. (1.72%), Acinetobacter spp. (0.13%), and other non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli (0.57%). In Staphylococci, 55-80% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, and 40-70% to fluoroquinolones, while no resistance was observed against vancomycin. 40-60% of isolates of P. aeruginosa were resistant to cephalosporins, 40-55% to fluoroquinolones, and 30-60% to aminoglycosides. Also, 40-80% of isolates of Enterobacterales were resistant to cephalosporins, and 50-60% to fluoroquinolones. Most gram-negative isolates were susceptible to carbapenems and polymyxin B. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest compilation of microbiological profile of bacterial keratitis from North India. It highlights the current trend of the bacterial pathogens that cause infectious keratitis. Staphylococci and Pseudomonas were found to be the most common pathogens. Increased resistance was seen against some of the commonly prescribed empirical antibiotics. Such evidence is useful for restructuring the empirical prescription practices from time to time.

AB  - A 56-year-old man was diagnosed with calcitonin negative, plasma chromogranin A-positive, immunohistochemistry-negative, high-grade MTC (medullary thyroid cancer) behaving clinically like anaplastic thyroid cancer and presented with progressive disease after conventional therapies. A theranostic approach of Ga-68-DOTA.SA.FAPi-guided Lu-177-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) radionuclide therapy was administered on compassionate grounds as per the Declaration of Helsinki because known standard lines of treatment were ineffective. Treatment with a single cycle of 1.65 GBq Lu-177-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) demonstrated a sustainable reduction in the neck mass with significant improvement in the quality of life of the patient. Lu-177-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) is a potential theranostic option for high-grade MTC refractory to standard therapeutic options.

AB  - Objective To compare experts' perceived usefulness of audit filters from Ghana, Cameroon, WHO and those locally developed; generate context-appropriate audit filters for trauma care in selected hospitals in urban India; and explore characteristics of audit filters that correlate to perceived usefulness. Design A mixed-methods approach using a multicentre online Delphi technique. Setting Two large tertiary hospitals in urban India. Methods Filters were rated on a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of perceived usefulness, with the option to add new filters and comments. The filters were categorised into three groups depending on their origin: low and middle-income countries (LMIC), WHO and New (locally developed), and their scores compared. Significance was determined using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We performed a content analysis of the comments. Results 26 predefined and 15 new filter suggestions were evaluated. The filters had high usefulness scores (mean overall score 9.01 of 10), with the LMIC filters having significantly higher scores compared with those from WHO and those newly added. Three themes were identified in the content analysis relating to medical relevance, feasibility and specificity. Conclusions Audit filters from other LMICs were deemed highly useful in the urban India context. This may indicate that the transferability of defined trauma audit filters between similar contexts is high and that these can provide a starting point when implemented as part of trauma quality improvement programmes in low-resource settings.

AB  - The standard of care for posterior segment disorders such as wet age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular oedema and retinal vascular occlusions is pharmacotherapy by intravitreal drug delivery. Since the therapeutic effect of these drugs lasts only around 4 to 8 weeks, repeated intravitreal injections are required. Pain is experienced by the patients during injection as the needle courses through the sclera and choroid. The current work describes the design and development of a novel anodized titanium alloy implant that allows for intravitreal injections through the implant so that the needle transverses only the conjunctiva, thus minimizing discomfort to the patient. Both ex-vivo testing of the implant in enucleated goat's eye as well as in-vivo validation in rabbit eyes was carried out. The implant was placed through pars plana via a minor surgical procedure and was sutured to the sclera and covered with conjunctiva. Subsequent intravitreal injections were administered under topical anaesthesia with a 30-gauge needle through the implant thus delivering the drug into the vitreous cavity. Repeated intravitreal injections were administered every 2 weeks via the implant for 3 months in 4 rabbits. Apart from cataract in 1 rabbit, no complications were observed. There was no evidence of intra-ocular inflammation or infection at final follow-up. Histopathological analysis did not reveal any inflammation or necrosis around the area of implant. The implants were subsequently removed at 5 months and scleral wound was closed with a single suture. The sclera and overlying conjunctiva healed well and no intraocular complications were observed after removal.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological disorder that affects the movement of the human body. It is primarily characterized by reduced dopamine levels in the brain. The causative agent of PD is still unclear but it is generally accepted that alpha-synuclein has a central role to play. It is also known that gap-junctions and associated connexins are complicated structures that play critical roles in nervous system signaling and associated misfunctioning. Thus, our current article emphasizes how, alongside alpha-synuclein, ion-channels, gap-junctions, and related connexins, all play vital roles in influencing multiple metabolic activities of the brain during PD. It also highlights that ion-channel and gap-junction disruptions, which are primarily mediated by their structural-functional changes and alterations, have a role in PD. Furthermore, we discussed available drugs and advanced therapeutic interventions that target Parkinson's pathogenesis. In conclusion, it warrants creating better treatments for PD patients. Although, dopaminergic replenishment therapy is useful in treating neurological problems, such therapies are, however, unable to control the degeneration that underpins the disease, thereby declining theft overall efficacy. This creates an additional challenge and an untapped scope for neurologists to adopt treatments for PD by targeting the ion-channels and gap-junctions, which is well-reviewed in the present article.

AB  - Justification In India, there is a lack of uniformity of treatment strategies for aplastic anemia (AA), and many children are managed only with supportive care due to non-availability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Process Eminent national faculty members were invited to participate in the process of forming a consensus statement in Hyderabad in July, 2016. Draft guidelines were circulated to all members, and comments received in a online meeting in October, 2020 were incorporated into the final draft. These were approved by all experts. Objective To facilitate appropriate management of children with acquired aplastic anemia. Recommendations Key recommendations are: i) A bone marrow biopsy is must to make a diagnosis of AA; ii) Rule out inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS), connective tissue disorders, viral infections, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), drug or heavy metal induced marrow suppression in all cases of AA; iii) Conservative approach to transfusions should be followed, with a target to keep hemoglobin >6 g/dL in children with no co-morbidities; iv) HLA-matched sibling donor HSCT is the preferred choice of treatment for newly diagnosed very severe/severe AA; v) In absence of HLA-matched family donor, a matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) should be considered as alternate choice based on physician expertise; vi) Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) based conditioning with cyclosporine and methotrexate as graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis is the preferred regimen; vii) Horse ATG and cyclosporine are the recommended drugs for IST. One should wait for 3-6 months for the response assessment and consideration of next line therapy.

AB  - Introduction: India witnessed the catastrophic second wave of COVID-19 during the summer months of 2021. Many patients with non-resolution of symptoms admitted to dedicated COVID-19 treatment centers required prolonged inpatient care which led to the unavailability of beds for other COVID-19 patients. The objective of this study was to determine the duration of SARS-CoV-2 positivity in moderate and severe COVID-19 patients requiring long-term pulmonary care as well as to find out the association between different variables with the persistence of the virus.
   Methodology: A retrospective chart review of clinical and laboratory data of patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 between 1st April 2021 and 15th July 2021 admitted for more than 28 days and requiring long-term pulmonary care was carried out at National Cancer Institute, AIIMS, India. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected with real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Data from all consecutively included patients satisfying the selection criteria were presented temporally and analyzed by Fisher's exact test (p < 0.05).
   Results: All 51 patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the 5th week of initial laboratory confirmation of COVID-19. The majority of the patients (38; 74.5%) remained positive for viral RNA till the 6th week and the median duration of viral positivity was 45 days. The clinical presentation of SARI at admission was significantly higher among patients with viral persistence till the 6th week (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The median duration of the viral positivity was 45 days and SARI at admission was significantly associated with viral persistence till the 6th week.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess the relationships of (1) clinical variables (age, level of injury, time since injury [TSI], and completeness of injury) and (2) psychological variables (stress and depression) with mental imagery ability in individuals with spinal cord injury.
   Study Design: This was a cross-sectional study. Participants with spinal cord injury (N= 130) were requested to fill the Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire and Vividness of Motor Imagery Questionnaire. They also completed the Perceived Stress Scale and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 for the assessment of stress and depression, respectively.
   Results: Mental imagery scores were found to be significantly low in cervical injuries (P < 0.001) as compared with thoracic injuries (P < 0.001). Furthermore, higher levels of spinal injuries resulted in lower mental imagery scores. Completeness of injury (according to Asia Impairment Scale) also had a significant relationship (P < 0.001) with the mental imagery ability among spinal cord injury participants. Presence of stress (P < 0.001) and depression (P < 0.001) also associated with reduced efficiency of mental imagery in these individuals.
   Conclusions: Injury type and psychological factors were associated with mental imagery in SCI patients. Imagery-based interventions should be designed after consideration of identified factors yielding effect on their outcomes.

AB  - PURPOSE. With age, human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) accumulates bisretinoid fluorophores that may impact cellular function and contribute to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Bisretinoids are comprised of a central pyridinium, dihydropyridinium, or cyclohexadiene ring. The pyridinium bisretinoid A2E has been extensively studied, and its quantity in the macula has been questioned. Age-changes and distributions of other bisretinoids are not well characterized. We measured levels of three bisretinoids and oxidized A2E in macula and periphery in human donor eyes of different ages.
   METHODS. Eyes (N = 139 donors, 61 women and 78 men, aged 40-80 years) were dissected into 8 mm diameter macular and temporal periphery punches. Using liquid chromatography - electrospray ionization - mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and an authentic synthesized standard, we quantified A2E (ng). Using LC-ESI-MS and a 50-eye-extract of A2E, we semiquantified A2E and 3 other compounds (eye extract equivalent units [EEEUs): A2-glycerophosphoethanolamine (A2GPE), dihydropyridine phosphatidyl ethanolamine (A2DHPE), and monofuranA2E (MFA2E).
   RESULTS. A2E quantities in ng and EEEUs were highly correlated (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). From 262 eyes, 5 to 9-fold higher levels were observed in the peripheral retina than in the macula for all assayed compounds. A2E, A2DHPE, and MFA2E increased with age, whereas A2GPE remained unaffected. No significant right-left or male-female differences were detected.
   CONCLUSIONS. Significantly higher levels were observed in the periphery than in the macula for all assayed compounds signifying biologic differences between these regions. Levels of oxidized A2E parallel native A2E and not the distribution of retinal illuminance. Data will assist with the interpretion of clinical trial outcomes of agents targeting bisretinoid-related pathways.

AB  - Background: Symptomatic evaluation using Eckardt score and achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life and physiological evaluation using timed barium examination (TBE) and high-resolution manometry is integral to the diagnosis of achalasia. However, the correlation of physiological outcomes with symptomatic outcomes and their role in routine follow-up after laparoscopic Heller cardiomyotomy (LHCM) is controversial. In this study, we evaluated the role of physiological testing in achalasia patients undergoing LHCM and its correlation with symptomatic evaluation. Materials and Methods: Case records of patients undergoing LHCM for achalasia between January 2017 and March 2020 were reviewed for symptom scores (Eckardt score and achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life) and physiological parameters [5-min column height on TBE and median integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) on high-resolution manometry]. Sixty-one patients with complete data in the preoperative period and on follow-up were included in the study. The data was analyzed for symptomatic and physiological outcomes and their correlation using paired t test and the Spearman correlation test. Results: At a median follow-up of 16 months following LHCM, there was a significant improvement in Eckardt score (7.03 +/- 1.53 to 0.93 +/- 1.10, P<0.001), achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life (58.34 +/- 7.81 to 14.57 +/- 13.45, P<0.001), column height on TBE (115.14 +/- 46.9 to 27.89 +/- 34.31, P<0.001) and IRP (23.95 +/- 8.26 to 4.61 +/- 4.11, P<0.001). Eckardt score correlated significantly with achalasia-specific health-related quality-of-life scores preoperatively (rho=0.410, P<0.001) and on follow-up (rho=0.559, P<0.001). There was no correlation between symptomatic parameters and physiological parameters. Conclusions: In patients of achalasia, LHCM leads to significant improvement in symptomatic and physiological parameters. Symptom scores correlate among themselves but not with physiological scores. Thus, physiological testing may not be needed for routine follow-up.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The adoption of telemedicine became a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic because patients found commuting to be difficult owing to travel restrictions. Initially, audio-based teleconsultations were provided. Later, on the basis of the feedback of patients and caregivers, the authors started to provide video-based teleconsultations via WhatsApp. The authors subsequently surveyed the patients and caregivers to determine their satisfaction levels with telemedicine services.
   METHODS An anonymized telephone survey of patients who had participated in teleconsultation was conducted with a structured questionnaire. The responses were analyzed and their correlations with the perceived benefits and limitations of audio and video teleconsultation were determined.
   RESULTS Three hundred respondents were included in the first round of surveys, of whom 250 (83.3%) consented to video teleconsultation. Among the respondents who participated in both audio and video teleconsultations (n = 250), paired analysis showed that video teleconsultation was perceived as better in terms of providing easier access to healthcare services (p < 0.001), saving time (p < 0.001), and satisfaction with the way patient needs were conveyed to healthcare providers (p = 0.023), as well as in terms of adequacy of addressing healthcare needs (p < 0.001) and consequently providing a higher rate of overall satisfaction (p < 0.001). For both audio and video teleconsultation, overall patient satisfaction was significantly related to only previous exposure to WhatsApp. However, for video consultation, longer call duration (p = 0.023) was an important independent factor. Video teleconsultation was preferable to face-to-face consultation irrespective of educational status, but higher education was associated with preference for video teleconsultation.
   CONCLUSIONS Both audio and video teleconsultation are viable cost-effective surrogates for in-person physical neurosurgical consultation. Although audio teleconsultation is more user-friendly and is not restricted by educational status, video teleconsultation trumps the former owing to a more efficient and satisfactory doctor-to-patient interface.

AB  - The heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein D (hnRNPD) serves as a prognostic marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We evaluated the diagnostic potential of hnRNPD to differentiate between OSCC and normal mucosa. Immunohistochemistry for hnRNPD and a routinely used diagnostic marker deltaNp63 (p40) was performed in 32 normal mucosae and 46 OSCC specimens. Subsequently, receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic potential of hnRNPD in comparison to that of p40. Immunostaining for p40 and hnRNPD was observed in 39 (84.78%) and 38 (82.60%) cases, respectively, in OSCC specimens. The poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma displayed 100% (eight cases) immunoreactivity for hnRNPD as compared to 87.5% (seven cases) for p40. Nuclear staining of p40 and hnRNPD was observed in all OSCC specimens. p40 staining was restricted to basal cells, whereas both basal and para-basal cells displayed hnRNPD staining in OSCC specimens. Areas under the curve for p40 and hnRNPD were 0.86 and 0.87, respectively. p40 and hnRNPD showed equal sensitivities (80.95%). However, hnRNPD displayed marginally higher (88.23%) specificity for tumor cells as compared to that of p40 (85.29%). Conclusion: In addition to being a well-established prognostic marker, hnRNPD can serve as a diagnostic marker for OSCC.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the macular vessel density (VD) on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) using proprietary software (automated) and image processing software (manual) in diabetic patients. Methods: In a retrospective study, OCT-A images (Triton, TOPCON Inc.) of type 2 diabetics presenting to a tertiary eye care center in North India between January 2018 and December 2019 with or without nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and with no macular edema were analyzed. Macular images of size 3 x 3 mm were binarized with global thresholding algorithms (ImageJ software). Outcome measures were superficial capillary plexus VD (SCP-VD, automated and manual), deep capillary plexus VD (DCP-VD, manual), and correlation between automated and manual SCP-VD. Results: OCT-A images of 89 eyes (55 patients) were analyzed: no diabetic retinopathy (NoDR): 29 eyes, mild NPDR: 29 eyes, and moderate NPDR: 31 eyes. Automated SCP-VD did not differ between NoDR and mild NPDR (P = 0.69), but differed between NoDR and moderate NPDR (P = 0.014) and between mild and moderate NPDR (P = 0.033). Manual SCP-VD (Huang and Otsu methods) did not differ between the groups. Manual DCP-VD differed between NoDR and mild NPDR and between NoDR and moderate NPDR, but not between mild and moderate NPDR with both Huang (P = 0.024, 0.003, and 0.51, respectively) and Otsu (P = 0.021, 0.006, and 0.43, respectively) methods. Automated SCP-VD correlated moderately with manual SCP-VD using Huang method (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) with a mean difference of -0.01% (agreement limits from -6.60% to +6.57%). Conclusion: DCP-VD differs consistently between NoDR and NPDR with image processing, while SCP-VD shows variable results. Different thresholding algorithms provide different results, and there is a need to establish consensus on the most suited algorithm.

AB  - Purpose: To report the clinical profile and treatment outcomes of patients with culture-positive Acremonium keratitis.
   Methods: This is a retrospective observational study. Medical records of all patients treated in a tertiary eye hospital for culture positive infective keratitis from March 2016 to February 2021 were screened, of which those positive for Acremonium species on fungal culture were reviewed. Demographic details, clinical presentation, clinical course, treatment given, total follow-up duration, time taken for ulcer to heal, scar size, and final visual acuity in the last follow-up were recorded.
   Results: Fifty three cases of fungal keratitis caused by Acremonium species were identified, 22 females and 31 males, with average age of 46.39 +/- 18.64 years. The mean duration of symptoms being 54.47 +/- 50 days. Only five patients had a history of trauma with vegetative matter. Clinical presentation of patients showed a large number of variations, with 2 patients presenting as peripheral ulcerative keratitis and 1 with epithelial plaque. The mean visual acuity of patients at presentation was 2.43 +/- 0.46 logMAR units. Thirty-three of 53 patients presented with perforated corneal ulcer and underwent penetrating keratoplasty; 20 patients were medically managed on topical voriconazole 1%, natamycin 5%, and oral voriconazole. The mean duration of healing of epithelial defect was 95 +/- 60.62 days (range 60-165 days).
   Conclusion: Acremonium keratitis has a long and indolent course. A prolonged combination therapy of natamycin and voriconazole seems to be effective in the management. A delay in the diagnosis of Acremonium keratitis often leads to clinical worsening requiring keratoplasty.

AB  - Introduction In India about 95% of individuals who need treatment for common mental disorders like depression, stress and anxiety and substance use are unable to access care. Stigma associated with help seeking and lack of trained mental health professionals are important barriers in accessing mental healthcare. Systematic Medical Appraisal, Referral and Treatment (SMART) Mental Health integrates a community-level stigma reduction campaign and task sharing with the help of a mobile-enabled electronic decision support system (EDSS)-to reduce psychiatric morbidity due to stress, depression and self-harm in high-risk individuals. This paper presents and discusses the protocol for process evaluation of SMART Mental Health. Methods and analysis The process evaluation will use mixed quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate implementation fidelity and identify facilitators of and barriers to implementation of the intervention. Case studies of six intervention and two control clusters will be used. Quantitative data sources will include usage analytics extracted from the mHealth platform for the trial. Qualitative data sources will include focus group discussions and interviews with recruited participants, primary health centre doctors, community health workers (Accredited Social Health Activits) who participated in the project and local community leaders. The design and analysis will be guided by Medical Research Council framework for process evaluations, the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, and the normalisation process theory. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the ethics committee of the George Institute for Global Health, India and the Institutional Ethics Committee, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi. Findings of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, stakeholder meetings, digital and social media platforms.

T2  - MICROORGANISMS
KW  - mucormycosis COVID-19
KW  - intracranial fungal infection
KW  - COVID-19
AB  - (1) Background: During the second wave of COVID-19, India faced a rapid and sudden surge of not only COVID19-delta variant cases but also mucormycosis, making the infection even more fatal. We conducted a study to determine factors associated with the occurrence of mucormycosis in patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: This case-control study comprised 121 patients; 61 cases (mucormycosis with COVID-19) and 60 controls. Patients were included from April 10, 2021 onwards. Follow-up was conducted after about 90 days and health status was recorded based on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). (3) Results: Mucormycosis with COVID-19 cases had a median (IQR) age of 49 (43-59) years with 65.6% males and were older (95% CI 1.015-1.075; p = 0.002) than in the control group with median (IQR) 38 (29-55.5) years and 66.6% males. Baseline raised serum creatinine (OR = 4.963; 95% CI 1.456-16.911; p = 0.010) and D-dimer (OR = 1.000; 95% CI 1.000-1.001; p = 0.028) were independently associated with the occurrence of mucormycosis in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, diabetes mellitus (OR = 26.919; 95% CI 1.666-434.892; p = 0.020) was associated with poor outcomes and increased mortality in patients with mucormycosis with COVID-19 as per the multivariable analysis. A total of 30/61 mucormycosis patients had intracranial involvement. (4) Conclusions: The study observed elevated levels of baseline raised creatinine and D-dimer in mucormycosis pa-tients with COVID-19 as compared to the control group. However, future studies may be conducted to establish this cause-effect relationship.

TI  - Vanishing White Matter Disease Presenting as Dementia and Infertility
T2  - NEUROLOGY-GENETICS
AB  - Objectives
   Vanishing white matter (VWM), an inherited leukoencephalopathy affecting the brain and the spinal cord, is most often a childhood-onset progressive disorder, generally presenting with ataxia. The adult-onset VWM is relatively rare with slowly progressive cognitive dysfunction dominating the clinical presentation. We report a case of adult-onset VWM from the Indian subcontinent.
   Methods
   Exome sequencing.
   Results
   A 58-year-old woman with young-onset diabetes and hypertension presented with gradually progressive cognitive decline beginning at age 40 years. She had early and predominant executive dysfunction and emotional lability and late involvement of memory and navigation. In addition to cognitive dysfunction, the patient experienced bladder and bowel incontinence along with a spastic gait. She also had primary infertility and menopause at age 40 years. Two of the patient's sisters had primary infertility; one of them had urine and stool incontinence along with gait disturbance. An MRI examination of the brain showed diffuse, symmetrical T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery white matter hyperintensities. On genetic testing, the patient was found to be homozygous for c.687T>G variation in the EIF2B3 gene.
   Discussion
   Adult-onset VWM is rare. Infertility in an adult patient with progressive cognitive decline should raise a suspicion of VWM.

AB  - Immune check point inhibitors such as nivolumab are changing the treatment paradigm of relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (r/rHL). Data from single arm studies have shown nivolumab to be an effective and safe therapy. Real world data from resource constrained settings are limited. Our study is a retrospective single center analysis of nivolumab in r/rHL from India. Data regarding baseline and pretreatment characteristics were collected for 20 patients treated with nivolumab from January 2016 to March 2021. Of 20, 15 patients received nivolumab in modified protocol, because of financial limitations. Postnivolumab therapy, the overall response rate was 90%, with 40% in complete remission. The median progression free survival was 13.1 month (95% confidence interval 8.33 mo, not reached) and median overall survival not reached, at a follow up of 24.3 months. No patients discontinued nivolumab because of side effects. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed no effect of dose reduction or increased duration of administration. Most common adverse effect seen was autoimmune hypothyroidism. Possible delayed immune-related side effects were seen in 3 out 5 patients in peritransplant period, in those who received nivolumab as salvage regimen before autologous stem cell transplant. In conclusion, nivolumab shows comparable efficacy and safety even with compromised dosing and schedule of administration of the drug in real world setting.

AB  - Indian healthcare is fast growing and with significant chunk of it being in small, fragmented, informal sector; Artificial Intelligence (AI) is pegged as a magical tool for a better healthcare system. There is an inclination to merely mimic the US approach in the on-going policy making and legislative exercises, which can have serious fallouts for Indian healthcare.
   India needs a different approach to suite her unique requirements. In this regard, each of the five stages in AI development lifecycle has been analyzed in the light of current on-ground realities. These boil down to three fold challenges of how to increase adoption of digital health, prevent data silos and create maximum value from data.
   Availability of quality data for value addition without barriers and restrictions is the common denominator for leveraging the full potential of AI. This requires liberal policies enabling secondary use of data in developing countries with rapidly growing healthcare sector akin to India. This has to be carefully balanced with data privacy and security.
   Restrictive healthcare data policies and laws can slow down adoption of digitization, perpetuate status-quo, be biased towards the incumbent players, cause Industry stagnation and thus will do more harm than good. It is therefore the data policies that will make or break AI in Indian healthcare.

AB  - Introduction Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is a generalized term, usually known as "jelly belly" since 1884. Incidence is very low, 1-3 per million people per year. Because of its indolent nature, it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, thereby impacting the quality of life. The 5-year survival rate varies from 23 to 86% in world literature. Even 10 years and 20 years of survival have been described. With our experience, we like to propose rename of PMP as abdomino-peritoneal mucinous carcinoma (APM) as we strongly feel the time has come to specify the term and standardize the management strategy. Methodology In the premier institute of India and as a tertiary referral center, we experienced the maximum number of advanced cases of APM. From 2012 to 2021, we analyzed all the APM patients based on a prospectively maintained computerized database in the department of surgical oncology and found the reasons for renaming from this traditional one. Results We included a total of 87 patients who underwent surgical intervention. Thirty-five patients underwent cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), and 52 patients underwent debulking. In CRS-HIPEC patients, CC-0 was achieved in 28 patients (80%), CC-1 in 4 patients (11.4%), and CC-2 in 3 patients (8.6%). Palliative intent HIPEC was done in 3 patients (8.6%). Clavien-Dindo grade III and IV morbidity was observed in 18.8% of patients with 90 days mortality of 5.7%. Conclusion With our long-term experience and advancement of scientific evidence, we like to propose a new name for PMP as APM. We strongly believe this paper will give a clear picture of this rare disease and standard management outlines.

AB  - Background: Histological changes induced by gluten in the duodenal mucosa of patients with non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are poorly defined. Objectives: To evaluate the structural and inflammatory features of NCGS compared to controls and coeliac disease (CeD) with milder enteropathy (Marsh I-II). Methods: Well-oriented biopsies of 262 control cases with normal gastroscopy and histologic findings, 261 CeD, and 175 NCGS biopsies from 9 contributing countries were examined. Villus height (VH, in mu m), crypt depth (CrD, in mu m), villus-to-crypt ratios (VCR), IELs (intraepithelial lymphocytes/100 enterocytes), and other relevant histological, serologic, and demographic parameters were quantified. Results: The median VH in NCGS was significantly shorter (600, IQR: 400-705) than controls (900, IQR: 667-1112) (p < 0.001). NCGS patients with Marsh I-II had similar VH and VCR to CeD [465 mu m (IQR: 390-620) vs. 427 mu m (IQR: 348-569, p = 0 center dot 176)]. The VCR in NCGS with Marsh 0 was lower than controls (p < 0.001). The median IEL in NCGS with Marsh 0 was higher than controls (23.0 vs. 13.7, p < 0.001). To distinguish Marsh 0 NCGS from controls, an IEL cut-off of 14 showed 79% sensitivity and 55% specificity. IEL densities in Marsh I-II NCGS and CeD groups were similar. Conclusion: NCGS duodenal mucosa exhibits distinctive changes consistent with an intestinal response to luminal antigens, even at the Marsh 0 stage of villus architecture.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the efficacy of physiological, non-detergent eyelid wipes with conventional lid hygiene in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Methods: Fifty participants with MGD were recruited and randomized into two groups. Participants in group I used Evolve Pure (TM) Eyewipes twice a day to clean the eyelid debris along with standard therapy (antibiotic and lubricants) and participants in group II followed lid hygiene with warm compresses along with standard therapy. Symptoms, ocular surface assessment (lipid layer thickness, tear meniscus height, non-invasive tear film breakup time, and meibography), slit-lamp biomicroscopy (eyelash contamination, meibomian gland blockage, meibomian gland secretion, and meibomian gland telangiectasia) and tear film osmolarity were noted at baseline and 90 days after therapy. Results: Significant improvement in symptoms and signs of MGD was observed in both groups after treatment (P < 0.001); however, the clinical improvement was better with the use of eyelid wipes. Lipid layer thickness increased significantly in group I (P = 0.0006) and group II (P = 0.0002), which was maintained even after adjusting for sociodemographic variables such as age, sex, and severity score of symptoms and signs. Conclusion: Lipid layer thickness of the tear film is a sensitive marker in monitoring response to treatment in patients with MGD. The use of physiological detergent-free eyelid wipes is non-inferior to lid hygiene and warm compresses, which remains the mainstay for treatment of MGD; the clinical improvement with eyelid wipes was noted to be better.

AB  - Due to lack of well-designed trials, there is no good evidence on the efficacy of stem cells in spinal cord injury. We aim to study the efficacy and outcome of bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) in acute complete spinal cord injury (SCI).
   In this prospective study over a 3-year period, 27 patients with acute, complete SCI were randomized to receive BMSCs or placebo (intramedullary route) intraoperatively. Institutional ethics approval was taken and informed consent was taken from all patients. Functional outcome was assessed using ASIA scale, SCIM score and SSEP responses preoperatively, three and six months after surgery.
   Thirteen patients were available for final analysis of which six were in the stem cell group and seven received placebo. 6 patients had improvement by at least one grade in ASIA score in the stem cell group as compared to only one patient in the placebo group. However, no functional motor improvement in any of the patients. ASIA sensory score improved from a preoperative mean of 124 to 224 at 6 months compared to the static mean of 115 in the control group. Absent SSEP waveform converted to abnormal waveform at 6 months in 3 patients in the stem cell group and one patient in the control group. There was no significant difference in the SCIM scores between the groups at last follow-up. All patients in the stem cell group reported improved bladder sensation, decreased spasticity and improved posture control as compared to nine in the placebo group. BMSCs through intramedullary route are a potential therapy for acute complete SCI and more research is required in this area.

AB  - A 65-year-old male with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage underwent 25G pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). A large disk of thick organized blood of 5 disk diameter (DD) size was encountered in subhyaloid space. All attempts including lower cut rates to remove this disk using a 25G cutter turned futile. We used a 20G fragmatome to safely remove this hard clot from vitreous cavity in 50 s. Surgical time for removal of similar clot of 3 DD by 25G cutter in another eye was 5 min. Removal of thick clotted subhyaloid blood by ultrasonic fragmentation during diabetic vitrectomy is a safe, faster, and useful maneuver.

AB  - Introduction
   Two pharmacological possibilities exist for an acute ischemic stroke (AIS): recanalization of the occluded artery and neuroprotection from ischaemic injury, the latter's efficacy being debatable. We sought to determine whether administration of Citicoline immediately after recanalization therapy for AIS would improve clinical and radiological outcome at three months compared to standard treatment alone.
   Patients and methods
   CAISR was a single centre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial with blinded endpoint assessment. It was approved by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences Institutional ethics committee and registered at the Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2018/011900). We recruited participants with AIS undergoing recanalization therapy and randomly assigned them to receive either Citicoline or placebo in 1:1 ratio. Citicoline arm patients received Citicoline 1 gm BD intravenously for three days, followed by oral citicoline 1 gm BD for 39 days. Placebo arm patients received 100 ml intravenous normal saline for three days, followed by multivitamin tablet BD for 39 days. All patients received standard of care.
   Outcome
   Blinded assessors did the follow-up assessment at six weeks (MRI Brain-stroke volume) and three months (NIHSS 0-2, mRS 0-2 and Barthel index> = 95).
   Results
   The infarct volume decreased from week 1 to week 6 by 2.6 cm(3) on placebo versus 4.2 cm(3) on Citicoline (p-0.483). The OR for achieving NIHSS 0-2, mRS 0-2 and Barthel index> = 95 with Citicoline was found to be 0.96(95%CI 0.39-2.40), 0.92(95%CI 0.40-2.05) and 0.87 (95%CI 10.22-2.98) respectively.
   Conclusion
   CAISR was the first to evaluate the role of Citicoline, when used immediately after recanalization therapy, when the penumbral tissue is the most susceptible either to be protected from injury or become ischemic. We did not find any significant difference between the Citicoline or placebo arms with respect to either our primary or secondary outcomes.

AB  - Fibrin is the fibrous protein network that comprises blood clots; it is uniquely capable of bearing very large tensile strains (up to 200%) due to multiscale force accommodation mechanisms. Fibrin is also a biochemical scaffold for numerous enzymes and blood factors. The biomechanics and biochemistry of fibrin have been independently studied. However, comparatively little is known about how fibrin biomechanics and biochemistry are coupled: how does fibrin deformation influence its biochemistry? In this study, we show that mechanically induced protein structural changes in fibrin affect fibrin biochemistry. We find that tensile deformation of fibrin leads to molecular structural transitions of a-helices to beta-sheets, which reduced binding of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), an enzyme that initiates fibrin lysis. Moreover, binding of tPA and Thioflavin T, a commonly used beta-sheet marker, were mutually exclusive, further demonstrating the mechano-chemical control of fibrin biochemistry. Finally, we demonstrate that structural changes in fibrin suppressed the biological activity of platelets on mechanically strained fibrin due to reduced aIIb beta 3 integrin binding. Our work shows that mechanical strain regulates fibrin molecular structure and biological activity in an elegant mechanochemical feedback loop, which possibly extends to other fibrous biopolymers.

AB  - Background: Evaluation of perfusion characteristics is the key to characterize vascular anomalies. Contrastenhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a radiation-free modality to evaluate this in real-time and can be coupled along with Doppler-ultrasound (US). Objective: To evaluate the utility of CEUS in characterization of suspected soft-tissue vascular anomalies and compare its diagnostic accuracy with Doppler-US. Materials and methods: This was an ethically-approved cross-sectional study, done from November 2017November 2019, involving 93 patients (55 M/38F; mean age 23.6 +/- 11.9 years) in development cohort and 128 (66 M/62F; mean age 21.4 +/- 11.1 years) in validation cohort. Patients suspected to have soft-tissue vascular anomalies on clinical evaluation and US were included. Clinical features, US, Doppler, subjective and quantitative CEUS features (from time-intensity curves) were evaluated. Composite gold standard employing MRI, phlebogram, DSA or biopsy was used to make the final diagnosis. The CEUS features found to be significantly different in the development cohort were prospectively validated in the validation cohort. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant, ROC curves were drawn and threshold values obtained for the various quantitative parameters. A prospective diagnosis was suggested in the validation group along with a degree of diagnostic confidence and accuracy was calculated. Results: The spectrum of lesions included 77 venous malformations, 46 fibro-adipose vascular anomalies, 32 vascular tumors, 20 arteriovenous malformations and 20 lymphatic malformations. All lesions were found to have distinctive temporal and morphological subjective enhancement patterns. Quantitative parameters like risetime, mean-transit-time, time-to-peak, peak-enhancement showed significant differences between the various groups (P value < 0.05). Addition of CEUS not only increased the diagnostic accuracy of Doppler-US from 76.5% (91/119) to 88.2% (105/119), but also the degree of diagnostic confidence in characterization of soft-tissue vascular anomalies. None of the patients showed any contrast-related adverse effects. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is useful to characterize different types of soft-tissue vascular anomalies and increases the diagnostic accuracy and confidence over Doppler-ultrasound.

AB  - Postoperative astigmatism is one of the common complications affecting visual outcomes after a penetrating keratoplasty. It can result from various factors related to host, donor and surgical technique, resulting in suboptimal visual outcome. While some of the measures taken during preoperative planning and during actual surgery can reduce the magnitude of postoperative astigmatism, postoperative correction of astigmatism is often required in cases with high degrees of astigmatism. When spectacles and contact lenses fail to provide optimal visual outcomes, various surgical techniques that include astigmatic keratotomy, compression sutures, tonc intraocular lens placement, and laser refractive procedures can be considered. When none of these techniques are able to achieve a desired result with in the acceptable optical range, a repeat keratoplasty is considered a last option. We discuss the various causes and management of complication of postoperative astigmatism occurring after a full thickness comeal transplantation surgery.(c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the role of frailty and inflammatory markers in predicting the short-term outcomes after catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) and central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI).
   METHODS: Data regarding the patients' characteristics, isolates on CAUTI and CLABSI, antibiotic susceptibility, frailty (11-point Modified Frailty Index), and inflammatory markers were retrospectively collected. Their impact on the short-term outcomes was assessed using regression modeling response.
   RESULTS: One hundred and one patients with CAUTI (n = 71) and CLABSI (n = 30) between January 2018 and December 2019 were included in this study. The pooled incidence rates for CAUTI were 5.50 and for CLABSI 3.58 episodes/1000 catheter-days. We observed 74.7% drug resistance in our CAUTI isolates and 93.3% in CLABSI. In the multivariate analysis, frailty (P = 0.006), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P = 0.007) and the presence of sepsis (P = 0.029) were found to be significant predictors of in-hospital mortality in CAUTI. In patients with CLABSI, frailty (P = 0.029) and NLR (P = 0.029) were found significant and along with sepsis (P = 0.069) resulted in a regression model with good accuracy in predicting mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that 11-point Modified Frailty Index and NLR as well as the regression model significantly predicted mortality with an area under the curve of 86.1%, 81.4%, and 95.4%, respectively, in CAUTI, and 70.9%, 77.8%, and 95.2%, respectively, in CLABSI.

AB  - Juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG) is a subset of primary open-angle glaucoma that is diagnosed before 40 years of age. The disease may be familial or non-familial, with pro-portions varying among different populations. Myocilin mutations are the most commonly associated. JOAG is characterized by high intraocular pressures (IOP), with many patients needing surgery. The mean age at diagnosis is in the 3rd decade, with a male preponderance. Myopia is a common association. The pathophysiology underlying the disease is immaturity of the conventional outflow pathways, which may or may not be observed on gonioscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography. The unique optic nerve head features include large discs with deep, steep cupping associated with high IOP-induced damage. Pro-gression rates among JOAG patients are comparable to adult primary glaucomas, but as the disease affects younger patients, the projected disability from this disease is higher. Early di-agnosis, prompt management, and life-long monitoring play an important role in preventing disease progression. Gene-based therapies currently under investigation offer future hope.

AB  - Purpose Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) who fail therapy or develop a relapse are initiated on a retreatment regimen. These patients are at high risk for adverse outcomes. This study aimed to assess the relationship between plasma levels of anti-tubercular drugs and therapy outcome in patients on retreatment. Methods Pharmacokinetics of retreatment regimen drugs [isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA), ethambutol (EMB), and streptomycin (STM)] were compared between cured and not-cured patients using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in 134 patients with PTB on a retreatment regimen. Results Of 134 patients, 108 were cured, 17 developed multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), and 9 remained smear-positive after completion of the retreatment (8 months). Two-hour plasma levels (C-2hr) at Day 0 were lower in 'not cured' subjects than 'cured' subjects and reflected the drug levels achieved later in the duration of retreatment. Notably, in the 26 'not cured' subjects, C-2hr plasma levels after the first dose at Day 0 were significantly low (INH: 0.86 vs. 2.94 mg/L, p <= 0.002, RIF: 0.56 vs. 2.55 mg/L, p <= 0.003, PZA: 1.85 vs. 26.58 mg/L, p <= 0.001 and EMB: 0.72 vs. 1.53 mg/L, p <= 0.010). Conclusion Therapeutic failure in patients with PTB on a retreatment regimen is associated with lower plasma drug levels. Therapeutic drug monitoring would prove useful for obtaining a favorable clinical outcome. C-2hr levels on Day 0 reflected drug levels achieved later and could be a good predictor of patient outcome.

AB  - Pain is an unpleasant and upsetting experience. Persistent pain has an impact on an individual's quality of life which causes stress and mood disorders. There are currently no pain-relieving techniques available that can eliminate pain and offer relief without causing any adverse effects. These factors draw attention to traditional treatments like yoga and meditation, which can reduce biological stress and hence increase immunity, as well as alleviate the psychological and emotional suffering produced by pain. Yoga reduces the stress response and the pain cascade via the downregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and vagal stimulation. Yoga is a cost-effective growing health practice that, unlike pharmaceuticals, has no side effects and can help patients stay in remission for longer periods of time with fewer relapses. Yoga not only reduces stress and depression severity but also improves functional status and reduces pain perception. This article highlights the impact of yoga on pain management and on a malfunctioning immune system, which leads to improved health, pain reduction, disease management, and improvement in overall quality of life.

AB  - Low-grade dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) are a frequent cause of drug-refractory epilepsy. Molecular mechanisms underlying seizure generation in these tumors are poorly understood. This study was conducted to identify altered genes in nonneoplastic epileptogenic cortical tissues (ECTs) resected from DNT patients during electrocorticography (ECoG)-guided surgery. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) was used to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in these high-spiking ECTs compared to non-epileptic controls. A total of 477 DEGs (180 upregulated; 297 downregulated) were observed in the ECTs compared to non-epileptic controls. Gene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of genes belonging to the following Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways: (i) glutamatergic synapse; (ii) nitrogen metabolism; (iii) transcriptional misregulation in cancer; and (iv) protein digestion and absorption. The glutamatergic synapse pathway was enriched by DEGs such as GRM4, SLC1A6, GRIN2C, GRM2, GRM5, GRIN3A, and GRIN2B. Enhanced glutamatergic activity was observed in the pyramidal neurons of ECTs, which could be attributed to altered synaptic transmission in these tissues compared to non-epileptic controls. Besides glutamatergic synapse, altered expression of other genes such as GABRB1 (synapse formation), SLIT2 (axonal growth), and PROKR2 (neuron migration) could be linked to epileptogenesis in ECTs. Also, upregulation of GABRA6 gene in ECTs could underlie benzodiazepine resistance in these patients. Neural cell-type-specific gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed transcriptome of ECTs to be predominantly contributed by microglia and neurons. This study provides first comprehensive gene expression profiling of nonneoplastic ECTs of DNT patients and identifies genes/pathways potentially linked to epileptogenesis.

AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory infection in young children. We previously estimated that in 2015, 33.1 million episodes of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection occurred in children aged 0-60 months, resulting in a total of 118 200 deaths worldwide. Since then, several community surveillance studies have been done to obtain a more precise estimation of RSV associated community deaths. We aimed to update RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection morbidity and mortality at global, regional, and national levels in children aged 0-60 months for 2019, with focus on overall mortality and narrower infant age groups that are targeted by RSV prophylactics in development.
   Methods In this systematic analysis, we expanded our global RSV disease burden dataset by obtaining new data from an updated search for papers published between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2020, from MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, OpenGrey, CNKI, Wanfang, and ChongqingVIP. We also included unpublished data from RSV GEN collaborators. Eligible studies reported data for children aged 0-60 months with RSV as primary infection with acute lower respiratory infection in community settings, or acute lower respiratory infection necessitating hospital admission; reported data for at least 12 consecutive months, except for in-hospital case fatality ratio (CFR) or for where RSV seasonality is well-defined; and reported incidence rate, hospital admission rate, RSV positive proportion in acute lower respiratory infection hospital admission, or in-hospital CFR. Studies were excluded if case definition was not clearly defined or not consistently applied, RSV infection was not laboratory confirmed or based on serology alone, or if the report included fewer than 50 cases of acute lower respiratory infection. We applied a generalised linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) to estimate RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence, hospital admission, and in-hospital mortality both globally and regionally (by country development status and by World Bank Income Classification) in 2019. We estimated country-level RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection incidence through a risk-factor based model. We developed new models (through GLMM) that incorporated the latest RSV community mortality data for estimating overall RSV mortality. This review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021252400).
   Findings In addition to 317 studies included in our previous review, we identified and included 113 new eligible studies and unpublished data from 51 studies, for a total of 481 studies. We estimated that globally in 2019, there were 33.0 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 25.4-44.6 million), 3.6 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions (2.9-4.6 million), 26 300 RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (15100-49 100), and 101 400 RSV-attributable overall deaths (84 500-125 200) in children aged 0-60 months. In infants aged 0-6 months, we estimated that there were 6.6 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes (4.6-9.7 million), 1.4 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions (1.0-2.0 million), 13 300 RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital deaths (6800-28 100), and 45 700 RSV-attributable overall deaths (38 400-55 900). 2.0% of deaths in children aged 0-60 months (UR 1.6-2.4) and 3.6% of deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months (3.0-4.4) were attributable to RSV. More than 95% of RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection episodes and more than 97% of RSV-attributable deaths across all age bands were in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Interpretation RSV contributes substantially to morbidity and mortality burden globally in children aged 0-60 months, especially during the first 6 months of life and in LMICs. We highlight the striking overall mortality burden of RSV disease worldwide, with one in every 50 deaths in children aged 0-60 months and one in every 28 deaths in children aged 28 days to 6 months attributable to RSV. For every RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection in-hospital death, we estimate approximately three more deaths attributable to RSV in the community. RSV passive immunisation programmes targeting protection during the first 6 months of life could have a substantial effect on reducing RSV disease burden, although more data are needed to understand the implications of the potential age-shifts in peak RSV burden to older age when these are implemented.

AB  - Celiac disease (CeD) is a chronic, immune-mediated enteropathy that is precipitated by dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals expressing HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8. In the current clinical practice, there are many serologic studies to aid in the diagnosis of CeD which include autoantibodies like IgA antitissue transglutaminase, antiendomysium, and antideamidated forms of gliadin peptide antibodies. Small intestinal biopsy has long been considered an essential step for the diagnosis of CeD. However, in the recent era, researchers have explored the possibility of CeD screening and diagnosis without endoscopy or biopsy. The newer emerging biomarkers of CeD appear promising in diagnostic evaluation and subsequent monitoring of disease. In this review of literature, we have explored the emerging biomarker-based diagnostic evaluation and monitoring of CeD.

AB  - Mitochondria play a central role in maintaining cellular and metabolic homeostasis during vital development cycles of foetal growth. Optimal mitochondrial functions are important not only to sustain adequate energy production but also for regulated epigenetic programming. However, these organelles are subtle targets of environmental exposures, and any perturbance in the defined mitochondrial machinery during the developmental stage can lead to the re-programming of the foetal epigenetic landscape. As these modifications can be transferred to subsequent generations, we herein performed a cross-sectional study to have an in-depth understanding of this intricate phenomenon. The study was conducted with two arms: whereas the first group consisted of in utero pro-oxidant exposed individuals and the second group included controls. Our results showed higher levels of oxidative mtDNA damage and associated integrated stress response among the exposed individuals. These disturbances were found to be closely related to the observed discrepancies in mitochondrial biogenesis. The exposed group showed mtDNA hypermethylation and changes in allied mitochondrial functioning. Altered expression of mitomiRs and their respective target genes in the exposed group indicated the possibilities of a disturbed mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk. This was further confirmed by the modified activity of the mitochondrial stress regulators and pro-inflammatory mediators among the exposed group. Importantly, the disturbed DNMT functioning, hypermethylation of nuclear DNA, and higher degree of post-translational histone modifications established the existence of aberrant epigenetic modifications in the exposed individuals. Overall, our results demonstrate the first molecular insights of in utero pro-oxidant exposure associated changes in the mitochondrial-epigenetic axis. Although, our study might not cement an exposure-response relationship for any particular environmental pro-oxidant, but suffice to establish a dogma of mito-epigenetic reprogramming at intrauterine milieu with chronic illness, a hitherto unreported interaction.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The phenotypic features and morphogenesis of the 'sinus venosus defect' remain controversial. The phenotypic features are anomalous systemic connections of 1 or more pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connection, usually associated with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. Cases with these features, however, have not always been described as sinus venosus defects.
   METHODS: We reviewed the findings documented in the literature from 11 patients with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein, most reported following an autopsy examination. We compared these findings with the anatomical details of 50 patients undergoing surgical correction in our centre, paying particular attention to the override of the superior caval vein.
   RESULTS: In only two-thirds of those undergoing surgery did the superior caval vein override the rims of the oval fossa, with the degree of override >50% in only 2 individuals. It is only these latter 2 cases that are directly comparable to the reported cases of biatrial connection of the superior caval vein.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our comparisons provide new insights into the developmental background and phenotypic features of the superior sinus venosus defect. The defects exist because of the anomalous systemic connection of the pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connections but not always in association with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. In extreme cases, nonetheless, they can underscore the connection of the caval vein to the morphologically left atrium, frequently described previously as a 'biatrial connection'. The sinus venosus defect is better considered a venovenous malformation than a septal defect.

TI  - Identification of metabolite extraction method for targeted exploration of antimicrobial resistance associated metabolites of <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - INSIGHTS
KW  - MECHANISMS
AB  - Antimicrobial resistant Klebsiellapneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), as being a pathogen of critical clinical concern, urgently demands effective therapeutic options. However, the discovery of novel antibiotics over the last three decades has declined drastically and necessitates exploring novel strategies. Metabolomic modulation has been the promising approach for the development of effective therapeutics to deal with AMR; however, only limited efforts have been made to-date, possibly due to the unavailability of suitable metabolites extraction protocols. Therefore, in order to establish a detailed metabolome of K. pneumoniae and identify a method for targeted exploration of metabolites that are involved in the regulation of AMR associated processes, metabolites were extracted using multiple methods of metabolites extraction (freeze-thaw cycle (FTC) and sonication cycle (SC) method alone or in combination (FTC followed by SC; FTC + SC)) from K. pneumoniae cells and then identified using an orbitrap mass analyzer (ESI-LC-MS/MS). A total of 151 metabolites were identified by using FTC, 132 metabolites by using FTC+SC, 103 metabolites by using SC and 69 metabolites common among all the methods used which altogether enabled the identification of 199 unique metabolites. Of these 199, 70 metabolites were known to have an association with AMR phenotype and among these, the FTC + SC method yielded better (identified 55 metabolites), quantitatively and qualitatively compared to FTC and SC alone (identified 51 and 41 metabolites respectively). Each method of metabolite extraction showed a definite degree of biasness and specificity towards chemical classes of metabolites and jointly contributed to the development of a detailed metabolome of the pathogen. FTC method was observed to give higher metabolomic coverage as compared to SC alone and FTC + SC. However, FTC + SC resulted in the identification of a higher number of AMR associated metabolites of K. pneumoniae compared to FTC and SC alone.

AB  - Introduction The ventriculoperitoneal shunt is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. One of the avoidable complications of shunt surgery is shunt infection. This PRISMA-compliant meta-analysis analysed the effectiveness of topical and/or intraventricular antibiotics in preventing shunt infections in patients undergoing shunt surgery.
   Methods Four databases were searched from inception to 30th June 2021. Only original articles comparing the rate of shunt infection with and without antibiotics were included. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compare the effect of the use of antibiotics in preventing infection and subgroup analysis for finding differences in various antibiotics.
   Results The rate of shunt infection was 2.24% (53 out of 2362) in the topical antibiotic group in comparison to 5.24% (145 out of 2764) in the control group (p = 0.008). Subgroup analysis revealed that there is no significant difference between the antibiotics used.
   Conclusions Our meta-analysis found that the risk of shunt infection is significantly reduced with the use of topical and intraventricular antibiotics without any serious adverse effect. No side effects of topical or intraventricular antibiotics were reported in the included studies. Further prospective studies are required to establish the safety and optimal dosage of topical antibiotics for them to be used routinely in neurosurgical practice. They can be used in patients at high risk of developing shunt infections till such studies are available.

AB  - Background:Surgical smoke generated through energy devices may present detrimental effects on individuals present in the operating room (OR). Despite the concerns possibly associated with surgical smoke, there may be no mandatory policies that suggest protective measures and limited firm standards are committed yet to address the same. AimThe aim of this paper is to present recommendations for surgeons and OR personnel by taking a consensus approach based on available literature and its interpretation by a multi-national panel of experts. MethodsThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) group was established with the aims of reviewing literature evidence, discussing key issues regarding surgical smoke and its hazards, and offering a summary of statements in achieving a smoke-free OR environment. Eleven expert surgeons from the international APAC region were gathered with the purpose of coming to a consensus on engineering, best work-practices, and administrative controls in minimizing surgical smoke exposure. A two-phase consensus method was used to obtain opinions from the expert panel of specialists. Statements with an agreement of more than 80% were accepted. FindingsFor twenty-one statements, the panel achieved consensus on 17 statements; another 5 were dropped due to lack of consensus. The consensus was obtained on statements that address the need for the implementation of administrative policies, training and awareness, standard procedure for the continued use of engineering controls, stringent work practice controls and preventive controls. ConclusionThe statements presented may guide surgeons and OR personnel in the practical management of surgical smoke safety, mitigating the risks associated with it. The consensus statement also provides a series of recommendations that can be used with other stakeholders, such as policymakers, hospital administrators and professional societies, to highlight and motivate the implementation of meaningful policies.

AB  - FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) promotes glioblastoma (GBM) by promoting protumorigenic inflammatory cytokine expression in tumor cells. However, tumors also have an immunosuppressive microenvironment maintained by mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta cytokines. Here, we have studied the role of FAT1 in tumor immune suppression. Our preliminary TIMER2.0 analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed an inverse correlation of FAT1 expression with infiltration of tumor-inhibiting immune cells (such as monocytes and T cells) and a positive correlation with tumor-promoting immune cells [such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)] in various cancers. We have analyzed the role of FAT1 in modulating the expression of TGF-beta 1/2 in resected human gliomas, primary glioma cultures, and other cancer cell lines (U87MG, HepG2, Panc-1, and HeLa). Positive correlations of gene expression of FAT1 and TGF-beta 1/2 were observed in various cancers in TCGA, Glioma Longitudinal Analysis Consortium (GLASS), and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Positive expression correlations of FAT1 were also found with TGF-beta 1/2 and Serpine1 (downstream target) in fresh-frozen GBM samples using q-PCR. siRNA-mediated FAT1 knockdown in cancer cell lines and in primary cultures led to decreased TGF-beta 1/2 expression/secretion as assessed by q-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. There was increased chemotaxis (transmigration) of THP-1 monocytes toward siFAT1-transfected tumor cell supernatant as a consequence of decreased TGF-beta 1/2 secretion. Reduced TGF-beta 1 expression was also observed in THP-1 cultured in conditioned media from FAT1-depleted glioma cells, thus contributing to immune suppression. In U87MG cells, decreased TGF-beta 1 upon FAT1 knockdown was mediated by miR-663a, a known modulator. FAT1 expression was also observed to correlate positively with the expression of surrogate markers of MDSCs [programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, and interleukin (IL)-10] in glioma tumors, suggesting a potential role of FAT1 in MDSC-mediated immunosuppression. Hence, our findings elaborate contributions of FAT1 to immune evasion, where FAT1 enables an immunosuppressive microenvironment in GBM and other cancers via TGF-beta 1/2.

AB  - Introduction: 'In-home injuries' are those that occur within the house or its immediate surroundings. The literature on the prevalence and magnitude of home injuries is sparse. This study was designed to characterize the mechanisms of 'in-home' injuries and compare their outcomes with 'outside home injuries'. Materials and Methods: The Australia-India Trauma Systems Collaboration (AITSC) Project created a multi centric registry consisting of trauma patients admitted at four urban tertiary care hospitals in India from April 2016 to March 2018. This registry data was analysed for this study. All admitted patients except for dead on arrival were included. Patients were categorised into 'in-home' and 'outside home' cohorts based on the place where the trauma occurred. The outcome measures were 30 day in-hospital mortality and the length of hospital stay. Two subgroup analyses were performed, the first comprised pediatric patients ( < 15 years) and the second elderly patients > 64 years). Results: Among 9354 patients in the AITSC data registry, 8398 patients were included in the study. Out of these, 29 percent were in-home injuries, whereas the rest occurred outside home. The 30 day in-hospital mortality was 10.6 percent in the 'in-home' cohort, as compared to 13.7 percent in the 'outside home' cohort. This difference although significant on univariable analysis ( p < 0.01), there was no significant difference on multivariable regression analysis, after adjusting for age and injury severity score (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.73-1.04; p = 0.15). The length of hospital stay was shorter in the home injuries group (median = 5 days; IQR = 3-12 days) compared to the outside-home group (median = 7 days; IQR = 4-14 days) ( p < 0.01). In the pediatric and the elderly, on multivariable regression analysis, in-home injuries were associated with higher mortality than outside home injuries. Conclusion: There was no significant difference in the 30 day in-hospital mortality amongst admitted trauma patients sustaining injuries at home or outside the home. However, in pediatric and elderly patients the chances of mortality was significantly higher when injured at home. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - tREPs-A New Class of Functional tRNA-Encoded Peptides
T2  - ACS OMEGA
KW  - GENES
KW  - ORIGIN
AB  - We asked if transfer RNA (tRNA) ever got an opportunity of translating its own sequence during evolution, what would have been the function of such .a.NA-encoded peptides (tREPs)? If not, could one artificially synthesize tREPs to study the corresponding functional outcomes? Here, we report a novel, first-in-the-class, chemically synthesized tREP-18 molecule originating from the Escherichia coli tRNA sequence showing potent antileishmanial property. As a first step, E. coli tRNAs were computationally translated into peptide sequence equivalents and a database of full-length hypothetical tREPs was created. The tREP sequences were sent into sequence, structure, and energy filters to narrow down potential peptides for experimental validation. Based on the functional predictions, tREPs were screened against antiparasitic targets, leading to the identification of tREP-18 as a potential antiparasitic peptide. The in vitro assay of chemically synthesized tREP-18 on the Ag83 strain of Leishmania donovani showed its potent antileishmanial property (IC50 value of 22.13 nM). The atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy images indicated significant alteration in the cytoskeletal architecture of tREP-18-treated parasites. Also, tREP-18 seems to destabilize the mitochondrial membrane potential of parasites, disrupting their cellular integrity and leading to parasitic death. The cellular assays of the tREP-18 peptide on the BS12 strain, a clinical isolate of post-kala azar dermal leishmaniasis, demonstrated its significant efficacy at an IC50 value of 15 nM. The tREP-18 peptide showed a toxic effect on the amastigote stage of the parasite, showing macrophage pathogen clearance at a concentration of 22.5 nM. This study provides the proof of the concept of making a new class of functional peptides from tRNA sequences. It also opens a huge untapped tRNA-peptide space toward novel discoveries and applications. In the future, it would be interesting to perform tREP edits and redesign tREPs toward specific applications.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate if the use of a quality improvement (QI) initiative improves initiation and acceptability of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in critically ill children with respiratory distress. Methods The study was carried out in 3 phases over a period of 6 mo in the pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in children aged 2 mo to 14 y of age. In phase 1, data were collected for 1 mo and reasons for NIV failure were identified. In phase 2, process changes like adherence to checklist, monitoring, and one-day orientation program were instituted. The plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle was carried out in each phase. In phase 3, which was for 2 mo, the acceptance of NIV was measured and results were compared with phase 1. Results A total of 37 patients were included, 12 in phase 1 and 25 in phase 3. NIV failure was recorded in 5 (42%) and 2 (8%) patients in phase 1 and phase 3 (p = 0.025), respectively. The cause of NIV failure was intolerance to the interface in both phases. Sedation was used in 18 (72%) patients in phase 3, as compared to 2 patients in phase 1. Conclusions The use of a quality improvement initiative in the form of a protocol, checklist, and training of the treating team resulted in improved tolerance to NIV, and thereby, its success. Use of sedation may help improve tolerance to the interface and contribute to its success.

AB  - Discoveries in the last few years have emphasized the existence of an enormous breadth of communication between osteo-immune systems. These discoveries fuel novel approaches for the treatment of several bone pathologies including osteoporosis. Bifidobacterium longum (BL) is a preferred probiotic of choice due to its varied immunomodulatory potential in alleviating various inflammatory diseases. Here, we evaluate the effect of BL in an ovariectomy (ovx)-induced post-menopausal osteoporotic mouse model. Our in vitro findings reveal that BL suppresses the differentiation and functional activity of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in both mouse bone marrow cells and human PBMCs. Strikingly, BL-induced Bregs were found to be significantly more efficient in suppressing osteoclastogenesis and modulating Treg-Th17 cell balance with respect to control Bregs in vitro. Our in vivo mu CT and bone mechanical strength data further confirm that BL supplementation significantly enhanced bone mass and bone strength, along with improving the bone microarchitecture in ovx mice. Remarkably, alterations in frequencies of CD19(+)CD1d(hi)CD5(+)IL-10(+) Bregs, CD4(+)Foxp3(+)IL-10(+) Tregs, and CD4(+)Ror gamma t(+)IL-17(+) Th17 cells in distinct lymphoid organs along with serum-cytokine data (enhanced anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines IFN-gamma and IL-10 and reduced osteoclastogenic-cytokines IL-6, IL-17, and TNF-alpha) strongly support the immunomodulatory potential of BL. Altogether, our findings establish a novel osteo-protective and immunomodulatory potential of BL in augmenting bone health under osteoporotic conditions.

AB  - The status of the protocols used for the management of dental trauma (DT) in the eighteenth and early nineteenth-century is largely unknown. The end of World War II saw a tremendous resurgence of high quality research and the development of codes of ethics and publishing. The aim of this scoping review was to analyse articles related to aspects of DT published before 1945 in the English language. An expert group discussion was done to create an a priori protocol based on the PRISMA-2020-guidelines' extension for scoping reviews. A systematic search strategy based upon the Population (P), Exposure (E), Comparator (C), Outcome (O) and Time (T) was performed in five databases on 10 February 2022. Filters were used to identify the literature until 1945, and duplicates were removed. The scrutiny of the titles and abstracts and later the full texts was performed as per the pre-defined eligibility criteria. The grey literature and archives of the English language dentistry literature were searched, and a reference search was also performed. A total of 13 studies were selected from the databases and 20 from the reference searching. The first reported article was from the year 1872. Two other case reports had been published by 1899 and three more before World War I (1914). The majority of the studies originated from the United States of America. Nineteen were case reports, five were original research articles, two were classifications and guidelines papers, and one was a review. During the period before 1945, 33 articles were published regarding DT. The articles were mostly related to the description of cases, although there were a few original research papers. A significant observation, contrary to popular belief, was the presence of articles related to conservative management of injuries to tooth roots and the dental pulp. A progression in terms of the quality of protocols over time was also observed.

AB  - Background: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent cause of abnormal vaginal discharge among pre-menopausal women and associated with adversities of sexual and reproductive health. The present study aimed to identify potential epidemiological and behavioural risk factors and clinical predictors of BV among women in Delhi, India. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess 283 non-pregnant women aged 18-45 years for BV using Nugent's scoring criteria. Information on demographics, sexual behaviours, hygiene practices and clinical symptoms was obtained and evaluated for their association with Nugent-BV status. Results: A positive diagnosis for Nugent-BV was made in 69 (24.4%) participants, 55 (19.4%) were intermediate and 159 (65.2%) were negative for Nugent-BV. Infertility (p = .02) and recent unprotected sexual exposure (p = .02) were strongly associated with Nugent-BV. On the other hand, women who reported regular use of condoms during intercourse were more likely to test negative (p = .03). None of the patient complaints, however, had any significant correlation with Nugent-BV diagnosis. Conclusion: Women in their reproductive years share the highest burden of adversities associated with bacterial vaginosis. History of infertility, recent unprotected sexual exposure and frequent use of condoms were correlates having significant associations with Nugent-BV.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate subtyping of NSCLC into lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is the cornerstone of NSCLC diagnosis. Cytology samples reveal higher rates of classification failures, that is, subtyping as non-small cell carcinoma-not otherwise specified (NSCC-NOS), as compared with histology specimens. This study aims to identify specific algorithms on the basis of known cytomorphologic features that aid accurate and successful subtyping of NSCLC on cytology.
   Methods: A total of 13 expert cytopathologists participated anonymously in an online survey to subtype 119 NSCLC cytology cases (gold standard diagnoses being LUAD in 80 and LUSC in 39) enriched for nonkeratinizing LUSC. They selected from 23 predefined cytomorphologic features that they used in subtyping. Data were analyzed using machine learning algorithms on the basis of random forest method and regression trees.
   Results: From 1474 responses recorded, concordant cytology typing was achieved in 53.7% (792 of 1474) responses. NSCC-NOS rates on cytology were similar among gold standard LUAD (36%) and LUSC (38%) cases. Misclassification rates were higher in gold standard LUSC (17.6%) than gold standard LUAD (5.5%; p < 0.0001). Keratinization, when present, recognized LUSC with high accuracy. In its absence, the machine learning algorithms developed on the basis of experts' choices were unable to reduce cytology NSCC-NOS rates without increasing misclassification rates.
   Conclusions: Suboptimal recognition of LUSC in the absence of keratinization remains the major hurdle in improving cytology subtyping accuracy with such cases either failing classification (NSCC-NOS) or misclassifying as LUAD. NSCC-NOS seems to be an inevitable morphologic diagnosis emphasizing that ancillary immunochemistry is necessary to achieve accurate subtyping on cytology.

AB  - Background The growing burden of hypertension and diabetes is one of the major public health challenges being faced by the health system in India. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) that assist with tailoring evidence-based management approaches combined with task-shifting from more specialized to less specialized providers may together enhance the impact of a program. We sought to integrate a technology "CDSS" and a strategy "Task-shifting" within the Government of India's (GoI) Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) System under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) initiative to enhance the program's impact to address the growing burden of hypertension and diabetes in India. Methods We developed a model of care "I-TREC" entirely calibrated for implementation within the current health system across all facility types (Primary Health Centre, Community Health Centre, and District Hospital) in a block in Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar district of Punjab, India. We undertook an academic-community partnership to incorporate the combination of a CDSS with task-shifting into the GoI CPHC-NCD system, a platform that assists healthcare providers to record patient information for routine NCD care. Academic partners developed clinical algorithms, a revised clinic workflow, and provider training modules with iterative collaboration and consultation with government and technology partners to incorporate CDSS within the existing system. Discussion The CDSS-enabled GoI CPHC-NCD system provides evidence-based recommendations for hypertension and diabetes; threshold-based prompts to assure referral mechanism across health facilities; integrated patient database, and care coordination through workflow management and dashboard alerts. To enable efficient implementation, modifications were made in the patient workflow and the fulcrum of the use of technology shifted from physician to nurse. Conclusion Designed to be applicable nationwide, the I-TREC model of care is being piloted in a block in the state of Punjab, India. Learnings from I-TREC will provide a roadmap to other public health experts to integrate and adapt their interventions at the national level.

AB  - Smokeless tobacco product (STP) consumption is a significant public health threat across the globe. STPs are not only a storehouse of carcinogens and toxicants but also harbor microbes that aid in the conversion of tobacco alkaloids to carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), thereby posing a further threat to the health of its consumers. The present study analyzed the bacterial diversity of popular dry and loose STPs by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This NGS-based investigation revealed four dominant phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria and identified 549 genera, Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Lactobacillus constituting the core bacteriome of these STPs. The most significantly diverse bacteriome profile was displayed by the loose STP Mainpuri kapoori. The study further predicted the functional attributes of the prevalent genera by Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) algorithm. Genes encoding for nitrate and nitrite reduction and transport enzymes, antibiotic resistance, multi-drug transporters and efflux pumps, secretion of endo- and exotoxin, and other pro-inflammatory molecules were identified. The loose STPs showed the highest level of nitrogen metabolism genes which can contribute to the synthesis of TSNAs. This study reveals the bacteriome of Indian domestic loose STPs that stagger behind in manufacturing and storage stringencies. Our results raise an alarm that the consumption of STPs harboring pathogenic genera can potentially lead to the onset of several oral and systemic diseases. Nevertheless, an in-depth correlation analysis of the microbial diversity of STPs and their elicit impact on consumer health is warranted.

AB  - Patients with early breast cancer are affected by metastasis to axillary lymph nodes. Metastasis to these nodes is crucial for staging and quality of surgery. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy that is currently used to assess lymph node metastasis is not effective. This necessitates identification of biomarkers that can flag metastasis. Early stage breast cancer patients were recruited. Surgical resection of breast was followed by identification of sentinel lymph nodes. Fresh frozen section biopsy was used to assign metastatic and non-metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. Discovery phase included iTRAQ proteomics coupled with mass spectrometric analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD027668. Validation was done by bioinformatic analysis and ELISA. There were 2398 unique protein groups and 109 differentially expressed proteins comparing metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes. Forty nine proteins were up-regulated, and sixty proteins that were down regulated in metastatic group. Bioinformatic analysis showed ECM-receptor interaction pathways to be implicated in lymph node metastasis. ELISA confirmed up-regulation of ECM proteins in metastatic lymph nodes. ECM proteins have requisite parameters to be developed as a diagnostic tool to assess status of sentinel lymph nodes to guide surgical intervention in early breast cancer.

AB  - Bacterial keratitis continues to be one of the leading causes of corneal blindness in the developed as well as the developing world, despite swift progress since the dawn of the "anti-biotic era". Although, we have expeditiously developed our understanding about the different causative organisms and associated pathology leading to keratitis, extensive gaps in knowledge continue to dampen the efforts required for early and accurate diagnosis, and management in these patients, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. The ability of the causative bacteria to subdue the therapeutic challenge stems from their large genome encoding complex regulatory networks, variety of unique virulence factors, and rapid secretion of tissue damaging proteases and toxins. In this review article, we provide an overview of the established diagnostic techniques and therapeutics for keratitis caused by various bacteria. We extensively report the recent in-roads through novel tools for accurately diagnosing mono-and poly-bacterial corneal infections. Furthermore, we outline the recent progress by our groups and others in understanding the sub-cellular genomic changes that lead to antibiotic resistance in these organisms. Finally, we discuss in detail, the novel therapies and drug delivery systems in development for the efficacious management of bacterial keratitis.

AB  - Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common type of head and neck cancer worldwide. Smokeless tobacco (SLT) has been well proven for its role in oral carcinogenesis due to the abundance of several carcinogens. However, the role of inhabitant microorganisms in the oral cavity of smokeless tobacco users has not yet been well explored in the context of OSCC. Therefore, the present investigation was conceived to analyze the oral bacteriome of smokeless tobacco users having OSCC (CP group). With the assistance of illumina-based sequencing of bacterial-specific V3 hypervariable region of 16S rDNA gene, 71,969 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were categorized into 18 phyla and 166 genera. The overall analysis revealed that the oral bacteriome of the patients with OSCC, who were smokeless tobacco users, was significantly different compared to the healthy smokeless tobacco users (HTC group) and non-users (HI users). The appearance of 14 significantly abundant genera [FDR (false discovery rate) adjusted probability value of significance (p value) < 0.05] among the CP group showed the prevalence of tobacco-specific nitrosamines forming bacteria (Staphylococcus, Fusobacterium, and Campylobacter). The functional attributes of the oral bacteriome of the CP group can also be correlated with the genes involved in oncogenesis. This study is the first report on the oral bacteriome of Indian patients with OSCC who were chronic tobacco chewers. The results of the present study will pave the way to understand the influence of smokeless tobacco on the oral bacteriome of OSCC patients.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health crisis and the number one cause of death for an infectious disease. The health consequences in high-burden countries are significant. Barriers to TB control and eradication are in part caused by difficulties in diagnosis. Improvements in diagnosis are required for organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) to meet their ambitious target of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% by the year 2025, which has become hard to reach due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of new tests for TB are key priorities of the WHO, as defined in their 2014 report for target product profiles (TPPs). Rapid triage and biomarker-based confirmatory tests would greatly enhance the diagnostic capability for identifying and diagnosing TB-infected individuals. Protein-based test methods e.g. lateral flow devices (LFDs) have a significant advantage over other technologies with regard to assay turnaround time (minutes as opposed to hours) field-ability, ease of use by relatively untrained staff and without the need for supporting laboratory infrastructure. Here we evaluate the diagnostic performance of nine biomarkers from our previously published biomarker qPCR validation study; CALCOCO2, CD274, CD52, GBP1, IFIT3, IFITM3, SAMD9L, SNX10 and TMEM49, as protein targets assayed by ELISA. This preliminary evaluation study was conducted to quantify the level of biomarker protein expression across latent, extra-pulmonary or pulmonary TB groups and negative controls, collected across the UK and India, in whole lysed blood samples (WLB). We also investigated associative correlations between the biomarkers and assessed their suitability for ongoing diagnostic test development, using receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (ROC) analyses, singly and in panel combinations. The top performing single biomarkers for pulmonary TB versus controls were CALCOCO2, SAMD9L, GBP1, IFITM3, IFIT3 and SNX10. TMEM49 was also significantly differentially expressed but downregulated in TB groups. CD52 expression was not highly differentially expressed across most of the groups but may provide additional patient stratification information and some limited use for incipient latent TB infection. These show therefore great potential for diagnostic test development either in minimal configuration panels for rapid triage or more complex formulations to capture the diversity of disease presentations.

AB  - Pneumonia, an acute respiratory tract infection, is one of the major causes of mortality worldwide. Depending on the site of acquisition, pneumonia can be community acquired pneumonia (CAP) or nosocomial pneumonia (NP). The risk of pneumonia, is partially driven by host genetics. CYP1A1 is a widely studied pulmonary CYP family gene primarily expressed in peripheral airway epithelium. The CYP1A1 genetic variants, included in this study, alter the gene activity and are known to contribute in lung inflammation, which may cause pneumonia pathogenesis. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to establish the possible contribution of CYP1A1 gene, and its three variants (rs2606345, rs1048943 and rs4646903) towards the genetic etiology of pneumonia risk. Using PRISMA guidelines, we systematically reviewed and meta-analysed case-control studies, evaluating risk of pneumonia in patients carrying the risk alleles of CYP1A1 variants. Heterogeneity across the studies was evaluated using I2 statistics. Based on heterogeneity, a random-effect (using maximum likelihood) or fixed-effect (using inverse variance) model was applied to estimate the effect size. Pooled odds ratio (OR) was calculated to estimate the overall effect of the risk allele association with pneumonia susceptibility. Egger's regression test and funnel plot were used to assess publication bias. Subgroup analysis was performed based on pneumonia type (CAP and NP), population, as well as age group. A total of ten articles were identified as eligible studies, which included 3049 cases and 2249 healthy controls. The meta-analysis findings revealed CYP1A1 variants, rs2606345 [T vs G; OR = 1.12 (0.75-1.50); p = 0.02; I2 = 84.89%], and rs1048943 [G vs T; OR = 1.19 (0.76-1.61); p = 0.02; I2 = 0.00%] as risk markers whereas rs4646903 showed no statistical significance for susceptibility to pneumonia. On subgroup analysis, both the genetic variants showed significant association with CAP but not with NP. We additionally performed a spatial analysis to identify the key factors possibly explaining the variability across countries in the prevalence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We observed a significant association between the risk allele of rs2606345 and rs1048943, with a higher COVID-19 prevalence worldwide, providing us important links in understanding the variability in COVID-19 prevalence.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates are becoming more common over the world, posing a severe public health danger, particularly in developing nations like India. Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial (CR-GNB) infection has become a fast-expanding global threat with limited antibiotic choice and significant mortality. This study aimed to highlight the carbapenem-resistance among clinical isolates of hospital admitted patients in Bihar, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 101 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All GNB isolates were tested for their antimicrobial susceptibility using Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method. Double disc synergy test / modified Hodge test (DDST/MHT) were used to detect carbapenemase production by these isolates. Subsequently, these isolates were evaluated for carbapenem-resistance genes using whole-genome sequencing method. The overall percentage of carbapenem-resistance among GNB was (17/101) 16.8%. The genomic analysis of antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) demonstrates a significantly high prevalence of bla(CTX-M) followed by bla(SHV), bla(TEM), bla(OXA,) and bla(NDM) beta-lactam or carbapenem resistance genes among clinical isolates of GNB. Co-occurrence of bla(NDM) with other beta-lactamase-encoding genes was found in 70.6% of carbapenemase-producing isolates. Our study highlights the mechanism of carbapenem-resistance to curb the overwhelming threat posed by the emergence of drug-resistance in India.

AB  - Purpose Patients with hypoparathyroidism are at risk of vertebral fractures (VFs) despite high bone mineral density (BMD). We investigated this paradox by assessing trabecular bone score (TBS) and hip structural analysis (HSA) in non-surgical chronic hypoparathyroidism (cHypoPT) with and without VFs. Methods 152 cHypoPT patients (age 40.2 +/- 13.4 years, M: F = 81:71) with a median follow-up of 8 (2-13) years were assessed for BMD, VFs, TBS, and HSA and compared with 152 healthy controls. VFs at T-7-L-4 were assessed by Genant's method. Average serum total calcium and phosphorus during follow-up were assessed. Results The lumbar spine and hip BMD were higher by 25.4 and 13.4% in cHypoPT than controls (P < 0.001). Paradoxically, VFs (30.9 vs.7.9%), including multiple (12.5 vs. 2.6%) were higher in cHypoPT (P < 0.001). Though overall average TBS (1.411 +/- 0.091) was normal in cHypoPT, 25.4% of the females had subnormal TBS, more in post than pre-menopausal women (52.3 vs. 14%, P = 0.002) and as compared to males (6.1%, P = 0.001). TBS correlated with menopausal status and follow-up serum calcium-phosphorus product. For every gm/cm(2) rise in BMD, TBS increase was only 0.227 in cHypoPT compared to 0.513 in controls. Frequency of VFs increased with declining TBS (P = 0.004). HSA was comparable between cHypoPT with and without VFs. 23.4% of cHypoPT with VFs had subnormal TBS. Conclusion 31% of cHypoPT patients had VFs. TBS indicated degraded bone microarchitecture in 50% of the post-menopausal cHypoPT women. However, TBS has limitations to detect abnormal bone microarchitecture in cHypoPT as only one-fourth of patients with VFs showed low TBS.

AB  - Introduction: Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a common cutaneous side effect of capecitabine therapy. Apart from oral cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor (celecoxib), there are no proven strategies for the prevention of HFS. However, celecoxib is associated with significant cardiotoxicity. To date, no study has evaluated the role of topical COX inhibitor, diclofenac. In this study, we aim to compare topical 1% diclofenac gel with placebo in the prevention of capecitabine-induced HFS.
   Methods: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group superiority trial: the Diclofenac Topical in Reducing Capecitabine induced HFS (D-TORCH) study. A total of 264 patients with breast and gastrointestinal malignancies will be randomly allocated (stratified by sex and type of therapy [monotherapy or combination regimen with capecitabine]) to receive either 1% topical diclofenac or placebo that will be applied over the palmar and dorsal surface of the hands twice daily whilst taking capecitabine for 12 weeks. The patients will be followed up until the end of four cycles. The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of topical diclofenac with placebo in preventing HFS (incidence of NCI CTCAEv5.0 grade 2 or higher HFS). The secondary objective is to compare the effect of topical diclofenac with placebo on preventing all grades of HFS (incidence of NCI CTCv5.0 all grade HFS), time to develop HFS (from the start of capecitabine), patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (HF-HRQoL questionnaire), adherence with the application (self-reported), capecitabine dose changes (number of patients with dose modifications due to HFS) and safety profile (NCICTCv5.0 all grade HFS)
   Discussion: The D-TORCH study aims to determine if 1% topical diclofenac reduces the incidence of grade 2 or higher HFS in patients receiving capecitabine. To date, there have been a lot of trials for hand-foot syndrome prevention using agents like pyridoxine, vitamin E, carvedilol, and various polyherbal formulations, but none has been found successful. If the trial meets the primary end point, 1% topical diclofenac will be the new standard of care for HFS prevention.

AB  - Background: The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and prophylactic efficacy of add-on Comprehensive Ayurveda and mindfulness-based Yoga (CAY) regimen to standard care among HealthCare Workers (HCWs) against COVID-19.Materials and methods: This prospective single-blind (outcome assessor-blinded) RCT was conducted in tertiary care hospital in Delhi during July 2020-April 2021. HCWs of both sexes were randomized to add-on CAY intervention or control group. The primary outcomes were the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 positive cases and influenza-like illness events (ILI). Secondary outcomes were anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), and quality of life (SF-36) at the end of 12 weeks.Results: Three hundred fifty-six participants (181 in intervention and 175 in the control group) were randomized. With the modified intention to treat approach, we analyzed 309 participants. The mean age for the intervention and control group was 39.3 +/- 10.1 and 36.6 +/- 10 years, respectively. Incidence of COVID-19 event was higher in control group compared to CAY group (16 of 164 [9.8%] vs. 11 of 145 [7.6%]; P = 0.50). The incidence of ILI events was also higher in the control group as compared to the CAY group (14 of 164 [8.5%] vs 9 of 145 [6.2%]). The health change domain of the SF-36 questionnaire showed statistically significant improvement in the CAY group as compared to the control group (P < 0.01).Conclusion: Incidence of COVID-19 and ILI events was lower in the CAY group compared with the contr ol group, though the difference is not statistically significant.

AB  - Background There is little information on comprehensive diabetes care comprising glycaemic, lipid, and blood pressure control in India; therefore, we aimed to assess the achievement of treatment targets among adults with self-reported diabetes.
   Methods The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-India Diabetes (INDIAB) study is a cross-sectional, population-based survey of adults aged 20 years or older in all 30 states and union territories of India. We used a stratified multistage sampling design, sampling states in a phased manner, and selected villages in rural areas and census enumeration blocks in urban areas. We used a three-level stratification method on the basis of geography, population size, and socioeconomic status for each state. For the outcome assessment, good glycaemic control was defined as HbA(1c) of less than 7.0% (A), blood pressure control was defined as less than 140/90 mm Hg (B), and the LDL cholesterol target was defined as less than 100 mg/dL (C). ABC control was defined as the proportion of individuals meeting glycaemic, blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol targets together. We also performed multiple logistic regression to assess the factors influencing achievement of diabetes treatment targets.
   Findings Between Oct 18, 2008, and Dec 17, 2020, 113 043 individuals (33537 from urban areas and 79 506 from niral areas) participated in the ICMR-INDIAB study. For this analysis, 5789 adults (2633 in urban areas and 3156 in rural areas) with self-reported diabetes were included in the study population. The median age was 56.1 years (IQR 55.7-56.5). Overall, 1748 (weighted proportion 36.3%, 95% CI 34.7-37.9) of 4834 people with diabetes achieved good glycaemic control, 2819 (weighted proportion 48.8%, 47.2-50.3) of 5698 achieved blood pressure control, and 2043 (weighted proportion 41.5%, 39.9-43.1) of 4886 achieved good LDL cholesterol control. Only 419 (weighted proportion 7.7%) of 5297 individuals with self-reported diabetes achieved all three ABC targets, with significant heterogeneity between regions and states. Higher education, male sex, rural residence, and shorter duration of diabetes (<10 years) were associated with better achievement of combined ABC targets. Only 951 (weighted proportion 16.7%) of the study population and 227 (weighted proportion 36.9%) of those on insulin reported using self-monitoring of blood glucose.
   Interpretation Achievement of treatment targets and adoption of healthy behaviours remains suboptimal in India. Our results can help governments to adopt policies that prioritise improvement of diabetes care delivery and surveillance in India. Copyright (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemokines belong to a family of chemoattractant cytokines and are well known to have an essential role in various cancer aetiologies. Multiple subsets of immune cells are recruited and enrolled into the tumor microenvironment through interactions between chemokines and their specific receptors. These populations and their interactions have a distinct impact on tumor growth, progression, and treatment outcomes. While it is clear that many chemokines and their cognate receptors can be detected in breast and other cancers, the role of each chemokine and receptor has yet to be determined. This review focuses on the main chemokines that play a crucial role in the tumor microenvironment, emphasizing breast cancer. We have also discussed the techniques used to identify the chemokines and their future implication in the early diagnosis of cancer. In-depth knowledge of chemokines and their role in breast cancer progression can provide specific targets for breast cancer biotherapy.

AB  - Gluten ataxia is a rare immune-mediated neurological disorder caused by the ingestion of gluten. The diagnosis is not straightforward as antibodies are present in only up to 38% of patients, but often at lower titers. The symptoms of ataxia may be mild at the onset but lead to permanent damage if remain untreated. It is characterized by damage to the cerebellum however, the pathophysiology of the disease is not clearly understood. The present study investigated the neurochemical profile of vermis and right cerebellum and structural changes in various brain regions of patients with gluten ataxia (n = 6, age range 40-65 years) and compared it with healthy controls (n = 10, 40-55 years). Volumetric 3-D T1 and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the three planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) of the whole brain and single-voxel H-1- magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the vermis and right cerebellum were acquired on 3 T human MR scanner. The metabolite concentrations were estimated using LC Model (6.1-4A) while brain volumes were estimated using the online tool volBrain pipeline and CERES and corrected for partial volumes. The levels of neuro-metabolites (N-acetyl aspartate + N-acetyl aspartate glutamate, glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine, and total creatine) were found to be significantly lower in vermis, while N-acetyl aspartate + N-acetyl aspartate glutamate and glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine was lower in cerebellum regions in the patients with gluten ataxia compared to healthy controls. A significant reduction in the white matter of (total brain, cerebellum, and cerebrum); reduction in the volumes of cerebellum lobe (X) and thalamus while lateral ventricles were increased in the patients with gluten ataxia compared to healthy controls. The reduced neuronal metabolites along with structural changes in the brain suggested neuronal degeneration in the patients with gluten ataxia. Our preliminary findings may be useful in understanding the gluten-induced cerebral damage and indicated that MRI and MRS may serve as a non-invasive useful tool in the early diagnosis, thereby enabling better management of these patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND The extent to which health care systems have adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide necessary cardiac diagnostic services is unknown.
   OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on cardiac testing practices, volumes and types of diagnostic services, and perceived psychological stress to health care providers worldwide.
   METHODS The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations from baseline in cardiovascular diagnostic care at the pandemic's onset and 1 year later. Multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with procedure volume recovery.
   RESULTS Surveys were submitted from 669 centers in 107 countries. Worldwide reduction in cardiac procedure volumes of 64% from March 2019 to April 2020 recovered by April 2021 in high- and upper middle-income countries (recovery rates of 108% and 99%) but remained depressed in lower middle- and low-income countries (46% and 30% recovery). Although stress testing was used 12% less frequently in 2021 than in 2019, coronary computed tomographic angiography was used 14% more, a trend also seen for other advanced cardiac imaging modalities (positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance; 22%-25% increases). Pandemic-related psychological stress was estimated to have affected nearly 40% of staff, impacting patient care at 78% of sites. In multivariable regression, only lower-income status and physicians' psychological stress were significant in predicting recovery of cardiac testing.
   CONCLUSIONS Cardiac diagnostic testing has yet to recover to prepandemic levels in lower-income countries. Worldwide, the decrease in standard stress testing is offset by greater use of advanced cardiac imaging modalities. Pandemic-related psychological stress among providers is widespread and associated with poor recovery of cardiac testing. (C) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Background: In bipolar disorder (BD), depression is the most difficult-to-treat dimension and available evidence suggests that add-on supraphysiological doses of levothyroxine may be an effective augmenting agent. Aim: This systematic review has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of supraphysiologic doses of levothyroxine in bipolar depression in adults. Methods: After a comprehensive literature search on MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane databases and International Clinical Trial Registry Platform (ICTRP), reviewers extracted data from eight relevant articles. PRISMA guidelines were followed in the selection, analysis and reporting of findings. Quality assessment was done using the risk of bias assessment and a random effects model was used to estimate effect size. Meta-analysis could not be done due to the lack of randomized, placebo-controlled trials and adequate data. A systematic review was done on eight studies and analysis on the pre-post change in Hamilton depression rating scale score (HDRS) was done for six studies. Results: The random model analysis of pooled effects showed a standardized mean difference of HDRS score by 2.62 (95% CI: 2.21-3.04; p < 0.0001). The responder and remission rates were not significant as reported in one study. Markov chain analysis performed in one study revealed that patients in the levothyroxine group had a significantly greater increase in time in the euthymic state and a decrease in the mixed state. In most of the studies, levothyroxine therapy was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Conclusion: Add-on supraphysiological dose of levothyroxine has a potential role in attenuating depressive symptoms in bipolar depression, especially in therapy-resistant BD.

AB  - ABSTR A C T Objective: Individuals seeking treatment for physical symptoms having unknown etiology are common in the primary healthcare setup. Factors such as biomedical, environmental, social, and psychological ones are expected to play an important role in the treatment of Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS). Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy of psychological interventions for the treatment of MUPS. Method: Studies were selected using different electronic databases (PubMed, Wiley, Cochrane), to identify RCTs published in the last 11 years on psychological interventions to treat MUPS. A total of 12 studies were finalized for systematic review and 7 for meta-analysis based on the inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed by the two reviewers independently using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. OpenMeta[Analyst] was used to perform meta-analysis. Results: The findings revealed that psychological interventions can possibly be effective in treating patients with MUPS. Somatic symptom severity and depression improved in the intervention groups as compared to controls, while anxiety, and physical and mental component summary of Short-Form General Health Survey 36 did not significantly improve in the intervention group.Conclusion: A tailored module including psychological interventions to deal with these patients in primary care may be useful in improving the overall functioning of the individuals.

AB  - Purpose Heteropagus twinning (HT) is a rare anomaly. Six new cases along with a systematic review are described. Methods Six cases of HT managed at two tertiary care teaching hospitals over the last 26 years are described. A PubMed search with words: Heteropagus AND/ OR parasitic twins from 2001 to 2021 hit 183 articles. 36 were added from non-PubMed sources. Finally, 120 cases including 114 from 69 articles and 6 new cases were analysed. Results Of the new cases, 2/6 had an antenatal diagnosis. Five were males. 4 autosites had omphaloceles. Split notochord and 2 parasites attached to a single autosite were encountered. 5/6 autosites survived. On systematic review, the most frequent variant seen was rachipagus (n = 50) followed by omphalopagus (n = 46). Limbs were reported in 75 cases. Congenital heart disease was seen in 17/120(14.2%) autosites. Omphalocele and meningomyelocele were the most common extracardiac anomalies in autosites. Weight along with the anatomy and position of heteropagus twins was a better determinant of the mode of delivery than weight alone. Mortality was reported in 12 cases. Conclusion Autosites in HT generally carry a good prognosis, however, final outcome depends mainly on associated major cardiac anomalies. Meticulous antenatal assessment and preoperative planning are of paramount importance.

AB  - Background: There is no agreed protocol on usage of proper and best suturing material in minimally invasive pyeloplasty. The aim of this meta-analysis was to summarize and analyze current evidence on suturing materials for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.Materials and Methods: This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE) were systematically searched for relevant comparative studies on barbed suture (BS) and non-barbed suture (NBS) in minimally invasive pyeloplasty.Results: Five comparative studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Pooling the data demonstrated a significantly shorter operative duration in patients belonging to the BS group versus the NBS group (95% confidence interval [CI] -81.63 to -10.41, P = .01), with statistically significant estimated heterogeneity among the included studies (P < .0001). Although the incidence of redo-pyeloplasty was higher in the BS group, the pooled risk ratio (RR) for the need for redo-pyeloplasty in subjects belonging to the BS group versus the NBS group was 6.00 (95% CI 0.78-46.14), demonstrating no statistically significant difference (P = .09). A total of 5 patients developed postoperative complications. The pooled RR for the occurrence of these complication showed no significant difference among the patients belonging to both the groups (95% CI 0.22-6.05, P = .88).Conclusions: Minimally invasive pyeloplasty using BS is associated with significantly shorter operative time. The incidence of postoperative complications and requirement of redo-pyeloplasty showed no significant difference among both the treatment groups. Further randomized controlled trials need to be conducted before any definite conclusions are drawn.

AB  - Purpose Respiratory disorders pose a major threat to the morbidity and mortality to public health. Here we reviewed the nanotechnology based pulmonary drug delivery using metered dose inhalers. Methods Major respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), asthma, acute lower respiratory tract infections, tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer. At present, common treatments for respiratory disorders include surgery, radiation, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy or a combination. The major challenge is development of systemic delivery of the chemotherapeutic agents to the respiratory system. Conventional delivery of chemotherapy has various limitation and adverse side effected. Hence, targeted, and systemic delivery need to be developed. Towards this direction nanotechnology, based controlled, targeted, and systemic drug delivery systems are potential candidate to enhance therapeutic efficacy with minimum side effect. Among different route of administration, pulmonary delivery has unique benefits such as circumvents first pass hepatic metabolism and reduces dose and side effects. Results Respiratory disorders pose a major threat to the morbidity and mortality to public health globally. Pulmonary delivery can be achieved through various drug delivery devices such as nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, and metered dose inhalers. Among them, metered dose inhalers are the most interesting and first choice of clinician over others. This review focused on nanotechnology based pulmonary drug delivery using metered dose inhalers. This report focused on delivery of various types of therapeutics using nanocarriers such as polymeric nanoparticles and micelles, dendrimers, lipid nanocarriers such as liposomes, solid lipid nanostructures and nanostructured lipid carriers, and other using metered dose inhalers discussed comprehensively. This report provides insight about the effect of parameters of MDI such as co-solvent, propellants, actuators shape, nozzle diameters, and jet lengths, and respiratory flow rate, and particle size of co-suspension of drug on aerodynamics and lung deposition of formulation. This review also provided the insight about various metered dose inhalers market scenario and digital metered dose inhalers. Conclusion This report concluded the clinical potential of metered dose inhalers, summary of current progress and future perspectives towards the smart digital metered dose inhalers development.

AB  - Purpose: This study was planned to determine the trends and susceptibility pattern of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) in severely ill chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients admitted in pulmonary ward and ICU of our tertiary care centre. Methods: Fifty COPD patients suspected of IPA from pulmonary ward and ICU from April 2017 to September 2018 were investigated. Samples were processed by standard methods, culture positive isolates were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed by microbroth dilution method. Results: Twenty-two critically ill COPD patients were microbiologically positive for IA infection, of which 13 were classified as putative invasive aspergillosis. The most common comorbid illness associated was diabetes. A. flavus and A. fumigatus were the commonest species isolated. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the antifungals was low. Morbidity due to IPA in COPD patients was very high. Conclusions: Prevalence of IPA in the pulmonary ward and ICU was found to be 9.6%. MALDI-TOF seems to be a promising tool for aiding rapid identification especially for slow growing and non-sporulating fungi. Heightened awareness and suspicion for pulmonary mould infections along with early diagnosis can substantially alter the patient prognosis.

AB  - New designs of mechanical ventilators require extensive testing before utilizing the ventilator on a patient. Test lungs are commonly used to understand the behavior of new designs of ventilators and the lung mechanics. The current study aims to develop a numerical model of dual test lungs utilizing the partitioned fluid-structure interaction (FSI) approach and test it against the available experimental data of volume-controlled ventilation. Two breathing rates of 12 and 18 bpm were studied at two different tidal volumes of 500 and 600 ml for spontaneous breathing. It is found that with an increase in the compliance (tidal volume/pressure rise) of the lung, the peak pressure rise inside the test lung decreases irrespective of the breathing rate. The maximum average pressure of 44.73, 27.45, and 14 cm H2O is observed for static lung compliances of 10, 21 , and 39 ml/cm H2O, respectively at a tidal volume of 600 ml. Similarly, the maximum von-misses stress was higher (498 kPa) for the lung with lower compliance (10 ml/cm H2O) as compared to the lung with higher compliance (39 ml/cm H2O) at the end of inspiration. This study forms a basis for using computational methods to model simple lung simulators that can effectively investigate the lung mechanics for both spontaneous and ventilated breathing. Thus, it can be utilized as a reference to test novel designs of mechanical ventilators.

AB  - Purpose: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are one of the most common, causing substantial morbidity, mortality and are highly cost-effective means of reducing healthcare associated infections rates in health care set-ups. In India, there is no existing system for systematic surveillance of SSIs, encompassing post-discharge period. Methods: An indigenous SSI e-surveillance software was developed. Patients developing SSI as per standard definitions were included in the study. A denominator form and a case report form were filled for each case of SSI detected. The microbiological diagnosis was done as per standard methods. Logistic regression analysis was used to test for association of SSI and risk factors and determining the prevalence odds ratios. Results: Of the total of 850 patients enrolled in the SSI surveillance, 47 (5.5%) developed SSI. Most patients (490/ 850, 58%) underwent the open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) and also developed an SSI (33/490, 6.7%). Clean contaminated wound class and Dressing were found to be associated with increased risk of SSI significantly, Also increase in the length of stay was found to be associated with increased risk of SSI significantly. High antimicrobial resistance was observed in the microbial isolates recovered from SSIs. Patients who developed SSI had longer hospital stays. Conclusions: Our study has been the first systematic surveillance effort in India, where patients were followed up till six months post surgeries. This pilot study was later expanded to other Indian hospitals. This network of SSISurveillance will lay the foundation for initiation of SSI-surveillance across the country.

AB  - Background To analyse the varied clinical profile and treatment outcomes of posterior zone 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Methods This retrospective case-series included 54 eyes of 27 infants of posterior zone 1 ROP treated at our centre from January 2018 to June 2019. Three clinical patterns were observed at presentation - Posterior zone 1 ROP without detachment (group 1), with subtotal detachment (group 2) and total detachment (group 3) of the vascularised retina. Their profile, treatment options and outcomes were studied. Results The mean birth weight was 1204 +/- 262 gm and mean gestational age was 28.8 +/- 2 weeks. Clinical presentation as per group 1, 2 and 3 was seen in 33/54 (61.1%), 9/54 (16.6%) and 12/54 (22.2%) eyes, respectively. All the eyes received intravitreal ranibizumab as primary intervention. In group 1, 25/33 (75.7%) eyes had laser and 8/33 (24.2%) had surgery whereas, in group 2, 2/9 (22.2%) eyes had laser and 7/9 (77.7%) underwent surgery as a second intervention. In group 3, only 3 /12 (25%) eyes had second intervention (surgery). Surgical outcomes of group 1 and 2 were better than group 3. At last follow-up, macular vascularisation was noted in 33/54 (61.1%) eyes. Conclusion A customised and multifaceted treatment approach is required to treat posterior zone 1 ROP.

AB  - Purpose: Anaerobic infections are common yet life-threatening. They are being recovered from all sites of the body, including the cardiovascular system. This study was aimed to determine the retrospective analysis on the isolation of anaerobes in cardiovascular samples received for a decade-long duration. It helps in knowing the frequency of isolation of anaerobic causes of cardiovascular infection. Methods: All cardiovascular samples from the department of Cardio-thoracic vascular surgery from January 2010 to December 2020 were studied. Results: Of 601 samples received, predominant samples were vegetations and valvular tissues of 258, followed by 98 samples of pericardial tissues, 92 samples of embolus, 90 samples of blood and post-operative collections, and 63 excised aneurysms and vascular grafts. Of the total, 15 samples grew anaerobes where Clostridium species were the predominant isolates. Clostridioides difficile was isolated in 2 samples. Conclusions: Anaerobes in cardiovascular samples are uncommon yet form a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Most infections are from the contiguous spread, penetrating trauma, and hematogenous causing endocarditis or valvular infections. These conditions and samples form the seat of infectious focus and clinical suspicion towards the anaerobic cause of these conditions, especially in conventional routine culture-negative samples. Timely diagnosis of anaerobic infections plays a vital role in the good prognostic outcome of patients undergoing cardiothoracic and vascular surgery.

AB  - Background In this study, we evaluate the cost and outcomes of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) plus fulvestrant, fulvestrant alone, and conventional chemotherapy as the second-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in India. Methods Using a Markov model, the clinical effectiveness of managing HR+, HER2- MBC in postmenopausal women with either a CDK4/6i (either ribociclib or palbociclib) and fulvestrant, fulvestrant alone, and chemotherapy (single-agent paclitaxel or capecitabine) was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The costs were estimated from two different points of view: scenario I, as per the prevailing market prices of the drugs; and scenario II, as per the reimbursement rates set up by the publicly financed national health insurance scheme. Incremental cost per QALY gained with a given treatment option was compared against the next best alternative and was assessed for cost effectiveness using a threshold of 1-time the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in India from a societal perspective. Results In scenario I, an MBC patient was found to incur a lifetime cost of Indian Rupees ((sic)) 2.54 million ($34,644), (sic)2.53 million ($34,496), (sic)512,598 ($6,984), (sic)326,026 ($4,442) and (sic)237,115 ($3,230) for the ribociclib and palbociclib combination arms, fulvestrant monotherapy, single-agent paclitaxel and the single-agent capecitabine treatment arms, respectively. The lifetime cost for CDK4/6i (ribociclib and palbociclib) combination therapy, fulvestrant monotherapy, paclitaxel, and capecitabine arms was estimated to be (sic)1.94 million ($26,459), (sic)1.92 million ($26,220), (sic)315,387 ($4,296), (sic)187,392 ($2,553) and (sic)153,263 ($2,088), respectively, in scenario II. The mean QALYs lived per MBC patient with CDK4/6i (either ribociclib or palbociclib) combination therapy, fulvestrant, paclitaxel and capecitabine were estimated to be 1.4, 1.0, 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. None of the treatment arms are cost effective at current prices and reimbursement rates at a threshold of 1-time the per capita GDP of India. However, a 78% reduction in the current market price or a 72% reduction in the reimbursement rate of fulvestrant in the government-funded insurance program will make it a cost-effective treatment option for HR+, HER2- MBC patients in India. Conclusion CDK4/6i (ribociclib and palbociclib) therapy is not a cost-effective treatment option for MBC patients. A 72% reduction in the reimbursement rate for fulvestrant monotherapy will make it a cost-effective treatment option in the Indian context.

AB  - The pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (SCoV-2) has impacted the world in many ways and the virus continues to evolve and produce novel variants with the ability to cause frequent global outbreaks. Although the advent of the vaccines abated the global burden, they were not effective against all the variants of SCoV-2. This trend warrants shifting the focus on the development of small molecules targeting the crucial proteins of the viral replication machinery as effective therapeutic solutions. The PLpro is a crucial enzyme having multiple roles during the viral life cycle and is a well-established drug target. In this study, we identified 12 potential inhibitors of PLpro through virtual screening of the FDA-approved drug library. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies suggested that these molecules bind to the PLpro through multiple interactions. Further, IC50 values obtained from enzyme-inhibition assays affirm the stronger affinities of the identified molecules for the PLpro. Also, we demonstrated high structural conservation in the catalytic site of PLpro between SCoV-2 and Human Coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) through molecular modelling studies. Based on these similarities in PLpro structures and the resemblance in various signalling pathways for the two viruses, we propose that HCoV-229E is a suitable surrogate for SCoV-2 in drug-discovery studies. Validating our hypothesis, Mefloquine, which was effective against HCoV-229E, was found to be effective against SCoV-2 as well in cell-based assays. Overall, the present study demonstrated Mefloquine as a potential inhibitor of SCoV-2 PLpro and its antiviral activity against SCoV-2. Corroborating our findings, based on the in vitro virus inhibition assays, a recent study reported a prophylactic role for Mefloquine against SCoV-2. Accordingly, Mefloquine may further be investigated for its potential as a drug candidate for the treatment of COVID.

AB  - Background and Aim Thiopurines are widely used to maintain remission in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Reported effectiveness and tolerability rates have been variable across studies. There are only sparse data in Asian population regarding the long-term efficacy and safety of thiopurines. Methods Records of 5351 patients followed up at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) clinic, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from 2004 to 2020 were evaluated retrospectively. Safety was evaluated in terms of long-term adverse events and development of malignancy. Results Of 5351 patients with IBD, 1093 who received thiopurine for > 3 months (UC = 788 [proctitis-1.9%, left-sided colitis-44.9%, & pancolitis-53.1%] & CD = 305 [inflammatory-42.6%, stricturing-46.9%, & fistulizing-10.5%]) were included (60.8%-male patients). Follow up and treatment duration on thiopurine were 7 (4-12) years and 39.4 +/- 40.3 months, respectively, with 254 (23.2%) patients receiving thiopurines for more than 5 and 68 (6.2%) receiving for more than 10 years. Three hundred and fifty-nine (UC: 249 [31.6%]; CD: 110 [36.1%]; P = 0.1) patients developed adverse events; commonest was myelosuppression (23.4%) followed by gastrointestinal intolerance (3%), flu-like illness (1.7%), and arthralgia/myalgia (1.4%). Myelosuppression was the commonest cause of thiopurine withdrawal. No patient (including 254 patients on thiopurine for >= 5 years) developed lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer. The cumulative probability of staying free from adverse events in overall IBD cohort at 1, 2, and 5 years was 78.6%, 71.9%, and 68.4%, respectively, and this was comparable between UC and CD (P = 0.09). Conclusion Long-term follow up of patients with IBD from northern India on thiopurine monotherapy demonstrated minimal risk of development of lymphoma as well as non-melanoma skin cancer.

AB  - Background Spinocerebellar ataxia 1 (SCA1) and SCA2 are dominantly inherited ataxias caused due to CAG expansion mutation in ATXN1 (CAG >= 39) and ATXN2 (CAG >= 32) genes located at 6p22.3 and 12q24.12 loci, respectively, with key manifestations of progressive limb and gait ataxia and with or without brain stem and pyramidal tract involvement. Both SCA1 and SCA2 are quite prevalent subtypes among the SCAs. There are very few reports that describe a combinatorial SCA subtype mutation in a single patient. Cases Here, we report a novel co-occurrence of SCA1 and SCA2 mutations in two unrelated patients. Case-1 was observed to carry ATXN1-CAG (30/40) and ATXN2-CAG (23/45), while case-2 harbored ATXN1-CAG (29/42) and ATXN2-CAG (23/41). Overall, the clinical outcome was complex with probable early onset than expected in Case-1 and in Case-2, we observed a significant delayed onset of the disease than expected. Conclusion These cases highlight the probabilistic interactive outcome of two unrelated genetic events towards a converging phenotype.

AB  - Considerable changes in particulate matter (PM) during COVID-19 lockdown in major cities around the World demand changes in exposure assessment studies of PM. The present study shows variations in respiratory deposition dose (RDD) of both fine (PM2.5) and coarse (PM10) particles before, during and after Covid-19 lockdown phases at three sites (with different pollution signatures) in Delhi-Alipur, Okhla and Pusa Road. Exposure assessment study showed mean PM2.5 RDD (+/- S.D.) (mu g/min) for walk and sit mode during before lockdown (BL) as 2.41(+/- 1.20) and 0.84(+/- 0.42) for Alipur, 2.71(+/- 1.60) and 0.94(+/- 0.56) for Okhla, and 2.54(+/- 1.28) and 0.88(+/- 0.44) for Pusa road, which decreased drastically during Lockdown 1(L1) as 0.85(+/- 0.35) and 0.30(+/- 0.12) for Alipur, 0.83(+/- 0.33) and 0.29(+/- 0.11) for Okhla, and 0.68(+/- 0.28) and 0.23(+/- 0.10) for Pusa road, respectively. Mean PM10 RDD (+/- S.D.) (mu g/min) for walk and sit mode during before lockdown (BL) as 3.90 (+/- 1.73) and 1.36 (+/- 0.60) for Alipur, 4.74 (+/- 2.04) and 1.65 (+/- 0.71) for Okhla, and 4.25 (+/- 1.69) and 1.48 (+/- 0.59) for Pusa Road, respectively which decreased drastically during Lockdown 1(L1) as 2.19 (+/- 0.95) and 0.76 (+/- 0.33) for Alipur, 1.73 (+/- 0.67) and 0.60 (+/- 0.23) for Okhla and, 1.45 (+/- 0.50) and 0.50 (+/- 0.17) for Pusa Road, respectively. Significant decrease in RDD concentrations (Both PM2.5 and PM10) than that of BL phase have been found during Lockdown 1(L1) phase and other successive lockdown and unlock phases-Lockdown 2(L2), Lockdown 3(L3), Lockdown 4(L4) and Unlock1 (UL1) phases. Changes in RDD values during lockdown phases were affected by lesser traffic emission, minimized industrial activities, biomass burning activities, precipitation activities, etc. Seasonal variations of RDD showed Delhites are found exposed to more fine and coarse particles' RDD (walk and sit modes) before and after lockdown, i.e. during normal days than during lockdown phases showing potential health effects. People in sit condition found less exposed to fine and coarse RDD comparison to those in walk condition both during normal and lockdown days.

AB  - Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) frequently cause significant distress and dysfunction, and may be unresponsive to conventional treatments. Some voice-hearers report an ability to fully control the onset and offset of their AVH, making them significantly less disruptive. Measuring and understanding these abilities may lead to novel interventions to enhance control over AVH. Fifty-two voice-hearers participated in the pilot study. 318 participants with frequent AVH participated in the validation study. A pool of 59 items was developed by a diverse team including voice-hearers and clinicians. After the pilot study, 35 items were retained. Factorial structure was assessed with exploratory (EFA, n = 148) and confirmatory (CFA, n = 170) factor analyses. Reliability and convergent validity were assessed using a comprehensive battery of validated phenomenological and clinical scales. CFA on the final 18 items supported two factors for a Methods of Control Scale (5 items each, average omega = .87), and one factor for a Degree of Control Scale (8 items, average omega = .95). Correlation with clinical measures supported convergent validity. Degree of control was associated with positive clinical outcomes in voice-hearers both with and without a psychosis-spectrum diagnosis. Degree of control also varied with quality of life independently of symptom severity and AVH content. The Yale control over perceptual experiences (COPE) Scales robustly measure voice-hearers' control over AVH and exhibit sound psychometric properties. Results demonstrate that the capacity to voluntarily control AVH is independently associated with positive clinical outcomes. Reliable measurement of control over AVH will enable future development of interventions meant to bolster that control.

AB  - The present guidelines aim to provide comprehensive information on genital condyloma acuminata, including the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management. The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of genital condyloma acuminata in adults in Asia, including patients with HIV co-infection. Methodology: A PubMed search was performed, using the keywords "condyloma acuminata", "anal wart", "anogenital wart", "genital wart" and "genital HPV". A total of 3031 results were found in publications during last six years. A careful review of the titles and abstracts was done to find all the studies pertaining to epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of condyloma acuminata. Diagnosis: Various diagnostic procedures described are: 1. PCR (LE: 2b). 2. Serology (LE: 2b). 3. In-situ hybridization (LE: 3). Prevention: 1. Vaccination (LE: 1a): Quadrivalent vaccine reduced the frequency of anogenital warts in both vaccinated and unvaccinated contacts. According to the update Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations, the following protocol is recommended: (a). HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years for both males and females. (b). Catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. (c). Shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for persons aged 27-45 years, who are at risk of new HPV infection. 2. Male circumcision (LE: 2a): conflicting evidence. HIV and condyloma acuminata: In HIV-affected individuals, the course of HPV is more aggressive, with a greater risk of treatment resistance, increased chances of intraepithelial neoplasia as well as cancers. Treatment: Physician administered. 1. Photodynamic therapy (LE: 1a). 2. Laser (LE: 2b). 3. Surgery (LE: 1a). 4. Electrosurgery (LE: 2c). 5. Cryotherapy (LE: 1b). 6. Immunotherapy (LE: 1b). 7. Podophyllin (LE: 1b). Provider administered. 1. Imiquimod 5%(LE: 1a). 2. Podophyllotoxin (LE: 1b). 3. Sinecatechins (LE: 1a). 4. Cidofovir (LE: 3). 5. 5- Fluorouracil (LE: 1a). 6. Interferon (LE: 1a).

AB  - Background: During the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several angiogenic factors are overexpressed in the hepatic microenvironment, which play a critical role in governing the phenotype of the endothelial cells. Mutation in the p53 gene (TP53) is a common event in HCC that may dysregulate the angiogenic signals. However, their functional messages remain largely unexplored at the onset of metastasis. Methods: Role of p53 was studied by siRNA mediated silencing of p53 in HepG2 cells (WTp53), collecting and analyzing their conditioned medium, followed by indirect co-culture with endothelial cells (HUVECs). Gene and protein expression in HCC cells and endothelial cells was studied by RT-qPCR and western blotting respectively. beta-catenin protein expression and localization were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Results: We have studied a cell-to-cell interaction model to investigate the crosstalk of endothelial and hepatoma cells by either knocking down p53 or by using p53 null low metastatic HCC cell line. In the absence of p53, the HCC cells influence the migration and vascular network formation of endothelial cells through paracrine signaling of VEGF. Secretory VEGF activated the VEGF receptor-2 along with the survival signaling in endothelial cells. However, the beta-catenin signal is upregulated in endothelial cells only during interaction with metastatic set up irrespective of absence and presence of p53, indicating context-dependent participation of p53 during communication between hepatoma cells and endothelial cells. Conclusion: This study highlights that the role of p53 on cellular responses during interaction of hepatocellular carcinoma and endothelial cells is distinct to cell types and context.

AB  - Mycolic acids are the key constituents of mycobacterial cell wall, which protect the bacteria from antibiotic susceptibility, helping to subvert and escape from the host immune system. Thus, the enzymes involved in regulating and biosynthesis of mycolic acids can be explored as potential drug targets to kill Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Herein, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes is used to understand the fatty acid metabolism signaling pathway and integrative computational approach to identify the novel lead molecules against the mtFabH (beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase III), the key regulatory enzyme of the mycolic acid pathway. The structure-based virtual screening of antimycobacterial compounds from ChEMBL library against mtFabH results in the selection of 10 lead molecules. Molecular binding and drug-likeness properties of lead molecules compared with mtFabH inhibitor suggest that only two compounds, ChEMBL414848 (C1) and ChEMBL363794 (C2), may be explored as potential lead molecules. However, the spatial stability and binding free energy estimation of thiolactomycin (TLM) and compounds C1 and C2 with mtFabH using molecular dynamics simulation, followed by molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) indicate the better activity of C2 (Delta G = -14.18 kcal/mol) as compared with TLM (Delta G = -9.21 kcal/mol) and C1 (Delta G = -13.50 kcal/mol). Thus, compound C1 may be explored as promising drug candidate for the structure-based drug designing of mtFabH inhibitors in the therapy of Mtb.

AB  - Background Picture-naming tests (PNTs) evaluate linguistic impairment in dementia due to semantic memory impairment, impaired lexical retrieval or perceptual deficits. They also assess the decline in naming impairment at various stages of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that occurs due to progressive cognitive impairment. With the increasing numbers of people with dementia globally, it is necessary to have validated naming tests and norms that are culturally and linguistically appropriate. Aims In this cross-sectional study we harmonized a set of 30 images applicable to the Indian context across five languages and investigated the picture-naming performance in patients with MCI and dementia. Methods & Procedures A multidisciplinary expert group formed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) collaborated towards developing and adapting a picture naming test (PNT) known as the ICMR-PNT in five Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. Based on cross-cultural adaptation guidelines and item-wise factor analysis and correlations established separately across five languages, the final version of the ICMR-PNT test was developed. A total of 368 controls, 123 dementia and 128 MCI patients were recruited for the study. Psychometric properties of the adapted version of the ICMR-PNT were examined, and sensitivity and specificity were examined. Outcomes & Results The ICMR-PNT scores in all languages combined were higher in controls compared with patients with dementia and MCI (F-2,F- 615 = 139.85; p < 0.001). Furthermore, PNT scores for MCI was higher in comparison with patients with dementia in all languages combined (p < 0.001). The area under the curve across the five languages ranged from 0.81 to 1.00 for detecting dementia. There was a negative correlation between Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and ICMR-PNT scores and a positive correlation between Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) and ICMR-PNT scores in control and patient groups. Conclusions & Implications The ICMR-PNT was developed by following cross-cultural adaptation guidelines and establishing correlations using item-wise factor analysis across five languages. This adapted PNT was found to be a reliable tool when assessing naming abilities effectively in mild to moderate dementia in a linguistically diverse context. What this paper adds What is already known on this subject Picture-naming evaluates language impairment linked to naming difficulties due to semantic memory, lexical retrieval or perceptual disturbances. As a result, picture naming tests (PNTs) play an important role in the diagnosis of dementia. In a heterogeneous population such as India, there is a need for a common PNT that can be used across the wide range of languages. What this study adds to existing knowledge PNTs such as the Boston Naming Test (BNT) were developed for the educated, mostly English-speaking, Western populations and are not appropriate for use in an Indian context. To overcome this challenge, a PNT was harmonized in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam) and we report the patterns of naming difficulty in patients with MCI and dementia. The ICMR-PNT demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy when distinguishing patients with mild to moderate dementia from cognitively normal individuals.
   What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? With the growing number of persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia around the world, its critical to have culturally and linguistically relevant naming tests and diagnosis. This validated ICMR-PNT can be used widely as a clinical tool to diagnose dementia and harmonize research efforts across diverse populations.

AB  - Epigenetic changes alter the expression of genes at both pre- and post-transcriptional levels without changing their DNA sequence. Accumulating evidence suggests that such changes can modify cellular behavior and characteristics required during development and in response to various extracellular stimuli. Trophoblast cells develop from the outermost trophectoderm layer of the blastocyst and undergo many phenotypic changes as the placenta develops. One such phenotypic change is differentiation of the epithelial natured cytotrophoblasts into the mesenchymal natured extravillous trophoblasts. The extravillous trophoblasts are primarily responsible for invading into the maternal decidua and thus establishing connection with the maternal spiral arteries. Any dysregulation of this process can have adverse effects on the pregnancy outcome. Hence, tight regulation of this epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for successful pregnancy. This review summarizes the recent research on the epigenetic regulation of the EMT occurring in the trophoblast cells during placental development. The functional significance of chemical modifications of DNA and histone, which regulate transcription, as well as non-coding RNAs, which control gene expression post-transcriptionally, is discussed in relation to trophoblast biology.

AB  - To the Editor: In the KEYNOTE-522 trial, Schmid et al.(1) reported that the addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer resulted in an increased percentage of patients with a pathological complete response (no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes). In a recent analysis of this trial (Feb. 10 issue),(2) the authors found that the addition of pembrolizumab improved event-free survival among the patients. The improvement in this outcome was predominantly restricted to patients who had not had a pathological complete response; the 3-year event-free survival was 67.4% among such patients in the pembrolizumab group . . .

AB  - Esophageal cancer (EC) is frequently considered a lethal malignancy and is often identified at a later stage. It is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths globally. The conventional treatment methods like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery offer limited efficacy and poor clinical outcome with a less than 25% 5-year survival rate. The poor prognosis of EC persists despite the growth in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to treat EC. This underlines the need to elucidate the complex molecular mechanisms that drive esophageal oncogenesis. Apart from the role of the tumor microenvironment and its structural and cellular components in tumorigenesis, mounting evidence points towards the involvement of the esophageal microbiome, inflammation, and their cross-talk in promoting esophageal cancer. The current review summarizes recent research that delineates the underlying molecular mechanisms by which the microbiota and inflammation promote the pathophysiology of esophageal cancer, thus unraveling targets for potential therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Aim: To characterize Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A) among different stages of COVID-19 infection.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study which included six healthy individuals and 68 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 in the Department of Medicine, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from July 2020 to September 2020. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 groups, and serum samples were drawn for the measurement of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A) which was done by BD (TM) Cytometric Bead Array.
   Results: All the cytokines showed dynamic expression in the COVID-19 group, of which only IL-6 was statistically significant. Among the three severity groups of COVID-19, increased severity did not transform into increased cytokine level, with the exception for IL-6, which was statistically significant.
   Conclusions: In our small sample study, six cytokines expressions were evaluated however most of them were elevated in COVID-19 patients but were not statistically significant except IL-6.

AB  - Aim The present study sought to study morphology and associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with crossed pulmonary arteries on multidetector computed tomography (CT) angiography. Materials and Methods We retrospectively evaluated all CT angiography studies performed at a tertiary medical center from January 2014 to December 2021 to identify patients with crossed pulmonary arteries. The associated cardiovascular anomalies as identified on CT angiography were evaluated. Results Out of 4773 patients who had undergone CT angiography for evaluation of congenital heart diseases, we identified 24 (0.5%) patients (18 males; mean age: 7.7 years) with crossed pulmonary arteries. Tetralogy of Fallot was associated in seven (29.17%) patients, double outlet right ventricle in one (4.17%) patient, and common arterial trunk in four (16.67%) patients. An aortopulmonary window was seen in three (12.5%) patients while atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect were seen in two (8.33%) and 16 (66.67%) patients, respectively. Aortic arch anomalies were present in 16 (66.67%) patients including interrupted aortic arch and coarctation of aorta with hypoplastic aortic arch seen in two (8.33%) patients each. A double aortic arch with an atretic left arch was seen in one (4.17%) patient. Coronary artery anomalies were seen in three (12.5%) patients. Conclusion Crossed pulmonary arteries are a rare anomaly and their presence suggests the coexistence of a variety of cardiovascular anomalies, including aortic arch anomalies and outflow tract malformations. Comprehensive CT angiography-based evaluation of cardiovascular morphology is imperative in the presence of crossed pulmonary arteries to facilitate presurgical planning.

AB  - Treatment of patients with resistant/refractory multiple myeloma (MM) is an unmet need. In this phase II study, we evaluated the role of bendamustine, pomalidomide and dexamethasone combination in this setting. Between February 2020 and December 2021, 28 patients were recruited. Patients received bendamustine 120 mg/m(2)day 1, pomalidomide 3 mg days 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg days 1, 8, 11, 22, regimen given for a maximum of six cycles. The median (range) age of the patients was 54 (30-76) years and 15 (53.6%) were males. Patients had received a median (range) of three (two-six) prior lines and 85.7% were refractory to both lenalidomide and bortezomib. The primary end-point was the overall response rate (ORR) defined as >= partial response after at least three cycles. Secondary objectives were toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression and overall survival (OS). An intent-to-treat analysis was done. An ORR of 57.6% was achieved. Patients with extramedullary myeloma had a better response rate. At a median follow-up of 8.6 months, the median PFS and OS were 6.2 and 9.7 months respectively. Toxicity was manageable; mainly haematological (neutropenia, 46.4%; anaemia, 42.8%; and thrombocytopenia, 7.1%). Bendamustine, pomalidomide and dexamethasone could be a novel combination for the heavily pretreated, lenalidomide-refractory myeloma population.

AB  - IntroductionWorldwide gastric cancer is the 5th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of gastrointestinal cancer-related deaths. Alone surgery provides long-term survival improvements in 20% of the patients with local advanced gastric cancer. The results can be improved considering multimodal management including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, in low middle-income countries like India, multimodal management is challenging. Herein, we evaluated the experience of multimodal management of gastric cancer and the long-term outcome. MethodsRetrospective analysis of the data of 372 patients was done from a prospectively maintained computerized database from 1994 to 2021. Records were analyzed for demographic details, treatment patterns, recurrences, and long-term outcomes (DFS and OS). Statistical analysis was done with the package SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp, Chicago, Illinois, USA). ResultsThis study included 372 patients. The mean age of the patients was 54.07. A total of 307 patients (82.5%) were operated upfront, 45 (12%) received NACT, and 20 (5.5%) underwent the palliative procedure. A total of 53.2% underwent curative resection. R0 resection rate was achieved in 95% of patients. A total of 72.58% of patients required adjuvant treatment, and the majority of the patients underwent chemoradiotherapy. The most common site of metastasis was the liver. Median follow-up was 50.16 months. The 3-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 36.28% and 67.8%, and the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were 30.15% and 37.7%, respectively. ConclusionOur study suggested that multimodal management is required in locally advanced gastric cancer to achieve good long-term outcomes. The treatment sequence can be tailored based on the available resources.

AB  - Aims: The associations between prognostic awareness, acceptance of illness and psychological outcomes (anxiety, depression and spiritual well-being) remain unclear. This study examined the associations between prognostic awareness and various psychological outcomes and how they can be moderated by patient acceptance of illness (cancer).
   Materials and methods: In total, 1184 patients with stage IV solid cancer were recruited at major public hospitals across four Asian countries (China, India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam). Prognostic awareness and acceptance of illness were assessed through self-reported understanding of treatment intent and acceptance of illness, respectively. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, whereas spiritual well-being was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being Scale. Multivariate regressions were used to estimate the associations while controlling for patient characteristics.
   Results: Compared with being unaware of their prognosis (i.e. believing that their cancer is curable), being aware or unsure of their prognosis was associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, and lower spiritual well-being scores. Acceptance of illness moderated these relationships and improved the psychological outcomes.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that disclosure of prognostic information should be provided in conjunction with psychological interventions that focus on acceptance of illness. (C) 2021 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Petrous endostosis or prominent suprameatal tubercle is a rare entity which may prevent adequate microscopic exposure of the trigeminal nerve root entry zone during microvascular decompression (MVD) for trigeminal neuralgia. We present a rare case of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) with petrous endostosis, which was managed adequately by partial removal of the prominent suprameatal tubercle to improve the obscured site of neurovascular conflict and enabled complete MVD. Through this manuscript, we additionally discuss the nuances involved in this extension of the standard retrosigmoid approach in light of the published literature. Petrous endostosis encountered during MVD for TN can impose an operative challenge. Suprameatal extension of the standard retrosigmoid approach improves exposure at the site of neurovascular conflict but requires utmost care and attention to avoid complications. We emphasize recognizing this anatomical variation in the preoperative period to predict an operative difficulty, ensure appropriate patient counselling, and avoiding surgical complications.

Indiscriminate use of antimicrobials leading to the emergence of resistant or refractory microorganisms has further worsened the prognosis. Coexisting ocular surface diseases, delay in diagnosis due to inadequate microbiological sample, a slow-growing/virulent organism, or systemic immunosuppressive state all contribute to the refractory response of the ulcer. With improved understanding of these varied ocular and systemic factors contributing to the refractory nature of the microbes, role of biofilm formation and recent research on improving the bioavailability of drugs along with the development of alternative therapies have helped provide the required multidimensional approach to effectively diagnose and manage cases of refractory corneal ulcers and prevent corneal perforations or further dissemination of disease. In this review, we explore the current literature and future directions of the diagnosis and treatment of refractory keratitis.

AB  - This retrospective study was aimed to understand the clinical, laboratory, radiological parameters and the outcome of COVID-19 patients with underlying haematological disease. All patients with known haematological disease admitted with COVID-19-positive status from April to August 2020 in the COVID-19 facility of a tertiary care centre in north India, were included. Their medical records were analyzed for outcome and mortality risk factors. Fifty four patients, 37 males, were included in the study. Of these, 36 patients had haematological malignancy and 18 had benign disorder. Fever (95.5%), cough (59.2%) and dyspnoea (31.4%) were the most common symptoms. Nine patients had severe disease at diagnosis, mostly malignant disorders. Overall mortality rate was 37.0 per cent, with high mortality seen in patients with aplastic anaemia (50.0%), acute myeloid (46.7%) and lymphoblastic leukaemia (40.0%). On univariate analysis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >2 [odd ratio (OR) 11.6], COVID-19 severity (OR 8.2), dyspnoea (OR 5.7) and blood product transfusion (OR 6.4) were the predictors of mortality. However, the presence of moderate or severe COVID-19 (OR 16.6, confidence interval 3.8-72.8) was found significant on multivariate analysis. The results showed that patients with haematological malignancies and aplastic anaemia might be at increased risk of getting severe COVID-19 infection and mortality as compared to the general population.

AB  - Background: Patients with perinatal hypoxia (PH) and drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) often have bilateral parieto-occipital gliosis. Surgical management of such patients is a dilemma.
   Objective: To identify preoperative determinants for unilateral disconnection vs callosotomy, and analyze the surgical outcome in such patients.
   Methods and Material: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with DRE and history of PH, with MRI abnormalities restricted to bilateral posterior quadrants. Preoperative semiology, epilepsy duration and seizure frequency were recorded. Based on the concordance between the results of non-invasive tests, patients underwent either posterior quadrant disconnection (PQD) or corpus callosotomy (CC). Preoperative variables were analyzed and corelated to the postoperative seizure freedom.
   Results: Fourteen patients were identified, 6 underwent PQD and 8 underwent CC. At follow up of 39.17 +/- 23.75 months, 66.66% of patients (4/6) in the PQD subgroup had an ILAE Class I outcome. While none in the CC group attained seizure freedom, 87.5% (7/8) had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency (follow up: 42 +/- 27.31 months). Patients with a poor outcome had significantly greater seizure frequency (P = 0.05) and history of drop attacks (P = 0.04) in both the groups. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) accurately localized the epileptogenic zone in all of the patients with good outcome (P = 0.015). Concordance with single photon emission tomography (SPECT) was also a predictor of favorable outcome (P = 0.041).
   Conclusions: A history of drop attacks with high seizure frequency is associated with poor postoperative seizure outcome. Unilateral PQD is feasible and leads to superior seizure-free outcomes, even in cases with widespread and bilateral imaging and electrical abnormalities, provided the other preoperative investigations are concordant in localizing the epileptogenic zone.

AB  - Background: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the two most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infections. For over two decades, treatment guidelines have recommended empirical co-treatment for N.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis as symptoms overlap and co-infection is common. Studies from India estimating the same are limited and mostly based on conventional techniques. Aim and Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of N.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis coinfection using nucleic acid amplification tests. Further, we assessed the utility of pus cell estimation in Gram stained smears as a screening tool for inclusion of samples for molecular diagnosis. Methods: This was a prospective study conducted at two tertiary care hospitals; 100 patients (55 females and 45 males) with genitourinary discharge attending STI clinics were recruited, and endocervical or urethral swabs were collected. PCRs forN.gonorrhoeae and C.trachomatis were put up. In addition, microscopy and culture for gonococcus was performed followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 16 software. Results: N.gonorrhoeae infection was more common than C.trachomatis. A total of 14 patients were positive by PCR (9 males and 5 females) for gonococcus. However, culture was positive only in 8 male patients. PCR for C.trachomatis was positive in 9 (4 males and 5 females) and the co-infection rate was 5%. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of pus cell estimation was 100% for males and 64% and 94.6% respectively for females. All isolates were susceptible to extended spectrum cephalosporins and azithromycin. Limitation: The sample size of the study was small. Conclusion: Frequency of N.gonorrhoeae/C.trachomatis coinfection in symptomatic STI patients is low. Coinfection is considerably overestimated and necessary confirmation of etiological diagnosis could reduce widespread empirical administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

AB  - Purpose:Real-life comparison of three intravitreal drug regimens used in cases of endophthalmitis at a tertiary care center in India.Methods:In this prospective, comparative study, patients of bacterial endophthalmitis were grouped according to intravitreal antibiotic drug regimens into Group 1 (ceftazidime and vancomycin), Group 2 (piperacillin + tazobactam and vancomycin), and Group 3 (imipenem and vancomycin). Forty-eight hours after injection nonresponding/worsening patients underwent vitrectomy. Vitreous samples were subjected to microbiological and pharmacokinetic tests.Results:A total of 64 patients were included and divided into Group 1: 29, Group 2: 20, and Group 3: 15 cases. Also, 75% of patients were post-surgical endophthalmitis, whereas 25% were post-traumatic. Improvement in vision (V90-0) and vision at 3 months (V90) were comparable between the three groups. Visual recovery was poorer in post-traumatic cases. In post-surgical cases, visual recovery was poorer in those presenting beyond 72 h of onset of symptoms (P = 0.0002). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity (66%) was higher than BACTEC (TM) (33%) and culture (14%). Antibiotic resistance was comparable amongst the three groups. Most patients (62/64) further underwent vitrectomy. Ceftazidime and vancomycin achieved vitreous concentrations more than the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) at 48 h after the first injection.Conclusion:The choice of antibiotics did not affect the rate of vitrectomy and final vision in a real-life scenario. Ceftazidime and vancomycin can still be used as first-line intravitreal antibiotics owing to their comparable microbial sensitivity profile and adequate ocular bioavailability.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its risk factors among diabetic patients in the states of Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh (CG). Methods: Diabetic patients were screened in the treating diabetologist/physician's clinic by a team that included an ophthalmologist, an optometrist, and a counselor. Demographic details, diabetic control, compliance to eye checkup, awareness regarding diabetic blindness, and visual acuity were recorded using a questionnaire. DR was graded both by indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus photo taken with a portable fundus camera. Results: In total, 602 subjects were screened across five selected locations of MP and CG. The prevalence of DR was 13.62%. No significant difference with gender was seen. The presence and grade of DR were related to age, diabetic age, and diabetic control. Conclusion: This study provides the prevalence data for DR among diabetic patients from the states of MP and CG and highlights important barriers to DR screening in our country.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that manifest lung abnormalities during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients with severe COVID19 and ten uninfected controls. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant ???classical??? signature (n=23) showed upregulation of the unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation, supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) that potentially represents ???cytokine release syndrome??? (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such as IL1 and CCL19, but absence of complement activation. We found that a majority of patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in ???classical??? patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients, which can be identified through complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. These findings can be used to design personalized therapy using in silico identified drug molecules or in mitigating specific secondary infections.

AB  - PURPOSE
   The aim of the study was to radiolabel, characterize, and perform in vitro and in vivo assessment of Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) tamoxifen for screening ER expressing lesions in breast cancer patients.
   METHODS
   In this study, tamoxifen has been radiolabeled with Tc-99m via Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core. The characterization and quality control tests of Tc-99m-tamoxifen were performed. In vitro receptor binding and blocking studies were performed in both positive control (MCF-7) and negative control cell lines (MDA-MB-231). Normal biodistribution studies were performed in female Wistar albino rats. The pilot clinical studies were performed in 4 ER-expressing breast cancer patients. Of the 4 patients, 1 was on tamoxifen therapy. All 4 patients had also undergone Fluorine-18 -fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography.
   RESULTS
   Tamoxifen was radiolabeled with Tc-99m via Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core with more than 95% radiochemical yield. Mass spectra showed a peak corresponding to the molecular weight of Tc-99m-tricarbonyl and Tc-99m-tamoxifen. The site of binding of Tc-99m-tricarbonyl with tamoxifen was determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The Tc-99m-tamoxifen showed 30% binding with MCF-7 and only 1%-2% receptor binding with MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Also, the percentage of receptor binding was drastically reduced (up to 72%) when ER was saturated with 50 times the excess molar ratio of unlabeled tamoxifen. In a pilot patient study, Tc-99m-tamoxifen uptake was observed in primary and metastatic lesions. However, no uptake was observed in a patient who was on tamoxifen therapy. The uptake of F-18-FDG was noted in all the patients.
   CONCLUSION
   Tamoxifen was radiolabeled with an in-house-synthesized Tc-99m-tricarbonyl core. The radiolabeled complex has been characterized and evaluated for receptor specificity in in vitro and in vivo studies. Also, this is the first clinical study using Tc-99m-tamoxifen for imaging ER. More patients need to be evaluated to further explore the role of Tc-99m-tamoxifen in ER-expressing lesions.

AB  - The worldwide incidence of bone disorders has trended steeply upward and is expected to get doubled by 2030. The biological mechanism of bone repair involves both osteoconductivity and osteoinductivity. Despite the self-healing functionality after injury, bone tissue faces a multitude of pathological challenges. Several innovative approaches have been developed to prepare biomaterial-based bone grafts. To design a suitable bone material, the freeze-drying technique has achieved significant importance among the other conventional methods. However, the functionality of the polymeric freeze-dried scaffold in in-vivo osteogenesis is in a nascent stage. In this study facile, freeze-dried, biomaterial-based load-bearing three-dimensional porous composite scaffolds have been prepared. The biocompatible scaffolds have been made by using chitosan (C), polycaprolactone (P), hydroxyapatite (H), glass ionomer (G), and graphene (gr). Scaffolds of eight different groups (C, P, CP, CPH, CPHG, CPHGgr1, CPHGgr2, CPHGgr3) have been designed and characterized to evaluate their applicability in orthopedics. To evaluate the efficacy of the scaffolds a series of physio-chemical, morphological, and in-vitro and in-vivo biological experiments have been performed. From the obtained results it was observed that the CPHGgr1 is the ideal compatible material for Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the blood cells. The in-vitro bone-specific gene expression study revealed that the scaffold assists MSCs osteogenic differentiation. Additionally, the in-vivo study on the mice model was also performed for a period of four and eight weeks. The subcutaneous implantation of the designed scaffolds did not show any altered physiological condition in the animals, which indicated the in-vivo biocompatibility of the designed material. The histopathological study revealed that after eight weeks of implantation, the CPHGgr1 scaffold supported significantly better collagen deposition and calcification. The facile designing of the CPHGgr1 multicomponent nanocomposite provided an osteo-regenerative biomaterial with desired mechanical strength as an ideal regenerative material for cancellous bone tissue regeneration.

AB  - Chronic encephalitis manifesting as an epilepsy syndrome most commonly presents as Rasmussen's syndrome, usually characterized by epilepsia partialis continua, hemiparesis, and progressive cortical deficits such as aphasia, hemianopia, and cognitive decline. It is characterized by progressive hemispheric cortical atrophy on imaging and is usually seen in childhood. Adult-onset of the syndrome is rare, and only a few cases have been reported with bilateral symptoms. We present a patient with pseudobulbar affect and frontal lobe dysfunction who developed multifocal myoclonic jerks, right hemibody focal motor seizures, and right hemiparesis with bilateral cerebellar signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed progressive hemispheric atrophy and bilateral features in Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET CT). Brain biopsy revealed chronic T-cell infiltrate. We discuss this case as the patient had several features that were atypical for Rasmussen's encephalitis (or syndrome).

AB  - Unselected population-based personalised ovarian cancer (OC) risk assessments combining genetic, epidemiological and hormonal data have not previously been undertaken. We aimed to understand the attitudes, experiences and impact on the emotional well-being of women from the general population who underwent unselected population genetic testing (PGT) for personalised OC risk prediction and who received low-risk (<5% lifetime risk) results. This qualitative study was set within recruitment to a pilot PGT study using an OC risk tool and telephone helpline. OC-unaffected women >= 18 years and with no prior OC gene testing were ascertained through primary care in London. In-depth, semi-structured and 1:1 interviews were conducted until informational saturation was reached following nine interviews. Six interconnected themes emerged: health beliefs; decision making; factors influencing acceptability; effect on well-being; results communication; satisfaction. Satisfaction with testing was high and none expressed regret. All felt the telephone helpline was helpful and should remain optional. Delivery of low-risk results reduced anxiety. However, care must be taken to emphasise that low risk does not equal no risk. The main facilitators were ease of testing, learning about children's risk and a desire to prevent disease. Barriers included change in family dynamics, insurance, stigmatisation and personality traits associated with stress/worry. PGT for personalised OC risk prediction in women in the general population had high acceptability/satisfaction and reduced anxiety in low-risk individuals. Facilitators/barriers observed were similar to those reported with genetic testing from high-risk cancer clinics and unselected PGT in the Jewish population.

AB  - Purpose: To determine and validate retinal vascular caliber measurements by using the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system. Retinal vasculature changes are often regarded as clinical markers for systemic disease. Methods: It was a prospective observational study conducted on 600 eyes of 300 normal subjects with no systemic or ocular illness from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 in a tertiary referral eye center. Non-mydriatic infrared reflectance, blue reflectance, and blue peak blue autofluorescence fundus imaging were done on the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system. The dimensions of the retinal vessels were measured using inbuilt calipers at 1800 mm from the center of the optic disc. Internal and external dimensions were measured. Observer variation and its comparison using Image J software were assessed. Results: The median age was 29 years (18-50 years). Mean internal and external diameters for arterioles were 85.1 +/- 12.4 mu m and 105.0 +/- 12.0 mu m, and for venules were 133.8 +/- 16.6 mu m and 145.4 +/- 16.1 mu m, respectively. The mean internal and external wall thicknesses were 19.7 +/- 8.0 mu m and 11.0 +/- 5.6 mu m, and wall thickness-to-lumen ratios were 0.3 +/- 0.1 and 0.1 +/- 0.1, respectively. Arteriolar-to-venular ratio for lumen and vessel was 0.66 +/- 0.1 and 0.74 +/- 0.1, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between age groups. Both inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was >95%. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the difference between measurements using both confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and Image J software lies within the limits of agreement approximately 95% of the time. Conclusion: This is the first effort to develop a normative database by using a simple non-invasive confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system with high observer reproducibility.

KW  - LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS
AB  - Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (C-ALCL) is a cutaneous CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorder. The patients usually present with single or multiple cutaneous nodules or papules and about 10% cases present with extracutaneous manifestations, which are predominantly in the form of regional lymph nodal involvement. Visceral involvement especially pulmonary or hepatic involvement in C-ALCL is only rarely described in the scientific literature. Approximately 20%-42% cases show spontaneous regression, about 50% cases may recur; however, C-ALCL generally carries a good prognosis. We present a rare case of primary C-ALCL in a 66-year-old man with regional lymph nodal and hepatic involvement. Differential diagnostic entities are discussed in this report with the review of the literature.

AB  - Purpose: To report clinical presentation, in vivo confocal microscopic features, and corneal phenotype in patients with trachomatous keratopathy (TK) and secondary amyloidosis. Methods: Histopathological records of all patients undergoing keratoplasty at the Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences over a 3-year period were scanned retrospectively for a diagnosis of TK and amyloidosis. Demographic profile and details of preoperative comprehensive ophthalmic assessment were extracted. The histopathology was freshly reviewed. Results: Fifteen patients (29 eyes) with TK and atypical corneal involvement due to amyloid deposition were identified. Herbert's pits and upper palpebral conjunctival scarring were present in all cases. Central or total diffuse corneal scarring was present involving the anterior stroma in 5 (31%) and the full thickness of the cornea in 11 (69%) of the eyes. Eight (73%) of 11 patients with deep stromal amyloid deposits revealed bilateral, discrete, blue-white opacities at the level of deep stroma and Descemet membrane (DM). Endothelial cells were atrophic and flattened with gutta formation. Confoscans revealed hyperreflective, needle-shaped crystalline deposits of extracellular amyloid at various depths of the corneal stroma up to DM. All host corneal buttons demonstrated Congo red-positive amyloid deposits on histopathological examination. Conclusions: We describe a distinct form of TK unlike the usual presentation of dense, leucomatous, vascularized corneal scarring in trachoma. We believe that amyloid deposits in DM and the corneal endothelium have not previously been reported in patients with trachoma.

AB  - Ependymomas can arise along the entire neuraxis; however, they possess site-specific unique molecular alterations and a methylome pattern which is directly related with the prognostic outcomes. Since 2016, when the updated fourth edition of World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system was published, it has been emphasized to classify ependymomas by anatomic site and molecular signatures associated genetic alterations so that classification of the disease reflects its underlying biology. In continuation, the fifth edition of the WHO classification of CNS tumors introduces major changes, including site-specific molecular profiles as the basis of classifying ependymomas. Furthermore, an integrated tier system of reporting is recommended for better clinical correlation and predicting outcomes. WHO grading can still be included in a specific tier, along with molecular markers.

AB  - Background: Although dermatology is mostly an outpatient specialty, some patients with severe skin disease need hospital admission for management. There is a paucity of data regarding the profile of these dermatology in-patient admissions. Aims: We studied the profile of patients admitted to the dermatology ward of our tertiary care government hospital in North India. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of discharge sheets of patients admitted in the dermatology ward from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2017. Results: Discharge sheets of 2032 admissions for 1664 patients were analyzed. The most common diagnoses in the admitted patients were immunobullous disorders (576, 28%), connective tissue diseases (409, 20%), infections, including leprosy and sexually transmitted infections (179, 8.8%), psoriasis (153, 7.5%) and reactive arthritis (92, 4.5%). The mean duration of admission was 13.95 +/- 11.67 days (range 1-118 days). Two hundred and fifty-six patients (15.38%) were re-admitted, accounting for 368 (18.11%) re-admissions. Patients with immunobullous disorders (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.29-2.28) and psoriasis (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.02-2.55) were more likely to be re-admitted. Adult patients, those who were admitted for more than four weeks, those who had comorbidities, and those who developed a complication during the hospital stay also had a greater likelihood of being re-admitted. Limitations: The retrospective design of the study, and the non-availability of data regarding transfers to other specialties or intensive care units and deaths were the main limitations of this study. Conclusion: This study describes the profile of patients admitted in a dermatology ward of a tertiary care centre center in North India. The patient profile and admission characteristics associated with a higher probability of re-admission were identified.

AB  - Context: Cognition is impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with varying levels of magnitude.
   Aim: The present study aimed to identify a biomarker for classifying MCI and AD using multi-domain cognitive testing.
   Settings and Design: This was a cross-sectional study.
   Methods and Materials: 26 AD patients, 28 MCI patients and 25 controls were recruited. Cognitive assessment of different domains was done using standard questionnaires and cognitive function tests.
   Statistical Analysis Used: Cognitive task scores were compared between the groups using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA).
   Results: Patients with AD had significantly lower MMSE, CDR, cognitive task scores compared to controls and MCI. Cognitive scores of all tasks for MCI were significantly less than controls, except MMSE and digits forward score. ROC analysis showed that picture memory had 100% sensitivity, 91.6% specificity for AD and 88.4% sensitivity, 92.5% specificity for MCI. Word memory had 92.3% specificity, 100% specificity for AD and 80.7% specificity, 84.6% specificity for MCI.
   Conclusions: The global cognitive tools are less specific in bringing out the differences especially between MCI and control. Limitation of MMSE, heterogeneity of MCI and differential impairment of various domains of cognition, demands the inclusion of multi-domain cognitive evaluation especially picture and word memory tasks with high sensitivity and specificity into the existing diagnostic protocol. ROC results also suggested the continuum of cognitive impairment and MCI as a transitional stage leaving more scope on the quantum of research required for intervention to halt the structural and functional decline.

AB  - Objectives Infections including tuberculosis (TB) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). We systematically reviewed the prevalence of mycobacterial infections in patients with IIM. Methods We screened PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases and conference abstracts (2015-20) for original articles using Covidence. Pooled estimates of prevalence were calculated. Results Of 83 studies (28 cohort studies, two case control and 53 case reports), 19 were analysed. Of 14 043 IIM patients, DM (54.41%) was the most common subset among TB. Most studies were from Asia with high prevalence (5.86%, 2.33%-10.60%). Pooled prevalence of mycobacterial infections among IIM was 3.58% (95% CI: 2.17%, 5.85%, P < 0.01). Disseminated and extrapulmonary forms (46.58%; 95% CI: 39.02%, 54.31%, P = 1.00) were as common as pulmonary TB (49.07%; 95% CI: 41.43%, 56.75%, P =0.99) both for I-2=0. Muscle involvement, an otherwise rare site, was frequently seen in case reports (24.14%). M. tuberculosis (28.84%) was the most common pathogen followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (3.25%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were less common overall (6.25; 95% CI: 3.49%, 10.93%) I-2=0, P =0.94. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression based on high vs low TB regions found prevalence 6.61% (2.96%, 11.33%) in high TB regions vs 2.05% (0.90%, 3.56%) in low TB regions. While death due to TB was occasionally reported (P =0.82), successful anti-tubercular treatment was common (13.95%). Conclusion TB is common in IIM, particularly in endemic regions though current data is largely heterogeneous. Extra-pulmonary forms and atypical sites including the muscle are frequent. Limited data suggests fair outcomes, although larger prospective studies may offer better understanding.

AB  - Cancer treatment is heading towards precision medicine driven by genetic and biochemical markers. Various genetic and biochemical markers are utilized to render personalized treatment in cancer. In the last decade, noninvasive imaging biomarkers have also been developed to assist personalized decision support systems in oncology. The imaging biomarkers i.e., radiomics is being researched to develop specific digital phenotype of tumor in cancer. Radiomics is a process to extract high throughput data from medical images by using advanced mathematical and statistical algorithms. The radiomics process involves various steps i.e., image generation, segmentation of region of interest (e.g. a tumor), image preprocessing, radiomic feature extraction, feature analysis and selection and finally prediction model development. Radiomics process explores the heterogeneity, irregularity and size parameters of the tumor to calculate thousands of advanced features. Our study investigates the role of radiomics in precision oncology. Radiomics research has witnessed a rapid growth in the last decade with several studies published that show the potential of radiomics in diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction in oncology. Several radiomics based prediction models have been developed and reported in the literature to predict various prediction endpoints i.e., overall survival, progression-free survival and recurrence in various cancer i.e., brain tumor, head and neck cancer, lung cancer and several other cancer types. Radiomics based digital phenotypes have shown promising results in diagnosis and treatment outcome prediction in oncology. In the coming years, radiomics is going to play a significant role in precision oncology.

TI  - Comparing two different schedules of online learning for updated cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines in Covid-19 patients: A randomized study
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - MEDICAL-EDUCATION
KW  - PROGRAM
AB  - Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is an evolving disease with newly generated evidence related to the clinical management of Covid-19 patients. We aimed to compare two online learning schedules for disseminating new cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines in terms of knowledge gain and acceptability among nurses.
   Methods. In a prospective randomized controlled study, 61 nurses trained in comprehensive cardiopulmonary life support (CCLS) were randomized to synchronous ( n=31) and asynchronous learning groups (n= 30). The enhanced training module on CPR (ETMCPR) prepared by a team of experts was used to impart training to the nurses. Baseline data and pre-intervention knowledge of participants were collected using a structured demographic sheet and knowledge questionnaire (25 items) in a google form. Nurses in the synchronous group were provided training using ETMCPR through a licensed Zoom platform, while the nurses in the asynchronous group had access to the uploaded ETMCPR module in the e-learning platform. At the end of the intervention, the knowledge of the nurses was assessed along with their acceptability to the online learning schedule.
   Results. Both schedules of online learning were effective in improving the knowledge scores of the nurses (11.93 [3.26] v. 21.15 [1.90], p=0.01 and 11.71 [3.12] v. 20.32 [1.71], p=0.01). The mean acceptability scores of nurses in the asynchronous group were statistically lower than in the synchronous group (38.93 [2.50] v. 42.5 [3.08], p=0.007).
   Conclusion. Both synchronous and asynchronous schedules of online learning were effective in disseminating updated CPR guidelines; however, nurses in the synchronous group were more satisfied with the learning schedule.

AB  - Justification Global developmental delay (GDD) is a relatively common neurodevelopmental disorder; however, paucity of published literature and absence of uniform guidelines increases the complexity of clinical management of this condition. Hence, there is a need of practical guidelines for the pediatrician on the diagnosis and management of GDD, summarizing the available evidence, and filling in the gaps in existing knowledge and practices. Process Seven subcommittees of subject experts comprising of writing and expert group from among members of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) and its chapters of Neurology, Neurodevelopment Pediatrics and Growth Development and Behavioral Pediatrics were constituted, who reviewed literature, developed key questions and prepared the first draft on guidelines after multiple rounds of discussion. The guidelines were then discussed by the whole group in an online meeting. The points of contention were discussed and a general consensus was arrived at, after which final guidelines were drafted by the writing group and approved by all contributors. The guidelines were then approved by the Executive Board of IAP. Guidelines GDD is defined as significant delay (at least 2 standard deviations below the mean with standardized developmental tests) in at least two developmental domains in children under 5 years of age; however, children whose delay can be explained primarily by motor issues or severe uncorrected visual/hearing impairment are excluded. Severity of GDD can be classified as mild, moderate, severe and profound on adaptive functioning. For all children, in addition to routine surveillance, developmental screening using standardized tools should be done at 9-12 months, 18-24 months, and at school entry; whereas, for high risk infants, it should be done 6-monthly till 24 months and yearly till 5 years of age; in addition to once at school entry. All children, especially those diagnosed with GDD, should be screened for ASD at 18-24 months, and if screen negative, again at 3 years of age. It is recommended that investigations should always follow a careful history and examination to plan targeted testing and, vision and hearing screening should be done in all cases prior to standardized tests of development. Neuroimaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, should be obtained when specific clinical indicators are present. Biochemical and metabolic investigations should be targeted towards identifying treatable conditions and genetic tests are recommended in presence of clinical suspicion of a genetic syndrome and/or in the absence of a clear etiology. Multidisciplinary intervention should be initiated soon after the delay is recognized even before a formal diagnosis is made, and early intervention for high risk infants should start in the nursery with developmentally supportive care. Detailed structured counselling of family regarding the diagnosis, etiology, comorbidities, investigations, management, prognosis and follow-up is recommended. Regular targeted follow-up should be done, preferably in consultation with a team of experts led by a developmental pediatrician/pediatric neurologist.

AB  - Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly given to all patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery. However, currently, there is no consensus if prophylactic usage of antibiotics in cochlear implantation accords any benefit and if the duration of such use varies according to the surgeon's experience or institutional preference. A systematic review was conducted to gather evidence on ideal duration for antibiotic prophylaxis recommended for patients undergoing cochlear implantation. We registered the protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021235079) and reported the systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analysis statement. Of the 278 screened articles, 6 full-text original articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included. There were a total of 2081 participants in these 6 retrospective studies and all studies except 1 included both adult and pediatric populations. Antibiotic therapy was given as intervention, either as single dose or multiple doses, and compared with other group(s) receiving either no antibiotic prophylaxis or a different duration of prophylaxis. Three studies did not find any significant difference between infection rates when a different duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was given, while 2 studies found a single dose to be more efficacious, and yet another study concluded that a longer duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was more beneficial. Based on the available data, the ideal duration of post-operative antibiotic therapy to be given after cochlear implant surgery could not be defined. However, administrating a single dose of intraoperative antibiotic seems to be the most consistent practice so far.

AB  - Poor infant young child feeding (IYCF) practices result in malnutrition, poor psychosocial development, poor school performance and less productivity in later life, thereby perpetuating a vicious cycle. The current study aims to characterize the IYCF practices during the first year of life in a maternal-child birth cohort (DHANI) in Belagavi, Karnataka, India. We collected data from the dyad at birth, 6 and 12 months postpartum. We examined dietary diversity among these infants at 12 months using WHO criteria. A total of 902 live births were recorded, and 878 mother-child pairs completed the 12-month follow up. The overall prevalence of early (within 1 h of delivery) initiation of breastfeeding (EIBF) was 77.9%, and that of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) at 6 months was 52.4%. At 12 months, most (90%) infants were breastfed, while 39% also received formula. The large majority (94.4%) of infants met minimum meal frequency (MMF), but only 55% of infants were receiving a minimum acceptable diet (MAD). The mean dietary diversity (DD) score was 4.7 +/- 1.1. Only 21.9% of infants consumed egg and/or flesh food. A large proportion (33.8%) of infants received no vegetables and/or fruits till 12 months of age. Consumption of sweet beverage was 4.8%, but consumption of ultra-processed foods high in trans-fats, sugars and salt was high (85.8%). High-quality, sustainable and scalable interventions to enhance knowledge and support positive behaviour change for adopting and implementing better IYCF practices may be urgently needed in low- and middle-income group settings to improve diet diversity and overall nutritional intake amongst young children.

AB  - Background & objectives: High mortality has been observed in the cancer population affected with COVID-19 during this pandemic. We undertook this study to determine the characteristics and outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19 and assessed the factors predicting outcome.
   Methods: Patients of all age groups with a proven history of malignancy and a recent diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on nasal/nasopharyngeal reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR tests were included. Demographic, clinical and laboratory variables were compared between survivors and non-survivors groups, with respect to observed mortality.
   Results: Between May 11 and August 10, 2020, 134 patients were included from the three centres and observed mortality was 17.1 per cent. The median age was 53 yr (interquartile range 39-61 yr) and thirty four patients (25%) were asymptomatic. Solid tumours accounted for 69.1 per cent and breast cancer was the most common tumour type (20%). One hundred and five patients (70.5%) had received chemotherapy within the past four weeks and 25 patients (19.3%) had neutropenia at presentation. On multivariate analysis, age [odds ratio (OR) 7.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-54.00); P=0.033], haemoglobin [OR 6.28 (95% CI 1.07-37.04); P=0.042] neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio [OR 12.02 (95% CI 2.08-69.51); P=0.005] and baseline serum albumin [OR 18.52 (95% CI 2.80-122.27); P=0.002], were associated with higher mortality. Recent chemotherapy, haematological tumours type and baseline neutropenia did not affect the outcome.
   Interpretation & conclusions: Higher mortality in moderate and severe infections was associated with baseline organ dysfunction and elderly age. Significant proportion of patients were asymptomatic and might remain undetected.

AB  - Acute neurological insult can trigger a cascade of events in other organ systems such as the heart and lung. Neurogenic stunned myocardium (NSM) and Neurogenic pulmonary edema (NPE) are mostly reported after stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or seizures whenever sympathetic storm and autonomic dysregulation occurs. We report here for the first time, a case of postoperative infratentorial extradural hematoma in a patient triggering NSM and NPE at the same time. The challenges involved in the management of such a patient are described in this case report. The patient was successfully managed and discharged home with no new neurological deficits.

AB  - The median age of presentation for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is lower in developing countries with a higher proportion under 5 years of age possibly attributable to the high prevalence of Epstein-Barr virus-driven disease. It is unclear whether the clinical presentation and outcomes of this cohort are different with concern regarding late effects being most pronounced in this age group. We report the outcome of children under 5 years of age enrolled in the InPOG-HL-15-01, the first multicentric collaborative study for newly diagnosed children and adolescents with HL from India. Thirty-five (9%) of the study population was younger than 5 years with a striking male preponderance of 34:1. They were less likely to have bulky disease, mediastinal or splenic involvement. The outcomes appear to be at least as favorable as in the older patient group. Efforts need to be made to evolve treatment strategies that spare this very young cohort from potential late effects.

KW  - WHO
AB  - The latest fifth edition of the World Health Organization classification of central nervous system tumors (WHO CNS5) has been built on the prior WHO 2016 classification as well as recommendations put forward by seven updates of the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy (cIMPACT). Various new tumor types and subtypes have been recognized which are of clinical significance. Tumor groups have been restructured and the nomenclature of some tumor types has also been revised. The use of terms 'entity' and 'variant' have been replaced by 'type' and 'subtype'. Significant changes have been introduced in the grading of tumors viz. use of Arabic numerals, grading within individual tumor types and combined histological and molecular grading. The terms 'Not otherwise specified' and 'Not elsewhere classified' can now be used for all tumor types. WHO CNS5 also for the first time endorses the use of DNA methylation profiling for the diagnosis of some tumor types/subtypes. Finally, the importance of combining histology with molecular parameters is emphasized for the "layered reporting" and "integrated diagnosis", which will provide valuable diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive information, as well as for some entities, suggest targeted therapies.

AB  - Aim: To estimate the differences in the maxillary arch morphology in buccal and palatal canine impaction in an Asian population of Gujarati origin. Methodology: An institutional ethics committee's approval was acquired before the commencement of this study. Sixty subjects were enrolled in the study. Thirty subjects (20 females and 10 males) had a maxillary impacted canine either buccal or palatal and thirty control group participants were selected aged 13 to 18 years who sought orthodontic treatment at the tertiary health care center in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, in western India. Routine pre-treatment radiographs and dental plaster models with good anatomic details were recorded. Measurements of the inter-molar width, palatal depth, arch length, sum of the mesio-distal width of the upper incisors, and available arch space were recorded from prepared orthodontic study models using digital vernier calipers with an accuracy of 0.01 mm and brass wire. The ratio of palatal depth to inter-molar width (Ratio 1), arch length to inter-molar width (Ratio 2), and width of the maxillary incisors to available arch space (Ratio 3) were also secondarily calculated. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21, IBM Inc. The normality of the data was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk test. As the data was found to be normally distributed, bivariate analyses were also performed (one-way ANOVA test, Bonferroni post hoc correction). The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value less than 0.05. Results: The comparison of the inter-molar width, palatal depth, arch length, sum of the mesio-distal width of the upper incisors, available arch space, Ratio 1, Ratio 2, and Ratio 3 among controls and subjects with buccal and palatal canine impaction showed overall significant differences in the inter-molar width, palatal depth, arch length, sum of the mesio-distal width of the upper incisors, and available arch space when compared using one-way ANOVA as p < 0.05. Ratios 1, 2, and 3 also showed significant differences between the buccal and palatal canine impaction. Conclusion: An inadequate arch length (p < 0.0001) and a higher degree of crowding with reduced available arch space (p < 0.0001) may be considered as early risk factors for buccal maxillary canine impaction. An inadequate inter-molar width (p < 0.0001), and an increased palatal depth (p < 0.0001) with a clinically reduced mesiodistal width of the sum of maxillary incisors may be considered as risk factors for palatal maxillary canine impaction in an Asian population of Gujarati origin.

AB  - Background: Brain tumors are the second most common malignancy in childhood and the surgical excision remains the cornerstone of management. The objective of this study was to analyze the factors associated with the length of intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and postoperative outcome in such children.
   Materials and Methods: Three years of data were collected, retrospectively, by detailed review of medical records pertaining to pre-anesthetic evaluation and perioperative course of children less than 16 years of age who underwent excision of intracranial tumors.
   Results: One hundred sixty-eight medical records were analyzed. One third of the children were found to have developed various intraoperative adverse events; the most common were hemodynamic changes following brainstem handling and brain swelling. 58% of children required postoperative mechanical ventilation. 82.7% of patients had favorable neurologic outcome which was comparable between the two tumor locations (supratentorial vs infratentorial). On multivariate analysis, re-exploration surgery and electrolyte disturbances, such as serum sodium, were found to be the independent risk factors affecting hospital stay. The amount of intraoperative blood loss and postoperative pulmonary complications (POPCs) were independent risk factors affecting the neurologic outcome.
   Conclusions: Adverse events are fairly common after excision of brain tumors in children. Intraoperative complications did not affect the ICU stay or neurological outcome; however, the postoperative complications increased length of ICU and hospital stays. POPC was the single most important factor responsible for poor neurologic outcome and was more so in children who underwent infratentorial surgery, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and who had a lower cranial nerve palsy.

AB  - Yoga-based interventions can be effective in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We developed a Yoga programme for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) and conducted a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) among high-risk people in India. This qualitative study's objective was to identify and explore participants' trial- and intervention-related barriers and facilitators. The feasibility trial was conducted at two Yoga centres in New Delhi and Bengaluru, India. In this qualitative study, 25 trial participants (13 intervention group, 12 control group) were recruited for semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using deductive logic and an interpretative phenomenological approach. Amongst intervention and control participants, key barriers to trial participation were inadequate information about recruitment and randomisation processes and the negative influence of non-participants. Free blood tests to aid T2DM prevention, site staff's friendly behaviour and friends' positive influence facilitated trial participation. Amongst intervention participants, readability and understanding of the programme booklets, dislike of the Yoga diary, poor quality Yoga mats, difficulty in using the programme video, household commitment during home sessions, unplanned travel, difficulty in practising Yoga poses, hesitation in attending programme sessions with the YOGA-DP instructor of the opposite sex and mixed-sex group programme sessions were key barriers to intervention participation. Adequate information was provided on T2DM prevention and self-care, good venue and other support provided for programme sessions, YOGA-DP instructors' positive behaviour and improvements in physical and mental well-being facilitated intervention participation. In conclusion, we identified and explored participants' trial- and intervention-related barriers and facilitators. We identified an almost equal number of barriers (n = 12) and facilitators (n = 13); however, intervention-related barriers and facilitators were greater than for participating in the trial. These findings will inform the design of the planned definitive RCT design and intervention and can also be used to design other Yoga interventions and RCTs.

AB  - The presence of emulsified silicone oil in the eye can lead to many complications, glaucoma being one of the most common. Adequate IOP control is difficult to achieve with medical management alone; surgical intervention is often required. Glaucoma drainage device implantation is often the preferred line of surgical intervention in such cases due to trabeculectomy failure from emulsified silicone oil droplets and associated conjunctival scarring. However, the silicone tube of Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV) may attract the silicone oil droplets, causing blockade of the tube with persistent raised IOP postoperatively. We report one such case where post-AGV silicone oil tube occlusion was treated with semi-conservative surgical management instead of revising the entire surgery or implantation of another drainage device. Our surgical technique of intracameral "vent and flush" offers rapid and effective IOP control in such cases. Postoperatively, normal IOP was achieved. Patency of tube continued to be maintained along with normalization of IOP on subsequent follow-ups.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence and pattern of autofluorescence and its related cytological changes in pterygium. Methods: Eighty-six patients with unilateral pterygium and 76 controls were recruited. We graded pterygium, looked for autofluorescence, performed cytology of the nasal conjunctiva, repeated evaluation after 6 months, compared findings with controls, and assessed the progression of pterygium from photographs with the help of ImageJ software. Results: Autofluorescence was present in 51% of cases with pterygium. Autofluorescence at the leading edge (65.9%) was the predominant pattern seen. In total, 83.3% of grade 3 pterygia, 64.7% of grade 2 pterygia, and 28.9% of grade 1 pterygia (P value <0.0005) had autofluorescence. Impression cytology showed conjunctival epithelial cells in 60% of cases, significant squamous metaplasia in grade 3 pterygia (45%) compared with grade 2 pterygia (11.8%), and normal conjunctival epithelial cells in grade 1 pterygia (P value < 0.0005). Conclusions: The presence and pattern of conjunctival autofluorescence and cytological changes, especially squamous metaplasia, are linked to the severity or grade of pterygium.

AB  - Introduction In this study, the optimal input parameters point spread function (PSF) and the number of iterations of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm were experimentally determined to restore Tc-99 m methyl diphosphonate (MDP) whole-body bone scan images. Materials and methods The experiment was performed on 60 anonymized Tc-99 m MDP whole-body bone scan images. Ten images were used for estimating the optimum value of PSF and the number of iterations to restore scintigraphic images. The remaining 50 images were used for validation of estimated parameters. The image quality of observed and restored images was assessed objectively using blind/referenceless image spatial quality evaluator (BRISQUE), mean brightness (MB), discrete entropy (DE), and edge-based contrast measure (EBCM) image quality metrics. Image quality was subjectively assessed by two nuclear medicine physicians (NMPs) by comparing the restored image quality with observed image quality and assigning a score to each image on the scale of 0-5. Results Based on BRISQUE, MB, DE, and EBCM scores, the restored images were significantly sharper, less bright, had more detailed information, and had less contrast around edges compared to the input images. The restored images had improved resolution based on visual assessment as well; NMPs assigned an average image quality score of 4.00 to restored images. Maximum resolution enhancement was noticed at PSF (size: 11 pixels, sigma: 1.75 pixels) and the number of iterations = 10. With the increase in the number of iterations, noise also gets amplified along with resolution enhancement and affects the detectability of small lesions; in the case of relatively low noisy input images, the number of iterations = 5 gave better results. Conclusion Tc-99 m MDP bone scan images were restored to improve image quality using the Richardson-Lucy algorithm. The optimum value of the PSF parameter was found to be of size = 11 pixels and sigma = 1.75 pixels.

AB  - Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase-like (MASTL) regulates mitotic progression and is an attractive target for the development of new anticancer drugs. In this study, novel inhibitory molecules were screened against MASTL kinase, a protein involved in cell proliferation in breast cancer. Natural source-derived drugs Enzastaurin and Palbociclib were selected to identify their role as MASTL kinase inhibitors. Cytotoxic activity, kinase activity, and other cell-based assays of Enzastaurin and Palbociclib were evaluated on human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The potential natural compounds caused cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Further analysis by Annexin V and PI staining indicated that both drugs are potent inducers of apoptosis. Enzastaurin induced G2/M phase arrest, while Palbociclib caused G1 arrest. MASTL kinase activity was significantly abrogated with both the compounds showing EC50 values of 17.13 mu M and 10.51 mu M, respectively. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that Enzastaurin and Palbociclib possess the ability to inhibit MASTL kinase activity and induce cell death in breast cancer cells, thus exhibiting significant therapeutic potential.

AB  - Low-grade gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in the pediatric age group. The majority of these tumors are circumscribed, while diffuse low-grade gliomas are relatively rare. The pediatric type diffuse low-grade gliomas (pDLGG) have a distinctly different biological behavior, molecular profile, and clinical outcome as compared to their adult counterpart. In the 5th edition of World Health Organization (WHO) CNS classification, pDLGGs are subclassified into four distinct histomolecular entities, namely, (i) diffuse astrocytoma, MYB- or MYBL1-altered, (ii) angiocentric glioma, (iii) polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young (PLNTY), and (iv) diffuse low-grade glioma, MAPK pathway-altered. Although the molecular profile, to a great extent, aligns with the morphological features, it is not specific. Many of the molecular alterations described in pDLGG have therapeutic implications with the availability of newer targeted therapies. A wide range of testing platforms are available for routine assessment of these molecular alterations in clinical laboratories, though WHO does not recommend any particular method.

AB  - Background: Chronic opioid use affects biological functioning implicating the hematopoietic and immune system. It may alter various hematological parameters and inflammatory markers. This study aimed to assess the association of opioid dependence with the hematological parameters and inflammatory markers in the Indian population.
   Methods: A retrospective chart review was done among opioid dependent (ODS) males and healthy controls (HC) who visited the center's laboratory between Jan 2017 and Dec 2018 for hematological investigations. Clinical records reviewed for opioid use details like type, duration, and route of administration. The hematological profile presented as Mean or median. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the hematological parameters between the cases and controls.
   Results: The study included 191 ODS patients and 123 controls. Among ODS patients, a significant decrease in the levels of hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin and an increase in RBC count and lymphocytes was observed when compared to controls. The inflammatory markers, Neutrophil-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Platelet-Lymphocyte Ratio, were significantly lower among ODS. Longer duration of opioid use leads to increased NLR among ODS patients. Opioid use by injection did not alter any of the hematological parameters compared to non-injection drug use.
   Conclusion: Chronic opioid use has a significant effect on the hematopoietic cells. Opioid use for longer durations increases the inflammatory markers suggesting underlying infections.

AB  - Background: Opioid-dependent patients undergoing opioid substitution therapy (OST) consume alcohol in a hazardous pattern which adversely affects their treatment outcome. This study aims to measure alcohol biomarkers to screen for secondary alcohol use in OST patients.
   Methods: A pilot study was planned to measure alcohol biomarkers (AST, ALT, GGT, and CDT) to assess alcohol use in OST patients from three community clinics. The biomarkers were categorized based on the reported frequency of alcohol use. The association of the biomarkers with the frequency of alcohol consumption was determined using the post hoc (Mann-Whitney) test.
   Results: Forty-five patients with a mean (SD) age of 37.04 (10.7) years were included in the study. Alcohol intake was reported in daily, weekly, and monthly patterns by 22, 63, and 16% of the patients, respectively. High levels of ALT, GGT, and CDT were measured in patients with daily use of alcohol. Serum CDT levels significantly differentiate daily and weekly use from monthly consumption of alcohol.
   Conclusions: Alcohol biomarkers significantly predict the pattern of alcohol use among OST patients. These results can be prudent in low-resource community clinics to improve the overall outcomes of OST in India.

AB  - Histiocytic sarcoma (HS) is an aggressive hematolymphoid malignancy that arises from non Langerhans histiocytes and usually involves the skin, lymph nodes, and intestine. The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) is a rare occurrence with around 30 cases being reported in English literature. Morphological and immunohistochemical evidence of histiocytic differentiation is essential for diagnosis. Prognosis is very poor and consensus on treatment is not available mainly due to its rarity. We report two cases of HS with varied clinical presentation and pathological findings and elucidate the diagnostic challenges of this rare entity.

AB  - Background and Aims: Substance use among medical students may have consequences like poor academic performance and impaired patient care. There is a growing literature on substance use among medical students in India. This systematic review and meta-analysis were done to synthesize the literature on substance use among medical students in India.
   Methods: Medline and Google Scholar were used as search engines to ascertain the literature that reported substance use among Indian medical students from January 2000 to January 2022. The pooled prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, other substance, and overall substance use was computed.
   Results: A total of 65 studies were included. The pooled prevalence of tobacco use was 21.9% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 18.5% to 25.3%, n = 20,165, k = 51), while the pooled prevalence of alcohol use was 27.1% (95% CI of 23.0% to 31.1%, n = 11,823, k = 31). The overall pooled prevalence of substance use was 40.3% (95% CI of 25.5% to 55.2%, n = 4960, k = 10), while pooled prevalence of cannabis was 8.2% (95% CI of 4.9% to 11.5%, n = 2418, k = 7). The use of tobacco was about 10 times higher in males than females, while the odds of alcohol use were about five times higher in males.
   Conclusion: Substance use is common among medical students, with rates of substance use being generally higher in males as compared to females. Targeted interventions may help to reduce substance use and prevent the development of substance use disorders in this population.

AB  - Time-restricted eating (TRE), a popular form of intermittent fasting, has been demonstrated to provide multiple health benefits, including an extension of healthy lifespan in preclinical models. While the specific mechanisms remain elusive, emerging research indicates that one plausible mechanism through which TRE may confer health benefits is by influencing the expression of the epigenetic modulator circulatory miRNAs, which serve as intercellular communicators and are dysregulated in metabolic disorders, such as obesity. Therefore, the goal of this pilot study is to examine the effects of a 4-week TRE regimen on global circulatory miRNA from older (>= 65 years) overweight participants. Pre- and post-TRE regimen serum samples from nine individuals who participated in the Time to Eat clinical trial (NCT03590847) and had a significant weight loss (2.6 kg, p < 0.01) were analyzed. The expressions of 2083 human miRNAs were quantified using HTG molecular whole transcriptome miRNA assay. In silico analyses were performed to determine the target genes and biological pathways associated with differentially expressed miRNAs to predict the metabolic effects of the TRE regimen. Fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed pre- and post-TRE regimen. Specifically, downregulated miRNA targets suggested increased expression of transcripts, including PTEN, TSC1, and ULK1, and were related to cell growth and survival. Furthermore, the targets of downregulated miRNAs were associated with Ras signaling (cell growth and proliferation), mTOR signaling (cell growth and protein synthesis), insulin signaling (glucose uptake), and autophagy (cellular homeostasis and survival). In conclusion, the TRE regimen downregulated miRNA, which, in turn, could inhibit the pathways of cell growth and activate the pathways of cell survival and might promote healthy aging. Future mechanistic studies are required to understand the functional role of the miRNAs reported in this study.

AB  - Approximately 80% genes have an active expression in the brain and 40% of known genetic disorders affect the central nervous system. Revolutionary techniques like next-genome sequencing have solved the problem of the diagnostic odyssey in neurological genetic diseases. As several studies have shown the cost-effectiveness of next-genome sequencing compared to the older tests available in our diagnostic armamentarium, it becomes imperative to know about these genetic mutations and the tests available to diagnose them. We have tried to explain the basic concepts of genetics, the selection of available tests and their interpretation for neurophysicians.

AB  - Regenerative medicine using stem cells offers promising strategies for treating a variety of degenerative diseases. Regulation of stem cell behavior and rejuvenate senescence are required for stem cells to be clinically effective. The extracellular matrix (ECM) components have a significant impact on the stem cell's function and fate mimicking the local environment to maintain cells or generate a distinct phenotype. Here, human elastin-like polypeptide-based ECM-mimic biopolymer was designed by incorporating various cell-adhesion ligands, such as RGD and YIGSR. The significant effects of bioactive fusion ELPs named R-ELP, Y-ELP, and RY-ELP were analyzed for human bone-marrow-derived stem cell adhesion, proliferation, maintenance of stemness properties, and differentiation. Multivalent presentation of variable cell-adhesive ligands on RY-ELP polymers indeed promote efficient cell attachment and proliferation of human fibroblast cells dose-dependently. Similarly, surface modified with RY-ELP promoted strong mesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) attachment with greater focal adhesion (FA) complex formation at 6 h post-incubation. The rate of cell proliferation, migration, population doubling time, and collagen I deposition were significantly enhanced in the presence of RY-ELP compared with other fusion ELPs. Together, the expression of multipotent markers and differentiation capacity of MSCs remained unaffected, clearly demonstrating that stemness properties of MSCs were well preserved when cultured on a RY-ELP-modified surface. Hence, bioactive RY-ELP offers an anchorage support system and effectively induces stimulatory response to support stem cell proliferation.

AB  - SIGNIFICANCE Neovascular glaucoma is an important subset of secondary glaucoma in neurofibromatosis patients. Vasculopathy of the ophthalmic circulation needs to be borne in mind while evaluating their etiology. PURPOSE This study aimed to report the presentation, diagnostic work-up and management of an unusual case of neovascular glaucoma in a child. CASE REPORT A 7-year-old boy presented with uniocular ischemic fundus and secondary neovascular glaucoma. Detailed family history and evaluation led to a diagnosis of familial neurofibromatosis type 1. Fundus fluorescein angiography revealed compromised retinal and choroidal circulations in the affected eye. Ocular ultrasound B scan and neuroimaging did not show any contributory lesions. Cardiovascular evaluation was within normal limits. Ophthalmic Doppler imaging revealed normal proximal ophthalmic arteries in both eyes; however, the central retinal artery of the affected eye showed low flow in its proximal part and absent flow in the distal part, as compared with the fellow eye showing regular flow until the optic disc margin. Corroborating the clinical, fundus fluorescein angiography and Doppler findings, a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1-related vasculopathy of the distal ophthalmic artery was made. Poor visual prognosis for the affected eye was explained, and anterior retinal cryopexy along with cyclocryotherapy was performed to treat the neovascular glaucoma. CONCLUSIONS Vasculopathy of the ophthalmic circulation is an important cause of neovascular glaucoma in neurofibromatosis patients. The morphology of Lisch nodules may be altered in an ischemic eye, and therefore, careful examination of the other eye and systemic evaluation is vital in such unusual scenarios.

AB  - Purpose:To formulate a treatment algorithm for the management of descemetocele. Methods:This was a prospective interventional study that was conducted at a tertiary eye-care center. All consecutive cases of descemetocele during the study period (April 1, 2017-March 31, 2018) were evaluated for the following parameters: age, sex, previous medical or surgical therapy, risk factors, preexisting ocular diseases, location, site and size of descemetocele, interventions undertaken, visual acuity, and the fellow eye status. The surgical modalities and fellow eye status were correlated individually with therapeutic and functional outcomes, based on which a treatment algorithm was formulated. Results:The study included 24 eyes of 24 patients (19M, 5F) with a median age of presentation of 45 years. The mean follow-up duration was 6.79 +/- 3.97 months (3-12 months). The most common cause of descemetocele was microbial keratitis (66.66%), and most cases were central (50%), small (58.33%), and non-perforated (79.16%). The surgical interventions undertaken were cyanoacrylate glue (CG, 37.5%), penetrating keratoplasty (PKP, 33.33%), patch graft (16.66%), and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK, 12.5%). Therapeutic success was noted in 13/24 eyes (54.16%). Final visual acuity > 3/60 was seen in 25% cases. Suboptimal therapeutic (P = 0.07) and visual (P = 0.34) outcomes were noted in subjects with non-functional fellow eye. Conclusion:PKP was preferred for descemetoceles with active microbial keratitis and extensive infiltrates, while CG and DALK were undertaken for healed microbial keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis, and ocular surface disorders with partial limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). For total LSCD, amniotic membrane graft was preferred.

Results: The study included 24 eyes of 24 patients (19M, 5F) with a median age of presentation of 45 years. The mean follow-up duration was 6.79 +/- 3.97 months (3-12 months). The most common cause of descemetocele was microbial keratitis (66.66%), and most cases were central (50%), small (58.33%), and non-perforated (79.16%). The surgical interventions undertaken were cyanoacrylate glue (CG, 37.5%), penetrating keratoplasty (PKP, 33.33%), patch graft (16.66%), and deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK, 12.5%). Therapeutic success was noted in 13/24 eyes (54.16%). Final visual acuity > 3/60 was seen in 25% cases. Suboptimal therapeutic (P = 0.07) and visual (P = 0.34) outcomes were noted in subjects with non-functional fellow eye. Conclusion: PKP was preferred for descemetoceles with active microbial keratitis and extensive infiltrates, while CG and DALK were undertaken for healed microbial keratitis, neurotrophic keratitis, and ocular surface disorders with partial limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). For total LSCD, amniotic membrane graft was preferred.

TI  - Hand sanitizer-related calls at the National Poisons Information Centre, India during the lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - UNITED-STATES
KW  - INTOXICATION
KW  - INGESTION
AB  - Background. Hand sanitizer (HS) has been increasingly used during the Covid-19 pandemic. We compared the telephonic calls received by the National Poisons Information Centre (NPIC), New Delhi, India, related to its unsafe exposure and inappropriate use during the lockdown and pre-lockdown periods.
   Methods. We analysed and compared telephonic call records of 3 months of pre- lockdown and 3 months of the lockdown and HS-related calls in different age groups and zones during these periods.
   Results. The centre received 4000 calls; of these 1583 (40%) were related to household products of which only 63 (4%) were related to HS. There was an 8-fold increase in the number of calls received at the NPIC during the lockdown compared to the pre-lockdown period seeking medical attention following unsafe exposure or inappropriate use of HS. More calls were received from the south and north zones and, in the majority of these cases, HS was ingested accidentally. In some cases, HS was ingested intentionally for suicide during the lockdown.
   Conclusions. Our study shows that unsafe exposure of HS is common under conditions of stress as seen during the lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic. It should be kept out of reach of small children. Further, providing psychological help and counselling to older age groups under conditions of stress are important issues of concern.

TI  - Covid-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (CAROM) in Delhi: Demographics and risk factors in a single-centre consecutive cohort of 200 inpatients
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Background. There was a dramatic rise in the incidence of rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis associated with the 2021 Covid-19 wave in India. We aim to document the demographic characteristics and risk factors of a consecutive cohort of inpatients with Covid-19-associated rhino-orbito-cerebral mucormycosis (CAROM) during the surge of April-June 2021.
   Methods. We included all patients of CAROM treated at our tertiary referral facility from 1 April to 14 June 2021. We prospectively gathered details with regard to Covid-19 illness and treatment, CAROM presentation, comorbid conditions and risk factors.
   Results. Our prospective cohort consisted of 200 consecutive patients, of which 146 (73%) patients tested positive on the Covid-19 RT- PCR test at presentation. CAROM occurred concurrent with the Covid-19 infection in 86%, and delayed CAROM after seeming recovery from Covid-19 was seen in 14%. Covid-19 was classified as mild, moderate and severe in 54%, 33% and 13%. The surge of CAROM followed the population peak of Covid-19 infections by about 3 weeks. Advanced disease at presentation was frequent with ocular involvement in 56.6% (111/196) and central nervous system involvement in 20% (40/199). One or more comorbid conditions were identified in 191/200 (95.5%) patients. The dominant associations were with diabetes (189/200; 94.5%) and uncontrolled hyperglycaemia (122/133; 91.7%), recent steroid use (114/200; 57%), which was often considered as inappropriate in dosage or duration, lymphopenia (142/176; 80.7%), and increased ferritin levels (140/160; 87.5%). No evidence supported the role of previous oxygen therapy or previous nasal swab testing as risk factors for CAROM.
   Conclusion. The inpatient volumes of CAROM were noted to parallel the Covid-19 incidence curve by about 3 weeks. Covid-19 infection may directly predispose to CAROM by way of lymphopenia and increased ferritin levels. Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia is identified as a near-invariable association. Recent steroid use is noted as very frequent and was often received in excess of treatment advisories.

AB  - COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Since then, efforts were initiated to develop safe and effective vaccines. Till date, 11 vaccines have been included in the WHO's emergency use list. The emergence and spread of variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 has altered the disease transmission dynamics, thus creating a need for continuously monitoring the real-world effectiveness of various vaccines and assessing their overall impact on disease control. To achieve this goal, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) along with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, took the lead to develop the India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker by synergizing three different public health databases: National COVID-19 testing database, CoWIN vaccination database and the COVID-19 India portal. A Vaccine Data Analytics Committee (VDAC) was constituted to advise on various modalities of the proposed tracker. The VDAC reviewed the data related to COVID-19 testing, vaccination and patient outcomes available in the three databases and selected relevant data points for inclusion in the tracker, following which databases were integrated, using common identifiers, wherever feasible. Multiple data filters were applied to retrieve information of all individuals >= 18 yr who died after the acquisition of COVID-19 infection with or without vaccination, irrespective of the time between vaccination and test positivity. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the reduction of mortality and hospitalizations was initially assessed. As compared to the hospitalization data, mortality reporting was found to be much better in terms of correctness and completeness. Therefore, hospitalization data were not considered for analysis and presentation in the vaccine tracker. The vaccine tracker thus depicts VE against mortality, calculated by a cohort approach using person-time analysis. Incidence of COVID-19 deaths among one- and two-dose vaccine recipients was compared with that among unvaccinated groups, to estimate the rate ratios (RRs). VE was estimated as 96.6 and 97.5 per cent, with one and two doses of the vaccines, respectively, during the period of reporting. The India COVID-19 Vaccination Tracker was officially launched on September 9, 2021. The high VE against mortality, as demonstrated by the tracker, has helped aid in allaying vaccine hesitancy, augmenting and maintaining the momentum of India's COVID-19 vaccination drive.

KW  - SYNDROME TYPE-1
KW  - GUIDELINES
AB  - Background: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) of upper limbs is one of the under-recognized painful disabling condition seen in many neurological conditions.
   Objective: To see the effectiveness of peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) along with intra-articular injection in shoulder joint in the improvement of pain, swelling and range of motion (ROM) of the upper limb in CRPS.
   Methods: It was a single-center, prospective study in male and female patients between 18 and 70 years with CRPS of the upper limb due to any etiology, within one year of illness. Single-dose of the intra-articular shoulder joint injection and peripheral nerve blocks at the wrist with steroid, 2% lignocaine, and sterile water was given. The primary outcome measure was a reduction in pain in the upper limb, assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures were an improvement in passive ROM of joints and a decrease in swelling of the hand. The significance of the P value was adjudged against an alpha of 0.05.
   Results: Thirty-three patients (25 men), with a mean (SD) age of 55.2 (9.4) years, and mean (SD) duration of illness of 101.9 (76.8) days were included. After 1 week, there was a significant improvement (P < 0.05) in the ROM of joints. The decrease in pain scores on VAS [mean difference -5.1 (CI -5.7, -4.5)] and reduction in hand swelling [mean difference -0.9 (CI -1.1, -0.7)] was also significant.
   Conclusion: Peripheral median, radial, and ulnar nerve block at wrist along with intra-articular steroid injection in the shoulder joint is an effective method of management of CRPS of the upper limb.

TI  - Smartphone-Based Telestroke Vs"Stroke Physician" led Acute Stroke Management (SMART INDIA): A Protocol for a Cluster-Randomized Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF INDIAN ACADEMY OF NEUROLOGY
KW  - Cluster randomized trial
KW  - stroke
KW  - telestroke
KW  - telerehabilitation
KW  - CARE
AB  - Background: One of the major challenges is to deliver adequate health care in rural India, where more than two-thirds of India's population lives. There is a severe shortage of specialists in rural areas with one of the world's lowest physician/population ratios. There is only one neurologist per 1.25 million population. Stroke rehabilitation is virtually nonexistent in most district hospitals. Two innovative solutions include training physicians in district hospitals to diagnose and manage acute stroke ('Stroke physician model') and using a low-cost Telestroke model. We will be assessing the efficacy of these models through a cluster-randomized trial with a standard of care database maintained simultaneously in tertiary nodal centers with neurologists. Methods: SMART INDIA is a multicenter, open-label cluster-randomized trial with the hospital as a unit of randomization. The study will include district hospitals from the different states of India. We plan to enroll 22 district hospitals where a general physician manages the emergency without the services of a neurologist. These units (hospitals) will be randomized into either of two interventions using computer-generated random sequences with allocation concealment. Blinding of patients and clinicians will not be possible. The outcome assessment will be conducted by the blinded central adjudication team. The study includes 12 expert centers involved in the Telestroke arm by providing neurologists and telerehabilitation round the clock for attending calls. These centers will also be the training hub for "stroke physicians" where they will be given intensive short-term training for the management of acute stroke. There will be a preintervention data collection (1 month), followed by the intervention model implementation (3 months). Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the composite score (percentage) of performance of acute stroke care bundle assessed at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. The highest score (100%) will be achieved if all the eligible patients receive the standard stroke care bundle. The study will have an open-label extension for 3 more months. Conclusion: SMART INDIA assesses whether the low-cost Telestroke model is superior to the stroke physician model in achieving acute stroke care delivery. The results of this study can be utilized in national programs for stroke and can be a role model for stroke care delivery in low- and middle-Income countries. (CTRI/2021/11/038196)

AB  - Purpose:To assess the role of noninvasive ocular surface analyzer (OSA) in workup of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) and to estimate hospital-based prevalence of MGD using this objective device. Methods:The study recruited 113 consecutive participants attending the ophthalmology outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital. All participants were administered a symptom questionnaire. Participants underwent a comprehensive ocular examination, including slit-lamp biomicroscopy and meibomian gland expression. Lipid layer thickness (LLT), noninvasive tear breakup time (NIBUT), tear meniscus height (TMH), and meibomian gland loss (MGL) were assessed using OSA. The presence of either or both reduced/absent meibum secretion and cloudy to toothpaste-like secretion was diagnosed as MGD. Results:Prevalence of total MGD was 57.52% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 48.3%-66.8%) and that of symptomatic MGD was 42.5% (95% CI: 33.2%-51.7%). Prevalence of total and symptomatic MGD was highest in those aged >= 50 years (P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). Computer vision syndrome increased the odds of symptomatic MGD (odds ratio [OR]: 4.3). NIBUT and MGL significantly differed in MGD and non-MGD groups (P = 0.023 and P < 0.001, respectively). LLT significantly differed between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases (P = 0.033). MGL >25% increased the odds of having MGD (OR: 19.1). Significant negative correlations were observed between MGL and NIBUT (P = 0.04) and between MGL and LLT (P = 0.02). MGL demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for MGD (AUC = 0.827, sensitivity = 75.4%, specificity = 85.4%, cut-off value: >= 26%). Conclusion:MGD is a common disorder in adults attending the ophthalmology outpatient services of a tertiary eye care hospital. Incorporating noninvasive OSA in clinical practice can aid in rapid and reliable measurements of MGD-related parameters.

AB  - Pirarubicin (PIRA) is a semi-synthetic anthracycline derivative that is reported to have lesser toxicity and better clinical outcomes as compared to its parental form doxorubicin (DOX). However, long term use of PIRA causes bone marrow suppression and severe cardiotoxicity to the recipients. Herein, we have developed a biodegradable polymeric nano platform consisting of amphiphilic di-block copolymer methoxy polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid and a hydrophobic penta-block copolymer polylactic acid-pluronic L-61-polylactic acid as a hybrid system to prepare PIRA (& DOX) encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) with an aim to reduce its off targeted toxicity and enhance therapeutic efficacy for cancer therapy. Prepared PIRA/DOX NPs showed uniform particle size distribution, high encapsulation efficiency and sustained drug release profile. Cytotoxicity evaluation of PIRA NPs against TNBC cells and mammospheres showed its superior anti-cancer activity over DOX NPs. Anti-cancer efficacy of PIRA/DOX NPs was found significantly enhanced in presence of penta-block copolymer which confirmed chemo-sensitising ability of pluronic L-61. Most importantly, encapsulation of PIRA/DOX in the NPs reduced their off targeted toxicity and increased the maximum tolerated dose in BALB/c mice. Moreover, treatment of EAC tumor harbouring mice with PIRA NPs resulted in higher tumor regression as compared with the groups treated with free PIRA, free DOX or DOX NPs. Altogether, the results conclude that prepared PIRA NPs exhibits an excellent anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy and has a strong potential for cancer therapy.

AB  - Cancer is one of the leading causes of death and significantly burdens the healthcare system. Due to its prevalence, there is undoubtedly an unmet need to discover novel anticancer drugs. The use of natural products as anticancer agents is an acceptable therapeutic approach due to accessibility, applicability, and reduced cytotoxicity. Natural products have been an incomparable source of anticancer drugs in the modern era of drug discovery. Along with their derivatives and analogs, natural products play a major role in cancer treatment by modulating the cancer microenvironment and different signaling pathways. These compounds are effective against several signaling pathways, mainly cell death pathways (apoptosis and autophagy) and embryonic developmental pathways (Notch pathway, Wnt pathway, and Hedgehog pathway). The historical record of natural products is strong, but there is a need to investigate the current role of natural products in the discovery and development of cancer drugs and determine the possibility of natural products being an important source of future therapeutic agents. Many target-specific anticancer drugs failed to provide successful results, which accounts for a need to investigate natural products with multi-target characteristics to achieve better outcomes. The potential of natural products to be promising novel compounds for cancer treatment makes them an important area of research. This review explores the significance of natural products in inhibiting the various signaling pathways that serve as drivers of carcinogenesis and thus pave the way for developing and discovering anticancer drugs.

AB  - Background: The patients with positive celiac disease (CeD) specific serology, but no evidence of intestinal inflammation are defined as potential celiac disease (PCeD) patients. About one-third of PCeD patients develop intestinal inflammation over time. The present study investigated the metabolome of small intestinal biopsies, blood plasma, and urine of patients with PCeD to understand the biochemical changes underlying the CeD. Methods: The metabolic profiles of small intestinal biopsies, blood plasma, and urine of patients with PCeD (n = 7) were compared with CeD (n = 64) and controls (n = 15) [disease controls (DC) and healthy controls (HC)] using H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Results: The intestinal mucosa of PCeD showed lower levels of histidine, glycine, tyrosine, and tryptophan compared to DC. Altered levels of 6 metabolites (glucose, acetate, acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, pyruvate, arginine) in blood plasma and two metabolites (succinate and aminohippurate) in urine were observed in PCeD compared to HC. The PLS-DA model built on the concentration of blood plasma showed separate clustering for PCeD and CeD patients. Conclusion: Altered metabolic profile of PCeD suggested that gluten intolerance was evident at the metabolic level before the intestinal damage. Altered energy metabolism and lower cytoprotective activity (histidine, glycine, arginine) indicated vulnerability to develop intestinal inflammation in PCeD over time. Our study may provide an insight into early biochemical processes of the progression of PCeD to CeD.

AB  - Background One anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) is now one of the mainstream bariatric surgical procedures with proven safety and efficacy. However, data on the gastrointestinal quality of life following OAGB is lacking.
   Methods This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database, performed at a single tertiary care teaching hospital from January 2016 until March 2021. All patients undertook the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire. GIQLI was correlated with various parameters. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess the importance of each question in the questionnaire and devise a "Mini GIQLI score".
   Results A total of 60 patients were included. The %TWL at 3 and 5 years was 26.2 +/- 11.9%, 31.7 +/- 11 respectively. The mean weight regain was 5.6 +/- 8.5 kg. The mean GIQLI score was 125 +/- 13.1. The mean scores for questions pertaining to gastrointestinal, social, psychological, and physical domains were 3.49, 3.7, 3.45, and 3.27 respectively. Scree plot of principal component analysis showed that a new score ("Mini GIQLI") combining only 5 questions had good correlation with the overall GIQOL score (r = 0.842). The five questions related to anxiety, fatigue, feeling unwell, loss of endurance, and feeling unfit.
   Conclusions Patients report a good score on GIQLI assessment following OAGB. The Mini GIQLI score is a quicker tool with good correlation to the full-length GIQLI score.

AB  - Background Inflammation plays an important role in all the stages of atherosclerotic plaque development. The current study aimed at assessing the altered expression of genes functioning in inflammation within the early stage (ES) and advanced stage (AS) atherosclerotic plaques obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and identifying biomarker panel/s that may detect the status of plaque stages using peripheral blood samples. Methods A section of ES and AS plaques and normal left internal mammary arteries (LIMA) were obtained from 8 patients undergoing the CABG surgery. Total RNA isolated was analyzed for mRNA and miRNA expression profile by Affymetrix arrays. A significant number of mRNAs was found to be differentially expressed in ES and AS plaque tissues relative to LIMA. The pathway analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs in the two plaque stages was also performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Database. Results The mRNAs were found to be involved in critical inflammatory processes such as the toll-like receptor signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Few miRNAs targeting these mRNAs were also altered in the two plaque conditions. QRT-PCR results showed a similar expression pattern of a few of the mRNAs and miRNAs in peripheral blood of the same patients relative to healthy controls. Conclusion Changes in mRNA and miRNA expression associated with various inflammatory processes occur in different atherosclerotic stage plaques as well as peripheral blood. Detection of such variations in patients' blood can be used as a possible prognostic tool to detect and/or predict the risk and stage of atherosclerosis.

AB  - Nitinol is a versatile alloy known for its shape memory effect and thus finds multiple applications in biomedical devices and implants. The biomedical applications of nitinol-based devices are, however, limited because of concerns related to leaching and its associated cytotoxicity. In particular, nitinol nanoparticles (NPs), despite being highly promising for biomedical applications such as nano-actuators and biomolecular delivery agents are not explored, owing to the same concerns. Moreover, nitinol nanoparticles and their biological interactions are not fully characterized, and the available literature on their toxicity portrays a divided picture. Surface passivation of nitinol using multiple methods has been explored in the past to reduce the leaching of nickel in implants while also improving the thrombogenic properties. In this work, we reported the preparation of passivized nitinol NPs by laser ablation of nitinol targets, followed by different surface treatments. The effect of different treatments in reducing nickel leaching and its influence on biocompatibility were studied. The biocompatibility and multi-faceted interaction of nitinol NPs with osteoblast cells and associated toxicity were explored. Homogenous nitinol NPs were found to be generated at 25 W of laser power. Also, surface modification using hydrogen peroxide, anodization, and acid etching was found to be effective in waning the nickel leaching and improving biocompatibility. In view of the observed results of cellular interactions, we discussed the possible routes of cellular toxicity of these NPs. The prospective applications of such passivized NPs in the biomedical field are also discussed in this work.

AB  - Introduction: Viruses are known to significantly affect global health and are the leading cause of death worldwide as evident from numerous virus epidemics/ pandemics in the present and past. Though there are several antiviral therapies for human health care, only a few of them have significant therapeutic efficacy. The high costs of synthetic antiviral drugs, the rapid emergence of resistance, and the related side effects, are important challenges faced in anti-viral therapies. Traditional Indian Medicine (TIM) has a major advantage over modern medicine with their wider therapeutic window and rare side effects. The phytochemicals from the plants have shown strong inhibition of many viral infections.Method: In the present study, the TIM plants in the classical codified texts of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homoeopathy, Sowa Rigpa (AYUSH) and plant repository of the National Innovation Foundation -India (NIF) database was reviewed to explore plants that have sufficient scientific experimental data demonstrating efficacy against different viruses. Fifteen years of literature presenting different treatment options available for control of viral infections was reviewed.Result: It was found that reducing inflammation, enhancing immunity, and disrupting viral infection cycle were useful strategies for combating acute viral infections. In this paper, the authors suggest an integrative strategy of incorporating TIM plants in preventive healthcare that may act as the first line of defence against acute viral infections.Conclusion: Development of an effective polyherbal formulation from a combination of potent TLR antagonists (anti-inflammatory), immuno-modulators, antivirals, and herbs that are rich source of micronutrients (especially Vitamin C and Zn) can act as a preventive strategy for a wide range of viral infections.

AB  - Lithium fluoride (LiF) is one of the best tissue equivalent materials exhibiting good thermoluminescence (TL) properties, however it shows weak optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) response with blue light (470 nm) stimulation. Several research groups are working on improving the OSL properties of LiF phosphor. In an attempt, a thorough investigation on tissue equivalent LiF: Mg,Cu,Na,Si (MCNS) as a possible OSL material has been done in the current work. As the preparation route and particle size can modify the energy levels and optical transitions, the striking improvement is expected by preparing it in nanocrystalline form. The structural and morphological characterization has been done using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The OSL emission is observed in continuous wave mode under blue (460 nm) light stimulation. The OSL decay curve exhibits a significant increase in intensity which is ~2 times higher than LiF based commercial phosphor (TLD-100) irradiated with gamma dose of 0.1 Gy. The phosphor shows a linear dose response in the range of 0.1-20 Gy with almost constant decay rate. The phosphor has shown low residual signal which is good for its repetitive use. The OSL decay curve has been analysed and related parameters such as photoionization cross-section and decay constant are determined. ESR study has been done to identify the defect centres and describing the role of point defects and charge compensators involved in the luminescence process. This reveals the existence of Cu in Cu+ or Cu0 state. Good OSL properties suggests MCNS phosphor has a potential as a OSL dosimeter. The current study adds new knowledge and opens a new window to improve the OSL sensitivity of LiF material.

AB  - Background Pulpotomy is an effective, vital pulp therapy procedure for caries-affected or traumatized primary teeth. Though its efficacy is widely accepted, the superiority of medicaments and techniques remains debatable. Aim The aims of this review were to compare the success rates of various pulpotomy medicaments or techniques, assess the methodological quality of reviews, and grade the level of evidence for each comparison. Design This review followed the principles of evidence-based medicine and recommendations for the overview of systematic reviews. An a priori protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42021244489). A comprehensive literature search was performed by two reviewers, and studies were selected from various databases according to predefined criteria. Two reviewers independently used a self-designed pilot-tested form to extract data from the selected studies. A quality analysis was performed using A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) and the ROBIS tool. Reporting characteristics and overlap of the primary studies were also assessed. We used modified Kohler's criteria for evaluating the quality of evidence for outcomes of included systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Results The scrutiny of 62 full-text articles resulted in the inclusion of eight systematic reviews. The quality of four of the reviews was found to be critically low, and the overlap of primary studies in the meta-analyses was found to be high. Pulpotomy medicaments/techniques, except calcium hydroxide, had success rates of more than 80% for all domains and time periods. Most of the comparisons revealed no differences in the clinical, radiographic, or overall success rates. Mineral trioxide aggregate, however, was found to have better radiographic and overall success rates than calcium hydroxide at periods greater than 12 and 18 months. It also had a greater radiographic success rate than full-strength/1:5 diluted and full-strength formocresol at 24 months. Formocresol was found to have better overall success rates than calcium hydroxide at all time periods and better radiographic success rates at 12 months. Only 12 of the 63 comparisons had suggestive or weak evidence, whereas all others had either negligible evidence or insufficient data. Conclusions The pulpotomy medicaments/techniques, except calcium hydroxide, showed success rates of more than 80%, whereas most comparisons revealed no differences. Mineral trioxide aggregate, however, was found to be better than calcium hydroxide and formocresol in several respects. This study highlights the lack of evidence regarding the choice of pulpotomy agents for the treatment of caries-affected primary teeth and elucidates the domains that require primary studies in the future.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the remodeling of visceral arteries post-endovascular repair (TEVAR) of type B aortic dissection and to investigate interval change in renal volume and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) vis-a-vis baseline visceral artery morphology. Materials and Methods All patients of type B aortic dissection who underwent TEVAR with a baseline and follow-up CT during the study period were included. Baseline morphology of visceral arteries (celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric artery and bilateral renal artery) were classified into 7 patterns depending upon the origin of the artery (from true/false lumen) and the extension of dissection flap, while occluded vessels were categorized as pattern 8. Results One hundred and thirty-two branches were analyzed in 25 patients (23 males; mean age: 50.1 years) with a mean follow-up of 386 days. 51 visceral branches were arising from the true lumen without any stenosis. Of the remaining 81 branches, 48 showed favorable remodeling (P = .0001). The highest incidence of favorable remodeling was observed in arteries arising from the true lumen (pattern 2,3: 44/48; 91.6%) whereas only one thrombosed and artery arising from the false lumen each (pattern 5 and 8) showed favorable remodeling. Kidneys perfused by false lumen or occluded renal artery suffered statistically significant volume loss compared to kidneys perfused by true or both lumens (-16.5% vs .2%; P = .01); however, the change in eGFR failed to reach statistical significance. Conclusion Visceral arteries arising from the true lumen are more likely to undergo favorable remodeling. The kidneys supplied by false lumen or by occluded renal artery suffer significantly more volume loss after TEVAR.

AB  - Background The role of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) in improving muscle mass in cirrhosis is presently debatable. Aims To evaluate the role of BCAA in improving muscle mass in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. Methods Consecutive patients with cirrhosis with Child-Pugh score < 10 and sarcopenia were randomized to receive either 12 g/day of BCAA orally or a placebo (1:1) for 6 months in addition to a home-based exercise program (30 min/day), dietary counselling and standard medical therapy. Sarcopenia was defined according to gender-specific axial skeletal muscle index (SMI) cut-offs. The primary endpoint was a change in muscle mass based on CT scan (SMI) after 6 months of supplementation. Results Sixty patients [mean age 41.6 +/- 9.9 years; males (66.6%) of predominantly viral (40%) and alcohol-related (31.7%) cirrhosis] were randomized. Baseline clinical and demographic characters were similar except MELD score (10.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 12.2 +/- 3.5, p = 0.02) and calorie intake (1838.1 kcal +/- 631.5 vs. 2217.5 kcal +/- 707.3, p = 0.03), both being higher in the placebo arm. After adjusting for both baseline confounders, baseline SMI and protein intake, the change in SMI at 6 months was similar in both groups [mean adjusted difference (MAD) + 0.84, CI - 2.9; + 1.2, p = 0.42] by intention-to-treat analysis. The secondary outcomes including change in handgrip strength (p = 0.65), 6-m gait speed (p = 0.20), 6-min walk distance (p = 0.39) were similar in both arms. Four patients had minor adverse events in each arm. Conclusion Addition of BCAA to exercise, dietary counselling and standard medical therapy did not improve muscle mass in patients with cirrhosis having sarcopenia. (CTRI/2019/05/019269).

AB  - Background Few data on the management of acute phase of traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) in patients suffering polytrauma are available. As the therapeutic choices in the first hours may have a deep impact on outcome of tSCI patients, we conducted an international survey investigating this topic. Methods The survey was composed of 29 items. The main endpoints of the survey were to examine: (1) the hemodynamic and respiratory management, (2) the coagulation management, (3) the timing of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spinal surgery, (4) the use of corticosteroid therapy, (5) the role of intraspinal pressure (ISP)/spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP) monitoring and (6) the utilization of therapeutic hypothermia. Results There were 171 respondents from 139 centers worldwide. A target mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of 80-90 mmHg was chosen in almost half of the cases [n = 84 (49.1%)]. A temporary reduction in the target MAP, for the time strictly necessary to achieve bleeding control in polytrauma, was accepted by most respondents [n = 100 (58.5%)]. Sixty-one respondents (35.7%) considered acceptable a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 7 g/dl in tSCI polytraumatized patients. An arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 80-100 mmHg [n = 94 (55%)] and an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of 35-40 mmHg [n = 130 (76%)] were chosen in most cases. A little more than half of respondents considered safe a platelet (PLT) count > 100.000/mm(3) [n = 99 (57.9%)] and prothrombin time (PT)/activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) < 1.5 times the normal control [n = 85 (49.7%)] in patients needing spinal surgery. MRI [n = 160 (93.6%)] and spinal surgery [n = 158 (92.4%)] should be performed after intracranial, hemodynamic, and respiratory stabilization by most respondents. Corticosteroids [n = 103 (60.2%)], ISP/SCPP monitoring [n = 148 (86.5%)], and therapeutic hypothermia [n = 137 (80%)] were not utilized by most respondents. Conclusions Our survey has shown a great worldwide variability in clinical practices for acute phase management of tSCI patients with polytrauma. These findings can be helpful to define future research in order to optimize the care of patients suffering tSCI.

AB  - POEMS syndrome, a rare plasma cell disorder, is challenging both in the diagnostic and therapeutic management. We present real word retrospective analysis of 108 cases analyzing clinical features and therapeutic modes. We compare our results with the available literature. This is the first description with such wide use of proteasome inhibitors in first line treatment. POEMS (Polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes) syndrome is a rare and challenging plasma cell disorder, both in the diagnostic and therapeutic management of the disease. Currently, the literature on POEMS is sparse with most evidence being case reports and small case studies. We present a retrospective real world experience of 108 patients with POEMS. We analyzed the clinical features and therapeutic interventions. Regarding clinical features, our findings demonstrated that skin lesions, thrombocythemia and polycythemia were present less frequently than reported previously. Regarding clinical interventions, this is one of the largest analyses of front line treatment in POEMS and the first one to include frequent utilization of proteasome inhibitors (37%). Bortezomib monotherapy was the most effective therapy achieving complete remission/very good partial remissions (CR/VGPR) in 69% of patients. Thirty percent of patients proceeded to planned autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) as part of the front-line treatment resulting in statistically superior progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to non-ASCT treated patients (P=.003). In multivariate analysis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and as age over 60 were associated with a negative impact on patient outcomes. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome are rare genetically and clinically heterogenous brain development disorders. Several exonic/splicing mutations are reported for these disorders to date, but similar to 40% of all cases remain unexplained. We aimed to uncover the genetic correlate(s) in a family of multiple siblings with microcephaly. A novel homozygous intronic variant (NC_000013.10:g.25459823T>C) in CENPJ (13q12) segregating with all four affected male siblings was identified by exome sequencing and validated by targeted linkage approach (logarithm of the odds score 1.8 at theta 0.0). RT-PCR of CENPJ in affected siblings using their EBV derived cell lines showed aberrant transcripts suggestive of exon skipping confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Significantly reduced wild type transcript/protein in the affected siblings having the splice variant indicates a leaky gene expression of pathological relevance. Based on known CENPJ function, assessing for mitotic alterations revealed defect in centrosome duplication causing mono/multicentrosome(s) at prophase, delayed metaphase, and unequal chromosomal segregation in patient cells. Clinical features witnessed in this study expand the spectrum of CENPJ-associated primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome. Furthermore, besides the importance of regulatory variants in classical monogenic disorders these findings provide new insights into splice site biology with possible implications for ASO-based therapies.

AB  - The diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis (aTB) is challenging and there is an urgent need for an accurate diagnostic test. We have developed a high affinity DNA aptamer against GlcB antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We further compared the diagnostic utility of in-house-generated high affinity DNA aptamers and polyclonal antibodies against two Mtb antigens, namely GlcB and HspX, in ascitic fluid samples. These diagnostic reagents were assessed in patients (n = 94) who were categorized as 'Definite TB', 'Probable TB', 'Possible TB' (taken together as aTB) and 'Non-TB' disease. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to derive cut-off values to provide >= 93% specificity. Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) for HspX and GlcB exhibited a sensitivity of similar to 84% and 50%, respectively (p-value <0.01). In contrast, antibody-based ELISA exhibited a lower sensitivity of similar to 18% and similar to 28% for HspX and GlcB, respectively (p-value <0.0001 and p = 0.05 for HspX and GlcB ELISA vs. ALISA, respectively). HspX ALISA detected 32/38 aTB cases, while Xpert detected only 9 samples. In conclusion, HspX aptamer-based test was found to be superior to the other tests for diagnosing aTB and it nearly fulfils the sensitivity criteria of WHO's 'Target Product Profile' for extrapulmonary tuberculosis (sensitivity >= 80%, specificity 98%).

KW  - THERAPY
AB  - Procalcitonin (PCT) is one of the best validated biomarkers in the management of sepsis. However, its prognostic utility remains poorly studied. The present study sought to assess the prognostic utility of serial PCT assessments in patients with sepsis, and to compare the prognostic predictive capability of serial measurements of PCT with conventional markers of inflammation and validated intensive care unit (ICU) severity scoring systems. We recruited consecutive patients admitted to the medical units of a tertiary care center with suspected or proven bacterial infection and sepsis. Measurement of serum PCT levels, inflammatory markers, and ICU severity scores were performed at admission and repeated every 48 hours subsequently for the duration of hospital stay. 99 patients with bacterial infection and sepsis were recruited and followed until death or discharge. Median serum PCT level was similar between survivors and non-survivors on day 1, but was significantly lower at days 3, 5 and 7 in the survivors. The analysis found Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE IV) score on all days (1, 3, 5, and 7), PCT on days 5 and 7, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at 24 hours to have good predictive accuracy for adverse patient outcome. PCT clearance on days 3 and 5 of admission was measured and demonstrated predictive accuracy comparable to day-matched APACHE IV scores. While serial levels of serum PCT in patients with sepsis are accurate in the prediction of adverse patient outcome, they do not offer any additional clinical benefit over existing severity of illness scores and may be cost prohibitive in resource-limited settings.

AB  - Importance: Carboplatin increases the pathological complete remission (pCR) rate in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) when added to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, however, evidence on its effect on survival outcomes is controversial.
   Methods: The study was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (CRD42021228386).
   We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials, and conference proceedings from January 1, 2004 to January 30, 2022 for relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients, with carboplatin in the intervention arm and standard anthracycline taxane (AT) in the control arm. PRISMA guidelines were used for this review. Data were pooled using fixed and random effects models as appropriate on extracted hazard ratios (HR). Individual patient data (IPD)for disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted from published survival curves of included RCTs; DFS and OS curves for each trial and the combined population were reconstructed, and HR estimated. The primary outcome was DFS; OS, pCR, and toxicity were secondary outcomes.
   Results: Eight trials with 2425 patients were included. Carboplatin improved DFS (HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.78; I-2 45%, p < 0.001) compared with AT at trial level and IPD level (HR 0.66; 95%CI, 0.55 to 0.80, p < 0.001) analysis. The OS also improved with carboplatin at both trial level (HR 0.69, 95%CI 0.50 to 0.95, I-2 41%, p = 0.02) and IPD level (HR 0.68; 95%CI, 0.54 to 0.87, p = 0.002) analysis. The pCR as expected, was better in the carboplatin arm (OR 2.11; 95% CI = 1.44-3.08; I-2 67%, p = 0.009). Anaemia and thrombocytopaenia were higher in the carboplatin arm.
   Conclusion: and relevance: Carboplatin added to (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC improves survival, as shown in both trial level and IPD analysis.

AB  - Thymic carcinomas are rare malignancies that in general arise in the prevascular (anterior) mediastinum. These tumors are usually invasive, often present at advanced stages, and typically behave aggressively. Studies are hampered by the paucity of these tumors, the large variety of carcinoma subtypes, and the lack of unique morphologic and immunophenotypic features. Despite these challenges, advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical approaches, systemic therapies, and radiation therapy techniques have been made. The WHO classification of thymic epithelial tumors has been updated in 2021, and the eighth tumor nodal metastasis staging by the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control included thymic carcinomas in 2017. Molecular alterations that provide more insight into the pathogenesis of these tumors and that potentially permit use of novel targeted therapies are increasingly being identified. New approaches to radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are under evaluation. International societies, including the International Thymic Malignancy Interest Group, European Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Japanese, Chinese, and Korean thymic associations, have been critical in organizing and conducting multi-institutional clinical studies. Herein, we review contemporary multidisciplinary perspectives in diagnosis and management of thymic carcinoma.(c) 2022 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

TI  - Effect of intensive weight-loss intervention on metabolic, ultrasound and anthropometric parameters among patients with obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an RCT
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION

KW  - STAGE
AB  - Background Lifestyle intervention is the mainstay therapy for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). We aimed to assess the efficacy of an intensive (9 contact points in 6 months) weight-loss intervention among patients with obesity (BMI 25-39.9 kg/m(2)) and NAFLD in north India. Methods A total of 140 patients (18-60 years) with obesity and NAFLD were randomized into intervention (n = 70) and control (n = 70) groups, at a tertiary-care hospital. Weight, anthropometric parameters, Controlled Attenuation Parameter (CAP), Liver Stiffness Measurement (LSM), liver enzymes, grade of fatty liver and HOMA-IR were measured at baseline (T-0) and 6 months (T-6). There was a high drop-out, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. Completers comprised of 59 participants (n = 30 intervention, n = 29 control). Intention to treat analysis was done. Results At T-6, ALT normalized in significantly higher (p = 0.03) number of cases in the intervention arm (66.7%) versus control arm (18.2%). No significant improvement was seen in other metabolic, ultrasound or anthropometric outcomes. Weight (p < 0.001), AST (p = 0.01), ALT (p = 0.02), body fat% (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001) and CAP (p < 0.001) significantly improved within the intervention arm along with a trend of improvement in steatosis and HOMA-IR. Control group showed significant decrease in weight (p < 0.001), WC (p < 0.001) and CAP (p = 0.02). Twice the number of patients in intervention arm (46.7%) lost >= 5% weight, compared to control arm (24.1%) (p = 0.07). Conclusion The intensive weight-loss intervention was not effective in improving the treatment outcomes among patients with obesity and NAFLD. However, given the potential of our intervention, we recommend larger trials with more intensive weight-loss interventions.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the autonomic function in specific learning disorder (SLD) and comorbid SLD attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (SLD-ADHD). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital with 20 adolescent subjects each of confirmed SLD, SLD-ADHD, and healthy control (mean age 15.32 y). Heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests were carried out using standard protocols. Results Heart-rate variability parameters, viz., mean RR interval, number of RR intervals which differ by >= 50 ms (NN50), percentage NN50, standard deviation of differences between adjacent RR intervals, root square of mean of the sum of the squares of differences between adjacent RR intervals, coefficient of variance and absolute power of high-frequency band (HF) recorded apparently lower levels in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control indicating lower parasympathetic tone. Whereas, higher absolute power of low- frequency band (LF) in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated enhanced sympathetic activity. Higher LF/HF and lower SD1/SD2 ratios in SLD and SLD-ADHD than healthy control indicated higher sympathetic tone over parasympathetic tone. Values of autonomic-function tests such as E:I ratio, change in heart rate during deep-breathing test, 30:15 ratio, and Valsalva ratio showed a decrease in SLD and SLD-ADHD as compared to healthy control implying reduction in parasympathetic reactivity. Increased values for rise in diastolic blood pressure in the isometric handgrip test and cold pressor test recorded in SLD as compared to healthy control, revealed the increased sympathetic reactivity. Conclusion Overall, results of heart-rate variability and autonomic-function tests imply dysregulation of sympathetic and parasympathetic activities with sympathetic dominance in SLD and SLD-ADHD.
