AB  - The study was designed to review the demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics of follicular helper T cells (TFH)-derived nodal PTCL in India including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with follicular helper T cell phenotype (P-TFH), and follicular T-cell lymphoma with additional immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RHOAG17V mutational analysis, as well as their impact on survival. This retrospective study included 88 cases of PTCL that were reclassified using IHC for TFH markers (PD1, ICOS, BCL6, and CD10) and dendritic-meshwork markers (CD21, CD23). Cases of TFH cell origin were evaluated for RHOAG17V mutation using Sanger sequencing and amplification-refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (validated using cloning and quantitative PCR) with detailed clinicopathologic correlation. Extensive re-evaluation with added IHC panel resulted in a total of 19 cases being reclassified, and the final subtypes were AITL (37 cases, 42%), PTCL-not otherwise specified (44, 50%), P-TFH (6, 7%), and follicular T-cell lymphoma (1, 1%). The presence of at least 2 TFH markers (>20% immunopositivity) determined the TFH origin. AITL patients tended to be male and showed increased presence of B-symptoms and hepatosplenomegaly. Histomorphology revealed that 92% of AITL cases had pattern 3 involvement. Sanger sequencing with conventional PCR did not yield any mutation, while RHOAG17V was detected by amplification-refractory mutation system-PCR in AITL (51%, P =0.027) and P-TFH (17%), which was validated with cloning followed by sequencing. Cases of RHOAG17V-mutant AITL had a worse Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status initially but fared better in terms of overall outcome ( P =0.029). Although not specific for AITL, RHOAG17V mutation shows an association with diagnosis and requires sensitive methods for detection due to low-tumor burden. The mutant status of AITL could have prognostic implications and translational relevance.

AB  - Introduction: 
          South Asia has noted an increasing prevalence of obesity and employment of bariatric surgery (BS) procedures. Prior studies have shown improvement in memory, executive function and attention, after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) operation in the Western population. However, there is a scarcity of data on cognitive improvement following BS in a non-Western population.
          Objective: 
          The objective of the study is to evaluate changes in cognitive functions of patients with severe obesity, after BS.
          Study Setting: 
          Tertiary-care Academic Center, India.
          Methodology: 
          A prospective study of patients undergoing BS was conducted. Specific neurocognitive tests (Mini-mental Status Examination, Standard progressive matrices, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, and Post Graduate Institute Memory Scale test) were used to assess cognitive status at baseline (preoperatively), and at 3, 6, and 12 months.
          Results: 
          Fifty-three patients were enrolled in the study, out of which 50 had completed 1 year of follow-up at the time of analysis (n = 50). Thirty-six patients (72%) were females. The median age was 42 years, and the mean preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 45.5 ± 6.3 kg/m2. 40 patients underwent SG, while 10 underwent RYGB procedure. At baseline, the study cohort had impairment of abstract reasoning, attention, and verbal retention, as compared to normative data. At 1 year after surgery, the mean BMI was 29.1 ± 2.6 kg/m2. There was a significant (P < 0.05) improvement in most cognitive domains (global cognitive functioning, abstract reasoning, attention/concentration, and memory function). However, improvement in language function was not found to be significant across the follow-up duration of 12 months (P = 0.35).
          Conclusions: 
          Individuals with severe obesity experience baseline impairment in cognitive functions. Similar to results from the Western population, BS (RYGB and SG) results in a significant improvement in multiple cognitive domains even in a non-Western population.

AB  - To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that manifest lung abnormalities during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of lung autopsies from 31 patients with severe COVID-19 and ten uninfected controls. Using metatranscriptomics, we identified the existence of two distinct molecular signatures of lethal COVID-19. The dominant 'classical' signature (n=23) showed upregulation of the unfolded protein response, steroid biosynthesis and complement activation, supported by massive metabolic reprogramming leading to characteristic lung damage. The rarer signature (n=8) that potentially represents 'cytokine release syndrome' (CRS) showed upregulation of cytokines such as IL1 and CCL19, but absence of complement activation. We found that a majority of patients cleared SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they suffered from acute dysbiosis with characteristic enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Staphylococcus cohnii in 'classical' patients and Pasteurella multocida in CRS patients. Our results suggest two distinct models of lung pathology in severe COVID-19 patients, which can be identified through complement activation, presence of specific cytokines and characteristic microbiome. These findings can be used to design personalized therapy using in silico identified drug molecules or in mitigating specific secondary infections.

TI  - Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount, geography, age, sex, and year: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2020
AU  - GBD 2020 Alcohol Collaborators
T2  - Lancet (London, England)
AB  - BACKGROUND: The health risks associated with moderate alcohol consumption continue to be debated. Small amounts of alcohol might lower the risk of some health outcomes but increase the risk of others, suggesting that the overall risk depends, in part, on background disease rates, which vary by region, age, sex, and year.
METHODS: For this analysis, we constructed burden-weighted dose-response relative risk curves across 22 health outcomes to estimate the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) and non-drinker equivalence (NDE), the consumption level at which the health risk is equivalent to that of a non-drinker, using disease rates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2020 for 21 regions, including 204 countries and territories, by 5-year age group, sex, and year for individuals aged 15-95 years and older from 1990 to 2020. Based on the NDE, we quantified the population consuming harmful amounts of alcohol.
FINDINGS: The burden-weighted relative risk curves for alcohol use varied by region and age. Among individuals aged 15-39 years in 2020, the TMREL varied between 0 (95% uncertainty interval 0-0) and 0·603 (0·400-1·00) standard drinks per day, and the NDE varied between 0·002 (0-0) and 1·75 (0·698-4·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals aged 40 years and older, the burden-weighted relative risk curve was J-shaped for all regions, with a 2020 TMREL that ranged from 0·114 (0-0·403) to 1·87 (0·500-3·30) standard drinks per day and an NDE that ranged between 0·193 (0-0·900) and 6·94 (3·40-8·30) standard drinks per day. Among individuals consuming harmful amounts of alcohol in 2020, 59·1% (54·3-65·4) were aged 15-39 years and 76·9% (73·0-81·3) were male.
INTERPRETATION: There is strong evidence to support recommendations on alcohol consumption varying by age and location. Stronger interventions, particularly those tailored towards younger individuals, are needed to reduce the substantial global health loss attributable to alcohol.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Obesity is a rising pandemic in childhood. There is scarcity of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in achieving weight loss in overweight/obese children. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of family-based comprehensive yoga intervention in the reduction of body mass index (BMI) in overweight/obese children, in comparison to standard dietary and lifestyle counselling and control group.
METHODS: This was an open-label randomized controlled study. Children aged 8-15 yr who were overweight or had obesity were randomized to one of the three arms for 18 wk; standard weight management (group 1), yoga with dietary modification (group 2) and control (no intervention; group 3). Reduction in BMI and improvement in physiological, biochemical and psychological parameters from baseline to 18 wk was compared between the three arms. Late follow up was also done at 6-12 months.
RESULTS: A total of 165 children with mean±standard deviation (SD) age of 11.6±1.8 yr and mean BMI 26.3±4.2 kg/m2 were enrolled. Outcome analysis at 18 wk was performed for 109 children. Improved diet quality and reduced intake were observed in both intervention arms. The median (IQR) reduction in BMI in standard and yoga arms was similar [-1.4 (-3.1, -0.5) kg/m2 and -1.2 (-2.3, -0.6) kg/m2, respectively], while it increased by +0.3 (-0.3, 0.1) in the control arm. In the yoga arm, mean systolic BP reduced from 118 (10) to 114 (8) mmHg, (P=0.019). In the standard arm, significant improvement in psychological scores was noted. In group 3, the mean fasting glucose increased from 93±10 to 102±12 mg/dl (P<0.001).
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that yoga in conjunction with dietary modification is equally effective as the standard weight management for BMI reduction in the paediatric age group.

DESIGN: Mixed method study. Questionnaires were developed using 5 steps: item generation by literature review and preexisting questionnaires, expert evaluation, pilot testing, factor analysis, and internal consistency.
SETTING: Adults with obesity recruited via web-based survey hyperlink.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred participants with a mean body mass index of 28.7 ± 4.4 kg/m2.
VARIABLES MEASURED: The questionnaires were generated using 221 items. Establishing content, face and construct validity, and internal consistency.
ANALYSIS: Content validity was analyzed using content validity index and content validity ratio, internal consistency through Cronbach α (CA), and structural validity by factor analysis via principal varimax rotation.
RESULTS: All three questionnaires had good content validity. The Behavioral Predictor Questionnaire had good internal consistency (CA, 0.7) and excellent structural validity (69.7%). Psychosocial Predictors Questionnaire (CA, 0.8, 67.5%) and Environmental Predictors Questionnaire (CA: 0.8, 72.2%) had excellent internal consistency and structural validity.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION: Questionnaires seem to be practical, valid, and reliable tools for baseline assessment of individual-specific factors related to weight loss success.

AB  - Acanthamoeba is a rare cause of granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) associated with high mortality. There have been few case reports of Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis worldwide. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe hyperinflammatory condition caused by abnormally active macrophages and cytotoxic T lymphocytes; its secondary form is due to infections or malignancies. However, HLH is rather an unknown complication of GAE. We describe an unusual and previously unreported case of Acanthamoeba meningoencephalitis in a young immunocompetent female culminating in secondary HLH.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There have been 214 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with a total death tally of 4.4 million. The current study aims to determine the predictive value of various scores in the assessment of progression of mild COVID-19 infection at a tertiary care hospital in North India.
METHODS: The study population consisted of adults (age more than 18 years) with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal specimens. Patients with only mild illness were enrolled. After the patients were admitted to the isolation ward, the presenting history, comorbidity status, vital signs and laboratory parameters were recorded. The 3 and 6 minutes walk test was performed daily from admission till discharge or progression of the severity of COVID- 19, and it was used to calculate Borg Dyspnoea Score (BDS) and National Early Warning Score (NEWS2) scores.
RESULTS: Our study consisted of 50 patients with 34 (68%) males, and the mean (SD) age of the patient population was 28.1 (6.4) years. The most common symptoms were fever, sore throat, and cough. All laboratory parameters were within normal ranges for all the patients. 96% recovered without progression, while only 4% of them progressed to moderate illness. Results of the 3 and 6 minutes walk tests, BDS and NEWS2 scores showed improvement over the course of the hospital stay.
CONCLUSION: Although the walk tests and the scores improved over time, they failed to predict the disease progression.

AB  - Preoperative ultrasound assessment of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter and the collapsi-bility index might identify patients with intravascular volume depletion. The purpose of this review was to gather the existing evidence to find out whether preoperative IVC ultrasound (IVCUS) derived parameters can reliably predict hypotension after spinal or general anaesthesia. PubMed was searched to identify research articles that addressed the role of IVC ultrasound in predicting hypotension after spinal and general anaesthesia in adult patients. We included 4 randomized control trials and 17 observational studies in our final review. Among these, 15 studies involved spinal anaesthesia and 6 studies involved general anaesthesia. Heterogeneity with respect to the patient populations under evaluation, definitions used for hypotension after anaesthesia, IVCUS assessment methods, and cut-off values for IVCUS-derived parameters to predict hypotension precluded pooled meta-analysis. The maximum and minimum reported sensitivity of the IVC collapsibility index (IVCCI) for predicting post-spinal hypotension was 84.6% and 58.8% respectively, while the maximum and minimum specificities were 93.1% and 23.5% respectively. For the prediction of hypotension after general anaesthesia induction, the reported ranges of sensitivity and specificity of IVCCI were 86.67% to 45.5% and 94.29% to 77.27%, respectively. Current literature on the predictive role of IVCUS for hypotension after anaesthesia is heterogeneous both in methodology and in results. Standardization of the definition of hypotension under anaesthesia, method of IVCUS assessment, and the cut-offs for IVC diameter and the collapsibility index for prediction of hypotension after anaesthesia are necessary for drawing clinically relevant conclusions.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the long-term outcomes of biventricular, univentricular, and so-called one-and-one-half ventricular repairs in patients with left and right isomerism. Methods: Surgical correction was undertaken, between 2000 and 2021, in 198 patients with right, and 233 with left isomerism. Results: The median age at operation was 24 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 18-45) and 60 days (IQR: 29-360) for those with right and left isomerism, respectively. Multidetector computed-tomographic angiocardiography demonstrated more than half of those with right isomerism had superior caval venous abnormalities, and one-third had a functionally univentricular heart. Almost four-fifths of those with left isomerism had an interrupted inferior caval vein, and one-third had complete atrioventricular septal defect. Biventricular repair was achieved in two-thirds of those with left isomerism, but under one-quarter with right isomerism (P < .001). Hazard regression for mortality revealed odds for prematurity at 5.5, pulmonary atresia at 2.81, atrioventricular septal defect with a common valvar orifice at 2.28, parachute mitral valve at 3.73, interrupted inferior caval vein at 0.53, and functionally univentricular heart with a totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection at 3.77. At a median follow-up of 124 months, the probability of survival was 87% for those with left, and 77% for those with right isomerism (P = .006). Conclusions: Multimodality imaging characterizes and delineates the relevant anatomical details, facilitating surgical management of individuals with isomeric atrial appendages. Continuing higher mortality despite surgical intervention in those with right isomerism points to the need for the reassessment of strategies for management.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: To review the anatomical details, diagnostic challenges, associated cardiovascular anomalies, and techniques and outcomes of management, including re-interventions, for the rare instances of transposition physiology with concordant ventriculo-arterial connections.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical and necropsy studies on diagnosis and surgical treatment of individuals with transposition physiology and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections, analyzing also individuals with comparable flow patterns in the setting of isomerism.
RESULTS: Among reported cases, just over two-thirds were diagnosed during surgery, after initial palliation, or after necropsy. Of the patients, four-fifths presented in infancy with either cyanosis or congestive cardiac failure, with complex associated cardiac malformations. Nearly half had ventricular septal defects, and one-fifth had abnormalities of the tricuspid valve, including hypoplasia of the morphologically right ventricle. A small minority had common atrioventricular junctions We included cases reported with isomerism when the flow patterns were comparable, although the atrioventricular connections are mixed in this setting. Management mostly involved construction of intraatrial baffles, along with correction of coexisting anomalies, either together or multistaged. Overall mortality was 25%, with one-fifth of patients requiring pacemakers for surgically-induced heart block. The majority of survivors were in good functional state.
CONCLUSIONS: The flow patterns produced by discordant atrioventricular and concordant ventriculo-arterial connections remain an important, albeit rare, indication for atrial redirection or hemi-Mustard's procedure with bidirectional Glenn. The procedure recruits the morphologically left ventricle in the systemic circuit, producing good long-term functional results. The approach can also be used for those with isomeric atrial appendages and comparable hemodynamic circuits.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We showed in our anatomical review, ventricular septal defects existing as multiple entities can be considered in terms of three major subsets. We address here the diagnostic challenges, associated anomalies, the role and techniques of surgical instead of interventional closure, and the outcomes, including reinterventions, for each subset.
METHODS: We reviewed 80 published investigations, noting radiographic findings, and the results of clinical imaging elucidating the location, number, size of septal defects, associated anomalies, and the effect of severe pulmonary hypertension.
RESULTS: Overall, perioperative mortality for treatment of residual multiple defects has been cited to be between 0% and 14.2%, with morbidity estimated between 6% and 13%. Perioperative mortality is twice as high for perimembranous compared to muscular defects, with the need for reoperation being over four times higher. Perventricular hybrid approaches are useful for the closure of high anterior or apical defects. Overall, the results have been unsatisfactory. Pooled data reveals incidences between 2.8% and 45% for device-related adverse events. Currently, however, outcomes cannot be assessed on the basis of the different anatomical subsets.
CONCLUSIONS: We have addressed the approaches, and the results, of therapeutic treatment in terms of coexisting discrete defects, the Swiss-cheese septum, and the arrangement in which a solitary apical muscular defect gives the impression of multiple defects when viewed from the right ventricular aspect. Treatment should vary according to the specific combination of defects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: We assessed the anatomical variations in coronary arterial patterns relative to the techniques of reimplantation in the setting of the arterial switch operation, relating the variations to influences on outcomes.
METHODS: We reviewed pertinent published investigations, assessing events reported following varied surgical techniques for reimplantation of the coronary arteries in the setting of the arterial switch procedure.
RESULTS: The prevalence of reported adverse events, subsequent to reimplantation, varied from 2% to 11%, with a bimodal presentation of high early and low late incidence. The intramural pattern continues to contribute to mortality, with some reports of 28% fatality. The presence of abnormal course relative to the arterial pedicles in the setting of single sinus origin was associated with a three-fold increase in mortality. Abnormal looping with bisinusal origin of arteries was not associated with increased risk.
CONCLUSION: The techniques of transfer of the coronary arteries can be individually adapted to cater for the anatomical variations. Cardiac surgeons, therefore, need to be familiar with the myriad creative options available to achieve successful repair when there is challenging anatomy. Long-term follow-up will be required to affirm the superiority of any specific individual technique. Detailed multiplanar computed-tomographic scanning can now reveal all the variants, and elucidate the mechanisms of late complications. Coronary angioplasty or surgical revascularization may be considered in selected cases subsequent to the switch procedure.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: On the basis of previously published accounts, coupled with our own experience, we have assessed the surgical approaches to patients with isomeric atrial appendages.
METHODS: We reviewed pertinent published studies on surgical treatment of individuals with isomeric atrial appendages, with the pertinent surgical details provided by most of the manuscripts.
RESULTS: Half of patients with right isomerism, and two-thirds of those with left isomerism have bilateral superior caval veins. Azygos extension of the inferior caval vein is reported in three-quarters of those with left isomerism. The coronary sinus is universally absent in right isomerism, along with totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and is absent in two-fifths of those with left isomerism. Univentricular atrioventricular connections are expected in up to three-quarters of those with right isomerism. Atrioventricular septal defect is reported in up to four-fifths, more frequently in right isomerism, with such patients typically having discordant ventriculoatrial connections or double outlet right ventricle. Reported mortalities extend to 85% for those with right, and 50% for those with left isomerism. In right isomerism, mortality is up to 54% for systemic-to-pulmonary arterial shunting, up to 75% for univentricular repair, and up to 95% for repair of totally anomalous pulmonary venous connection itself. No more than one-quarter had undergone Fontan completion, with reported mortalities of 21%.
CONCLUSION: Early surgical results are satisfactory in patients with left isomerism, but disappointing for those with right. Recent advances in cardiac and liver transplantation may offer improved survival.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT).
DESIGN: Parallel arm, single masked, randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: Sixty patients with ocular hypertension and IOP > 21 and < 30 mmHg were recruited at a tertiary eye care centre in India. Thirty patients (group 1) underwent six weeks of one hour daily MBSR sessions, while the other 30 patients (group 2) were waitlisted and kept on follow-up. The primary outcome was change in IOP (ΔIOP) after six weeks of MBSR. Secondary outcomes were effect on serum cortisol level, diurnal variation of IOP, vessel perfusion and vessel density on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and quality of life (QOL).
RESULTS: At six weeks, a significant decrease in IOP was noted in group 1 (23.05 ± 1.17 to 19.15 ± 1.45 mmHg; P = .001) compared with group 2 (22.55 ± 0.98 mmHg to 22.37 ± 1.07 mmHg; P = .107). The ΔIOP was significantly greater in group 1 (3.93 ± 1.47) than group 2 (0.17 ± 0.58; P = .001). The diurnal fluctuation of IOP decreased in group 1 (4.87 ± 1.13 mmHg to 2.73 ± 0.98 mmHg; P = .001) as compared with group 2 (4.50 ± 0.86 mmHg to 4.30 ± 0.83 mmHg; P = .227). Significant improvement in vessel perfusion, vessel density, and flux index was noted on OCTA in group 1 compared with group 2. Group 1 showed a significant decrease (P ≤ .001) in serum cortisol level and an improved QOL (P = .001).
CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-based stress reduction was associated with a significant decrease in IOP and serum cortisol, along with an improvement in optic nerve head perfusion and QOL. Mindfulness-based stress reduction can be considered as a potential treatment option in the management of OHT.

T2  - Journal of Ophthalmic & Vision Research
AB  - Trabeculectomy remains the most commonly performed surgery for medically uncontrolled glaucoma. Its success in primary open angle glaucoma is approximately 82% in the initial year after surgery and 64% at the end of five years. Lower success rates have been found in secondary glaucomas like neovascular glucoma, uvietic glaucoma, post-traumatic glaucoma, and for repeat surgeries. To illustrate improvement of the efficacy of trabeculectomy, enhancement with cyclodialysis has been introduced. This involves the creation of a cyclodialysis cleft in a controlled manner to allow additional suprachoroidal drainage of the aqueous. Cyclodialysis is the result of the separation of the longitudinal ciliary muscle fibers from the scleral spur, which creates an additional pathway for aqueous humor drainage. However, such a cleft often closes on its own due to associated inflammation caused by the filtration surgery. Deep sclerectomy is a non-penetrating surgery that involves dissection of a scleral patch and excision of a block of scleral tissue, retaining a thin membrane for aqueous drainage. In this study, we introduce a novel surgical technique of combining trabeculectomy with a limited deep sclerectomy and a cyclodialysis in two pseudophakic patients who developed secondary glaucoma after vitreo-retinal surgery with silicone oil insertion. In this technique the excised scleral tissue obtained after deep sclerectomy was utilized as a spacer to maintain the patency of the cyclodialysis cleft.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women with infertility, elucidate the psycho-social factors affecting infertile women, identify the commonly employed coping strategies, and evaluate their self-esteem and quality of life.
METHODS: A total of 150 women with infertility, from a tertiary care hospital, participated in this study. Cross-sectional assessment was performed by using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, WHO-Quality of life-BREF, and Brief-COPE Inventory.
RESULTS: Overall, 58% (87/150) of women reported depression on HDRS, 24% (36/150) reported anxiety on HAM-A, and 24% (36/150) had both depression and anxiety on HDRS and HAM-A. Comparative analysis of women reporting depression and anxiety indicated that they were subjected to significant discrimination, received lower social acceptance, had financial problems, higher depression and anxiety, poorer quality of life, and employed maladaptive coping. Living in a joint family, and using maladaptive coping were significant risk factors for anxiety and depression. Conversely, the family's ability to provide support, share problems, and assist with decision-making, along with receiving support from their spouses, were chief protective factors.
CONCLUSION: Women with infertility experience depression, anxiety, poor quality of life, and employ maladaptive coping. Supportive relationships with one's family and spouse are chief protective factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) and anxiety (PPA) is rising in India and efforts at generating local evidence for psychological intervention are scanty. We conducted a single-arm pilot study in an Indian rural community to test the impact of multicomponent psychoeducational intervention (MCPI) on women with PPD and PPA.
METHODS: Forty-three women with PPD/PPA/both received MCPI, which comprised three phases with in-person sessions held once weekly for a minimum of six and a maximum of ten weeks. Primary outcome variables were scores on depression and anxiety, assessed using the Edinburg postnatal depression scale and the state and trait anxiety inventory, along with evaluating the compliance rate to the intervention. The Mini-international neuropsychiatric interview (MINI) neuropsychiatric interview was used to confirm the diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Secondary outcome variables assessed were social support, functionality, parental stress, interpersonal violence, and marital satisfaction. We used Cohen's d effect size method for assessing the mean differences.
RESULTS: MCPI resulted in the improvement of 72% women (95% CI = 56.3%-84.7%). The overall compliance rate to the intervention was 85.63%, which was higher for responders than nonresponders (92.9% vs. 69.8%; P < 0.001). MCPI resulted in statistically significant improvement in the mean score of depression (P = 0.001, d = 0.95) and anxiety (P = 0.001, d = 1.30). On secondary outcome variables, significant improvement was obtained in the overall present social support (P = 0.001; d = 4.65), present social support from partner (P = 0.027; d = 0.45) and parents (P = 0.001; d = 0.74), future social support from parents (P = 0.001; d = 0.81), the performance of household responsibility (P = 0.001; d = 0.97), lifestyle in the last two weeks (P = 0.001; d = 3.57), parental stress (P = 0.001; d = 1.04), and marital satisfaction (P = 0.014; d = 0.52).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows that MCPI has a promising role in relieving depression and anxiety. It also improved the perception of social support from partner and parents, functionality, marital satisfaction, and reduced parental stress.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the surgical efficacy of reinforced plication of the medial rectus muscle to resection as an effective muscle strengthening procedure in exotropia.
METHODS: This is a prospective randomized trial in patients with exotropia who underwent complete orthoptic evaluation followed by random assignment into two groups by using a computer-drawn random number table. Group 1 patients underwent standard resection with recession procedure, and group 2 patients underwent reinforced plication with recession procedure. Follow-up was performed at day 1, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months to assess the surgical efficacy.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were included in the study of which 39 were in group 1 and 41 in group 2. The mean age in group 1 was 23.48 ± 11.94 years and 23.29 ± 10.02 years in group 2. The mean preoperative deviation in group 1 for distance was 50.13 ± 11.95 PD and 50.12 ± 9.79 PD in group 2 (P = 0.499). In group 1 with a mean surgical dose of 5.27 mm medial rectus resection and 8.04 mm lateral rectus recession, a 7.11 ± 3.95 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Similarly, in group 2 with a mean surgical dose of 5.16 mm medial rectus plication and 8.16 mm lateral rectus recession, a 6.00 ± 2.46 PD deviation was noted at the end of 6 months. Between groups, ocular surface changes, inter-surgeon comparison, and exotropia subtypes did not reveal any significant differences.
CONCLUSION: In our observation, the reinforced medial rectus muscle plication showed clinically comparable results as compared to the standard resection procedure at the end of 6 months. Therefore, this innovative modification can be considered as an alternative to standard resection.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) may improve the outcome in critically ill COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation. However, the timing of performing tracheostomy may be controversial, and it is an aerosol-generating procedure with a potential risk of viral exposure to healthcare workers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An operational protocol for performing PDT was made and subsequently followed in a designated COVID-19 ICU. Critically ill adult patients on mechanical ventilators who underwent PDT were included in this retrospective cohort study. Case files were retrospectively reviewed and patient characteristics, clinical outcome, and procedure-related details were noted.
RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 49 (39-67) years, and 41.5% of patients were females. The median duration of mechanical ventilation before tracheostomy was 10 (8-16) days, and the median (IQR) PaO2/FiO2 ratio on the day of PDT was 155 (125-180) mm Hg. Further, 48.8% of patients had transient desaturation to SpO2 <90%, and 41.5% survived to ICU discharge. None of the health care providers involved in PDT developed any symptoms of COVID 19.
CONCLUSION: This descriptive study demonstrates the feasibility, implementation, and apparent safety of the PDT protocol developed at our institution.

AB  - Histological interpretation of the rare pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) has been the holy grail for treatment options. However, no stand-alone clinical interventions have been developed owing to the lack of gene expression profiling data in PXA/APXA patients. We first time report the comprehensive analyses of the coding as well as long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signatures of PXA/APXA patients. Several genes such as IGFBP2, NF1, FOS, ERBB2, and lncRNAs such as NEAT1, HOTAIRM1, and GAS5 known to play crucial roles in glioma patients were also deregulated in PXA patients suggesting the commonality in the molecular signatures. PPI network, co-expression, and lncRNA-mRNA interaction studies unraveled hub genes (such as ERBB2, FOS, RPA1) and networks that may play a critical role in PXA biology. The most enriched pathways based on gene profiles were related to TLR, chemokine, MAPK, Rb, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. The lncRNA targets were enriched in glucuronidation, adipogenesis, TGF-beta signaling, EGF/EGFR signaling, and cell cycle pathways. Interestingly, several mRNAs like PARVG, and ABI2 were found to be targeted by multiple lncRNAs suggesting a tight control of their levels. Some of the most prominent lncRNA-mRNA pairs were LOC728730: MRPL9, XLOC_l2_011987: ASIC2, lnc-C1QTNF5-1: RNF26. Notably, several lncRNAs such as lnc-CETP-1, lnc-XRCC3-1, lnc-RPL31-1, lnc-USP13-1, and MAPKAPK5-AS1, and genes such as RPA1, NTRK3, and CNRP1 showed strong correlation to the progression-free survival of PXA patients suggesting their potential as novel biomarkers. Overall, the findings of this study may facilitate the development of a new realm of RNA biology in PXA that may have clinical significance in the future.

AB  - JUSTIFICATION: In India, there is a lack of uniformity of treatment strategies for aplastic anemia (AA), and many children are managed only with supportive care due to non-availability of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
PROCESS: Eminent national faculty members were invited to participate in the process of forming a consensus statement in Hyderabad in July, 2016. Draft guidelines were circulated to all members, and comments received in a online meeting in October, 2020 were incorporated into the final draft. These were approved by all experts.
OBJECTIVE: To facilitate appropriate management of children with acquired aplastic anemia.
RECOMMENDATIONS: Key recommendations are: i) A bone marrow biopsy is must to make a diagnosis of AA; ii) Rule out inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS), connective tissue disorders, viral infections, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), drug or heavy metal induced marrow suppression in all cases of AA; iii) Conservative approach to transfusions should be followed, with a target to keep hemoglobin >6 g/dL in children with no co-morbidities; iv) HLA-matched sibling donor HSCT is the preferred choice of treatment for newly diagnosed very severe/ severe AA; v) In absence of HLA-matched family donor, a matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant or immunosuppressive therapy (IST) should be considered as alternate choice based on physician expertise; vi) Fludarabine, cyclophos-phamide and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) based conditioning with cyclosporine and methotrexate as graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis is the preferred regimen; vii) Horse ATG and cyclosporine are the recommended drugs for IST. One should wait for 3-6 months for the response assessment and consideration of next line therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: We report findings from a survey on the mental health impact of COVID-19 factoring environmental adversities among older adolescents (15-19 years) living in urban slums in India.
METHODS: We report survey results of 3490 older adolescents. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression, slum adversity questionnaire for slum conditions, and for COVID-19 infection we recorded self-reported positivity status. Sociodemographic details were also collected. Additional sub-group analyses of sample who had depression and tested positive for COVID-19 infection was conducted. We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to identify factors and COVID-19 infection that were associated with depression.
RESULTS: Adolescents with adversities were three times more likely to report depression. Adolescents who reported COVID-19 infection were about two times more likely to have depression. Sub-group analyses showed that adolescents having experienced adversities and girls were more likely to report depression following COVID-19 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for an intersectional research framework that incorporates stress arising out of a pandemic, social disadvantage, and systemic inequities. Such a framework will help to assess mental health issues of developmentally vulnerable groups residing in disadvantageous conditions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence and determinants of hypertension among adolescents in a rural area in North India.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among community-dwelling adolescents (10-19 y) and defined blood pressure as per the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2017 criteria. A pretested, semistructured questionnaire was used to elicit sociodemographic details and risk factors of hypertension. Association of factors with hypertension, z scores of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were assessed by logistic and linear regression. In multivariable regression model, for both logistic and linear regression, variables with p value < 0.2 were included, excluding collinear variables.
RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty-four adolescents participated with mean (SD) age, BMI of 14.0 ± 2.6 y, 18.3 ± 3.5 kg/m2. Hypertension prevalence was 22.5% (95% CI: 19.7, 25.5) as per AAP and 15.2% (95% CI: 12.9, 17.8) as per NHBPEP criteria. Being hypertensive as per the AAP was associated with family history of noncommunicable disease (NCD) (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.11, 2.86) and BMI (AOR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.14), and as per the NHBPEP, was only associated with BMI (AOR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.17). SBP z score was significantly associated with male sex (adjusted beta coefficient AC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69, 0.90), and weight z scores (AC = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 3.28); DBP z score was significantly associated with z scores of height (AC = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.96) and waist (AC = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.30).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension among adolescents was high and was associated with BMI and family history of NCD.

AB  - A 54-year-old man, with history of undergoing deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) 20 months ago, presented with mature senile cataract in the same eye. While undergoing phacoemulsification, a large, central Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) was noted, separating the donor cornea from the host predescemetic layer. No DM tears were noted. Stromal puncture was done at the graft host junction to reduce the extent of DMD. This was followed by a large intracameral air bubble insertion, which resulted in complete resolution of DMD on the first postoperative day. DMD during hydration of wound is a unique complication to be anticipated while doing cataract surgery in an operated DALK eye.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Management of "failing" and "failed" Fontan circulation, particularly the indications, timing, and type of re-intervention, currently remains nebulous. Factors contributing to pathogenesis and mortality following Fontan procedure differ between children and adults.
METHODS: Since organ systems in individual patients are affected differently, we searched the extant literature for a "failing" and "failed" Fontan reviewing the clinical phenotypes, diagnostic modalities, pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical techniques employed, and their outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 410 investigations were synthesised. Although proper candidate selection, thoughtful technical modifications, timely deployment of mechanical support devices, tissue-engineered conduits, and Fontan takedown have decreased the peri-operative mortality from 9 to 15% and 1 to 3% per cent in recent series, pernicious changes in organ function are causing long-term patient attrition. In the setting of a failed Fontan circulation, literature documents three surgical options: Fontan revision, Fontan conversion, or cardiac transplantation. The reported morbidity of 25% and mortality of 8-10% among Fontan conversion continue to improve in select institutions. While operative mortality following cardiac transplantation for Fontan failure is 30% higher than for other CHDs, there is no difference in long-term survival with actuarial 10-year survival of around 54%. Mechanical circulatory assistance, stem cells, and tissue-engineered Fontan conduit for destination therapy or as a bridge to transplantation are in infancy for failing Fontan circulation.
CONCLUSIONS: An individualised management strategy according to clinical phenotypes may delay the organ damage in patients with a failing Fontan circulation. At present, cardiac transplantation remains the last stage of palliation with gradually improving outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The phenotypic features and morphogenesis of the 'sinus venosus defect' remain controversial. The phenotypic features are anomalous systemic connections of 1 or more pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connection, usually associated with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. Cases with these features, however, have not always been described as sinus venosus defects.
METHODS: We reviewed the findings documented in the literature from 11 patients with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein, most reported following an autopsy examination. We compared these findings with the anatomical details of 50 patients undergoing surgical correction in our centre, paying particular attention to the override of the superior caval vein.
RESULTS: In only two-thirds of those undergoing surgery did the superior caval vein override the rims of the oval fossa, with the degree of override >50% in only 2 individuals. It is only these latter 2 cases that are directly comparable to the reported cases of biatrial connection of the superior caval vein.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comparisons provide new insights into the developmental background and phenotypic features of the superior sinus venosus defect. The defects exist because of the anomalous systemic connection of the pulmonary veins that retain their left atrial connections but not always in association with a biatrial connection of the superior caval vein. In extreme cases, nonetheless, they can underscore the connection of the caval vein to the morphologically left atrium, frequently described previously as a 'biatrial connection'. The sinus venosus defect is better considered a venovenous malformation than a septal defect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancellation of any scheduled surgery is a significant drain on health resources and potentially stressful for patients. It is frequent in menstruating women who are scheduled to undergo open heart surgery (OHS), based on the widespread belief that it increases surgical and menstrual blood loss.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate blood loss in women undergoing OHS during menstruation.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A prospective, matched case-control study which included sixty women of reproductive age group undergoing OHS.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical blood loss was compared between women who were menstruating (group-M; n = 25) and their matched controls, i.e., women who were not menstruating (group-NM; n = 25) at the time of OHS. Of the women in group M, the menstrual blood loss during preoperative (subgroup-P) and perioperative period (subgroup-PO) was compared to determine the effect of OHS on menstrual blood loss.
RESULTS: The surgical blood loss was comparable among women in both groups irrespective of ongoing menstruation (gr-M = 245.6 ± 120.1 ml vs gr-NM = 243.6 ± 129.9 ml, P value = 0.83). The menstrual blood loss was comparable between preoperative and perioperative period in terms of total menstrual blood loss (gr-P = 36.8 ± 4.8 ml vs gr-PO = 37.7 ± 5.0 ml, P value = 0.08) and duration of menstruation (gr-P = 4.2 ± 0.6 days vs gr-PO = 4.4 ± 0.6 days, P value = 0.10).
CONCLUSION: Neither the surgical blood loss nor the menstrual blood loss is increased in women undergoing OHS during menstruation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the west, survival following treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) approaches 90%. Outcomes in India do not exceed 70%. To address this disparity, the Indian Collaborative Childhood Leukaemia group (ICiCLe) developed in 2013 a contemporary treatment protocol for uniform risk-stratified management of first presentation ALL based on cytogenetics and minimal residual disease levels (MRD). A multicentre randomised clinical trial opened in 2016 (ICiCLe-ALL-14) and examines the benefit of randomised interventions to decrease toxicity and improve outcomes.
METHODS: Patients 1-18 years with newly diagnosed ALL are categorised into four risk groups based on presentation features, tumour genetics and treatment response. Standard risk includes young (< 10 years) B cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) patients with low presentation leucocyte count (< 50 × 109/L) and no high-risk features. Intermediate risk includes BCP-ALL patients with no high-risk features but are older and have high presentation leucocyte counts and/or bulky disease. High risk includes BCP-ALL patients with any high-risk feature, including high-risk genetics, central nervous system leukaemia, poor prednisolone response at treatment day 8 and high MRD (≥ 0·01%) at the end of induction. Patients with T-lineage ALL constitute the fourth risk group. All patients receive four intensive treatment blocks (induction, consolidation, interim maintenance, delayed intensification) followed by 96 weeks of maintenance. Treatment intensity varies by risk group. Clinical data management is based on a web-based remote data capture system. The first randomisation examines the toxicity impact of a shorter induction schedule of prednisolone (3 vs 5 weeks) in young non-high-risk BCP-ALL. The second randomisation examines the survival benefit of substituting doxorubicin with mitoxantrone in delayed intensification for all patients. Primary outcome measures include event-free survival (overall, by risk groups), sepsis rates in induction (first randomisation) and event-free survival rates following second randomisation.
DISCUSSION: ICiCLe-ALL-14 is the first multicentre randomised childhood cancer clinical trial in India. The pre-trial phase allowed standardisation of risk-stratification diagnostics and established the feasibility of collaborative practice, uniform treatment, patient enrolment and data capture. Pre-trial observations confirm the impact of risk-stratified therapy in reducing treatment-related deaths and costs. Uniform practice across centres allows patients to access care locally, potentially decreasing financial hardship and dislocation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: With a substantial number of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) experiencing disease relapse, the quest for more sensitive methods to assess deeper responses indicative of cure continues.
METHODS: In this prospective analysis of 170 patients with MM at day 100 after autologous stem cell transplant, we evaluated the predictive value of conventional response, measurable residual disease (MRDTOTAL: the aberrant percentage of plasma cells [PC%] among total bone marrow cells), and neoplastic plasma cell index scores (NPCI: the aberrant PC% of total PCs).
RESULTS: Significantly better progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were observed with deepening conventional response. Conventional response-based stratification within the MRD-positive and MRD-negative subgroups showed a significantly higher PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.11; P < .005) and OS (HR, 3.08; P = .01) in the conventional response-positive/MRD-positive group compared with the conventional response-negative/MRD-positive group. Using K-adaptive partitioning to find the optimum threshold for MRD, patients achieving less than 0.001% MRDTOTAL had superior PFS (MRDTOTAL 0.001% to <0.1%: HR, 6.66, P < .005; MRDTOTAL ≥0.1%: HR, 11.52, P < .005) and OS (MRDTOTAL 0.001% to <0.1%: HR, 5.3, P < .05; MRDTOTAL ≥0.1%: HR = 9.21, P < .005). The C index and Akaike information criterion metrics demonstrated the superior performance of the NPCI compared with MRDTOTAL in predicting treatment outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive deepening of response, conventional as well as MRD, correlates with superior survival outcomes. The NPCI proved to be a superior determinant of survival and can be explored as a better statistic than MRD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Immunophenotypic profile and post-therapy alteration in antigenic expression were evaluated in normal, reactive, and aberrant plasma cells (NPC, RPC, and APC) for impact on measurable residual disease (MRD) assessment in multiple myeloma (MM).
METHODS: Samples from non-MM staging marrow (n = 30), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 30) and MM (n = 724) were prospectively evaluated for expression profiles of NPC, RPC, and APC using antigens recommended in consensus guidelines.
RESULTS: Polyclonal NPC-RPC demonstrated aberrations for all antigens evaluated with a higher frequency of aberrancies in post-therapy samples compared to treatment naïve samples (p < 0.001%). Immunomodulation in APC was observed in 79% of post-therapy samples with a change in expression of 1, 2, and ≥3 antigens in 19.9%, 15.6%, and 43.5% samples, respectively. In 13.4% of samples, APC showed no aberrancy and aberrant status was assigned based on cytoplasmic light chain restriction (cyLCR) alone. 9% samples with an admixture of NPC and APC displayed normal cytoplasmic kappa to lambda ratio (cyKLR) when the percentage of APC of total PC (neoplastic plasma cell index, NPCI), was below 25% and 50% for kappa and lambda restricted cases, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The panorama and high frequency of antigenic aberrations on polyclonal PC signify the importance of MRD assay validation on a large cohort under normal and reactive conditions. Frequent Immunophenotypic shifts in APC re-confirm the redundancy of baseline immunophenotype for MRD evaluation. Small clones of APC may be missed by assessment of cyKLR alone and therefore, surface marker aberrancy supported by cyLCR is required for definitive assignment of residual APC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The expression pattern of common antigens including cytoplasmic kappa/lambda ratio (cyKLR) was evaluated by flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCMI) to explore their relevance in discriminating normal and aberrant plasma cells (NPC and APC, respectively) across spectrum of plasma cell proliferative disorders (PCPD).
METHODS: In this prospective analysis, 791 samples from PCPD (treatment naive = 455; partially treated = 336) were evaluated for expression of CD38, CD138, CD45, CD19, CD56, CD27, CD81, CD117, Cy-kappa, and Cy-lambda using FCMI.
RESULTS: Amongst the entire cohort, 20.7% (n = 164) samples displayed only APC, 21% (n = 165) only NPC and 58% (n = 462) showed coexistence of NPC and APC. Using pattern-based recognition (PBR) for three common patterns (CD19 vs. CD56; CD27 vs. CD56 and CD19 vs. CD27), APC was separable from NPC in 93% samples. In 6.5% samples, the gating markers contributed in APC-NPC differentiation and in the remaining 0.5% CD117 and CD81 proved useful. Clonality assessment was found to be crucial to label plasma cell compartment as completely normal or aberrant in 42% cases with either all NPC or all APC. Sixty one out of 462 cases (13%) revealed cyKLR within normal reference range and in these cases; abnormal cyKLR was demonstrable only after gating APC separately based on PBR.
CONCLUSION: Fair discrimination between NPC and APC is achievable in all PCPD samples using eight markers (Gating: CD38, CD138, CD45; PBR:CD19, CD56, CD27; clonality: Cy-kappa and Cy-lambda). Thus, combined assessment of clonality and immunophenotypic aberrancies is required for accurate, reliable and precise assessment of NPC and APC compartments in PCPD.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis (CE), even after several control measures, causes significant morbidity throughout the world. Besides imaging investigation technology, the serological tests are essential for both diagnosis and management of this slowly progressive disease. The present study was a hospital-based retrospective study that examined the seropositivity rate for Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato antibody in patients suspected of CE at our tertiary health care center over 8 years from 2013 to 2020. Records of new visits to hospital/clinics and associated hospital discharge constituted the denominator of calculation. All samples were tested using commercially available indirect immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. A total of 925 suspected patients with a clinical diagnosis of CE were screened. The age group that commonly tested positive for CE was 20 to 39 years, and liver was the predominant organ found to be affected. The seropositive rate was 41.2%. On further year-wise analysis, it was observed that the seropositivity rate had significantly declined from 61.4% in 2013 to 33.8% in 2020. This study clearly showed that there is a by 27.6% decline of CE seropositivity rate in 8 years. This declining rate may be attributed to improved socioeconomic status and better implementation of health programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of leflunomide as a steroid-sparing agent among Indian patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) and to assess the changes of "halo sign" within affected arteries, detected ultrasonographically, after remission.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study, patients fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria for GCA and having halo sign in temporal artery ultrasound were treated with leflunomide and predefined tapering dose of prednisolone. Ultrasounds of temporal and axillary arteries were done at baseline and after remission were achieved.
RESULTS: Twenty-two GCA patients were followed up for a median duration of 24 months (interquartile range, IQR: 18-33). All patients showed clinical improvement and steroids could be stopped in 17 out of 22 patients. Median time to achieve remission (symptom-free with normal inflammatory markers) was 3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-3.6) months. Median time to achieve reduction to prednisolone dose <5 mg/d was 9 months (95% CI: 7-11). Prednisolone dose could be reduced in all patients while on leflunomide, suggesting steroid-sparing effect and a steroid-free remission could be achieved after a median of 14 months (95% CI: 9.4-18.6). Ultrasonographically, all patients showed improvement of halo signs, after 8 weeks (IQR 7.25-12). Seven patients experienced a clinical relapse after 12 months (IQR: 5-21) of initial remission. The predictors of relapse were duration of symptoms before initiation of immunosuppression therapy and delayed achievement remission by strict criteria.
CONCLUSION: This study showed efficacy and safety of leflunomide as a steroid-sparing agent in Indian GCA patients.

AB  - Many adults in India have received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine with or without a prior history SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, there is limited information on the effect of prior immunity on antibody response upon vaccination in India. As immunization of individuals continues, we aimed to assess whether pre-existing antibodies are further boosted by a single dose of BBV152, an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and, if these antibodies can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Here we show that natural infection during the second wave in 2021 led to generation of neutralizing antibodies against other lineages of SARS-CoV-2 including the Omicron variant, albeit at a significantly lower level for the latter. A single dose of BBV152 boosted antibody titers against the Delta and the Omicron variants but the antibody levels remained low against the Omicron variant. Boosting of antibodies showed negative correlation with baseline neutralizing antibody titers.

AB  - Background: Hemoglobin (Hb) variants arise due to point mutations in globin chains and their pathological treatments rely heavily on the identification of the nature and location of the mutation in the globin chains. Traditional methods for diagnosis such as HPLC and electrophoresis have their own limitations. Therefore, the present study aims to develop and optimize a specific method of sample processing that could lead to improved sequence coverage and analysis of Hb variants by nano LC-MALDI MS/MS. Methods: In our study, we primarily standardized various sample processing methods such as conventional digestion with trypsin followed by 10% acetonitrile treatment, digestion with multiple proteases like trypsin, Glu-C, Lys-C, and trypsin digestion subsequent to 2,2,2 trifluoroethanol (TFE) treatment. Finally, the peptides were identified by LC-MALDI MS/MS. All of these sample processing steps were primarily tested with recombinant Hb samples. After initial optimization, we found that the TFE method was the most suitable one and the efficiency of this method was applied in Hb variant identification based on high sequence coverage. Results: We developed and optimized a method using an organic solvent TFE and heat denaturation prior to digestion, resulting in 100% sequence coverage in the β-chains and 95% sequence coverage in the α-chains, which further helped in the identification of Hb mutations. A Hb variant protein sequence database was created to specify the search and reduce the search time. Conclusion: All of the mutations were identified using a bottom-up non-target approach. Therefore, a sensitive, robust and reproducible method was developed to identify single substitution mutations in the Hb variants from the sequence of the entire globin chains. Biological Significance: Over 330,000 infants are born annually with hemoglobinopathies and it is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in early childhood. Hb variants generally arise due to point mutation in the globin chains. There is high sequence homology between normal Hb and Hb variant chains. Due to this high homology between the two forms, identification of variants by mass spectrometry is very difficult and requires the full sequence coverage of α- and β-chains. As such, there is a need for a suitable method that provides 100% sequence coverage of globin chains for variant analysis by mass spectrometry. Our study provides a simple, robust, and reproducible method that is suitable for LC-MALDI and provides nearly complete sequence coverage in the globin chains. This method may be used in the near future in routine diagnosis for Hb variant analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High pharyngo-esophageal strictures following corrosive ingestion continue to pose a challenge to the surgeon, particularly in the developing world. With the advancements and increased experience with microsurgical techniques, free jejunal flaps offer a viable reconstruction option in patients with high corrosive strictures with previous failed reconstruction. We review our experience with free jejunal flap in three cases with high pharyngo-esophageal stricture following corrosive ingestion, with previous failed reconstruction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of three patients underwent salvage free jejunal flap after failed reconstruction for high pharyngo-esophageal strictures following corrosive acid ingestion. All the three patients developed anastomotic leak and subsequent stricture, two following a pharyngo-gastric anastomosis and one following a pharyngo-colic anastomosis. The strictured segment was bridged using a free jejunal graft with microvascular anastomosis to the lingual artery and common facial vein. All patients were followed-up at regular intervals.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The strictured pharyngeal anastomotic segment was successfully reconstructed with free jejunal flap in all the three patients. Patients were able to take food orally and maintain nutrition without the need of jejunostomy feeding. On long-term follow-up (median: 5 years), there was no recurrence of dysphagia and all the patients had good health-related quality of life.

AB  - Background  As the coronavirus disease 2019 virus made its way throughout the world, there was a complete overhaul of our day-to-day personal and professional lives. All aspects of health care were affected including academics. During the pandemic, teaching opportunities for resident training were drastically reduced. Consequently, medical universities in many parts across the globe implemented online learning, in which students are taught remotely and via digital platforms. Given these developments, evaluating the existing mode of teaching via digital platforms as well as incorporation of new models is critical to improve and implement. Methods  We reviewed different online learning platforms used to continue regular academic teaching of the plastic surgery residency curriculum. This study compares the four popular Web conferencing platforms used for online learning and evaluated their suitability for providing plastic surgery education. Results  In this study with a response rate of 59.9%, we found a 64% agreement rate to online classes being more convenient than normal classroom teaching. Conclusion  Zoom was the most user-friendly, with a simple and intuitive interface that was ideal for online instruction. With a better understanding of factors related to online teaching and learning, we will be able to deliver quality education in residency programs in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Copper nanoparticle (CuNP) has well-established antimicrobial activity. Instability in an aqueous medium due to aggregation into larger particles, conversion into metal ions, and oxidation into metal oxides are the major limitations of its practical use against bacterial infections.
OBJECTIVE: Development of CuNP Conjugated Chitosan Microparticles as a reservoir that will release CuNP effective against notorious bacteria like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
METHODS: CuNP conjugated chitosan microparticles (CNCCM) were synthesized using a simple twostep process. In the first step, a solution of chitosan in 2% (w/v) ascorbic acid was added dropwise in copper sulphate solution to prepare Cu ion conjugated chitosan beads. In the second step, these beads were soaked in sodium hydroxide solution to get the CNCCM. The dried CNCCM were characterized thoroughly for surface conjugation of CuNP, and the release of CuNP in a suitable medium. The physicochemical properties of release CuNP were further verified with the in silico modelled CuNP. The Antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of released CuNp were evaluated against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).
RESULTS: 2% (w/v) ascorbic acid solution (pH 3.5) was the optimum medium for the release of ~2 nm CuNP from CNCCM. The CuNP had an optical band gap of ~ 2 eV. It inhibited the cell wall synthesis of MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration was 200 nM. At 100 nM dose, the CuNP caused ~73% reduction in biofilm development after 24 h of growth. The cytotoxic effect of CuNP on the human cell line (HEK 293) was significantly less than that on MRSA. The 48 h IC50 value against HEK 293 was 3.45-fold higher than the MIC value against MRSA after 24 h treatment.
CONCLUSION: CuNP Conjugated Chitosan Microparticle has been developed. It works as a stable reservoir of ~2 nm CuNP. The CuNP is released in an aqueous medium containing 2% (w/v) ascorbic acid (pH 3.5). The released CuNP has a bacteriostatic effect against MRSA at a concentration safe for human cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Yoga nidra is a technique sages use to self-induce sleep. Classically, sleep is characterized by three cardinal electrophysiological features, namely, electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and electrooculography (EOG). As the literature on electrophysiological characterization of Yoga nidra is lacking, it is not known whether it is a sleep or awake state. The objective of the study was to electrophysiologically characterize yoga nidra practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty subjects underwent five initial supervised yoga nidra sessions and then continued practice on their own. The subjects completed their sleep diaries for 2 weeks before and during the intervention. The electrophysiological characterization was done after 2 weeks of yoga nidra practice using 19 EEG channels polysomnography for pre-yoga nidra, yoga nidra practice and post-yoga nidra. Polysomnographic data were scored for sleep-wake stages as per standard criteria. Power spectral density (PSD) was calculated from various frequency bands in different time bins. EEG data were grouped by areas, namely, central, frontal, prefrontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital in time bins. Sleep diary parameters were also compared for pre-post-yoga nidra training.
RESULTS: After 2 weeks of yoga nidra practice, awake was scored throughout the session (n = 26). PSD results (mean difference in dB between different time bins; P value) showed significant changes. When compared to pre-yoga nidra, there was an increase in delta power in the central area (1.953; P = 0.033) and a decrease in the prefrontal area (2.713; P = 0.041) during yoga nidra. Sleep diary showed improvement in sleep duration (P = 0.0001), efficiency (P = 0.0005), quality (P = 0.0005), and total wake duration (P = 0.00005) after 2 weeks of practice.
INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Yoga nidra practice in novices is electrophysiologically an awake state with signs of slow waves locally, often referred to as local sleep.

AB  - Background In the wake of the recent Roe vs. Wade judgment, we performed a Google Trends analysis to identify the impact of this decision on the interests regarding contraceptive choices in the United States. Methods A Google Trends search between April 6 and July 5, 2022, with the United States as the area of interest, was performed using the five most popular contraception choices. In addition, a second trend search was performed using oral and injectable hormonal birth control measures. Results Trends showed a spike in interest regarding various contraceptive methods immediately following the verdict. The highest increase in interest was noted for "vasectomy," followed by "tubal ligation." With respect to oral and injectable birth control measures, "morning after pill" showed a marked spike in interest. Conclusion This verdict has triggered increased interest in contraceptive practices, which can be translated into better reproductive health with proper public health initiatives.

AB  - Aging has been reported to deteriorate the quantity and quality of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which affect their therapeutic use in regenerative medicine. A dearth of age-related stem cell research further restricts their clinical applications. The present study explores the possibility of using MSCs derived from human gingival tissues (GMSCs) for studying their ex vivo growth characteristics and differentiation potential with respect to donor age. GMSCs displayed decreased in vitro adipogenesis and in vitro and in vivo osteogenesis with age, but in vitro neurogenesis remained unaffected. An increased expression of p53 and SIRT1 with donor age was correlated to their ability of eliminating tumorigenic events through apoptosis or autophagy, respectively. Irrespective of donor age, GMSCs displayed effective immunoregulation and regenerative potential in a mouse model of LPS-induced acute lung injury. Thus, we suggest the potential of GMSCs for designing cell-based immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches and their further extrapolation for acute inflammatory conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is widely used in dermatology for skin depigmentation. However, there are very few clinical studies on the efficacy of vitamin C in gingival depigmentation. This preliminary case series aims to present the clinical effectiveness, histologic changes, and patient-reported outcomes of intra-epidermal vitamin C injections (oral mesotherapy) for managing patients with gingival melanin hyperpigmentation.
METHOD AND MATERIALS: Five patients were administered locally injectable vitamin C (once per week for 4 to 5 visits) in maxillary or mandibular anterior pigmented gingiva. The depigmentation effect was evaluated using the Dummett Oral Pigmentation Index (DOPI) and Gingival Pigmentation Index (GPI). Digital photographs were used to assess gingival luminescence (L*) and pigmented surface area (PSA). Parameters were recorded at baseline and at 1 and 3 months. Melanocyte histopathologic count was determined at baseline and at 3 months. Pain, gingival color change, and patient satisfaction scores were also assessed.
RESULTS: Median GPI, DOPI, and PSA were significantly reduced (P ≤ .05) from baseline to 1 month. There was no statistically significant change from 1 month to 3 months. L* value significantly increased from baseline to 3 months. A median pain score of 3 (scale of 0 to 10) was observed on the day of the procedure. A score of 3 (scale of 0 to 4) was reported for the gingival color and scores 3 and 4 (scale of 0 to 4) for the overall patient satisfaction.
CONCLUSION: Oral mesotherapy using locally injectable vitamin C is a nonsurgical, minimally invasive, and efficient technique for gingival depigmentation. Indian patients were satisfied with the gingival color obtained and the overall treatment experience.
CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: As all the branches of medicine, specifically dentistry, direct to minimally invasive approaches, mesotherapy shows great importance to reduce the surgical interventions, especially when esthetic outcomes are needed. Oral mesotherapy using locally injectable vitamin C can be a useful nonsurgical technique for achieving gingival depigmentation in the esthetic zone.

AU  - Dayal, Prabhoo

T2  - Cureus
AB  - Introduction Researchers have found that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffer from anxiety more than the general population. The Anxiety Inventory for Respiratory Disease (AIR) scale has been primarily used to assess non-somatic anxiety in COPD patients. The validity of AIR among COPD patients has not been evaluated in Indian settings. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine the validity of AIR in these patients. The study aimed to evaluate concurrent criterion and discriminative validity of the AIR screening scale among patients with COPD using Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.2 as the gold standard measure for diagnosing Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) anxiety disorders. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Outpatients Department (OPD) of the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, from August 2018 to July 2019. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with COPD and aged 30 or above were recruited. All participants were further assessed in person by a psychiatry resident doctor using semi-structured proforma, MINI 7.0.2, and AIR Disease (Hindi). Mann-Whitney U and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted. The two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results To assess the concurrent criterion validity of the AIR scale for screening clinical anxiety disorders, the ROC curve was constructed using MINI diagnoses of anxiety disorder as the gold standard measure. A cut-off score of 5.5 was found to maximize both the specificity and sensitivity of the AIR scale for screening anxiety disorders among COPD patients with COPD. The AIR scale showed a high sensitivity (95%) and specificity (89%) at this cut-point. Conclusion The findings of this study recommend a cut-off score of 5.5 on the AIR scale instead of 8 in previous studies, as maintaining the previously recommended cut-offs in Indian settings may lead to an increase in false negatives. This could have negative consequences for patients seeking treatment. Further studies may be planned to explore the psychometric properties of the current tool in a larger population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (GMPS) phase analysis is an important tool to investigate the physiology of left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony. We aimed to test the performance of GMPS LV function and phase analysis in different clinical settings and on a diverse population.
METHODS: This is a post hoc analysis of a prospective, non-randomized, multinational, multicenter cohort study. Clinical evaluation and GMPS prior to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)(baseline) and 6-month post CRT (follow-up) were done. LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV phase standard deviation (LVPSD), and percentage of left ventricle non-viable (PLVNV) were obtained by 10 centers and compared to the core lab.
RESULTS: 276 GMPS studies had all data available from individual sites and from core lab. There were no statistically significant differences between all variables except for LVPSD. When subjects with no mechanical dyssynchrony were excluded, LVPSD difference became non-significant. LVESV, LVEF, LVPSD and PLVNV had strong correlation in site against core lab comparison. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated good agreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The presented correlation and agreement of LV function and dyssynchrony analysis over different sites with a diverse sample corroborate the strength of GMPS in the management of heart failure in clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the rate of remission of LN in an international cohort of 248 children and adolescents with biopsy-proven LN. Five different definitions from scientific studies and the definitions recommended by the ACR and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes were used.
METHODS: Anonymized clinical data in patients with biopsy-proven LN class ≥III (International Society of Nephrology/Royal Pathology Society) diagnosed and treated in the last 10 years in 23 international centres from 10 countries were collected. We compared the rate of patients in complete and partial remission applying the different definitions.
RESULTS: The mean age at diagnosis was 11 years and 4 months, and 177 were females. The number of patients in complete and partial remission varied a great deal between the different definitions. At 24 months, between 50% and 78.8% of the patients were in full remission as defined by the different criteria. The number of patients in partial remission was low, between 2.3% and 25%. No difference in achieved remission was found between boys and girls or between children and adolescents (P > 0.05). Patients with East Asian ethnicity reached remission more often than other ethnicities (P = 0.03-0.0008). Patients treated in high-income countries showed a higher percentage of complete remission at 12 and 24 months (P = 0.002-0.000001).
CONCLUSION: The rate of children and adolescents with LN achieving remission varied hugely with the definition used. Our results give important information for long-awaited treatment studies in children and young people.

TI  - New estimation of the prevalence of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) related to pulmonary TB - a revised burden for India
AU  - Denning, David W.
AU  - Cole, Donald C.
AU  - Ray, Animesh
T2  - IJID regions
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) may be confused with, or a coinfection of, pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), or may manifest itself after completion of antituberculous therapy (ATT).
METHODS: Literature searches were conducted on PubMed. The selected studies stated the timing of CPA diagnosis with respect to PTB. The key assumptions for estimating the annual incidence, annual deaths, and 5-year-period prevalence related to CPA were: of the clinically diagnosed PTB patients , 19% of those HIV-negative had CPA and 7% of HIV-positive patients had CPA; the percentage of patients presenting in the first year after PTB diagnosis or developing CPA as ATT finished was 10%; the annual rate of development of CPA from 2-5 years after PTB diagnosis was 1.5%; and the mortality of CPA was 20% in year 1 and 7.5% thereafter to year 5.
FINDINGS: In India, the annual incidence of CPA arising in PTB patients in 2019 was estimated to be 363 601  cases (range 254 521 - 472 682) and 42 766 deaths (range 29  936-55 595) - 10.5% of total PTB deaths. The 5-year-period prevalence of CPA was estimated at   1 575 716 , with an additional 100 715 deaths' total range of deaths 100 436- 186 525) annually.
INTERPRETATION: The revised estimation indicates a substantial unmet need for better diagnosis of CPA as part of a complex PTB-related respiratory morbidity burden.

AB  - COVID pandemic has impacted cancer care delivery and cancer surgical services globally. There is an urgent need to study the extent of the impact of COVID on cancer surgery and individual institutional response and strategies adopted to counter the adverse impact. A review of administrative and clinical policy changes adopted at the tertiary cancer center to combat COVID pandemic and resume cancer surgical services were performed. A retrospective comparative analysis of cancer out-patient census during COVID pandemic affected year and the preceding normal year along with cancer surgery data audit for the same periods was performed to assess the impact of the pandemic on cancer surgery. In addition, COVID infection rates among cancer surgery patients and healthcare workers were evaluated. There was approximately a 50% reduction in cancer outpatient registrations during COVID pandemic affected year. A trend of increasing footfalls was noted with decreasing COVID intensity and opening of lockdowns. There was a 33% reduction in major elective surgery and a 41% reduction in emergency surgery performed during the COVID period. As far as cancer surgeries are concerned, there was a 12-50% reduction in volumes involving different subsites. Overall COVID positivity rates among cancer surgery patients was low (8.17%), and approximately 30% of healthcare workers involved in cancer surgery were tested positive for COVID during the study period. Results of the current study indicate a significant impact of COVID pandemic on cancer surgical services. There was a significant impact on outpatient visits and cancer surgery volumes. However, a multidisciplinary-coordinated team approach, effective administrative and policy implementation, adoption of revised surgical safety and anesthesia protocols, COVID screening, and testing protocols facilitated resumption of cancer surgical services without adverse impact on surgical outcomes.

AB  - Cancer is emerging as a major public health challenge globally. Recently, IARC (International Association of Research on Cancer) published global cancer burden using GLOBOCAN 2020 estimates for 36 cancers in 185 countries of the world. As per the estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019, cancer is the first or second leading cause of death in 112 of 183 countries. The major takeaways of the GLOBOCAN 2020 report relevant to the surgical oncology community include the rising global burden of cancer, global disparity in cancer incidence and mortality in different geographic regions, and the impact of the human development index (HDI) on cancer incidence and projected global cancer burden by 2040. In this article, we discuss the implications of the GLOBOCAN report on future global cancer control strategies and the role of surgical oncologists in the fight against cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a multitude of surveys have analyzed the impact virus spreading on the everyday medical practice, including neurosurgery. However, none have examined the perceptions of neurosurgeons towards the pandemic, their life changes, and the strategies they implemented to be able to deal with their patients in such a difficult time.
METHODS: From April 2021 to May 2021 a modified Delphi method was used to construct, pilot, and refine the questionnaire focused on the evolution of global neurosurgical practice during the pandemic. This survey was distributed among 1000 neurosurgeons; the responses were then collected and critically analyzed.
RESULTS: Outpatient department practices changed with a rapid rise in teleservices. 63.9% of respondents reported that they have changed their OT practices to emergency cases with occasional elective cases. 40.0% of respondents and 47.9% of their family members reported to have suffered from COVID-19. 56.2% of the respondents reported having felt depressed in the last 1 year. 40.9% of respondents reported having faced financial difficulties. 80.6% of the respondents found online webinars to be a good source of learning. 47.8% of respondents tried to improve their neurosurgical knowledge while 31.6% spent the extra time in research activities.
CONCLUSIONS: Progressive increase in operative waiting lists, preferential use of telemedicine, reduction in tendency to complete stoppage of physical clinic services and drop in the use of PPE kits were evident. Respondents' age had an impact on how the clinical services and operative practices have evolved. Financial concerns overshadow mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that has been deployed in India. The results of the phase 3 trial have shown clinical efficacy of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
METHODS: We conducted a test-negative, case-control study among employees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (a tertiary care hospital in New Delhi, India), who had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (1:1) on the basis of age and gender. The odds of vaccination with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of occupational exposure (to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar time, using conditional logistic regression. The primary outcome was effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 (with the second dose received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - odds ratio) × 100%.
FINDINGS: Between April 15 and May 15, 2021, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 symptomatic employees had data on vaccination status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for analysis. The adjusted effectiveness of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0·0001). The adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted effectiveness of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61).
INTERPRETATION: This study shows the effectiveness of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge surge in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive delta (B.1.617.2) variant of SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this vaccine to help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, while continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological measures.
FUNDING: None.

T2  - Women's Midlife Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy, particularly when conducted in women younger than 45 years, has been associated with increased risk of non-communicable diseases. In India, research indicates that hysterectomy is a common procedure for women, but there have been no studies on its long-term effects. We examined patterns of hysterectomy amongst women in India and associations with their health and well-being in later life.
METHODS: This analysis utilised the first wave of the Longitudinal Study on Aging in India, a nationally representative study of adults that included a module on health and well-being. We analysed data on 35,083 women ≥45 years in India. We estimated prevalence of hysterectomy and performed multivariable logistic regression to identify associated risk factors and to examine the association between hysterectomy status and eight self-reported chronic conditions, hospitalisation and mobility.
RESULTS: The prevalence of hysterectomy among women >=45 years was 11.4 (95% CI: 10.3, 12.6), with higher odds among urban women (aOR: 1.39; 1.17,1.64) and higher economic status (highest compared to lowest quintile: aOR: 1.95; 1.44, 2.63). Hysterectomy history was associated with four chronic conditions: hypertension (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.28, 1.79), high cholesterol (aOR: 1.43; 1.04, 1.97), diabetes (aOR: 1.69; 1.28, 2.24), and bone/joint disease (aOR: 1.54; 1.20, 1.97) and higher odds of any hospitalisation in the past year (aOR: 1.69; 1.36, 2.09).
CONCLUSIONS: In India, evidence suggests that hysterectomy is associated with major chronic conditions. The assessment for hysterectomy as a treatment option for gynaecological morbidity should consider potential health consequences in later life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Home visitation has emerged as an effective model to provide high-quality care during pregnancy, childbirth, and post-natal period and improve the health outcomes of mother- new born dyad. This 3600 assessment documented the constraints faced by the community health workers (known as the Accredited Social Health Activists, ASHAs) to accomplish home visitation and deliver quality services in a poor-performing district and co-created the strategies to overcome these using a nexus planning approach.
METHODS: The study was conducted in the Raisen district of Madhya Pradesh, India. The grounded theory approach was applied for data collection and analysis using in-depth interviews, and focus group discussions with stakeholders representing from health system (including the ASHAs) and the community (rural population). A key group of diverse stakeholders were convened to utilize the nexus planning five domain framework (social-cultural, educational, organizational, economic, and physical) to prioritize the challenges and co-create solutions for improving the home visitation program performance and quality. The nexus framework provides a systemic lens for evaluating the success of the ASHAs home visitation program.
RESULTS: The societal (caste and economic discrimination), and personal (domestic responsibilities and cultural constraints of working in the village milieu) issues emerged as the key constraints for completing home visits. The programmatic gaps in imparting technical knowledge and skills, mentoring system, communication abilities, and unsatisfactory remuneration system were the other barriers to the credibility of the services. The nexus planning framework emphasized that each of the above factors/domains is intertwined and affects or depends on each other for home-based maternal and newborn care services delivered with quality through the ASHAs.
CONCLUSION: The home visitation program services, quality and impact can be enhanced by addressing the social-cultural, organizational, educational, economic, and physical nexus domains with concurrent efforts for skill and confidence enhancement of the ASHAs and their credibility.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the remodeling of visceral arteries post-endovascular repair (TEVAR) of type B aortic dissection and to investigate interval change in renal volume and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) vis-a-vis baseline visceral artery morphology.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients of type B aortic dissection who underwent TEVAR with a baseline and follow-up CT during the study period were included. Baseline morphology of visceral arteries (celiac, superior, and inferior mesenteric artery and bilateral renal artery) were classified into 7 patterns depending upon the origin of the artery (from true/false lumen) and the extension of dissection flap, while occluded vessels were categorized as pattern 8.
RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-two branches were analyzed in 25 patients (23 males; mean age: 50.1 years) with a mean follow-up of 386 days. 51 visceral branches were arising from the true lumen without any stenosis. Of the remaining 81 branches, 48 showed favorable remodeling (P = .0001). The highest incidence of favorable remodeling was observed in arteries arising from the true lumen (pattern 2,3: 44/48; 91.6%) whereas only one thrombosed and artery arising from the false lumen each (pattern 5 and 8) showed favorable remodeling. Kidneys perfused by false lumen or occluded renal artery suffered statistically significant volume loss compared to kidneys perfused by true or both lumens (-16.5% vs .2%; P = .01); however, the change in eGFR failed to reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSION: Visceral arteries arising from the true lumen are more likely to undergo favorable remodeling. The kidneys supplied by false lumen or by occluded renal artery suffer significantly more volume loss after TEVAR.

AB  - Background  Migration of the stent-graft post-thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is not uncommon; however, it is sparsely reported. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and complications of stent-graft migration post-TEVAR. Materials and Methods  Thirty-one patients who underwent TEVAR were retrospectively analyzed. The demographic, anatomical, and procedure-related factors were assessed. The measurements were done along the greater curvature of aorta around two fixed anatomic landmarks, that is, left common carotid artery or neoinnominate artery (hybrid repair) proximally and celiac artery distally. Aortic elongation and migration at proximal, distal, as well as at overlapping zone were measured. More than 10 mm of migration was considered significant. Results  Significant migration was observed in six (19%) patients. No significant migration was observed in the overlapping zone. The proximal landing zone 3 (odds ratio [OR] 12.78, p 0.01) was a significant risk factor, whereas landing zone 2 was a protective factor against the migration (OR 0.08, p 0.02). The odds for migration were more in segments I/3 and II/3 compared with I/2 and II/2, respectively, as per Modified Arch Landing Areas Nomenclature. A single complication was seen in the migration group which was treated by an overlapping stent graft. Conclusion  The stent-graft migration after TEVAR is not uncommon. Type 3 proximal landing zone was a significant risk factor for migration with an increased risk toward I/3 and II/3. Proximal landing zone 2 as well as adequate overlapping distance in multiple stent grafts can prevent migration. Ethical Approval No  IECPG-227/24.06.2020.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of mental health problems among mothers of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
METHODS: In this cross-sectional two-arm study, 130 mothers in each group, with either term infants not in NICU or preterm infants admitted to NICU, underwent mental health assessment using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire and Modified Parental Stress Scale-NICU. Their coping styles and quality of life were also assessed. Data were analyzed using SPSS IBM 25.0.
RESULTS: Anxiety (66.2% versus 46.9%) and depression (45.4% versus 23.1%) were more common among NICU mothers. Regarding subdomains of acute stress reaction, a higher number of NICU mothers showed symptoms of anxiety, re-experience and functional impairment. For mothers with infants in NICU, sight, sound, and parental role alterations were stressful. They had reduced quality of life scores in domains of physical health, psychological health, and social relationships. Also, a higher number of these mothers exhibited problem-solving and emotion-focused coping.
CONCLUSION: Preterm birth with NICU admission of the infant is more stressful for a mother than the term birth of a healthy neonate. It affects her mental health and quality of life. Both the obstetrician and the pediatrician should be mindful of this.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease (CKD) toxins accumulate in the muscles and cause fatigue, mental impairment, and muscle dysfunction (cramps). Exercise results in the opening of capillaries thereby increasing blood flow and allowing greater movement of urea and creatinine from the tissues to the vascular compartment and subsequent removal through dialysis. An experimental study of 64 CKD patients (32 each in experimental and control group), six low-intensity intra-dialytic exercises (IDE) were implemented for experimental group using video demonstration at 90 min after initiation of hemodialysis (HD) repeated thrice at an interval of 10 mins. Pre- and post-HD serum urea, creatinine, and fatigue levels were assessed at baseline, two, four and six weeks. Fatigue was measured using FACIT scale. Significant difference was found between the control and experimental group in serum urea, creatinine and fatigue levels (P = 0.007, P = 0.001, P = 0.001) at six weeks post HD. The experimental group showed a significant decrease in creatinine levels from baseline to six weeks (P = 0.04). Ninety-seven percent of patients were compliant to low-intensity IDE with patients feeling better and comfortable along with decrease in felt fatigue levels. No significant association was found between duration of illness, duration of maintenance HD and comorbidities and serum urea, serum creatinine, and fatigue levels (P = 0.5, P = 0.21, P = 0.78). The present study shows low-intensity IDE when performed regularly, was effective in decreasing serum urea, creatinine, and fatigue levels of CKD patients undergoing HD with vital signs remaining within the normal range. No overt complications were reported; hence, the exercises were safe.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the nutritional status (NS) of patients planned for maxillectomy and prosthodontic rehabilitation using three nutritional assessment methods.
METHODS: This longitudinal study enrolled 18 planned maxillectomy patients following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. NS was evaluated at five stages: before surgery (S0), 2 weeks after surgery (S1), 3 months after insertion of intermediate obturator (S2), just before fabrication of definitive obturator (S3), and 3 months after insertion of definitive obturator (S4) using two nutritional assessment tools i.e. Patient Generated -Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) &Nutritional risk index (NRI); and body composition indicators i.e. body mass index (BMI), fat free mass (FFM), total body water (TBW), skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI).To determine the changes in patient's nutritional status among different time points Repeated Measure ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc adjustments was used.
RESULTS: Out of 18 patients, 12 were completed the study. NS of maxillectomy patients deteriorates significantly (p < .05) till stage S2. At S3, significant improvement occurred as compared to stage S2, but it remained significantly less than pre-surgical level. However, at stage S4, all parameters were statistically comparable to S0 (p > .05) except for PG-SGA (p < .001) and SMM (p = .044).
CONCLUSION: NS of maxillectomy patients worsen post surgically due to surgical morbidity and adverse effects of radiotherapy (RT) but improves with post-surgical healing, resolution of sequel of RT and improved oral function due to well-adapted obturator prosthesis.

AB  - Glutamate-receptor-mediated hyperexcitability contributes to seizure generation in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway (TKP) metabolites regulate glutamate receptor activity under physiological conditions. This study was designed to investigate alterations in the levels of TKP metabolites and the differential regulation of glutamatergic activity by TKP metabolites in the hippocampus, anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and neocortex samples of a lithium-pilocarpine rat model of TLE. We observed that levels of tryptophan were reduced in the hippocampus and ATL samples but unaltered in the neocortex samples. The levels of kynurenic acid were reduced in the hippocampus samples and unaltered in the ATL and neocortex samples of the TLE rats. The levels of kynurenine were unaltered in all three regions of the TLE rats. The magnitude of reduction in these metabolites in all regions was unaltered in the TLE rats. The frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents were enhanced in hippocampus ATL samples but not in the neocortex samples of the TLE rats. The exogenous application of kynurenic acid inhibited glutamatergic activity in the slice preparations of all these regions in both the control and the TLE rats. However, the magnitude of reduction in the frequency of kynurenic acid was higher in the hippocampus (18.44 ± 2.6% in control vs. 30.02 ± 1.5 in TLE rats) and ATL (16.31 ± 0.91% in control vs. 29.82 ± 3.08% in TLE rats) samples of the TLE rats. These findings suggest the differential regulation of glutamatergic activity by TKP metabolites in the hippocampus, ATL, and neocortex of TLE rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Temporal trends in clinico-epidemiological parameters of stroke among Indian women have not been studied. We aimed to study the changes in these parameters over the last decade.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 417 strokes (ischemic/hemorrhagic) were prospectively recruited in two timelines. In total, 267 strokes were recruited in 2005 while 150 strokes were recruited in 2016-17. Patients underwent stepwise evaluation via a structured proforma. Demographic factors, stroke subtypes, and risk factors were analyzed.
RESULTS: Female strokes had a higher mean age in 2017 compared to 2005 (60.90 ± 16.9 vs. 53.21 ± 16.75 years, P = 0.002). Hemorrhagic strokes among females increased over the last decade. Female strokes with dyslipidemia were significantly lower in 2017 compared to 2005 (P = 0.002). Proportion of hypertensive and diabetic strokes were not significantly different between these two periods.
CONCLUSIONS: Over the past decade, the mean age of stroke onset has increased while the prevalence of dyslipidemia has reduced significantly among Indian female stroke patients.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) after primary therapy is a common condition, causing physical and psychological distress. Decongestive lymphedema therapy (DLT) using multi-layered compression bandages is an effective treatment. We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of a specific mobilizing bandage (Mobiderm®) on lymphedema volume reduction during the intensive phase of DLT. Methods and Results: Fifty female BCRL patients were randomized to receive either conventional multi-layered bandages or mobilizing bandaging by using Mobiderm. Affected limb volume and excess volume were evaluated at baseline (D0) and after 15 days. The primary outcome was change in affected limb volume after adjustment for baseline. Symptom scores were evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS); safety and tolerability were also assessed. Baseline characteristics were comparable. Affected limb volume reduction was observed in both study groups after 15 days: by 19.0% in the Mobiderm arm and 8.6% in controls (adjusted values). The between-group mean difference in adjusted volume reduction at day 15 was 256 mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 92.5 to 421.3 mL; p = 0.003) favoring Mobiderm. Reductions in excess volume of 57.3% (Mobiderm) and 25.1% (controls) were observed (adjusted values); with between-group mean difference in adjusted excess volume of 220.2 mL (95% CI, 69.3 to 371.3 mL; p = 0.006) favoring Mobiderm. Pain/heaviness VAS scores fell significantly in both groups, with mean reductions of 1.84 (Mobiderm) versus 0.83 (control; p = 0.001). Both regimens were well tolerated. Conclusion: The use of Mobiderm in multilayer compression bandaging shows benefit in lymphedema reduction and in alleviating functional symptoms/pain in patients with BRCL.

AB  - Nature and nurture have always been a prerogative of evolutionary biologists. The environment's role in shaping an organism's phenotype has always intrigued us. Since the inception of humankind, twinning has existed with an unsettled parley on the contribution of nature (i.e. genetics) versus nurture (i.e. environment), which can influence the phenotypes. The study of twins measures the genetic contribution and that of the environmental influence for a particular trait, acting as a catalyst, fine-tuning the phenotypic trajectories. This is further evident because a number of human diseases show a spectrum of clinical manifestations with the same underlying molecular aberration. As of now, there is no definite way to conclude just from the genomic data the severity of a disease or even to predict who will get affected. This greatly justifies initiating a twin registry for a country as diverse and populated as India. There is an unmet need to set up a nationwide database to carefully curate the information on twins, serving as a valuable biorepository to study their overall susceptibility to disease. Establishing a twin registry is of paramount importance to harness the wealth of human information related to the biomedical, anthropological, cultural, social and economic significance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to study the impact of temporary legislation implemented during Diwali on ocular firecracker injuries in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) region.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, records of the patients presenting with ocular firecracker injury during 10 days of Diwali (prediwali, Diwali and 8 days postdiwali) from 2014 to 2019 were retreived from the medical record section. Clinico-demographic profile, relevant history pertaining to the use of firecracker, and details of eye examination, namely presenting visual acuity (VA), laterality and classification of injury based on Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology System were noted.
RESULTS: Six hundred and sixty-seven eyes of 646 patients were recruited. The median age of patients was 14 years (R = 3-65 years) and male: Female ratio was 4.9:1. Majority of patients (57.7%; n = 373) were from outside Delhi. Most of them were open globe injuries (66.8%). In 55.4% (n = 356) eyes, presenting VA was perception of light to finger counting close to face and 28% (n = 180) eyes could not perceive any light. A significant reduction was noted in the number of ocular firecrcaker injuries after regulation (preregulation [2014-2016] n = 456; postregulation [2017-2019] n = 211; [P = 0.01, t-test]). During preregulation period, presenting VA was worse than 1/60 in significantly higher number of eyes (85.5%; n = 376) than post regulation (78.8%, n = 160) (P = 0.03, Chi-square test).
CONCLUSION: Although temporary legislation seems to be effective in reducing ocular firecracker injuries (52.7% reduction) in NCR, uniform implementation of stricter laws nationwide is essential to further minimize the problem.

T2  - Indian Journal of Ophthalmology
AB  - Myopia or short-sightedness is an emerging pandemic affecting more than 50% population in South-Asian countries. It is associated with several sight-threatening complications, such as retinal detachment and choroidal neovascularization, leading to an increased burden of visual impairment and blindness. The pathophysiology of myopia involves a complex interplay of numerous environmental and genetic factors leading to progressive axial elongation. Environmental factors such as decreased outdoor activity, reduced exposure to ambient light, strenuous near work, and role of family history of myopia have been implicated with increased prevalence of this refractive error. While multiple clinical trials have been undertaken to devise appropriate treatment strategies and target the modifiable risk factors, there is no single treatment modality with ideal results; therefore, formulating a comprehensive approach is required to control the myopia epidemic. This review article summarizes the epidemiology, dynamic concepts of pathophysiology, and evolution of the treatment modalities for myopia such as pharmacological (atropine and other agents) and optical methods (spectacles, contact lenses, and orthokeratology).

AB  - Aim This study aimed to compare the long-term outcome of implant therapy in partially edentulous patients with severe periodontitis compared to those with no history of periodontitis.Design Retrospective cohort study.Cohort selection Eighty-eight patients (34 men and 54 women; age ranging from 28 to 45 years) with severe periodontitis (47 patients with 108 implants) and no history of periodontitis (41 patients with 78 implants) were included in this institutional study. All these cohorts had received implants 6-8 years previously.Data analysis Probing pocket depth, radiographic marginal bone level and peri-implantitis were the primary outcomes, while bleeding on probing was the secondary outcome. The effect of variables was measured by odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Both patient-level and implant-level analyses were used to evaluate the association between peri-implantitis and potential risk factors. In addition, the association between probing pocket depth and radiographic marginal bone level with potential risk factors was assessed at implant-level analyses. In contrast, for patient-level data, a positive relationship was assessed with the Chi-square test.Results Patients with a history of severe periodontitis (OR = 11.13; p = 0.045), implants with a lack (<2 mm) of peri-implant keratinised mucosa (OR = 14.94; p <0.001) and implants placed in bone-grafted sites (OR = 4.93; p = 0.047) were associated with greater risk of peri-implantitis, at 6-8 years post-implant placement. The risk of developing radiographic marginal bone level ≥3 mm was significantly greater (OR = 1.20; p <0.001) in patients with higher full-mouth bleeding scores. The chance of peri-implant bleeding on probing was independently and especially higher in patients who brushed their teeth at most once per day (OR = 3.20; p = 0.04), with higher full-mouth bleeding score values (OR = 1.16; p <0.001) and irregular recall visits (OR = 15.34; p = 0.001).Conclusion This retrospective cohort study concluded that partially edentulous patients with a history of severe periodontitis were more prone to develop peri-implantitis at 6-8 years post-implant placement.

TI  - Does a high-sugar diet alter the bacterial diversity of the oral cavity?
AU  - Dhingra, Kunaal
AU  - Jeng, Jiiang-Huei
T2  - Evidence-Based Dentistry
AB  - DATA SOURCES: The electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct from 2010 onwards were searched to identify the eligible studies to determine the effect of sugar intake on oral microbiota diversity.
STUDY SELECTION: Clinical trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies in English and Spanish language were selected by four reviewers independently.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction (which comprised authors and year of publication, type of study, patients, origin, selection criteria, method of determining sugar consumption, amplified region, relevant results, and bacteria identified in patients with high sugar intake) was performed by three reviewers. Quality assessment of included studies was done by two reviewers using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: 374 papers were identified through three databases searched, out of which eight studies were finally selected. These included two interventional studies, two case-control studies, and four cohort studies. All except one study reported that the richness and diversity of oral microbes in the saliva, dental biofilm, and oral swab sample were significantly lower in participants with higher sugar consumption. There was a decrease in the population of certain bacteria but an enhancement of specific bacterial genera, such as Streptococcus, Scardovia, Veillonella, Rothia, Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus. Additionally, communities associated with high sugar intake showed enrichment of sucrose and starch metabolism pathways. All eight included studies had a low risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of the included studies, the authors concluded that consuming a sugar-rich diet leads to dysbiosis of the oral ecosystem, thereby increasing carbohydrate metabolism and the overall metabolic activity of oral microorganisms.

AB  - PET/computed tomography (CT) with fluorodeoxyglucose and nonfluorodeoxyglucose PET tracers has established itself in the management of malignant disorders. Its role in the assessment of nonmalignant conditions, such as infectious and noninfectious inflammatory diseases and other benign conditions, has emerged independently and alongside its role being evaluated in malignancy and continues to evolve. It is evident that PET/CT has the potential to play a significant role in various nonmalignant disorders of the thorax. This review highlights current developments and areas where PET/CT has a potential to impact the clinical management of nonmalignant thoracic conditions with special focus on nonfluorodeoxyglucose tracers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxygen delivery devices with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) valves have been described, but high inspiratory flows may lead to poor tolerance in tachypneic patients. Positive expiratory pressure oxygen therapy (PEP-OT) using an occlusive face mask, oxygen reservoir, and PEEP valve has not been evaluated in clinical settings.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a single-arm intervention trial, patients aged 19-55 years admitted with acute respiratory illness with oxygen support were enrolled. PEP-OT trial was given with PEEP of 5 and 7 cm of water over 45 minutes. Feasibility was assessed as uninterrupted completion of the PEP-OT trial. The effects of PEP-OT on cardiopulmonary physiology and adverse effects of therapy were recorded.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (6 males) were enrolled. Fourteen patients had pneumonia and one patient had pulmonary edema. Twelve patients (80%) completed the PEP-OT trial. There was significant improvement in respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate (HR) at the end of the 45-minute PEP-OT trial (p-values 0.048 and 0.003, respectively). There was a trend toward improved SpO2 and perceived dyspnea. None of the patients developed desaturation, shock, or air leaks. Positive expiratory pressure oxygen therapy is a feasible oxygen therapy in patients with acute hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: Positive expiratory pressure oxygen therapy seems to be safe and has a positive impact on respiratory mechanics in parenchymal respiratory pathology.

AB  - Extreme complexity in the Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA) system and its nomenclature makes it difficult to interpret and integrate relevant information for HLA associations with diseases, Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) and Transplantation. PubMed search displays ~ 146,000 studies on HLA reported from diverse locations. Currently, IPD-IMGT/HLA (Robinson et al., Nucleic Acids Research 48:D948-D955, 2019) database houses data on 28,320 HLA alleles. We developed an automated pipeline with a unified graphical user interface HLA-SPREAD that provides a structured information on SNPs, Populations, REsources, ADRs and Diseases information. Information on HLA was extracted from ~ 28 million PubMed abstracts extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Python scripts were used to mine and curate information on diseases, filter false positives and categorize to 24 tree hierarchical groups and named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithms followed by semantic analysis to infer HLA association(s). This resource from 109 countries and 40 ethnic groups provides interesting insights on: markers associated with allelic/haplotypic association in autoimmune, cancer, viral and skin diseases, transplantation outcome and ADRs for hypersensitivity. Summary information on clinically relevant biomarkers related to HLA disease associations with mapped susceptible/risk alleles are readily retrievable from HLASPREAD. The resource is available at URL http://hla-spread.igib.res.in/ . This resource is first of its kind that can help uncover novel patterns in HLA gene-disease associations.

AB  - To assess the global research landscape in the field of Posterior urethral valve (PUV), a scientometric study was conducted to determine the quantity and quality of the research output and get insight into the key research areas and pattern of collaboration in the research community.
METHODS: Primary data was acquired from the Scopus® database. Various parameters like the total research productivity, citations, citations per publication, citations per year, citations per publication per year, the scientific output of countries, institutions, authors, and journals were calculated. Key research areas were inferred by examining the top-cited articles (citations >150). Collaborative maps were generated by calculating co-authorship links amongst countries and authors using VOSviewer software.
RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred fourteen results were found published from 1913 to 2019, receiving a total of 27,253 citations, authored by 5138 authors from 125 countries. The top three countries were the United States of America (USA), India, and the United Kingdom (UK). The leading institutes were the Children's Hospital Boston, USA (n = 48), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS, Delhi), India (n = 38), and Great Ormond Street Hospital, UK (n- = 27). The journals which published the most articles on PUV were the Journal of Urology (n = 278), Journal of Pediatric Urology (n = 121), followed by Urology (n = 86). Leading authors were Glassberg, K. L and Bajpai M (n = 17, each), Canning DA & Kajbafzadeh, AM (n = 16, each), followed by Peters CA with 14 manuscripts. The top-cited documents (n = 10) received 2104 citations and were published between 1986 and 2010. The key areas of interest found were "long-term outcomes" (n = 4) and "fetal surgery" (n = 2). The most productive countries were also the most collaborative countries (the USA and UK).
CONCLUSION: In the research landscape of PUV, the USA, Children's Hospital Boston, and Glassberg, K. L, along with Bajpai, M were the top contributors in terms of the country, organization, and authors, respectively. The "Journal of Urology" and "Pediatric Nephrology" stands out in terms of bibliometric parameters considered. The hotspot topics based on the number of citations received were "long-term outcomes" and "fetal surgery" in PUV. The most productive countries were also the most collaborative countries (the USA and UK).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of times a research work gets cited by another article is one of the article-level metrics for assessing the quality of a research publication. Citation analysis by bibliometric review has been performed in several disciplines. The current study was aimed to systematically review the literature available on pediatric inguinal hernia since 1960 in terms of the 25 most cited articles in this field and analyze the bibliometric variables author and organizational collaborative patterns.
METHODS: Thomson Reuters Web of Science citation indexing database and research platform were used to retrieve the most cited articles in pediatric inguinal hernia (PIH) using appropriate search strings. The characteristics (name of authors, the total number of authors, the title of publication, journal of publication, year of publication, etc.) of the 25 top-cited articles were recorded. Specific bibliographical parameters were derived and analyzed. Visualization maps were generated using VOSviewer software.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that the Journal of Pediatric Surgery was leading the choice of journal for publication. While most of the publications originated from the United States of America, Schier was the most influential author. Five of the eight top-productive authors are also the most connected.
CONCLUSION: Articles on laparoscopic repair in PIH have been heavily cited. Following the United States of America, Turkey stands out as the topmost productive country in PIH. The publications on PIH show that "collaboration" is the bridging force between productivity and influence on the academic community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the global assimilation of "publish and perish" culture into institutional academics, there has been an exponential rise in the publication numbers. There are ~2500 PUBMED entries related to "anorectal malformation (ARM)." The young clinician in his pursuit to translate experimental research to bedside often finds himself lost "in the midst of plenty." This bibliometric analysis has been conducted to codify the seminal work on ARM for future reference and pay tribute to the most impactful articles.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thomson Reuters Web of Science citation indexing database and research platform was used to retrieve the most cited articles in ARM using appropriate search strings. The characteristics (name of authors, the total number of authors, the title of publication, journal of publication, year of publication, etc.,) of the 50 top-cited articles were analyzed.
RESULTS: The analysis revealed that the Journal of Paediatric Surgery was leading the choice of journal for publication. While most of the publications originated from the United States of America, Alberto Pena was the most influential author. The most studied topic was on associated malformations, and the most common study design was cohort studies.
CONCLUSION: The approach of citation analysis provided us an opportunity to retrieve the most influential articles on ARM. The trends in research in ARM have also been analyzed, spreading over five decades.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neglected peroneal tendon dislocation with iatrogenic etiology has been rarely reported in the literature and its management has not been fully understood to date.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 25-year-old male who presented with pain over the posterolateral aspect of his left ankle which was diagnosed to be a case of neglected peroneal tendon dislocation of iatrogenic etiology. Peroneal groove deepening with superior retinaculum repair was done in the patient along with loose body removal and osteophyte excision. Subsequent fibrosis augmented with the deepening of the groove maintained peroneal tendon position in the retromalleolar groove. On post-operative follow-up, the patient was completely satisfied with relief of pain and no complications. He also regained full range of motion and could walk without support.
CONCLUSION: Surgical intervention of fibular groove deepening with superior peroneal retinaculum reconstruction results in an excellent outcome for neglected peroneal tendon dislocation.

AB  - Hallux valgus is a common forefoot deformity characterized by medial deviation of the first metatarsal and lateral deviation of the hallux. More than 150 procedures have been described for the hallux valgus deformity with no proven superiority of one over the other. The initial osteotomies are open, and with the advent of power and micro instruments, the osteotomies were manageable via mini incisions and percutaneous procedures. The minimally invasive procedures have been divided into three generations. The first-generation osteotomies involve wedge correction. The second and third-generation osteotomies are translational. The second generation is a simple osteotomy, and the third is a chevron-type osteotomy. In our technique, we have used a hybrid procedure of second and third-generation procedures. The technique uses an ultrasonic bone scalpel to create a transverse sub-capital osteotomy which is then fixed with screws for a stable construct.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypervascularity of the rotator interval with increased expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor may be the causative factor of conventionally managed adhesive capsulitis. Hence, transcatheter arterial embolisation(TAE) has emerged as an alternative treatment option to occlude the target neovessels by infusing an embolic agent. The present study reviews the literature regarding the efficacy of the TAE for adhesive capsulitis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The systematic review was performed following PRISMA guidelines. MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Cochrane database of systemic reviews (CDSR) were searched for relevant publication (from 1960 to 2021). The search algorithm used was Transcatheter arterial embolisation and resistant adhesive capsulitis or refractory adhesive capsulitis or vascular adhesive capsulitis. The database search produced a total of 12026 publications. After exclusion of the non relevant titles, 113 abstracts were reviewed. From these abstracts, three full-text articles were obtained for final review.
RESULTS: All the studies were analyzed in depth. Patients with no or minimal improvement with conservative treatment for at least 3 months underwent TAE. Pre and post embolisation visual analog score(VAS), shoulder range of motion(ROM) were noted. Any additional therapy was also taken into account. Significant improvement of the VAS score and shoulder ROM was noted immediately after surgery and maintained till final follow up at 24.5 months.
CONCLUSION: Resistant cases of adhesive capsulitis can be managed successfully with TAE. But ample evidence is lacking regarding the appropriate patient selection and efficacy of TAE as a sole management option of resistant AC.

AB  - Background It is well known that some viral infections may affect male fertility. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can lead to multiorgan damage through the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor, abundant in testicular tissue. However, little information is available regarding the shedding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in semen and its impact on spermatogenesis and fertility potential. We planned to investigate the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of COVID-19 males and to study the effect of COVID-19 on semen quality and sperm DNA fragmentation index. Material and method Thirty COVID-19 male patients aged 19-45 registered to AIIMS Patna hospital participated in the survey between October 2020 and April 2021. We conducted a real-time reverse transcriptase test on all the semen samples. Detailed semen analysis, including the sperm DNA Fragmentation Index, was done at first sampling that is during COVID-19. After 74 days of the first sampling, we obtained the second sampling and repeated all the above tests. Results All semen samples collected in the first and second sampling tested with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In the first sampling, semen volume, vitality, total motility, sperm concentration, total sperm count, % normal morphology, % cytoplasmic droplet, and fructose were significantly lower. In contrast, semen agglutination, % head defect, DNA Fragmentation Index, liquefaction time, semen viscosity, and leukocytes were increased. These findings were reversed at the second sampling but not to the optimum level. All these findings were statistically significant (p < 0.05 for all). Thus, COVID-19 negatively affects semen parameters, including sperm DNA fragmentation index. Conclusion Although we could not find SARS-CoV-2 in the semen, the semen quality remained poor until the second sampling. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) clinics and sperm banking facilities should consider assessing the semen of COVID-19 males and exclude men with a positive history of SARS-CoV-2 until their semen quality returns to normal.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with temporal lobe epilepsy are subjected to standard temporal lobectomy wherever indicated. This is performed using a reverse question mark flap and a standard frontotemporal craniotomy. We describe the technique of minitemporal craniotomy (3 × 3cms) for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and analyze the clinical outcomes of patients operated using this approach.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the technique of minitemporal craniotomy for TLE without navigation guidance and to analyze the clinical outcomes of patients operated using this approach.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: This was a retrospective analysis of all consecutive TLE cases operated at our institute from 2014 to 2019, via minitemporal craniotomy, using surface landmarks only without navigation guidance. The surgical technique, indications for surgery, and their clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total number of 48 patients underwent surgery for TLE. There were no complications except three patients who had transient hemiparesis. The average duration of hospital stay was 4 days following surgery. Out of 28 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis, 22 (82%) had international league against epilepsy, Class I seizure outcome, 4 (12.5%) had Class II outcome and 2 (5.5%) had Class III outcome. 9 patients with dysembryoplastic neurectodermal tumor (DNET), 4 gangliogliomas, 2 neurocystecercosis (NCC), all had Class I outcome. Out of the five patients with MTS and associated anterior temporal focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), four (80%) had a Class I outcome, whereas one (20%) had Class II outcome.
CONCLUSION: Utilizing surface anatomical landmarks, minitemporal craniotomy can be performed in even peripheral centers without neuronavigation, with good cosmesis, seizure outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is associated with cognitive deficits, and age at diagnosis is thought to play a substantial role. However, there are limited data for the cognitive performance in young adults, in relation to the age of diabetes onset. The lack of information is particularly striking in the context of developing regions.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from August 2018 to July 2020. We included adult participants with T1DM, stratified by the age of diabetes onset (till 6 years of age, between 7 to 12 years of age, and 13 to < 18 years of age) and compared them with the control group (no diabetes or pre-diabetes). We filled a structured case record proforma for all participants and recorded relevant socio-demographic and medical details. Detailed neuropsychological assessment with 13 psychological tests representing four cognitive domains was carried-(1) attention, working memory and executive functions; (2) learning and memory; (3) visuoperceptual functions; and (4) information processing speed.
RESULTS: We evaluated 100 individuals, 73 (men 48.0%) with T1DM and 27 (men 51.9%) without T1DM. After adjustment for age, gender and education, the mean differences in composite Z scores (for the four cognitive domains) between participants with T1DM and without T1DM were 0.08 for attention, working memory and executive functions (p = 0.614); 0.07 for learning and memory (p = 0.694); 0.05 for visuoperceptual (p = 0.784); and 0.22 for information processing speed (p = 0.305). No significant differences were found for the three subgroups of individuals with T1DM, when compared with the control group. Effect size (Cohen's d) for the individual tests (n = 13) ranged from - 0.36 to + 0.39, and none of the comparisons were statistically significant. Amongst the participants with T1DM, higher education had a significant positive association with three of the four cognitive domains evaluated.
CONCLUSIONS: To conclude, our findings suggest minimal differences in the cognitive functioning of patients with T1DM with different age of onset of diabetes compared to healthy controls, when evaluated in early adulthood. This is possibly the first study from South Asia with an in-depth and comprehensive assessment of cognitive functions in patients with T1DM, using a detailed neuropsychological battery.

AB  - Lp-PLA2 is an enzyme encoded by the PLA2G7 gene located at chromosome 6p12-21, which is included in different signal transduction pathways. The potential of serum levels of Lp-PLA2 as a marker of inflammation quantifying cardio-metabolic risk, renal impairment and oxidative stress has been explored in earlier studies. It has also been used in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatic disease, metabolic conditions and exercise tolerance. Additionally, it shows promising evidence for the assessment of risk for certain cardiovascular conditions in otherwise seemingly healthy individuals. COVID-19 has affected life and the economy globally. The identification of biomarkers to assess the sickness and treatment plan is the need of the hour. This review summarizes the pathophysiological inter-relationship between serum levels of Lp-PLA2 and COVID-19. The authors hypothesize that the estimation of Lp-PLA2 levels may help in the early identification of risk and thus may play a beneficial role in the proactive management of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a rare and aggressive plasma cell neoplasm distinguished by extensive clonal expansion of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). PCL is divided into two subtypes: primary (pPCL) originates de novo without preceding multiple myeloma, while secondary (sPCL) comprises a leukemic modification that occurs as a late manifestation from previous multiple myeloma (MM). pPCL and sPCL are clinically and biologically two different entities. The molecular mechanisms of the development of PCL, either primary or secondary, remain poorly understood. We aim to present 5 years of data on clinical profiles and treatment outcomes of pPCL and sPCL patients treated at our cancer hospital in India and to find a predictive parameter of the development of PCL in cases of MM.
METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively reviewed and evaluated the clinicopathological features, laboratory parameters, immunophenotypic profile, and patient outcomes of 17 PCL cases diagnosed among 180 plasma cell dyscrasia patients during the study period to establish a correlation between pPCL & sPCL for diagnosis and management of PCL.
RESULTS: A total of 17 PCL patients were diagnosed among 180 plasma cell dyscrasia patients during the study period. Among PCL patients, 9 cases had pPCL (52.94% of all PCL patients), and 8 cases had sPCL (47.06% of all PCL patients). Peculiar differences were seen between the two PCL types. Both types of PCL had a younger age at the time of diagnosis, having elevated BM plasma cell infiltration percentage, frequent anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) levels, raised LDH levels, and positive M-protein in both serum and urine. In addition, SFLC assay and Immunofixation assay showed higher κ and lower λ in pPCL compared with sPCL (P<0.05). Higher Renal insufficiency was also observed in pPCL compared to sPCL (P=0.335). The survival and response to treatment of PCL patients remain considerably poor, sPCL exhibit shorter overall survival (OS) than pPCL with (median 1.75 months vs. 7 months respectively, P=0.1682). Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) needs to be diagnosed early and requires prompt initiation of treatment before patients get complications.
CONCLUSION: Our study characterizes the clinical and laboratory features of pPCL and sPCL and may aid physicians in prognosticating the course of disease of their patients. However, future multicentre studies are the need of the hour to develop accurate diagnostic criteria and establish the efficacy of therapeutic regimens.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease globally and in India. The already high burden of NAFLD in India is expected to further increase in the future in parallel with the ongoing epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the community, it is crucial to identify those at risk of progressive liver disease to streamline referral and guide proper management. Existing guidelines on NAFLD by various international societies fail to capture the entire landscape of NAFLD in India and are often difficult to incorporate in clinical practice due to fundamental differences in sociocultural aspects and health infrastructure available in India. A lot of progress has been made in the field of NAFLD in the 7 years since the initial position paper by the Indian National Association for the Study of Liver on NAFLD in 2015. Further, the ongoing debate on the nomenclature of NAFLD is creating undue confusion among clinical practitioners. The ensuing comprehensive review provides consensus-based, guidance statements on the nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment of NAFLD that are practically implementable in the Indian setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: No meta-analysis has analysed the safety and efficacy of lobeglitazone in type-2 diabetes (T2DM). We undertook this meta-analysis to address this knowledge-gap.
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for RCTs involving type-2 diabetes patients receiving lobeglitazone in intervention arm, and placebo/active comparator in control arm. Primary outcome was to evaluate changes in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate alterations in glucose, lipids and adverse events.
RESULTS: From initially screened 65 articles, data from 4 RCTs (828 patients) which fulfilled all criteria was analysed. Over 24 weeks, when compared to sitagliptin 100 mg/d and half maximal pioglitazone dose (15 mg/d), lobeglitazone 0.5 mg/day had comparable impact on HbA1c [MD 0.03% (95%CI: 0.11-0.17); P = 0.65; I2 = 0%], fasting glucose [MD 1.47 mg/dl (95%CI: 4.66-7.60); P = 0.64; I2 = 0%], triglycerides [MD-9.96 mg/dl (95%CI: 43.55-23.62); P = 0.56; I2 = 81%], LDL-cholesterol [MD0.74 mg/dl (95%CI: 4.60-6.09); P = 0.79; I2 = 0%] and HDL-cholesterol [MD1.55 mg/dl (95%CI: 3.72-6.82); P = 0.56]. Occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) [RR 1.07 (95% CI:0.78-1.47); P = 0.67; I2 = 0%] and severe AEs [RR 1.05(95%CI: 0.42-2.65); P = 0.91; I2 = 0%] were similar. Edema and weight gain were significantly higher with lobeglitazone compared to controls [RR 2.58 (95%CI: 1.08-6.17); P = 0.03; I2 = 0%]. Lobeglitazone 0.5 mg/d compared to half-maximal pioglitazone (15 mg/d), had similar edema and weight gain [RR 1.65 95% CI: 0.78-1.47)]. BMD percent changes at neck of femur was comparable in both groups [MD 0.07% (95%CI: 0.19-0.33); P = 0.60; I2 = 91%]. Low dose lobeglitazone (0.25 mg/d) was inferior to high dose lobeglitazone (0.5 mg/d) with regards to glycaemic efficacy with advantage of lower weight gain and edema.
CONCLUSION: The current evidence makes lobeglitazone unlikely to replace pioglitazone as the preferred thiazolidinedione in T2DM.

AB  - Small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) are aggressive tumors with high propensity to metastasize. Recent NCCN guidelines have incorporated immunotherapy in extensive stage SCLC. Limited benefit in few patients compounded by side effects of unwonted immune-checkpoint-inhibitor (ICPI) usage necessitates identification of potential biomarkers predicting response to ICPIs. Attempting this, we analysed expression of various immunoregulatory molecules in tissue biopsies and paired blood samples of SCLC patients. In 40 cases, immunohistochemistry for expression of immune inhibitory receptors CTLA-4, PD-L1 and IDO1 was performed. Matched blood samples were quantified for IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α and sCTLA-4 levels using immunoassay and additionally for IDO1 activity (Kynurenine/Tryptophan ratio) using LC-MS. Immunopositivity for PD-L1, IDO1 and CTLA-4 was identified in 9.3%, 6.2% and 71.8% cases, respectively. Concentration of serum IFN-γ (p-value < 0.001), TNF-α (p-value = 0.025) and s-CTLA4 (p-value = 0.08) were higher in SCLC patients while IL-2 was lower (p-value = 0.003) as compared to healthy controls. IDO1 activity was significantly elevated in SCLC cohort (p-value = 0.007). We proffer that SCLC patients show immune suppressive milieu in their peripheral circulation. Analysis of CTLA4 immunohistochemical expression along with s-CTLA4 levels appears prospective as biomarkers for predicting responsiveness to ICPIs. Additionally, evaluation of IDO1 appears cogent both as prognostic marker and potential therapeutic target as well.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The causal association between IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and celiac disease (CeD) is based on their clinical coexistence. In this prospective study, we screened patients with IgAN for CeD and explored the utility of analysis of IgA anti-TG2 antibody deposits, for establishing a causal association.
METHODS: Biopsy-proven patients of IgAN were screened for serum IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA anti-tTG Ab) titer and thereafter were invited to undergo endoscopic duodenal biopsy. Corresponding duodenal and kidney biopsies were subjected to IgA anti-TG2 antibody colocalization study using dual-color immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques. Additionally, kidney biopsies from 105 patients with IgAN who did not give consent for serology analysis, 30 non-IgA nephropathies, and 10 normal controls were also included. Dual-color-stained slides were interpreted based on stain distribution and intensity scores, and Pearson's index >0.3-1 on confocal imaging was considered significant.
RESULTS: Of a cohort of 151 patients with IgAN, 32 consented to undergo sero-screening and 5 of them had high serum anti-tTG Ab titer. Two out of the latter consented to endoscopic duodenal biopsies, in whom modified Marsh grade 3b changes were identified. Strong IgA anti-TG2 antibody deposits were noted in the kidney and duodenal biopsies of these patients. One patient out of non-consenting 105 patients with IgAN and 3 out of 30 patients with other non-IgA nephropathies also showed IgA anti-TG2 deposits. None of the healthy kidney tissues showed IgA anti-TG2 Ab deposits.
CONCLUSIONS: Co-localized IgA anti-TG2 deposits in the kidney biopsies in patients with IgAN help to establish a pathogenic link with CeD. A small proportion of patients with IgAN have associated CeD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) is a World Health Organization grade 1 neoplasm, which, due to its dubious morphologic features, may be misdiagnosed as a high-grade tumor at times. This tumor shows binary immunoexpression including both glial and neural markers, leading to a state of diagnostic quandary. Recent evidences have surmised the diagnostic utility of thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), spurring us to study the practicality of this marker in distinguishing SEGAs from its mimics.
METHODS: In this study, TTF-1 immunohistochemistry using clone 8G7G3/1 (1:50) was performed in 38 cases of SEGA, 30 cases of central neurocytoma, 10 cases each of intraventricular glioblastoma and ependymoma, and 5 cases of cortical tubers. Additionally, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf (BRAFV600E) mutation, a common genetic alteration in pediatric low-grade-glial tumors with neuronal-differentiation, was analyzed using Ventana immunohistochemistry platform.
RESULTS: TTF-1 immunopositivity was seen in all 38 cases (100%) of SEGAs, with 20 cases (52.6%) showing diffuse (>50% of tumor area) expression while focal (<50%) immunopositivity was seen in 18 cases (47.3%). None of the cases demonstrated serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf immunolabeling. Barring 2 cases of neurocytoma (6.6%), all other cases including ependymoma, glioblastoma, and cortical tubers were immunonegative for TTF-1.
CONCLUSIONS: The congruous finding of TTF-1 expression in SEGA and cells of the developing neuroepithelium in the medial ganglionic eminence hint toward a primogenitor cell with neoplastic potential in the presence of impelling factors.

AB  - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) exhibits intrinsic heterogeneity at the molecular level that aids in distinguishing between its two prominent subtypes - Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC). This paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI)-based deep learning framework to discover a small set of NSCLC biomarkers. The proposed framework comprises three modules - an autoencoder to shrink the input feature space, a feed-forward neural network to classify NSCLC instances into LUAD and LUSC, and a biomarker discovery module that leverages the combined network comprising the autoencoder and the feed-forward neural network. In the biomarker discovery module, XAI methods uncovered a set of 52 relevant biomarkers for NSCLC subtype classification. To evaluate the classification performance of the discovered biomarkers, multiple machine-learning models are constructed using these biomarkers. Using 10-Fold cross-validation, Multilayer Perceptron achieved an accuracy of 95.74% (±1.27) at 95% confidence interval. Further, using Drug-Gene Interaction Database, we observe that 14 of the discovered biomarkers are druggable. In addition, 28 biomarkers aid the prediction of the survivability of the patients. Out of 52 discovered biomarkers, we find that 45 biomarkers have been reported in previous studies on distinguishing between the two NSCLC subtypes. To the best of our knowledge, the remaining seven biomarkers have not yet been reported for NSCLC subtyping and could be further explored for their contribution to targeted therapy of lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is an aggressive, uncommon malignancy, with variation in operative approaches adopted across centres and few large-scale studies to guide practice. We aimed to identify the extent of heterogeneity in GBC internationally to better inform the need for future multicentre studies.
METHODS: A 34-question online survey was disseminated to members of the European-African Hepatopancreatobiliary Association (EAHPBA), American Hepatopancreatobiliary Association (AHPBA) and Asia-Pacific Hepatopancreatobiliary Association (A-PHPBA) regarding practices around diagnostic workup, operative approach, utilization of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies and surveillance strategies.
RESULTS: Two hundred and three surgeons responded from 51 countries. High liver resection volume units (>50 resections/year) organised HPB multidisciplinary team discussion of GBCs more commonly than those with low volumes (p < 0.0001). Management practices exhibited areas of heterogeneity, particularly around operative extent. Contrary to consensus guidelines, anatomical liver resections were favoured over non-anatomical resections for T3 tumours and above, lymphadenectomy extent was lower than recommended, and a minority of respondents still routinely excised the common bile duct or port sites.
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest some similarities in the management of GBC internationally, but also specific areas of practice which differed from published guidelines. Transcontinental collaborative studies on GBC are necessary to establish evidence-based practice to minimise variation and optimise outcomes.

AB  - RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To compare dual energy CT (DECT) quantitative metrics and radiomics for differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions on contrast enhanced abdomen CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 103 patients who underwent contrast-enhanced DECT for assessing focal pancreatic lesions at one of the two hospitals (Site A: age 68 ± 12 yrs; malignant = 41, benign = 18; Site B: age 46 ± 2 yrs; malignant = 23, benign = 21). All malignant lesions had histologic confirmation, and benign lesions were stable on follow up CT (>12 months) or had characteristic benign features on MRI. Arterial-phase, low- and high-kV DICOM images were processed with the DECT Tumor Analysis (DETA) to obtain DECT quantitative metrics such as HU, iodine and water content from a region of interest (ROI) over focal pancreatic lesions. Separately, we obtained DECT radiomics from the same ROI. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics to generate area under the curve (AUC) for best predictive variables.
RESULTS: DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics had AUCs of 0.98-0.99 at site A and 0.89-0.94 at site B data for classifying benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. There was no significant difference in the AUCs and accuracies of DECT quantitative metrics and radiomics from lesion rims and volumes among patients at both sites (p > 0.05). Supervised learning-based model with data from the two sites demonstrated best AUCs of 0.94 (DECT radiomics) and 0.90 (DECT quantitative metrics) for characterizing pancreatic lesions as benign or malignant.
CONCLUSION: Compared to complex DECT radiomics, quantitative DECT information provide a simpler but accurate method of differentiating benign and malignant pancreatic lesions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which health care systems have adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic to provide necessary cardiac diagnostic services is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on cardiac testing practices, volumes and types of diagnostic services, and perceived psychological stress to health care providers worldwide.
METHODS: The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a worldwide survey assessing alterations from baseline in cardiovascular diagnostic care at the pandemic's onset and 1 year later. Multivariable regression was used to determine factors associated with procedure volume recovery.
RESULTS: Surveys were submitted from 669 centers in 107 countries. Worldwide reduction in cardiac procedure volumes of 64% from March 2019 to April 2020 recovered by April 2021 in high- and upper middle-income countries (recovery rates of 108% and 99%) but remained depressed in lower middle- and low-income countries (46% and 30% recovery). Although stress testing was used 12% less frequently in 2021 than in 2019, coronary computed tomographic angiography was used 14% more, a trend also seen for other advanced cardiac imaging modalities (positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance; 22%-25% increases). Pandemic-related psychological stress was estimated to have affected nearly 40% of staff, impacting patient care at 78% of sites. In multivariable regression, only lower-income status and physicians' psychological stress were significant in predicting recovery of cardiac testing.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac diagnostic testing has yet to recover to prepandemic levels in lower-income countries. Worldwide, the decrease in standard stress testing is offset by greater use of advanced cardiac imaging modalities. Pandemic-related psychological stress among providers is widespread and associated with poor recovery of cardiac testing.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare epilepsy-related injuries in untreated or inadequately treated patients and patients on adequate treatment.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional case-control study, seizure-related injuries in patients who were either on no treatment or inadequate treatment were compared with another group of patients receiving appropriate evidence-based epilepsy treatment. The inadequately treated patients or 'cases' were drawn from an outreach epilepsy clinic while the adequately treated patients or 'controls' were recruited from a tertiary care facility providing comprehensive epilepsy management.
RESULTS: The odds of injury were eight times higher in inadequately treated patients or cases compared to the adequately treated patients or controls. After adjusting for gender, epilepsy duration, seizure frequency, current medication, and number of AEDs, the odds of injury were 15. 8 times higher in the cases. Major injuries such as burns, fractures, and tooth injuries were also higher in the cases.
CONCLUSION: Untreated or inadequately treated epilepsy patients have a significantly higher risk of injuries. With adequate treatment, some of the risks of injury can be mitigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis (compensated advanced chronic liver disease [cACLD]) are clinically indistinguishable and increase risk of developing clinically significant portal hypertension. Baveno VII recommends using elastography to rule out and diagnose cACLD with liver stiffness measurement (LSM) cut-offs of 10/15 kPa.
METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of 330 nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, performance of the Baveno VII cut-offs for diagnosing cACLD was compared with newly suggested lower cut-offs (8/12 kPa). A model for detecting cACLD among those with LSM between 8 and 12 kPa was developed and compared with recently published models.
RESULTS: Seventy (21.2%) of the 330 NAFLD patients had biopsy-proven cACLD. The Baveno VII cut-offs (10/15 kPa) had a lower sensitivity of 72.8% (60.9-82.8%) and a specificity of 93.4% (89.7-96.1%). Sensitivity and specificity of lower cut-offs (8/12 kPa) were 91.4% (82.3-96.8%) and 88.5% (83.9-92.1%), respectively. Modeling based on the presence of diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 3.625[1.161-11.320], p = 0.027) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (OR 1.636[1.098-2.436], p = 0.015) correctly identified 75.7% of patients with LSM between 8 and 12 kPa. Our model performed best with an area under receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.725 (95%CI 0.609-0.822), compared to Papatheodoridi (AUROC 0.626, CI 0.506-.736) and Zhou (AUROC 0.523, CI 0.403-0.640) models. A two-step strategy comprising application of lower LSM cut-offs followed by the predictive model correctly identified the presence of cACLD in 83% of the patients as compared to 75% by the Baveno VII cut-offs.
CONCLUSION: A two-step strategy employing lower LSM cut-offs and modeling based on diabetes and AST levels outperforms Baveno VII cut-offs for identifying cACLD in NAFLD patients.

AB  - Objective: Sonomyography, or ultrasound-based sensing of muscle deformation, is an emerging modality for upper limb prosthesis control. Although prior studies have shown that individuals with upper limb loss can achieve successful motion classification with sonomyography, it is important to better understand the time-course over which proficiency develops. In this study, we characterized user performance during their initial and subsequent exposures to sonomyography. Method: Ultrasound images corresponding to a series of hand gestures were collected from individuals with transradial limb loss under three scenarios: during their initial exposure to sonomyography (Experiment 1), during a subsequent exposure to sonomyography where they were provided biofeedback as part of a training protocol (Experiment 2), and during testing sessions held on different days (Experiment 3). User performance was characterized by offline classification accuracy, as well as metrics describing the consistency and separability of the sonomyography signal patterns in feature space. Results: Classification accuracy was high during initial exposure to sonomyography (96.2 ± 5.9%) and did not systematically change with the provision of biofeedback or on different days. Despite this stable classification performance, some of the feature space metrics changed. Conclusions: User performance was strong upon their initial exposure to sonomyography and did not improve with subsequent exposure. Clinical Impact: Prosthetists may be able to quickly assess if a patient will be successful with sonomyography without submitting them to an extensive training protocol, leading to earlier socket fabrication and delivery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused >3.5 million deaths worldwide and affected >160 million people. At least twice as many have been infected but remained asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic. COVID-19 includes central nervous system manifestations mediated by inflammation and cerebrovascular, anoxic, and/or viral neurotoxicity mechanisms. More than one third of patients with COVID-19 develop neurologic problems during the acute phase of the illness, including loss of sense of smell or taste, seizures, and stroke. Damage or functional changes to the brain may result in chronic sequelae. The risk of incident cognitive and neuropsychiatric complications appears independent from the severity of the original pulmonary illness. It behooves the scientific and medical community to attempt to understand the molecular and/or systemic factors linking COVID-19 to neurologic illness, both short and long term.
METHODS: This article describes what is known so far in terms of links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. We focus on risk factors and possible molecular, inflammatory, and viral mechanisms underlying neurological injury. We also provide a comprehensive description of the Alzheimer's Association Consortium on Chronic Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (CNS SC2) harmonized methodology to address these questions using a worldwide network of researchers and institutions.
RESULTS: Successful harmonization of designs and methods was achieved through a consensus process initially fragmented by specific interest groups (epidemiology, clinical assessments, cognitive evaluation, biomarkers, and neuroimaging). Conclusions from subcommittees were presented to the whole group and discussed extensively. Presently data collection is ongoing at 19 sites in 12 countries representing Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Europe.
DISCUSSION: The Alzheimer's Association Global Consortium harmonized methodology is proposed as a model to study long-term neurocognitive sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
KEY POINTS: The following review describes what is known so far in terms of molecular and epidemiological links among COVID-19, the brain, neurological symptoms, and AD and related dementias (ADRD)The primary objective of this large-scale collaboration is to clarify the pathogenesis of ADRD and to advance our understanding of the impact of a neurotropic virus on the long-term risk of cognitive decline and other CNS sequelae. No available evidence supports the notion that cognitive impairment after SARS-CoV-2 infection is a form of dementia (ADRD or otherwise). The longitudinal methodologies espoused by the consortium are intended to provide data to answer this question as clearly as possible controlling for possible confounders. Our specific hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 triggers ADRD-like pathology following the extended olfactory cortical network (EOCN) in older individuals with specific genetic susceptibility.The proposed harmonization strategies and flexible study designs offer the possibility to include large samples of under-represented racial and ethnic groups, creating a rich set of harmonized cohorts for future studies of the pathophysiology, determinants, long-term consequences, and trends in cognitive aging, ADRD, and vascular disease.We provide a framework for current and future studies to be carried out within the Consortium. and offers a "green paper" to the research community with a very broad, global base of support, on tools suitable for low- and middle-income countries aimed to compare and combine future longitudinal data on the topic.The Consortium proposes a combination of design and statistical methods as a means of approaching causal inference of the COVID-19 neuropsychiatric sequelae. We expect that deep phenotyping of neuropsychiatric sequelae may provide a series of candidate syndromes with phenomenological and biological characterization that can be further explored. By generating high-quality harmonized data across sites we aim to capture both descriptive and, where possible, causal associations.

AB  - Evidence suggests that parenting an autistic child or a child with neurodevelopmental disabilities can be more challenging than parenting a child meeting their developmental milestones, especially when there is a dearth of support services, such as in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite the majority of the world's children residing in LMICs, there are limited studies examining the understanding of developmental disorders and autism in these regions. We therefore aim to investigate perceptions of autism and developmental disabilities in caregivers of children in an urban setting in New Delhi, India. Thirteen semi-structured interviews with parents/caregivers of children were conducted in three groups: (1) caregivers with a child with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD); (2) caregivers with a child with a diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID); (3) and caregivers with children meeting their developmental milestones. Transcripts were analysed using framework analysis. Three themes on the impact of cultural and contextual factors on the recognition, interpretation, and reporting of autistic symptoms are discussed, and additional themes focus on the impact of diagnosis and family support. Our findings highlighted a vital need for greater community awareness and recognition of autism in India, for example through community and healthcare training, which may help to reduce stigma and facilitate wider family support.

AB  - Glioma is a major brain tumor, and the associated mortality rate is very high. Contemporary therapies provide a chance of survival for 9-12 months. Therefore, a novel approach is essential to improve the survival rate. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) cell signaling is critical for early development in various tumors. This investigation attempted to explore the potential interaction and regulation of Shh-Gli1 cell signaling in association with paired box 6 (Pax6) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). The expression pattern of Shh, Gli1, Pax6, and IDH2 was examined by transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry, and confocal images. The results suggest the interaction of Shh-Gli1 cell signaling pathway with Pax6 and IDH2 and potential regulation. Thereafter, we performed protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) of Gli1 with Pax6 and IDH2. The results suggest differential dynamic interactions of Gli1-IDH2 and Gli1-Pax6. Gli1 knockdown downregulated the expression of Pax6 and upregulated the expression of IDH2. Moreover, Gli1 knockdown decreased the expression of the drug resistance gene MRP1. The knockdown of Pax6 gene in glioma cells downregulated the expression of Gli1 and IDH2 and promoted cell proliferation. Moreover, the efficacy of the treatment of glioma cells with temozolomide (TMZ) and Gli1 inhibitor GANT61 was higher than that of TMZ alone. MDS results revealed that the interactions of Gli1 with IDH2 were stronger and more stable than those with Pax6. Intriguingly, inhibition of Pax6 promoted glioma growth even in the presence of TMZ. However, the tumor-suppressive nature of Pax6 was altered when Gli1 was inhibited by GANT61, and it showed potential oncogenic character, as observed in other cancers. Therefore, we conclude that Pax6 interacted with IDH2 and Gli1 in glioma. Moreover, the Shh-Gli1-IDH2/Pax6 cell signaling axis provides a new therapeutic approach for inhibiting the progression of the disease and mitigating drug resistance in glioma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has been examined as a risk factor for severity and progression of kidney disease due to its immunomodulatory effects. There is paucity of data about its impact in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, 25 (OH) vitamin D assay was performed in bio-banked baseline serum samples collected during kidney biopsy of 105 adult patients with primary IgAN diagnosed between 2015 and 2019. A level of < 10 ng/mL was defined as Vitamin D deficiency.
RESULTS: Mean age of patients was 34 ± 10.6 years, 69.5% were males. Mean baseline 25(OH) Vitamin D levels was 15.9 ± 11.9 ng/mL and 41(39%) patients had vitamin D deficiency. Serum albumin level was lower in vitamin D deficient patients compared to those who had higher vitamin D levels (3.7 ± 0.9 vs 4.1 ± 0.7 g/dl, p = 0.018)but there was no significant difference in baseline proteinuria and eGFR. Crescentic lesions were more frequent in vitamin D deficient group (19.5% vs 6.3%, p = 0.022). At median follow up of 21.5 months (6 - 56 months), there was no difference in remission (68.3% vs 65.6%, p = 0.777) and disease progression (12.5% vs 9.4%, p = 0.614) in those with and without Vitamin D deficiency respectively. On multivariate cox proportional hazard analysis, vitamin D deficiency was not a significant risk factor for renal survival (HR-1.79, 95% confidence interval:0.50-6.34, p = 0.368).
CONCLUSION: There was no association between vitamin D deficiency and disease profile as well as renal outcome in Indian patients with IgAN.

AB  - Tumor heterogeneity, marked by the presence of divergent clonal subpopulations of tumor cells, impedes the treatment response in cancer patients. Single-cell sequencing technology provides substantial prospects to gain an in-depth understanding of the cellular phenotypic variability driving tumor progression. A comprehensive insight into the intra-tumor heterogeneity may further assist in dealing with the treatment-resistant clones in cancer patients, thereby improving their overall survival. However, this task is hampered due to the challenges associated with the single-cell data, such as false positives, false negatives and missing bases, and the increase in their size. As a result, the computational cost of the existing methods increases, thereby limiting their usage. In this work, we propose a robust graph learning-based method, ARCANE-ROG (Algorithm for Reconstruction of CANcer Evolution via RObust Graph learning), for inferring clonal evolution from single-cell datasets. The first step of the proposed method is a joint framework of denoising with data imputation for the noisy and incomplete matrix while simultaneously learning an adjacency graph. Both the operations in the joint framework boost each other such that the overall performance of the denoising algorithm is improved. In the second step, an optimal number of clusters are identified via the Leiden method. In the last step, clonal evolution trees are inferred via a minimum spanning tree algorithm. The method has been benchmarked against a state-of-the-art method, RobustClone, using simulated datasets of varying sizes and five real datasets. The performance of our proposed method is found to be significantly superior (p-value < 0.05) in terms of reconstruction error, False Positive to False Negative (FPFN) ratio, tree distance error and V-measure compared to the other method. Overall, the proposed method is an improvement over the existing methods as it enhances cluster assignment and inference on clonal hierarchies.

AB  - Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is performed in patients with minor strokes and transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) to prevent further strokes. However, most operators do not intervene in older adults. We had a 92-year patient with recurrent minor strokes with two possible proximate causes - cardioembolism and significant symptomatic left carotid stenosis. This patient continued to have recurrent ischemic events in the left carotid territory despite optimum management of the cardioembolic source with dual antiplatelets and anticoagulation and was successfully treated with left CAS. The role of carotid revascularization in older patients with high-grade symptomatic carotid stenosis and cardiac comorbidities is discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in critically ill patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted where critically ill adult patients presenting with fever and bicytopenia were evaluated according to the HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria for the presence of secondary HLH. The underlying trigger, clinical profile, treatment, and outcome of patients with HLH were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 76 critically ill patients with fever and bicytopenia, 33 (43%) patients were diagnosed with HLH. The following triggers for HLH were identified: bacterial infections (23%), fungal infections (10%), viral infections (10%), parasitic infections (10%), autoimmune diseases (13%), and malignancy (8%). A total of 78% of the HLH cases received steroids, but the use of steroids was not associated with improvement in mortality.
CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of HLH in patients presenting with fever and bicytopenia in critically ill adult patients. Infections were identified as the most common trigger of HLH.

AB  - The detection and classification of cystic lesions of the jaw is of high clinical relevance and represents a topic of interest in medical artificial intelligence research. The human clinical diagnostic reasoning process uses contextual information, including the spatial relation of the detected lesion to other anatomical structures, to establish a preliminary classification. Here, we aimed to emulate clinical diagnostic reasoning step by step by using a combined object detection and image segmentation approach on panoramic radiographs (OPGs). We used a multicenter training dataset of 855 OPGs (all positives) and an evaluation set of 384 OPGs (240 negatives). We further compared our models to an international human control group of ten dental professionals from seven countries. The object detection model achieved an average precision of 0.42 (intersection over union (IoU): 0.50, maximal detections: 100) and an average recall of 0.394 (IoU: 0.50-0.95, maximal detections: 100). The classification model achieved a sensitivity of 0.84 for odontogenic cysts and 0.56 for non-odontogenic cysts as well as a specificity of 0.59 for odontogenic cysts and 0.84 for non-odontogenic cysts (IoU: 0.30). The human control group achieved a sensitivity of 0.70 for odontogenic cysts, 0.44 for non-odontogenic cysts, and 0.56 for OPGs without cysts as well as a specificity of 0.62 for odontogenic cysts, 0.95 for non-odontogenic cysts, and 0.76 for OPGs without cysts. Taken together, our results show that a combined object detection and image segmentation approach is feasible in emulating the human clinical diagnostic reasoning process in classifying cystic lesions of the jaw.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is higher in low- and middle-income countries, but HAIs are often missed because surveillance is not conducted. Here, we describe the identification of and response to a cluster of Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with high mortality in a surgical ICU (SICU) that joined an HAI surveillance network.
SETTING: A 780-bed, tertiary-level, public teaching hospital in northern India.
METHODS: After detecting a cluster of BCC in the SICU, cases were identified by reviewing laboratory registers and automated identification and susceptibility testing outputs. Sociodemographic details, clinical records, and potential exposure histories were collected, and a self-appraisal of infection prevention and control (IPC) practices using assessment tools from the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was conducted. Training and feedback were provided to hospital staff. Environmental samples were collected from high-touch surfaces, intravenous medications, saline, and mouthwash.
RESULTS: Between October 2017 and October 2018, 183 BCC BSI cases were identified. Case records were available for 121 case patients. Of these 121 cases, 91 (75%) were male, the median age was 35 years, and 57 (47%) died. IPC scores were low in the areas of technical guidelines, human resources, and monitoring and evaluation. Of the 30 environmental samples, 4 grew BCC. A single source of the outbreak was not identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementing standardized HAI surveillance in a low-resource setting detected an ongoing Burkholderia cepacia outbreak. The outbreak investigation and use of a multimodal approach reduced incident cases and informed changes in IPC practices.

TI  - Mapping development and health effects of cooking with solid fuels in low-income and middle-income countries, 2000-18: a geospatial modelling study
AU  - Local Burden of Disease Household Air Pollution Collaborators
T2  - The Lancet. Global Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: More than 3 billion people do not have access to clean energy and primarily use solid fuels to cook. Use of solid fuels generates household air pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean fuels.
METHODS: We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking at a 5 km × 5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2·1 million household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with household air pollution.
FINDINGS: Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205 000 (95% uncertainty interval 147 000-257 000) children younger than 5 years died from lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air pollution.
INTERPRETATION: Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suboptimal exposure to antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs has been associated with unfavourable treatment outcomes. We aimed to investigate estimates and determinants of first-line anti-TB drug pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents at a global level.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science (1990-2021) for pharmacokinetic studies of first-line anti-TB drugs in children and adolescents. Individual patient data were obtained from authors of eligible studies. Summary estimates of total/extrapolated area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h post-dose (AUC0-24) and peak plasma concentration (C max) were assessed with random-effects models, normalised with current World Health Organization-recommended paediatric doses. Determinants of AUC0-24 and C max were assessed with linear mixed-effects models.
RESULTS: Of 55 eligible studies, individual patient data were available for 39 (71%), including 1628 participants from 12 countries. Geometric means of steady-state AUC0-24 were summarised for isoniazid (18.7 (95% CI 15.5-22.6) h·mg·L-1), rifampicin (34.4 (95% CI 29.4-40.3) h·mg·L-1), pyrazinamide (375.0 (95% CI 339.9-413.7) h·mg·L-1) and ethambutol (8.0 (95% CI 6.4-10.0) h·mg·L-1). Our multivariate models indicated that younger age (especially <2 years) and HIV-positive status were associated with lower AUC0-24 for all first-line anti-TB drugs, while severe malnutrition was associated with lower AUC0-24 for isoniazid and pyrazinamide. N-acetyltransferase 2 rapid acetylators had lower isoniazid AUC0-24 and slow acetylators had higher isoniazid AUC0-24 than intermediate acetylators. Determinants of C max were generally similar to those for AUC0-24.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the most comprehensive estimates of plasma exposures to first-line anti-TB drugs in children and adolescents. Key determinants of drug exposures were identified. These may be relevant for population-specific dose adjustment or individualised therapeutic drug monitoring.

TI  - Cytomorphological evaluation of non-haematopoietic malignancies metastasizing to the bone marrow
AU  - Gajendra, Smeeta
AU  - Sharma, Rashi
T2  - American Journal of Blood Research
AB  - Bone marrow (BM) is one of the rare but important site of metastasis of solid tumors. The key steps of metastasis include invasion, intravasation, circulation, extravasation, and colonization. Tumor cells may express some adhesion molecules that promote the transmigration to the marrow space and link them to the marrow stroma with subsequent engraftment. It is important to detect the bone marrow metastasis for initial clinical staging, therapeutic selection, prognostic risk stratification, assessment of response to therapy and predicting relapse. Prognosis of non-hematopoietic malignancies with BM metastasis is dismal. Due to occulting and atypical clinical manifestations, bone marrow metastases can be easily missed or misdiagnosed, leading to higher mortality rates. The important factors on which the prognosis of patients with bone marrow metastases depends are primary tumor site, performance status, platelet count, and therapeutic regimens (systemic chemotherapy or palliative/supportive care). Further, in cases with BM metastasis with unknown primary sites, misdiagnosis can lead to delayed initiation of therapy and increased mortality. BM metastasis is seen in less than 10% of patients with metastatic cancer and is common in lung, breast or prostate carcinoma. Bone marrow metastasis can be presented as the initial presentation with hematological changes and may be misdiagnosed as a primary haematopoietic disorder. Leucoerythoblastic blood picture is the most common peripheral blood smear finding indicating BM metastasis, may be an indicator of associated BM fibrosis. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with immunohistochemistry (IHC) is an easy, cost effective and gold standard method of detection of BM metastasis. BM biopsy is superior to bone marrow aspirate for detection of metastasis. Morphology of metastatic cells is as per the primary site of tumor. Immunohistochemistry is a useful adjunct to morphology in reaching a definitive diagnosis even in case with carcinoma unknown primary (CUP) and also in diagnosing case of unsuspected malignancies. Though bone marrow is not among the most common site of involvement in CUP, which are liver, bone, lymph nodes and lung. But BM, if involved, the site of origin is determined using the immunohistochemistry panel applied to the metastatic deposits based on the morphology The aim of the review is to discuss the hematological findings of non-haematopoietic malignancies metastasizing to the bone marrow, emphasizing on histomorphology with IHC and its significance in establishing primary diagnosis in clinically unsuspected cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To study the efficacy and safety of uterine artery embolization in treatment of obstetric hemorrhage.
METHODS: This ethically approved prospective study was conducted between November 2017 and October 2019, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Consecutive patients presenting with uncontrolled obstetric hemorrhage were evaluated. Fifty-three patients with uncontrolled bleeding underwent uterine artery embolization (UAE) and were followed up.
RESULTS: Spectrum of patients encountered in this study was arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) (n = 25), retained products of conception (RPOC) (n = 16), RPOC with secondary AVMs (n = 5), ectopic pregnancy (n = 5) and iatrogenic trauma to cervix or vagina (n = 2). A total of 57 UAE procedures were performed in these 53 patients as repeat sessions were required in four patients. Most common embolic agent used was polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles with gelfoam followed by cyanoacrylate glue as second most common agent. Technical success was achieved in 57 (100%) of 57 UAE procedures. Primary clinical success was achieved in 49 (92%) of 53 patients and secondary clinical success in 52 (98%) patients. Clinical failure was observed in one patient who underwent hysterectomy.
CONCLUSION: Uterine artery embolization is a safe and effective procedure in the management of uncontrolled obstetric hemorrhage.

AB  - Novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the mental well-being of the population and posed many challenges in availing mental healthcare. Telepsychiatry has been proven to be an effective route for the delivery of mental healthcare. We share our experience of using the telemedicine approach in providing mental health services at a tertiarycare hospital in India during the COVID-19 pandemic, following the break in routine outpatient services during the national lockdown. The telepsychiatry approach helped in ensuring the maintenance of mental healthcare. The utility of telepsychiatry as an option for such future situations and for its use in routine follow up care in indicated cases, have also been discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Impact of micronutrient deficiency on childhood malignancy is unexplored. We estimated the prevalence of baseline micronutrient deficiency in children with cancer and its impact on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study was conducted at a tertiary cancer centre in India. Children (≤18 years) with de novo malignancy were enrolled between October 2012 and May 2014. Baseline levels of vitamin B12, folate, zinc, selenium, copper, and iron were measured and values below 150 pmol/L, 6 ng/mL, International Zinc Nutrition Collaborative Group cut-off, 0.5 μmol/L, 10 μmol/L, and 50 μg/dL, respectively, indicated deficiency.
RESULTS: Total 535 children [326 (60.9%) haematological and 209 (39.1%) solid malignancies] were enrolled with median follow-up of 66 months. Vitamin B12, folate, zinc, selenium, copper and iron deficiencies were found in 209 (39.1%), 89 (16.6%), 173 (32.3%), 39 (7.3%), 12 (2.2%), and 231 (43.2%) children, respectively. Selenium deficiency independently predicted poor EFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.56; p = 0.038) and OS (HR = 1.65; p = 0.027) in the cohort. In haematological malignancies, selenium deficiency predicted poor EFS (HR = 1.81; p = 0.023) and OS (HR = 2.12; p = 0.004). In solid malignancies, vitamin B12 (HR = 1.55; p = 0.028) and zinc (HR = 1.74; p = 0.009) deficiencies predicted poor EFS, and zinc deficiency predicted poor OS (HR = 1.77; p = 0.009). Multiple micronutrient (≥3) deficiencies also predicted poor EFS (HR = 1.69; p = 0.001) and OS (HR = 1.83; p < 0.001) in the whole cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Selenium deficiency was independently predictive of adverse outcomes in childhood cancer, particularly in haematological malignancies. Zinc deficiency adversely affected solid tumours. The adjunct use of micronutrient supplementation in paediatric malignancies should be explored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indian data on treatment outcomes and survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain scarce.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of 537 advanced NSCLC patients treated at a tertiary care facility in North India from January 2008 to March 2018 was done to assess treatment response and survival in terms of objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Median age of enrolled patients was 60 years (range: 26-89 years). The majority were males (78.2%) and smokers (66.5%). Adenocarcinoma (51.2%) was the most common pathological type. Most patients had good performance status (PS) (the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0 or 1 in 55.7%) and received conventional chemotherapy (86.6%). ORR and DCR after 3-4 months of first-line treatment were 55.2% and 71.75%, respectively (n = 223). Never smokers had better ORR as well as DCR compared to chronic smokers whereas treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors achieved significantly better ORR, and patients with good PS had better DCR compared to those with poor PS. Median PFS (n = 455) was 7.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-14.0) and median OS was 11.7 months (95% CI: 5.5-29.9 months). Good PS and nonsmoking status were independent predictors of better PFS on multivariate analysis. For OS, good PS, nonsmoking behavior, and treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors were independent predictors.
CONCLUSION: In advanced NSCLC, never-smokers, and patients with good baseline ECOG have favorable treatment and survival outcomes. Treatment with targeted therapy results in better ORR and OS but did not affect PFS.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Family history is considered as an important predictor of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes. Available research findings suggest that family history of chronic diseases is associated with perceived risk of disease and adoption of healthy behaviours. We examined the association between family history of cardio-metabolic diseases (CMDs) and healthy behaviours among adults without self-reported CMDs.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data of 12,484 adults, without self-reported CMDs, from the baseline survey of Centre for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia (CARRS) cohort study were analysed.
RESULTS: Family history was positively associated with non-smoking and high fruits & vegetables consumption in the age group of 45-64 years and moderate to high physical activity in the age group ≥65 years after adjusting for sex, education, wealth index, city and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS: Understanding perceived risks and cultural or psychological factors related to family history through ethnographic studies may deepen understanding of these associations.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the clinical, radiological and functional outcomes of three-column osteotomy (3CO) by a single-stage posterior approach in patients with isolated congenital angular kyphosis (CK) and healed post-tubercular kyphosis (PTK).
METHODS: The hospital records of 30 patients with isolated congenital kyphosis (Group CK) and 51 patients with healed post-tubercular kyphosis (Group PTK), operated at a single centre utilizing a 3CO by a single-stage posterior-only approach, were retrospectively analysed. The two groups were compared with respect to selected demographic variables with clinical, radiological and functional outcome measures at a minimum follow-up of 24 months.
RESULTS: Patients in Group CK (median: 13 years, range: 4-30 years) presented earlier than those in Group PTK (median: 16 years, range: 6-45 years). The apex of the deformity was most often located in the thoracic spine in Group PTK, and in the thoracolumbar or lumbar spine in Group CK. The mean operative time (198.2 ± 31.5 min v/s 174.4 ± 34.5; p = 0.01) and estimated blood loss (859.6 ± 312.2 ml v/s 720.8 ± 187.3; p = 0.04) were significantly higher in Group PTK. While the local kyphosis angle was significantly corrected with surgery in both groups, the correction was significantly better in Group CK-this group also had significantly better overall functional (SRS-22r) scores at a follow-up of 24 months (p < 0.05). The overall complication rate (29.4% v/s 23.3%) and neurological complication rate (9.8% v/s 6.6%) were higher in Group PTK. Permanent neurological deterioration occurred in one patient in each group.
CONCLUSION: Patients with PTK have significantly higher age of presentation, higher operative time and higher complication rate as compared to CK. However, good functional outcomes and kyphosis angle correction can be achieved in both the groups with posterior-only three-column osteotomies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The expression pattern of micro-RNAs (miRNA) has been implicated in the pathomechanism of various bone disorders, and has a role in differentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The purpose of the study was to investigate the differential miRNA profiles of osteoporotic hip fractures compared to young patients with hip fractures.
METHODS: Blood samples from ten osteoporosis patients and ten young, healthy patients, presenting with acute hip fractures were collected and subjected to an initial miRNA profiling to detect those miRNAs with significant variations between the two groups based on polymerase chain reactions performed in duplicate. A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based analysis was then performed for validation of specific miRNAs that were significantly different between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 182 miRNAs were analyzed. Thirty-nine of them showed significant differences between the two groups in the initial miRNA profiling. The validation results suggested that five miRNAs related to bone metabolism had significantly different expression among the osteoporotic hip fracture group compared to the young, healthy group: miR-23b-3p and miR-140-3p were up-regulated; miR-21-5p, miR-122-5p and miR-125b-5p were down-regulated.
CONCLUSIONS: Differential expression of selected miRNAs in patients with osteoporotic hip fracture suggests a possible role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers in prevention or timely prediction of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism of their involvement in osteoporosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings of tissue samples obtained from patients with radial longitudinal deficiency (RLD) and investigate the contribution of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.
METHODS: Specimens from radial-sided muscles and tendons were obtained at the time of surgery (either radialization or centralization) from 14 patients with 16 limbs affected with Bayne type 3 and type 4 RLD. The specimens were evaluated using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemical examination.
RESULTS: Among the 16 frozen muscle specimens, 6 (37%) showed normal muscle, while 10 (63%) showed the presence of atrophic fibers. The 6 cases with normal muscle showed no abnormality in fiber type distribution. Six patients showed predominance of type 1 muscle fibers. None of the specimens had myofibroblasts; 4 of 16 specimens had mast cells, and 9 of 16 specimens showed the presence of platelet derived growth factor-positive cells. Features of myofibroblasts (the presence of basal lamina, intercellular junctions, or pinocytic vesicles) were not identified in any specimen on electron microscopy.
CONCLUSIONS: The histopathological, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings, in particular the absence of myofibroblasts, in tissue samples obtained from patients with RLD, do not support the assumption of abnormality in soft tissues as a secondary driver of deformity in RLD.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study provides a preliminary insight into a possible role of soft tissues in the development of the deformity in RLD.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
PURPOSE: To report the demographic characteristics, clinico-radiological presentation, laboratory findings, and outcomes of "middlepath" treatment in patients with spinal tuberculosis from a single public healthcare facility in a developing country.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Tuberculosis is a global health problem that is endemic in developing countries and undergoing resurgence in developed ones. Spinal tuberculosis can cause disabling back pain, progressive deformity, and neurological involvement. However, there is a lack of large-scale epidemiological studies quantifying the size and severity of the problem of spinal tuberculosis.
METHODS: Hospital records of spinal tuberculosis patients treated at a single center over a period of 5 years were retrospectively reviewed. A diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis was based on standard clinical, radiological, microbiological, and histopathological evidence. Patients were treated in accordance with the "middle-path" regimen; surgery was reserved for selective indications.
RESULTS: A total of 1,652 patients were included. Their median age was 32.4 years, with 53% being male. Axial pain (98%) was the most common presenting symptom; 19% of patients had neurological deficit. Lumbar spine (37%) was the most common site of involvement, with a paradiscal pattern (82%) of involvement predominating. Multi-level involvement was seen in 19% of patients; skip lesions were noted in 2.8%. Transpedicular biopsy was performed in 667 patients; at least one tissue test was diagnostic of tuberculosis in 65% of patients. Forty-four patients had drug resistance to rifampicin. Surgery was required in 10.5% of patients. The "middle-path" regimen was associated with high compliance and significant improvements in pain (Visual Analog Scale score) and function (36-Item Short Form Health Survey).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the widespread prevalence of spinal tuberculosis and describe various epidemiological characteristics of a large sample of spinal tuberculosis patients. Adoption of the "middle-path" regimen is associated with high compliance and favorable outcomes in spinal tuberculosis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study impact of COVID-19 pandemic on frequency, clinical/electrophysiological profile and treatment outcomes in pediatric Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).
BACKGROUND: GBS is the most frequent cause of pediatric acute flaccid paralysis. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric GBS is unclear in the literature.
METHODS: We conducted an ambispective, multicentric, cohort study involving 12 of 27 centres in GBS Consortium, during two periods: pre-COVID-19 (March-August 2019) and during COVID-19 (March-August 2020). Children ≤12 years who satisfied National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke criteria for GBS/variants were enrolled. Details pertaining to clinical/laboratory parameters, treatment and outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge, GBS Disability score at discharge and 3 months) were analysed.
RESULTS: We enrolled 33 children in 2019 and 10 in 2020. Children in 2020 were older (median 10.4 [interquartile range 6.75-11.25] years versus 5 (2.5-8.4) years; P = 0.022) and had more sensory symptoms (50% versus 18.2%; P = 0.043). The 2020 group had relatively favourable mRS at discharge (median 1 (1-3.5) versus 3 (2-4); P = 0.042) and GBS disability score at 3 months (median 0 (0-0.75) versus 2 (0-3); P = 0.009) compared to 2019. Multivariate analysis revealed bowel involvement (P = 0.000) and ventilatory support (P = 0.001) as independent predictors of disability. No child in 2020 had preceding/concurrent SARS-CoV2 infection.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic led to a marked decline in pediatric GBS presenting to hospitals. Antecedent illnesses, clinical and electrophysiological profile of GBS remained largely unchanged from the pre-pandemic era.

AB  - Disease modification trials in dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have not met with success. One potential criticism of these trials is the lack of sensitive outcome measures. A large number of outcome measures have been employed in dementia and MCI trials. This review aims to describe and analyze the utility of cognitive/clinical outcome measures in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MCI trials. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted using relevant MeSH terms and exploded keywords. The search was confined to English language publications of human studies from the last five years which describe the latest trends in the use of outcome measures. Results: Despite broad use, the outcome measures employed are heterogeneous, with little data on correlations between scales. Another problem is that most studies are over-reliant on clinician/researcher assessment and cognitive outcomes, and there is a definite lack of stakeholder input. Finetuning of the paradigm is also required for people with early-stage disease, mild to moderate disease, and advanced dementia, as the outcome measures in these subgroups have varying relevance. Disease modification/prevention is an appropriate goal in early disease, whereas palliation and freedom from discomfort are paramount in later stages. The outcome measures selected must be suitable for and sensitive to these particular care goals. Although there is a shift to enrich MCI cohorts using a biomarker-based approach, the clinical relevance of such outcome measures remains uncertain. Conclusions: Outcome measures in dementia/MCI trials remain inhomogeneous and diverse, despite extensive use. Outcome measures fall within several paradigms, including cognitive, functional, quality-of-life, biomarker-based, and patient-reported outcome measures. The success of future disease-modifying trials is reliant to a large extent on the selection of outcome measures which combine all outcomes of clinical relevance as well as clinical meaning. Outcome measures should be tied to the type and stage of dementia and to the specific interventions employed.

AB  - Background: Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a progressive devastating condition due to persistence of mutant measles virus, affecting children and adolescents, characterised by myoclonus, seizures, and neuropsychiatric issues. Movement disorders apart from myoclonus are reportedly uncommon. We aimed to describe frequency and proportion of movement disorders among children with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, hypothesizing that these occur more frequently than previously reported. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we enrolled children with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis between 1 month and 18 years of age who fulfilled the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis as per modified Dyken criteria, and examined them for movement disorders. We also assessed their clinical profile and disease severity via Jabbour staging and modified Rankin Scale score. We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of children with and without movement disorders. Results: We enrolled 50 children (36 males; 72%) (age range 1.5-14 years). Of these, 28 (56%) had movement disorders. Among movement disorders, the most frequent was myoclonus (92%), followed by ataxia (9; 18%), chorea-athetosis (7; 14%), dystonia (6; 12%), tremor (4; 8%), repetitive behavior (4; 8%), and parkinsonism (3; 6%). Movement disorders were the presenting feature of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis among 7 children. There were no significant differences in clinical or laboratory features among children with and without movement disorders. Conclusions: Movement disorders were frequent in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Hyperkinetic disorders were dominant. Dystonia and chorea-athetosis occurred more commonly among nonmyoclonus movement disorders. Movement disorders may manifest even in earlier stages of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis and may be the heralding feature. Recognition of these features is important to plan management and reduce morbidity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the feasibility of teleneurorehabilitation (TNR) among persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), considering difficulties imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in access to healthcare, particularly in low-resource settings. The feasibility of TNR in India has not been formally assessed so far.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, prospective cohort study at a tertiary center in India. Persons with PD with Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stages 1-2.5, who were not enrolled into any formal exercise program, were offered TNR as per a predesigned program for 12 weeks. Baseline and post-intervention assessment included Movement Disorders Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), part II and III, Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ)-8 and Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS). We assessed adherence to TNR and problems expressed by patients/caregivers by means of open-ended surveys addressing barriers to rehabilitation.
RESULTS: We recruited 22 for TNR. Median age (interquartile range [IQR]) was 66.0 (44.0-71.0) years; 66.7% were H&Y stage 2.0. One patient died of COVID-19-related complications. Of the remaining 21, 14 (66.7%) had adherence of ≥75%; 16/21 (76.2%) patients had problems with attending TNR sessions as the family shared a single phone. Slow Internet speed was an issue among 13/21 (61.9%) of the patients. Other issues included lack of rapport, migration to distant hometowns and motor-hand impairment.
CONCLUSION: Multiple challenges were faced in implementing a telerehabilitation program among persons with PD, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. These barriers were present at various levels: recruitment, adherence issues and maintenance. Future TNR programs must address these concerns.

AB  - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a neurodegenerative disorder because of the persistence of mutated measles virus in the central nervous system. Till date, no curative therapy has been established for SSPE. Multiple drugs have been tried to modify the disease process but have shown mild to moderate benefit at best. It is also challenging to attribute the relative success of some strategies described in single case reports because of the known phenomenon of spontaneous improvement in 5% of patients with SSPE. Critical gaps in understanding the pathophysiological processes involved exist. Current therapies such as interferon alfa require invasive strategies for administration by the intraventricular or intrathecal route, with varying dosage regimens. Oral therapies such as isoprinosine and ribavirin are expensive and not readily available in resource-constrained settings. Most of the evidence so far favors the use of combinational regimens. In this viewpoint, we critically summarize the current evidence on disease-modifying strategies in the context of our region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypermanganesemia with dystonia 1 and 2 (HMNDYT1 and 2) are rare, inherited disorders of manganese transport.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe clinical, laboratory features, and outcomes among children with HMNDYT.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study involving tertiary centers across India. We enrolled children between 1 month to 18 years of age with genetically confirmed/clinically probable HMNDYT. Clinical, laboratory profile, genetic testing, treatment details, and outcomes scored by treating physicians on a Likert scale were recorded.
RESULTS: We enrolled 27 children (19 girls). Fourteen harbored SLC30A10 mutations; nine had SLC39A14 mutations. The SLC39A14 cohort had lower median age at onset (1.3 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.7-5.5] years) versus SLC30A10 cohort (2.0 [IQR, 1.5-5.1] years). The most frequent neurological features were dystonia (100%; n = 27), gait abnormality (77.7%; n = 21), falls (66.7%; n = 18), and parkinsonism (59.3%; n = 16). Median serum manganese (Mn) levels among SLC39A14 (44.9 [IQR, 27.3-147.7] mcg/L) cohort were higher than SLC30A10 (29.4 [17.1-42.0] mcg/L); median hemoglobin was higher in SLC30A10 (16.3 [IQR, 15.2-17.5] g/dL) versus SLC39A14 cohort (12.5 [8.8-13.2] g/dL). Hepatic involvement and polycythaemia were observed exclusively in SLC30A10 variants. A total of 26/27 children underwent chelation with disodium calcium edetate. Nine demonstrated some improvement, three stabilized, two had marked improvement, and one had normalization. Children with SLC39A14 mutations had poorer response. Two children died and nine were lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: We found female predominance. Children with SLC39A14 mutations presented at younger age and responded less favorably to chelation compared to SLC30A10 mutations. There is emerging need to better define management strategies, especially in low resource settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine and validate retinal vascular caliber measurements by using the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system. Retinal vasculature changes are often regarded as clinical markers for systemic disease.
METHODS: It was a prospective observational study conducted on 600 eyes of 300 normal subjects with no systemic or ocular illness from January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 in a tertiary referral eye center. Non-mydriatic infrared reflectance, blue reflectance, and blue peak blue autofluorescence fundus imaging were done on the confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system. The dimensions of the retinal vessels were measured using inbuilt calipers at 1800 μm from the center of the optic disc. Internal and external dimensions were measured. Observer variation and its comparison using Image J software were assessed.
RESULTS: The median age was 29 years (18-50 years). Mean internal and external diameters for arterioles were 85.1 ± 12.4 μm and 105.0 ± 12.0 μm, and for venules were 133.8 ± 16.6 μm and 145.4 ± 16.1 μm, respectively. The mean internal and external wall thicknesses were 19.7 ± 8.0 μm and 11.0 ± 5.6 μm, and wall thickness-to-lumen ratios were 0.3 ± 0.1 and 0.1 ± 0.1, respectively. Arteriolar-to-venular ratio for lumen and vessel was 0.66 ± 0.1 and 0.74 ± 0.1, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between age groups. Both inter- and intra-observer reproducibility was >95%. The Bland-Altman plot showed that the difference between measurements using both confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and Image J software lies within the limits of agreement approximately 95% of the time.
CONCLUSION: This is the first effort to develop a normative database by using a simple non-invasive confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy system with high observer reproducibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuraxial techniques provide good postoperative analgesia for painful procedures in the pediatric population. However, any injury to the spinal cord can lead to irreversible long-term effects.
AIMS: We aimed to evaluate dura-to-cord (DTC) distance from computerized tomography (CT) images of thoracolumbar spine in pediatric age group (1-16 years) at T8-9, T9-10, and L1-2 interspaces to identify the safe space for epidural insertion in Asian children.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: It was a retrospective study including 141 children aged 1-16 years who underwent routine CT scan of the thoracolumbar region for unrelated diagnostic indications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with spinal abnormalities were excluded. Sagittal CT images of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained to calculate the DTC at T8-9, T9-10, and L1-2 interspaces. The measurements at all levels were obtained perpendicular to the long axis of the vertebral body.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Continuous data were depicted as mean with standard deviations. The categorical data were presented as counts with percentages.
RESULTS: The mean DTC distance at T8-9, T9-10, and L1-2 interspaces was 3.51 ± 0.98 mm (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.35-3.67), 2.73 ± 0.94 mm (95% CI: 2.57-2.89), and 2.83 ± 1.08 mm (95% CI: 2.66-3.02), respectively. A significant difference was found between the genders at T9-10 (P = 0.02) and L1-2 levels (P = 0.04). No difference in DTC was found in toddlers, preschool children, school-going children, and adolescents. DTC at T8-9 showed a significant correlation with age (R 2 = 0.0479; P = 0.04), weight (R 2 = 0.038; P = 0.02), and height (R 2 = 0.037; P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: Thoracic epidural space can be used in children and adolescents for epidural catheter placement. T8-9 level showed maximum DTC distance and significant correlation with age, height, and weight in CT imaging in the present study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously conducted bibliometric analysis of 6 North American neurosurgical journals.
OBJECTIVE: To perform a bibliometric analysis of 6 European neurosurgical journals to build on our previous studies.
METHODS: We searched Web of Science for articles published in Acta Neurochirurgica, British Journal of Neurosurgery, Child's Nervous System, Journal of Neurological Surgery Part A: Central European Neurosurgery, Journal of Neurosurgical Sciences, and Neurosurgical Review between 2011 and 2020. We analyzed bibliometric parameters related to total annual document distribution, author metrics, journal metrics, country and continental distribution, institution, keywords, and journal impact.
RESULTS: European countries provided the greatest contributions. Acta Neurochirurgica followed by Child's Nervous System published the greatest number of articles and had the highest h-index and number of citations. From 2018 to 2020, total documents increased 79.6%, original articles increased 86.5%, review articles increased 103.6%, citations increased 79.6%, number of publishing authors increased 72.1%, number of authors in multi-author documents increased 72.4%, and author's keywords and keywords plus increased 72.4% and 27.0%, respectively. The collaboration index decreased 5.3% from 4.49 to 4.25. Annual published documents and citations were lower for European journals versus North American journals.
CONCLUSION: Several parameters of the European journals increased by 2020. One interesting finding is that growth for the 6 journals dramatically increased in the 2 years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. While neurosurgeon free time during lockdowns may account for much of the increase in 2020, the trend began before this. Our analysis did not identify a cause for the pre-COVID increases.

T2  - Neurosurgical Review
AB  - External ventricular drain (EVD) is one of the most commonly performed neurosurgical procedures. EVD can be associated with high rates of complications like misplacement, iatrogenic hemorrhage, and CSF infection. Several modifications have been proposed in the EVD insertion techniques to decrease the risk of these complications. Bolt-connected EVD, one of these modifications which involves insertion of a bolt in the burr hole, has been proposed to have better chances of optimal placement of EVD tip, lesser risk of CSF infection, and accidental pullout. A comprehensive search of different databases was performed to retrieve studies comparing the bolt-connected EVD with tunneled EVD and meta-analysis was done. Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Our analysis revealed that bolt-connected EVD is associated with significantly better chances of optimal placement than traditional tunneled EVD (MH OR-1.65, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.40, p = 0.008). We also observed that bolt-connected EVD is associated with significantly decreased risk of CSF infection (MH OR-0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, p = 0.026), EVD malfunction (MH OR-0.31, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58, p = 0.0003), and accidental disconnection (MH OR-0.09, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.26, p < 0.0001) as compared to traditional tunneled EVD. The difference between the two techniques was not statistically significant for complications, multiple punctures done for insertion of EVD, iatrogenic intracranial, and need of reoperation. Bolt-connected external ventricular drain is associated with significantly more chances of optimal placement and lesser chances of accidental discontinuation and CSF infection than tunneled EVD. There was no statistically significant difference noted between the two techniques for multiple punctures done for insertion of EVD, iatrogenic intracranial hemorrhage and need of reoperation. However, most of the included studies were retrospective. Thus, the results from the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution as further prospective high-quality studies are needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, disruption of surgical hands-on training has hampered the skills acquisition by budding neurosurgeons. Online and virtual classrooms have not been able to substitute the hands-on experience and learning via direct interaction with senior colleagues. To overcome these challenges, we organized a hybrid workshop where simulation-based learning modules, and direct and virtual interaction with surgeons during live surgeries or didactic lectures were utilized to help delegates in understanding the nuances of neurosurgery.
METHODS: A 3-day hybrid workshop was held in March 2021, which was attended by 133 delegates. A structured questionnaire was utilized to record their feedback.
RESULTS: An overwhelming majority of the respondents (94.1%, n = 64) found hybrid conferences to be better than an online conference. Most of the respondents (88.3%, n = 60) rated the utility of direct face-to-face interaction to be more satisfying as compared with online interaction with faculty during a webinar. Again, many the respondents (86.8%, n = 59) believed that similar hybrid events will be the new normal given the current situation of COVID-19 pandemic. A large majority (88.2%, n = 60) of the respondents reported that they will prefer a hybrid event over an online conference.
CONCLUSIONS: In this era of the COVID-19 pandemic, "hybrid" microneurosurgery workshops offer unique opportunities to enhance surgical skills acquisition by hands-on simulation-based learning and observing live surgical demonstrations, apart from 2-way interactions with experts under one roof. This may be a stepping stone for what lies ahead in the future of neurosurgical training.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a seronegative arthropathy which results in pathological ossification of the ligaments, disc, endplates and apophyseal structures. Cervical spinal fractures are more common in patients with ankylosing spondylitis than in patients without ankylosing spondylitis due to coexistent osteoporosis and kyphotic alignment of the spine. The risk of fracture-dislocation and associated spinal cord injury is also more in these patients. Management of cervical spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is more challenging.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 56-year-old male patient who presented to our emergency department following a road traffic accident. He had ASIA B spinal cord injury at C7 level. CT scan revealed a C6-7 fracture-dislocation with features suggestive of AS. The fracture involved all the three columns and extended through C7 body anteriorly and through the C6-7 disc posteriorly. The treating team was not aware that he had AS, and thus, precautions related to his head position were not taken. He underwent reduction of the fracture-dislocation and 360° fixation.
CONCLUSIONS: The management of cervical spine fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis is challenging. They need long segment fixation in their preoperative spinal alignment. Proper preoperative planning can result in good outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diagnostic ultrasound has long been a part of a physician's armamentarium, but transcranial focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging treatment of neurological disorders. Consequently, the literature in this field is increasing at a rapid pace.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis was aimed to identify the top-cited articles on FUS to discern their origin, spread, current trends highlighting future impact of this novel neurosurgical intervention.
METHODS: We searched the Web of Science database on 28th May 2021 and identified the top 100 cited articles. These articles were analyzed with various scientometric parameters like the authors, corresponding authors, country of corresponding author, journal of publication, year of publication. Citation based parameters including total citations, mean citations per article and mean citations, citation count, and the citation per year, citations per year and co-authors per document were studied as well in addition to Hirsch h-index, g-index, m-index, Bradford's Law, Lotka's law and Collaboration index.
RESULTS: The 100 top-cited articles were published between 1998 and 2019 in 45 different journals. The average citations per document and citations per document per year were 97.78 and 12.47, respectively. The most prolific authors were Hynynen K (Medical Biophysics-Toronto), Elias WJ (Neurosurgery-Virginia), Zadicario (InSightec). The Journal of Neurosurgery published the most top-cited articles (n = 11), and most articles originated from the United States, followed by Canada. Among individual institutions, the University of Toronto was the most productive.
CONCLUSION: FUS is an emerging treatment of neurological disorders. With its increasing application, the FUS literature is increasing rapidly. Eleven countries contributed to the top 100 cited articles, with the top 2 countries (the United States and Canada) contributing to more than half of these articles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is the commonest cause of cervical myelopathy. It contributes to high morbidity and consequent economic burden for society. Many measurement tools have been devised to quantify the disease severity, assist in decision-making, and to evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention.
OBJECTIVE: Most of the assessment scales are used for research purposes only and rarely in clinical practice. The purpose of this survey was to check the awareness of spine surgeons about these assessment scales and their role in the management of patients with CSM.
METHODS: An online questionnaire using the application "Google Forms" made consisting of 10 questions regarding the experience of treating the CSM patients and their preference for various parameters in assessing these patients. Statistical analysis was done using the statistical programming language R.
RESULTS: One-hundred and sixty-three responses were analyzed. About 90% of the respondents were aware of the assessment tools and only 57% of them used any in management. Nurick's grade was the most well known among all groups. The commonest reason for surgeons not using any of these assessment scales despite being aware of these scales was their perception that it is very time-consuming to complete these assessment scales.
CONCLUSION: Assessment scales have a role in the management and follow-up of CSM patients. While awareness regarding these tools is well spread, time constraint plays a major role in limiting its usage.

TI  - Role of Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Skull Base Paragangliomas - A Narrative Review
AU  - Garg, Kanwaljeet
AU  - Singh, Manmohan
T2  - Neurology India
AB  - Skull base paragangliomas, also known as glomus tumors, are grouped as glomus jugulare or glomus tympanicum. Paragangliomas are rare tumors, with an estimated incidence of 1 case per million persons. They occur more commonly in females and are more common in the fifth or sixth decade of life. Management of these tumors traditionally involved surgical excision. However, surgical excision can result in high complication rates, particularly cranial nerve palsies. Stereotactic radiosurgery has been shown to yield tumor control rates of more than 90%. A recent meta-analysis reported improvement in neurological status in 48.7% of cases, while it stabilized in 39.3% of patients. Transient deficits such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and hemifacial spasm developed following SRS in 5.8% of patients, while 2.1% of patients developed permanent deficits. There is no difference in the rate of tumor control between different radiosurgery techniques. Dose-fractionated SRS can be used for large tumors to decrease the risk of radiation-induced complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several scoring systems have been developed for assessment of patients with compressive cervical myelopathy. However, all of these have some shortcomings. We proposed a new modification of the modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) score-the AIIMS cervical myelopathy score (ACMS).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the ACMS with mJOA score and Nurick score.
METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with cervical compressive myelopathy. The new ACMS, mJOA, Nurick proposed by Benzel, and Nurick scores were recorded preoperatively and at three months postoperatively in patients.
RESULTS: Sixty-two patients completed the 3-month follow-up and were included in the final analysis. The mean preoperative and postoperative Nurick, mJOA, and ACMS scores were 3.3 and 3.0, 12.3 and 13.8, and 15.1 and 17.7, respectively. High correlation (Pearson's r > 0.8, 95% CI: 0.94 to 0.97, P < 0.005) was observed between ACMS and mJOA scores for all the individual components of both scales, both in pre- and postoperative assessments. A negative correlation was observed between the occupational ability scores ACMS and the Nurick scale (r = -0.76, 95% CI: -0.83 to - 0.68). No correlation was found with cord/canal ratio on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with any of the three scoring systems (preoperative, postoperative, or recovery rates).
CONCLUSIONS: The ACMS score showed a good correlation with the mJOA score for evaluation of functional disability in the setting of cervical myelopathy. The patients could themselves report the scores using the ACMS scoring chart. The occupational component of the ACMS also correlated well with the Nurick score.

AB  - Since the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, there has been an unprecedented increase in the acquisition of chest computed tomography (CT) scans. Nearly 616 million people have been infected by COVID-19 worldwide to date, of whom many were subjected to CT scanning. CT exposes the patients to hazardous ionizing radiation, which can damage the genetic material in the cells, leading to stochastic health effects in the form of heritable genetic mutations and increased cancer risk. These probabilistic, long-term carcinogenic effects of radiation can be seen over a lifetime and may sometimes take several decades to manifest. This review briefly describes what is known about the health effects of radiation, the lowest dose for which there exists compelling evidence about increased radiation-induced cancer risk and the evidence regarding this risk at typical CT doses. The lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer from low- and standard-dose chest CT scans performed in COVID-19 subjects is also discussed along with the projected number of future cancers that could be related to chest CT scans performed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The LAR of cancer Incidence from chest CT has also been compared with those from other radiation sources, daily life risks and lifetime baseline risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Complete subluxation of >100% of one vertebral body with respect to the adjacent vertebra is defined as spondyloptosis. It is the severest form of injury caused by high-energy trauma. Pediatric patients with a traumatic spine injury, particularly spondyloptosis are surgically demanding as reduction and achieving realignment of the spinal column requires diligent planning and execution.
OBJECTIVE: To enlighten readers about this rare but severest form of thoracolumbar spine injury and its management.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients treated here with spondyloptosis between 2008 and 2016 was done.
RESULTS: Seven children, ranging from 9 to 18 years (mean years) age were included in the study. Five patients had spondyloptosis at thoracolumbar junction and one each in the lumbar and thoracic spine. All patients underwent single-stage posterior surgical reduction and fixation except one patient who refused surgery. Intraoperatively, cord transection was seen in five patients while dura was intact in one patient. The mean follow-up period was 17 months (1-36 months) during which one patient expired due to complications arising from bedsores. All patients remained American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A neurologically.
CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic spondyloptosis is a challenging proposition to treat and the aim of surgery is to stabilize the spine. Rehabilitation remains the most crucial but the neglected part and dearth of proper rehabilitation centers inflict high mortality and morbidity in developing countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is currently one of the recommended treatments for symptomatic patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis (DTF). In this study, we aim to assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sorafenib in DTF patients.
METHODOLOGY: Patients aged>18 years with a histological diagnosis of DTF and who have received sorafenib were enroled in this prospective observational study. Demographic data, clinical profile, the initial dose of sorafenib, treatment-related toxicities, dose modifications, and responses were recorded. The primary objective was to assess the objective response rate (ORR). The secondary objectives were to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), tolerability, and adverse effects of sorafenib. Response assessment was based on response evaluation criteria in solid tumours 1.1 criteria. Adverse effects were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 criteria. Time to event was calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, and survival was compared by log-rank test. Univariate and multivariable cox regression analysis were used to find independent predictors of relapse.
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were enroled in the study. The median age of the study population was 32 (range, 18-81) years, and 66.35% of patients were females. On response assessment, ORR was 46.1% and stable disease was observed in 31.7% patients. ORR was higher in the appendicular site (51.7%) compared to the abdominal site (27.2%). PFS at 1 and 2 years was 86.6% (79.6-92.7%) and 73.7% (62.4-82.8%), respectively. Two-thirds (66.6%) of patients had already received some form of treatment. At the time of analysis, 70 (67.3%) patients were continuing sorafenib. Only 4.8% stopped sorafenib due to progression, 10.5% due to intolerable adverse effects, and 17.3% due to other reasons. The common treatment-related toxicities were hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) (89.4%), fatigue (79.8%), alopecia (70.1%), and diarrhoea (48.0%). In the patients with a starting dose of ≥400 mg (48.0% of patients), discontinuation was necessitated in 12% of patients, and further dose reduction was required in 58%, while only about 13% required dose reduction or discontinuation at a starting dose of 200 mg (51.9% of patients). Responses were not compromised due to lower starting doses.
CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib has good activity in DTF, but it is associated with significant toxicity. The adverse effect profile is distinct in Indian patients with higher HFSR and alopecia. Due to the high rate of dose reduction/discontinuation with a starting dose of 400 mg, a starting dose of 200 mg may be recommended in Indian patients.

AIM: To study the clinic-pathologic features and outcomes in patients with AM.
MATERIALS & METHODS: Clinical, pathologic findings and outcomes of patients with AM were recorded.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with AM were identified with median age of 57 years. Most patients presented in stage III (44.4%). Lymph node involvement was seen in 70.4%. The response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy was 16.6 and 25.0%, respectively. At a median follow up of 11 months, median overall survival was 30 months. Ballantine stage 3 and weight loss at presentation were predictors of poor survival.
CONCLUSION: AM presents at an advanced stage with lymph node and distant metastasis.

AB  - Pseudo-arthrosis of the proximal humerus is an uncommon condition that is difficult to treat. Humoral hypercalcemia from a benign tumour is a rare clinical entity and pleomorphic adenoma as its source has never been reported in the literature. We present the case of a 53-year-old gentleman with a pleomorphic parotid gland adenoma and pseudoarthrosis non-union of the proximal humerus exacerbated by symptomatic parathormone-independent hypercalcemia. The non-union is fixed using a novel technique of placing an ipsilateral cortico-cancellous iliac strut graft as a medial buttress and stabilized with a fixed-angle plate over the lateral side. Following the surgical resection of the tumour, hypercalcemia resolved and the patient improved clinically. This case is a good example of a rare endocrine disease managed by a multidisciplinary approach.

We report outcomes from three completed clinical trials in India: a single-arm study (V501-029 [NCT00380367]) in Indian girls (aged 9-15 years; N = 110) evaluating qHPV vaccine immunogenicity and safety; a subgroup analysis (n = 225) of Indian girls/boys (9-15 years) and women (16-26 years) from a global study (V503-002 [NCT00943722]) evaluating 9vHPV vaccine immunogenicity and safety; and a qHPV vaccine post-marketing safety surveillance study (V501-125) in Indian females (aged 9-45 years; N = 188) vaccinated during routine care. In V501-029 and V503-002, HPV vaccines were administered as 3 doses (Day 1, Month 2, Month 6). Serum HPV antibodies were evaluated by competitive Luminex immunoassays at Day 1 and Month 7 (both studies) and Months 12, 24, and 36 (V503-002 only). Adverse events (AEs) were collected by Vaccination Report Card. In V501-125, participants were actively surveilled for serious AEs (SAEs) within 30 days post-qHPV vaccination. In per-protocol analyses, qHPV and 9vHPV vaccines induced robust anti-HPV6/11/16/18 (V501-029) and HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 (V503-002) responses, respectively; ≥97% of participants seroconverted at Month 7 for each vaccine HPV type in both studies, and antibody responses persisted through 36 months in V503-002. The most common AEs were injection-site-associated. Most AEs were mild/moderate; no deaths, vaccine-related SAEs, or discontinuations due to AEs were reported. In V501-125, no SAE was reported. Overall, the qHPV and 9vHPV vaccines elicited robust antibody responses and were generally well tolerated in Indian participants.

AB  - We advise that only clinically validated HPV assays which have fulfilled internationally accepted performance criteria be used for primary cervical screening. Further, assays should be demonstrated to be fit for purpose in the laboratory in which they will ultimately be performed, and quality materials manuals and frameworks will be helpful in this endeavor. Importantly, there is a fundamental shortage of well validated, low-cost, low complexity HPV tests that have demonstrated utility in a near-patient setting; representing a significant challenge and focus for future development in order to reach the WHO's goal of eliminating cervical cancer.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health crisis and the number one cause of death for an infectious disease. The health consequences in high-burden countries are significant. Barriers to TB control and eradication are in part caused by difficulties in diagnosis. Improvements in diagnosis are required for organisations like the World Health Organisation (WHO) to meet their ambitious target of reducing the incidence of TB by 50% by the year 2025, which has become hard to reach due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Development of new tests for TB are key priorities of the WHO, as defined in their 2014 report for target product profiles (TPPs). Rapid triage and biomarker-based confirmatory tests would greatly enhance the diagnostic capability for identifying and diagnosing TB-infected individuals. Protein-based test methods e.g. lateral flow devices (LFDs) have a significant advantage over other technologies with regard to assay turnaround time (minutes as opposed to hours) field-ability, ease of use by relatively untrained staff and without the need for supporting laboratory infrastructure. Here we evaluate the diagnostic performance of nine biomarkers from our previously published biomarker qPCR validation study; CALCOCO2, CD274, CD52, GBP1, IFIT3, IFITM3, SAMD9L, SNX10 and TMEM49, as protein targets assayed by ELISA. This preliminary evaluation study was conducted to quantify the level of biomarker protein expression across latent, extra-pulmonary or pulmonary TB groups and negative controls, collected across the UK and India, in whole lysed blood samples (WLB). We also investigated associative correlations between the biomarkers and assessed their suitability for ongoing diagnostic test development, using receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (ROC) analyses, singly and in panel combinations. The top performing single biomarkers for pulmonary TB versus controls were CALCOCO2, SAMD9L, GBP1, IFITM3, IFIT3 and SNX10. TMEM49 was also significantly differentially expressed but downregulated in TB groups. CD52 expression was not highly differentially expressed across most of the groups but may provide additional patient stratification information and some limited use for incipient latent TB infection. These show therefore great potential for diagnostic test development either in minimal configuration panels for rapid triage or more complex formulations to capture the diversity of disease presentations.

T2  - Indian Journal of Ophthalmology
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the per operative intra-ocular lens (IOL) power calculation using intra-operative aberrometry (ORA) and its comparison with conventional methods.
METHODS: Patients with cataract planned for phacoemulsification by a single surgeon under topical anesthesia were enrolled in this prospective observational study in this prospective observational study. All patients underwent pre-operative biometry (Manual SRK-II and IOLMaster® 500) to determine the intra-ocular lens (IOL) power. Intra-operative aberrometry using ORA was also performed; however, IOL was inserted according to IOLMaster® (SRK/T). Spherical equivalent (SE) was recorded on post-operative days 1, 7, and 30. Patients were divided into three groups based on axial lengths for analysis. Comparative analysis was performed for the calculated IOL powers and prediction errors of ORA with conventional methods. Adjusted IOL power to calculate the emmetropic IOL using the LiHue formula was also determined and was compared with existing methods. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A total of 115 eyes from 113 patients were included, with a median age of 54.90 ± 14.3 years. The mean axial length was found to be 23.94 ± 2.3 mm. There was good agreement (87%) between ORA and IOLMaster® for calculated IOL powers with a mean difference of 0.047 ± 0.5D between the two (P = 0.33). A positive correlation was found between IOL power calculated using ORA, IOLMaster®, SRK-II, and adjusted IOL.
CONCLUSION: The use of intra-operative aberrometry (ORA) to calculate IOL power in patients undergoing uncomplicated phacoemulsification is non-inferior relative to standard pre-operative measurement and planning.

AB  - Pain is an unpleasant and upsetting experience. Persistent pain has an impact on an individual's quality of life which causes stress and mood disorders. There are currently no pain-relieving techniques available that can eliminate pain and offer relief without causing any adverse effects. These factors draw attention to traditional treatments like yoga and meditation, which can reduce biological stress and hence increase immunity, as well as alleviate the psychological and emotional suffering produced by pain. Yoga reduces the stress response and the pain cascade via the downregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and vagal stimulation. Yoga is a cost-effective growing health practice that, unlike pharmaceuticals, has no side effects and can help patients stay in remission for longer periods of time with fewer relapses. Yoga not only reduces stress and depression severity but also improves functional status and reduces pain perception. This article highlights the impact of yoga on pain management and on a malfunctioning immune system, which leads to improved health, pain reduction, disease management, and improvement in overall quality of life.

TI  - HLA-G 3'UTR polymorphisms & response to a yoga-based lifestyle intervention in rheumatoid arthritis: A randomized controlled trial
AU  - Gautam, Surabhi

T2  - The Indian Journal of Medical Research
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-G plays a vital role in immunomodulation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The mounting evidence suggests a link between HLA-G gene polymorphisms, disease susceptibility and methotrexate treatment response. Various environmental factors influence the onset and progression of RA and its treatment outcomes. The aim is to identify the treatment response of HLA-G 3' untranslated region polymorphisms to yoga-based lifestyle intervention (YBLI).
METHODS: In this eight-week single-blinded randomized controlled trial (CTRI/2017/05/008589), patients with RA (n=140) were randomized into two groups namely, yoga group or non-yoga group. Baseline genomic DNA was isolated using salting-out method. PCR-based methods were used for genotyping. The levels of soluble (s) HLA-G and disease activity were assessed by ELISA and disease activity score-28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), respectively, at baseline (day 0) and after eight weeks of intervention.
RESULTS: Low-producing sHLA-G genotypes, i.e. +3142GG and 14 bp ins/ins, showed a significant increase in sHLA-G levels after YBLI. The association analysis between HLA-G polymorphisms and treatment for RA showed no considerable differential treatment remission in either of the groups (P>0.05). The percentages of improvement were higher in the yoga group as compared to the non-yoga group in both the HLA-G +3142G>C and 14 bp ins/del polymorphisms irrespective of their respective genotypes. No significant association was found between sHLA-G levels and disease activity with respect to genotypes.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Yoga intervention results in improvement and reduced severity of RA in patients irrespective of the HLA-G 14 bp ins/del or +3142G>C polymorphisms. YBLI may be used as an adjunct therapy in RA independent of the genotypes.

AB  - Revision of an intrapelvic migration of the acetabular component of a total hip is a challenging surgery due to the risk of injury to the pelvic viscera. The primary concern is vascular injury due to the risk of mortality and limb loss. The researchers present one case where the acetabular screw was near the posterior branch of the internal iliac artery. A Fogarty catheter was placed in the internal iliac artery preoperatively, and the amount of fluid to inflate the catheter and completely block the artery was determined. The catheter was kept in a deflated condition. The hip reconstruction was performed, and there was no incidence of vascular injury during the procedure; hence, the Fogarty catheter was removed postsurgery. The placement of a Fogarty catheter in the at-risk vessel provides the freedom to proceed with the hip reconstruction through the standard approach. In case of an inadvertent event of a vascular injury, it can be inflated with the predetermined amount of saline to check the bleeding until the vascular surgeons take over the case.

TI  - Age-sex differences in the global burden of lower respiratory infections and risk factors, 1990-2019: results from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019
AU  - GBD 2019 LRI Collaborators
T2  - The Lancet. Infectious Diseases
AB  - BACKGROUND: The global burden of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) and corresponding risk factors in children older than 5 years and adults has not been studied as comprehensively as it has been in children younger than 5 years. We assessed the burden and trends of LRIs and risk factors across all age groups by sex, for 204 countries and territories.
METHODS: In this analysis of data for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we used clinician-diagnosed pneumonia or bronchiolitis as our case definition for LRIs. We included International Classification of Diseases 9th edition codes 079.6, 466-469, 470.0, 480-482.8, 483.0-483.9, 484.1-484.2, 484.6-484.7, and 487-489 and International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes A48.1, A70, B97.4-B97.6, J09-J15.8, J16-J16.9, J20-J21.9, J91.0, P23.0-P23.4, and U04-U04.9. We used the Cause of Death Ensemble modelling strategy to analyse 23 109 site-years of vital registration data, 825 site-years of sample vital registration data, 1766 site-years of verbal autopsy data, and 681 site-years of mortality surveillance data. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to analyse age-sex-specific incidence and prevalence data identified via systematic reviews of the literature, population-based survey data, and claims and inpatient data. Additionally, we estimated age-sex-specific LRI mortality that is attributable to the independent effects of 14 risk factors.
FINDINGS: Globally, in 2019, we estimated that there were 257 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 240-275) LRI incident episodes in males and 232 million (217-248) in females. In the same year, LRIs accounted for 1·30 million (95% UI 1·18-1·42) male deaths and 1·20 million (1·07-1·33) female deaths. Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates were 1·17 times (95% UI 1·16-1·18) and 1·31 times (95% UI 1·23-1·41) greater in males than in females in 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, LRI incidence and mortality rates declined at different rates across age groups and an increase in LRI episodes and deaths was estimated among all adult age groups, with males aged 70 years and older having the highest increase in LRI episodes (126·0% [95% UI 121·4-131·1]) and deaths (100·0% [83·4-115·9]). During the same period, LRI episodes and deaths in children younger than 15 years were estimated to have decreased, and the greatest decline was observed for LRI deaths in males younger than 5 years (-70·7% [-77·2 to -61·8]). The leading risk factors for LRI mortality varied across age groups and sex. More than half of global LRI deaths in children younger than 5 years were attributable to child wasting (population attributable fraction [PAF] 53·0% [95% UI 37·7-61·8] in males and 56·4% [40·7-65·1] in females), and more than a quarter of LRI deaths among those aged 5-14 years were attributable to household air pollution (PAF 26·0% [95% UI 16·6-35·5] for males and PAF 25·8% [16·3-35·4] for females). PAFs of male LRI deaths attributed to smoking were 20·4% (95% UI 15·4-25·2) in those aged 15-49 years, 30·5% (24·1-36·9) in those aged 50-69 years, and 21·9% (16·8-27·3) in those aged 70 years and older. PAFs of female LRI deaths attributed to household air pollution were 21·1% (95% UI 14·5-27·9) in those aged 15-49 years and 18·2% (12·5-24·5) in those aged 50-69 years. For females aged 70 years and older, the leading risk factor, ambient particulate matter, was responsible for 11·7% (95% UI 8·2-15·8) of LRI deaths.
INTERPRETATION: The patterns and progress in reducing the burden of LRIs and key risk factors for mortality varied across age groups and sexes. The progress seen in children younger than 5 years was clearly a result of targeted interventions, such as vaccination and reduction of exposure to risk factors. Similar interventions for other age groups could contribute to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals targets, including promoting wellbeing at all ages and reducing health inequalities. Interventions, including addressing risk factors such as child wasting, smoking, ambient particulate matter pollution, and household air pollution, would prevent deaths and reduce health disparities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of geographic and demographic disparities in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may affect the external validity of trials. While some studies have addressed racial or ethnic disparities, they have been limited to a certain region, and there is limited information about the global representation in orthopaedic research.
METHODS: RCTs published in major medical and orthopaedic journals from 2010 to 2019 were identified. After screening 6961 articles, 1769 trials enrolling 323,506 patients were included. The details of individual trials such as the country of origin, the proportion of women, and the proportion of different racial groups were recorded. Factors associated with reporting and representation of specific demographic groups, and annual changes were assessed.
RESULTS: Majority of the trials were from were from United States (US) (N = 380, 21.5%). US (30.7%, N = 99,356), United Kingdom (15.7%, N = 50,691) and Canada (8.3%, N = 26,890) accounted for majority of the enrolled patients. 59.1% of the patients were women. Among US trials reporting race, 81.2% were White, and 9.9% were African American. There was no significant variation in the global distribution (p = 0.056), percentage of women (p = 0.811), or percentage of Whites (p = 0.389) over the years.
CONCLUSION: The top three countries contributed to about 55% of the enrolled patients, whereas they contributed to only 6% of the world population. Overall, women appeared to be adequately represented in the trials, while racial minorities were underrepresented. There has not been any considerable improvement in the representation of developing regions or minorities over the last decade.

AB  - Disseminated cysticercosis is defined by the presence of multiple vesicular cystic lesions in the brain with cysts demonstrable in at least two other body parts. The exact course of disseminated cysticercosis is not known and the individual cysts either become inflamed or calcify. A patient's quality of life is often poor and disseminated cysticercosis treatment is far from satisfactory. Anecdotal reports have suggested dual antiparasitic therapy to be beneficial for treating diffuse parenchymal neurocysticerci and might be worth trying in patients with massively infiltrating disseminated cysticercosis with concomitant corticosteroids.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Trauma accounts for nearly 10% of the global burden of disease. Several trauma life support programmes aim to improve trauma outcomes. There is no evidence from controlled trials to show the effect of these programmes on patient outcomes. We describe the protocol of a pilot study that aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing advanced trauma life support (ATLS) and primary trauma care (PTC) with standard care.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will pilot a pragmatic three-armed parallel, cluster randomised controlled trial in India, where neither of these programmes are routinely taught. We will recruit tertiary hospitals and include trauma patients and residents managing these patients. Two hospitals will be randomised to ATLS, two to PTC and two to standard care. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality at 30 days from the time of arrival to the emergency department. Our secondary outcomes will include patient, provider and process measures. All outcomes except time-to-event outcomes will be measured both as final values as well as change from baseline. We will compare outcomes in three combinations of trial arms: ATLS versus PTC, ATLS versus standard care and PTC versus standard care using absolute and relative differences along with associated CIs. We will conduct subgroup analyses across the clinical subgroups men, women, blunt multisystem trauma, penetrating trauma, shock, severe traumatic brain injury and elderly. In parallel to the pilot study, we will conduct community consultations to inform the planning of the full-scale trial.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: We will apply for ethics approvals to the local institutional review board in each hospital. The protocol will be published to Clinical Trials Registry-India and ClinicalTrials.gov. The results will be published and the anonymised data and code for analysis will be released publicly.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins and aspirin have been proposed for treatment of COVID-19 because of their anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Several observational studies have shown favourable results. There is a need for a randomised controlled trial.
METHODS: In this single-center, open-label, randomised controlled trial, 900 RT-PCR positive COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalisation, were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 40 mg (Group A, n = 224), aspirin 75 mg (Group B, n = 225), or both (Group C, n = 225) in addition to standard of care for 10 days or until discharge whichever was earlier or only standard of care (Group D, n = 226). The primary outcome variable was clinical deterioration to WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement ≥ 6. The secondary outcome was change in serum C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and troponin I.
RESULTS: The primary outcome occurred in 25 (2.8%) patients: 7 (3.2%) in Group A, 3 (1.4%) in Group B, 8 (3.6%) in Group C, and 7 (3.2%) in Group D. There was no difference in primary outcome across the study groups (P = 0.463). Comparison of all patients who received atorvastatin or aspirin with the control group (Group D) also did not show any benefit [Atorvastatin: HR 1.0 (95% CI 0.41-2.46) P = 0.99; Aspirin: HR 0.7 (95% CI 0.27-1.81) P = 0.46]. The secondary outcomes revealed lower serum interleukin-6 levels among patients in Groups B and C. There was no excess of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients admitted with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, additional treatment with aspirin, atorvastatin, or a combination of the two does not prevent clinical deterioration. Trial Registry Number CTRI/2020/07/026791 ( http://ctri.nic.in ; registered on 25/07/2020).

AB  - IMPORTANCE: The use of perioperative, prophylactic, intravenous antibiotics is standard practice to reduce the risk of surgical site infection after oncologic resection and complex endoprosthetic reconstruction for lower extremity bone tumors. However, evidence guiding the duration of prophylactic treatment remains limited.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a 5-day regimen of postoperative, prophylactic, intravenous antibiotics compared with a 1-day regimen on the rate of surgical site infections within 1 year after surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical superiority trial was performed at 48 clinical sites in 12 countries from January 1, 2013, to October 29, 2019. The trial included patients with a primary bone tumor or a soft tissue sarcoma that had invaded the femur or tibia or oligometastatic bone disease of the femur or tibia with expected survival of at least 1 year who required surgical management by excision and endoprosthetic reconstruction. A total of 611 patients were enrolled, and 7 were excluded for ineligibility.
INTERVENTIONS: A 1- or 5-day regimen of postoperative prophylactic intravenous cephalosporin (cefazolin or cefuroxime) that began within 8 hours after skin closure and was administered every 8 hours thereafter. Those randomized to the 1-day regimen received identical saline doses every 8 hours for the remaining 4 days; patients, care providers, and outcomes assessors were blinded to treatment regimen.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome in this superiority trial was a surgical site infection (superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ space) classified according to the criteria established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within 1 year after surgery. Secondary outcomes included antibiotic-related complications, unplanned additional operations, oncologic and functional outcomes, and mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 604 patients included in the final analysis (mean [SD] age, 41.2 [21.9] years; 361 [59.8%] male; 114 [18.9%] Asian, 43 [7.1%] Black, 34 [5.6%] Hispanic, 15 [2.5%] Indigenous, 384 [63.8%] White, and 12 [2.0%] other), 293 were randomized to a 5-day regimen and 311 to a 1-day regimen. A surgical site infection occurred in 44 patients (15.0%) allocated to the 5-day regimen and in 52 patients (16.7%) allocated to the 1-day regimen (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.62-1.40; P = .73). Antibiotic-related complications occurred in 15 patients (5.1%) in the 5-day regimen and in 5 patients (1.6%) allocated to the 1-day regimen (hazard ratio, 3.24; 95% CI, 1.17-8.98; P = .02). Other secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial did not confirm the superiority of a 5-day regimen of postoperative intravenous antibiotics over a 1-day regimen in preventing surgical site infections after surgery for lower extremity bone tumors that required an endoprosthesis. The 5-day regimen group had significantly more antibiotic-related complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Azithromycin has immunomodulatory actions, and its beneficial effects have been demonstrated in asthmatic adults. Data on children are limited.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the addition of oral azithromycin to standard therapy in children with poorly controlled asthma improve asthma control compared with standard treatment alone?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This open-label randomized controlled trial included children (5-15 years of age) with poorly controlled asthma defined by Asthma Control Test (ACT) and Childhood Asthma Control Test (CACT) score of ≤ 19. They were randomized to receive azithromycin (10 mg/kg) three times weekly for 3 months along with standard treatment or standard treatment alone. The primary outcome was the ACT and CACT scores at 3 months. Secondary outcomes were asthma control according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the number of exacerbations, change in spirometry parameters, change in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (Feno) level, positive throat swab results, and side effects.
RESULTS: The trial included 120 children (89 boys; 60 in each group). The mean ± SD age was 9.9 ± 3 years. The baseline parameters were similar between the groups. Mean ± SD ACT and CACT scores (available for 115 children) at 3 months of intervention were 21.71 ± 2.17 vs 18.33 ± 2.19 (P < .001) in the azithromycin and control groups, respectively. The numbers of children with well-controlled asthma according to GINA guidelines were 41 of 56 vs 10 of 56 in the azithromycin and control groups, respectively (P < .001). The median number of exacerbations requiring emergency visit and steroid use were fewer in the azithromycin group: 0 (interquartile range [IQR], 3) vs 1 [IQR, 6]; P < .001). No difference was found in Feno level, spirometry parameters, positive throat swab results, and adverse effects between the groups.
INTERPRETATION: The use of azithromycin in children with poorly controlled asthma resulted in improved asthma control and reduced exacerbations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Excess hepatic and pancreatic fat may contribute to hyperglycemia.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) on anthropometric profile, liver, and pancreatic fat in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
METHODS: This is an observational interventional paired study design without a control group. Patients (n = 30) were given dapagliflozin 10 mg/day (on top of stable dose of metformin and/or sulfonylureas) for 120 days. Changes in anthropometry (circumferences and skinfold thickness), surrogate markers of insulin resistance, body composition, liver, and pancreatic fat (as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived proton density fat fraction [FF]) were evaluated.
RESULTS: After 120 days of treatment with dapagliflozin, a statistically significant reduction in weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat, circumferences, and all skinfold thickness was seen. A statistically significant reduction in blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c, hepatic transaminases, fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and postprandial C-peptide was noted, while HOMA-β, postprandial insulin sensitivity, and fasting adiponectin were statistically significantly increased. There was no change in lean body mass. Compared to baseline there was a statistically significant decrease in mean liver FF (from 15.2% to 10.1%, P < .0001) and mean pancreatic FF (from 7.5% to 5.99%, P < .0083). Reduction in liver fat was statistically significant after adjustment for change in body weight.
CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin, after 120 days of use, reduced pancreatic and liver fat and increased insulin sensitivity in Asian Indian patients with T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: No qualitative or quantitative analysis of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images has been reported for the differentiation between ameloblastomas and central giant cell granulomas (CGCGs).
AIM: To describe differentiating multidetector CT (MDCT) features in CGCGs and ameloblastomas and to compare differences in enhancement of these lesions qualitatively and using histogram analysis.
METHODS: MDCT of CGCGs and ameloblastomas was retrospectively reviewed to evaluate qualitative imaging descriptors. Histogram analysis was used to compare the extent of enhancement of the soft tissue. Fisher's exact tests and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05).
RESULTS: Twelve CGCGs and 33 ameloblastomas were reviewed. Ameloblastomas had a predilection for the posterior mandible with none of the CGCGs involving the angle. CGCGs were multilocular (58.3%), with a mixed lytic sclerotic appearance (75%). Soft tissue component was present in 91% of CGCGs, which showed hyperenhancement (compared to surrounding muscles) in 50% of cases, while the remaining showed isoenhancement. Matrix mineralization was present in 83.3% of cases. Ameloblastomas presented as a unilocular (66.7%), lytic (60.6%) masses with solid components present in 81.8% of cases. However, the solid component showed isoenhancement in 63%. No matrix mineralization was present in 69.7% of cases. Quantitatively, the enhancement of soft tissue in CGCG was significantly higher than in ameloblastoma on histogram analysis (P < 0.05), with a minimum enhancement of > 49.05 HU in the tumour providing 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity in identifying a CGCG.
CONCLUSION: A multilocular, lytic sclerotic lesion with significant hyperenhancement in soft tissue, which spares the angle of the mandible and has matrix mineralization, should indicate prospective diagnosis of CGCG.

T2  - Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)
AB  - AIM: Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) in hair is a direct biomarker proven to be useful for the detection of chronic excessive alcohol use. This study investigated the association of self-reported alcohol consumption with traditional biomarkers: GGT, AST, ALT, CDT, and MCV in blood and a direct biomarker, hair EtG, in a total of 122 patients with alcohol dependence syndrome. The diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers to differentiate heavy from non-heavy drinkers was also evaluated.
METHOD: GGT, AST, and ALT in serum were measured by Automated Chemistry Analyzer, MCV in blood was measured by Haematology Analyzer, serum CDT was analyzed by ELISA, and EtG in hair was evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The association between the biomarkers and the amount of alcohol consumed (self-reported) was determined using Spearman's rank correlation.
RESULTS: All participants showed EtG level above the cut-off (0.03 ng/mg). Hair EtG showed a statistically significant linear and positive correlation with the amounts (in grams) of alcohol consumed (r = 0.60; p < 0.001). No correlation was observed among the traditional biomarkers and the quantity of alcohol consumed. Also, EtG showed an excellent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (98%) with good sensitivity (85%) and specificity (60%) to classify heavy drinkers among individuals with alcohol dependence syndrome.
CONCLUSION: Hair EtG can be helpful to estimate retrospective alcohol consumption in long-term chronic alcohol consumption cases. Hair EtG also provides a reliable diagnostic test to detect heavy drinkers among individuals with alcohol dependence syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly evolved into a pandemic, affecting more than 90 million people and more than 1.9 million deaths worldwide. Despite extensive study, the prognostic role of various hematological and biochemical parameters remains unclear.
METHODS: This study was carried out at a COVID care facility in Delhi. The demographic and clinical information, laboratory parameters (hematological, biochemical, and inflammatory), and the treatment of admitted COVID-19 patients during first wave were collected from electronic medical records and were subsequently analyzed.
RESULTS: Between March 2020 and November 2020, a total of 5574 patients were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19. Majority (77.2%) were male and had a mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of 38.9 (14.9) years. The mean (SD) duration of hospital stay was significantly higher in nonsurvivors. Out of the entire cohort, 8.7% of the patients had comorbidities, whereas 47.1% of the patients were asymptomatic at presentation. Compared to the survivors, the nonsurvivors had a significantly higher proportion of comorbidities and were more likely to be symptomatic. Patients who died during hospital stay had significantly higher relative neutrophil percent and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and lower lymphocyte percent. The patients who died had significantly higher levels of ferritin, D-dimer, and fibrinogen.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of various hematological and inflammatory parameters can provide useful prognostic information among COVID-19-affected patients. It can also help in identifying patients who merit aggressive institutional care and thereby potentially mitigate the mortality.

TI  - Intrathecal Co-administration of Morphine Facilitated the Anti-nociceptive of Bupivacaine in a Rat Model of Acute Postoperative Pain
AU  - Ghosh, Tamoghna
AU  - Basu Ray, Subrata
T2  - Cureus
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bupivacaine is one of the commonly used agents for spinal anaesthesia. Moreover, co-administration with morphine can likely increase its anti-nociceptive effect bringing about a reduction in the required dose of bupivacaine. Though this has been observed clinically, preclinical studies on the efficacy of this drug combination are lacking.
METHODS: Sprague Dawley rats, previously implanted with intrathecal catheters, were administered either bupivacaine (30 mcg) or morphine (30 mcg) or both bupivacaine and morphine (15 mcg each). These doses were determined following prior evaluation of different doses of bupivacaine (3, 10 and 30 mcg). Rats were subjected to hind paw incision under isoflurane anaesthesia, 15 min after drug administration. Anti-nociception was evaluated by estimating mechanical allodynia in a fixed peri-incisional area using von Frey filaments. This was done 4 h after the incision.
RESULTS: Both bupivacaine and morphine attenuated allodynia though morphine was more effective. Co-administration of both drugs at half the doses increased the antinociceptive effect of bupivacaine to the 30 mcg dose level.
CONCLUSION: The underlying reason for this enhanced anti-nociception could be the different neural mechanisms responsible for anti-nociception. Local anaesthetics inhibit the generation of action potentials by blocking sodium channels whereas opioids like morphine act through G-protein coupled mu opioid receptor-linked closure of calcium channels in presynaptic terminals. In conclusion, the addition of morphine can facilitate bupivacaine's anti-nociceptive effect following intrathecal administration. This information could have clinical relevance in the treatment of postoperative pain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to describe the clinical profile and risk factors for severe disease in adolescents hospitalised with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an admitted cohort of COVID-19 patients was performed at a tertiary hospital in North India. Adolescents aged 12-18 years who were hospitalised during the first wave (March-December, 2020) and the second wave (March-June, 2021) were included. Data on the demographic details, clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, disease severity at admission, treatments received, and in-hospital outcomes were retrieved.
RESULTS: The study included 197 adolescents with a median [inter-quartile range (IQR)] age of 15 (13-17) years, of whom 117 (59.4%) were male. Among these, 170 (86.3%) were admitted during the first wave. Underlying co-morbidities were present in nine (4.6%) patients. A total of 60 (30.9%) patients were asymptomatic. In the severity grading, 148 (84.6%) had mild, 16 (9.1%) had moderate, and 11 (6.3%) had severe disease. Fever (14.9%) and cough (14.9%) were the most commonly encountered symptoms. The median (IQR) duration of hospital stay was 10 (8-13) days, and six (3.1%) patients died in the hospital.
CONCLUSION: Adolescents admitted with COVID-19 had predominantly asymptomatic or mild disease, and the mortality rate was 3.1%.

AB  - The Indian Neurogastroenterology and Motility Association (INMA), earlier named the Indian Motility and Functional Diseases Association developed this evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). A modified Delphi process was used to develop this consensus containing 28 statements, which were concerning diagnostic criteria, epidemiology, etiopathogenesis and comorbidities, investigations, lifestyle modifications and treatments. Owing to the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, lockdowns and mobility restrictions, web-based meetings and electronic voting were the major tools used to develop this consensus. A statement was regarded as accepted when the sum of "completely accepted" and "accepted with minor reservation" voted responses were 80% or higher. Finally, the consensus was achieved on all 28 statements. The consensus team members are of the view that this work may find use in teaching, patient care, and research on IBS in India and other nations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indigenous people globally experience poor nutrition outcomes, with women facing the greater burden. Munda, a predominant tribe in Jharkhand, India, live in a biodiverse food environment but yet have high levels of malnutrition.
OBJECTIVES: To assess diets and the nutritional status of Munda tribal women and explore associations with their Indigenous food consumption, dietary diversity, and socioeconomic and demographic profiles.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study with a longitudinal component to capture seasonal dietary intake was conducted in 11 villages of the Khunti district, Jharkhand. Household surveys and FFQs, supplemented with 2-d 24-h dietary recall and anthropometric assessments on 1 randomly selected woman per household were conducted.
RESULTS: Limited access to diverse foods from a natural food environment (Food Accessed Diversity Index score of 0.3 ± 0.3) was observed. More than 90% women in both seasons had usual nutrient intakes below the estimated average requirements for all nutrients except protein and vitamin C; 35.5% of women were underweight. The mean Minimum Dietary Diversity Score among women (MDDS) was low [2.6 ± 0.6 in wet monsoon; 3 ± 0.7 in winters (acceptable ≥5)]. Higher MDDS contributed to higher usual nutrient intakes (P <0.001). Indigenous food intakes in both seasons (wet monsoon and winter) were low, e.g. Indigenous green leafy vegetables [10.5 and 27.8% of the recommended dietary intake (RDI), respectively], other vegetables (5.2% and 7.8% of RDI, respectively), and fruits (5.8 and 22.8% of RDI, respectively). Despite low intakes, the Indigenous food consumption score was positively associated with usual intake of vitamin A, riboflavin, vitamin C, pyridoxine, and calcium (P < 0.05) in the wet monsoon and thiamine, riboflavin, and zinc (P < 0.001) in winters. After adjusting for covariates, Indigenous food consumption was associated with a higher usual intake of vitamin A (P  < 0.001) in the wet monsoon season.
CONCLUSION: Contextual food-based interventions promoting Indigenous foods and increasing dietary diversity have the potential to address malnutrition in Munda women.

T2  - Microvascular Research
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), several angiogenic factors are overexpressed in the hepatic microenvironment, which play a critical role in governing the phenotype of the endothelial cells. Mutation in the p53 gene (TP53) is a common event in HCC that may dysregulate the angiogenic signals. However, their functional messages remain largely unexplored at the onset of metastasis.
METHODS: Role of p53 was studied by siRNA mediated silencing of p53 in HepG2 cells (WTp53), collecting and analyzing their conditioned medium, followed by indirect co-culture with endothelial cells (HUVECs). Gene and protein expression in HCC cells and endothelial cells was studied by RT-qPCR and western blotting respectively. β-catenin protein expression and localization were analyzed by immunocytochemistry.
RESULTS: We have studied a cell-to-cell interaction model to investigate the crosstalk of endothelial and hepatoma cells by either knocking down p53 or by using p53 null low metastatic HCC cell line. In the absence of p53, the HCC cells influence the migration and vascular network formation of endothelial cells through paracrine signaling of VEGF. Secretory VEGF activated the VEGF receptor-2 along with the survival signaling in endothelial cells. However, the β-catenin signal is upregulated in endothelial cells only during interaction with metastatic set up irrespective of absence and presence of p53, indicating context-dependent participation of p53 during communication between hepatoma cells and endothelial cells.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights that the role of p53 on cellular responses during interaction of hepatocellular carcinoma and endothelial cells is distinct to cell types and context.

TI  - Divergent effect of Birinapant, and BV6 SMAC mimetic on TNFα induced NF-κB signaling and cell viability in activated hepatic stellate cells
AU  - Ghufran, Shaikh Maryam
AU  - Sharma, Sachin
AU  - Ghose, Sampa
AU  - Biswas, Subhrajit
T2  - Molecular Biology Reports
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) mediated cell survival as well as cell death. High serum TNFα levels correlate with liver fibrosis and enhance hepatic stellate cell (HSC) viability. However, the regulatory role of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1/2 (cIAP1/2) during TNFα induced NF-κB signaling in activated HSCs is largely unknown.
METHOD AND RESULTS: Activated HSCs were treated with cIAP1/2 inhbitiors i.e., SMAC mimetic BV6, and Birinapant in the presence of TNFα and macrophage conditioned media. TNFα cytokine increased cIAP2 expression and enhanced cell viability through the canonical NF-κB signaling in activated HSCs. cIAP2 inhibition via BV6 decreased the TNFα induced canonical NF-κB signaling, and reduced cell viability in activated HSCs. SMAC mimetic, Birinapant alone did not affect the cell viability but treatment of TNFα sensitized HSCs with Birinapant induced cell death. While BV6 mediated cIAP2 ablation was able to decrease the TNFα induced canonical NF-κB signaling, this effect was not observed with Birinapant treatment. Secreted TNFα from M1 polarized macrophages sensitized activated HSCs to BV6 or Birinapant mediated cell death. However, M2 polarized macrophage conditioned medium rescued the activated HSCs from BV6 mediated cytotoxicity.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we describe the regulatory role of cIAP2 in TNFα induced NF-κB signaling in activated HSCs. Targeting cIAP2 may be a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment via modulating NF-κB signaling in activated HSCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Spirituality has an impact on the quality of life of palliative care patients and it influences the way in which they experience their disease. Spiritual distress is a common issue among palliative care patients in India that is best assessed through a tool specifically designed for them. This study presents the findings of a psychometric assessment of SpiDiscI: a 16-item spiritual distress scale for Hindi speaking palliative care patients in India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a non-experimental cross-sectional sample survey design. 400 cancer patients undergoing pain treatment at the pain and palliative care unit of a tertiary cancer hospital in New Delhi enrolled in the study and completed the study's questionnaire. The questionnaire contained a section on demographic information, a numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain, SpiDiscI, FACIT-Sp-12, and WHOQOL-BREF. A subset of 50 patients with stable pain completed SpiDiscI a 2nd time 2 weeks after the first administration of the scale to assess test-retest reliability.
RESULTS: The scale's internal consistency is very good (Cronbach's Alpha 0.85). Spiritual distress scores ranged from 0 to 93.8 (mean 37.1, SD 23.6). Significant negative correlations between SpiDiScI and both FACIT-Sp-12 (R = -0.16, P = 0.001) and WHOQOL-BREF (R = -0.27, P < 0.001) confirmed convergent validity. There was no significant association with NRS pain scores (R = 0.06, P = 0.224). The highly significant association (R = 0.75, P < 0.001) of the scores on assessments 2 weeks apart confirmed test-retest reliability.
CONCLUSION: SpiDiScI is a reliable and valid measure to assess spiritual distress in research among Hindi speaking palliative care patients in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the high prevalence of traumatic dental injuries (TDIs), parents generally lack awareness about dental trauma emergency management. This preliminary study's goal was to assess parents'/guardians' awareness of the treatment of tooth fractures/avulsion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A preformed questionnaire in e-format was sent to parents of school-going children. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilks's test were employed to test the normality of data. In addition, a Chi-square test was performed for quantitative variables. P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: A response rate of 82.1% was achieved. Approximately 19.6% of parents reported dental injuries, with the majority (51.9%) occurring at home. In avulsion, 54.8% of parents believed that reinserting the tooth back into the socket was possible. For tooth fractures, 36.2% of parents believed that the fractured tooth could be glued. Tap water was preferred as a storage medium (43.3%). An insignificant association was observed with regard to storage media (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Inadequate understanding of the treatment of TDI by the primary caregiver leads to ineffective interventions at the scene of the accident and a poor prognosis for otherwise treatable cases.

AB  - Rosette forming glioneural tumors (RGNT) are a rare type of low-grade brain tumor included in 2007 in WHO classification. Given the benign nature of the disease, a complete surgical excision has been considered optimum. However, a handful of cases have reported the locally aggressive nature of RGNT. In addition, radiation may also be considered for a tumor located in areas where surgical excision is difficult. We present a similar case, where surgical risk was weighed against resection and we treated the patient with conformal radiation.

AB  - AIM: Salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy. The optimal treatment protocols are debated.
METHODOLOGY: A systematic search and individual patient data analysis of published cases of SDC was performed. SPSS v21 was used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Data of 857 patients available. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) of the entire cohort 42 months and 24 months. Nodal involvement, males, primary size >5 cm, androgen receptor (AR) negativity significantly worse OS. Patients with surgery had a favorable median PFS (p = 0.000) and OS (p = 0.077). Patients with adjuvant radiation had better PFS (30 vs 18 months; p = 0.077).
CONCLUSION: SDC has modest survival. Surgery and adjuvant radiation should be advocated for all patients. AR expression appears prognostic for survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hemispherotomy surgery in adults is shrouded in doubts regarding the functional outcome. The age at surgery alone should not be the deciding factor for surgery. Language paradigms were used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to confirm the role played by the age at the onset of seizures to predict the postoperative functional outcome. The objective of the study was to formulate an optimal strategy for patient selection for the left-sided hemispherotomy in adults, based on functional outcome analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 20 participants (age at surgery 1-26 years) who underwent left hemispherotomy (over a 5-year period) was conducted. The language and motor functional assessments of 18 participants (13 pediatric and five adult participants; attrition of participants- two) were recorded at presentation and during follow-up visits. After approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee, 13 cooperative participants (eight pediatric and five adult participants) underwent language fMRI. Motor fMRI with both active and passive paradigms was done in 16 participants.
RESULTS: All 18 participants with a mean follow-up of 24 months had class I seizure-free outcome. Of these 18, five were adults (mean age = 21 years, range: 18-22 years) and 13 were in the pediatric age group (mean age = 8 years, range: 2-15 years). Postoperatively, four adults retained both verbal fluency and language comprehension at a mean follow-up period of 38 months (range: 24-48 months). Their pre- and post-op language fMRI showed word generation and regional activations for semantic comprehension in the right hemisphere. The motor area activations were seen in the right hemisphere in two and in the left hemisphere in two participants. Among the pediatric participants, four (group I [n = 4/13]) who had good language outcome showed activations in the right hemisphere. In two participants (group II [n = 2/13]) who deteriorated postoperatively, the activations were in the left hemisphere. Five participants (group III [n = 5/13]) who retained the telegraphic language postoperatively had bilateral activations of semantic comprehension areas in fMRI. All 13 pediatric participants had motor area activations seen in the left hemisphere, similar to controls.
CONCLUSION: Left hemispherotomy can be advised to adults with comparably good postoperative language and motor outcome as in the pediatric age group, provided the weakness is acquired perinatally or below the age of 7 years. The fMRI is a valuable tool to aid in patient selection.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cumulative exposure to high blood pressure (BP) is an adverse prognostic marker. Assessments of BP control over time, such as time at target, have been developed but assessments of the effects of BP-lowering interventions on such measures are lacking.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether low-dose triple combination antihypertensive therapy was associated with greater rates of time at target compared with usual care.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Triple Pill vs Usual Care Management for Patients With Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial was a open-label randomized clinical trial of low-dose triple BP therapy vs usual care conducted in urban hospital clinics in Sri Lanka from February 2016 to May 2017. Adults with hypertension (systolic BP >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg or in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, systolic BP >130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg) requiring initiation (untreated patients) or escalation (patients receiving monotherapy) of antihypertensive therapy were included. Patients were excluded if they were currently taking 2 or more blood pressure-lowering drugs or had severe or uncontrolled blood pressure, accelerated hypertension or physician-determined need for slower titration of treatment, a contraindication to the triple combination pill therapy, an unstable medical condition, or clinically significant laboratory values deemed by researchers to be unsuitable for the study. All 700 individuals in the original trial were included in the secondary analysis. This post hoc analysis was conducted from December 2020 to December 2021.
INTERVENTION: Once-daily fixed-dose triple combination pill (telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, and chlorthalidone 12.5 mg) therapy vs usual care.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Between-group differences in time at target were compared over 24 weeks of follow-up, with time at target defined as percentage of time at target BP.
RESULTS: There were a total of 700 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 56 [11] years; 403 [57.6%] women). Patients allocated to the triple pill group (n = 349) had higher time at target compared with those in the usual care group (n = 351) over 24 weeks' follow-up (64% vs 43%; risk difference, 21%; 95% CI, 16-26; P < .001). Almost twice as many patients receiving triple pill therapy achieved more than 50% time at target during follow-up (64% vs 37%; P < .001). The association of the triple pill with an increase in time at target was seen early, with most patients achieving more than 50% time at target by 12 weeks. Those receiving the triple pill achieved a consistently higher time at target at all follow-up periods compared with those receiving usual care (mean [SD]: 0-6 weeks, 36.3% [30.9%] vs 21.7% [28.9%]; P < .001; 6-12 weeks, 55.2% [31.9%] vs 33.7% [33.0%]; P < .001; 12-24 weeks, 66.0% [31.1%] vs 43.5% [34.3%]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, this analysis provides the first estimate of time at target as an outcome assessing longitudinal BP control in a randomized clinical trial. Among patients with mild to moderate hypertension, treatment with a low-dose triple combination pill was associated with substantially higher time at target compared with usual care.

METHODS: Data regarding the patients' characteristics, isolates on CAUTI and CLABSI, antibiotic susceptibility, frailty (11-point Modified Frailty Index), and inflammatory markers were retrospectively collected. Their impact on the short-term outcomes was assessed using regression modeling response.
RESULTS: One hundred and one patients with CAUTI (n = 71) and CLABSI (n = 30) between January 2018 and December 2019 were included in this study. The pooled incidence rates for CAUTI were 5.50 and for CLABSI 3.58 episodes/1000 catheter-days. We observed 74.7% drug resistance in our CAUTI isolates and 93.3% in CLABSI. In the multivariate analysis, frailty (P = 0.006), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P = 0.007) and the presence of sepsis (P = 0.029) were found to be significant predictors of in-hospital mortality in CAUTI. In patients with CLABSI, frailty (P = 0.029) and NLR (P = 0.029) were found significant and along with sepsis (P = 0.069) resulted in a regression model with good accuracy in predicting mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that 11-point Modified Frailty Index and NLR as well as the regression model significantly predicted mortality with an area under the curve of 86.1%, 81.4%, and 95.4%, respectively, in CAUTI, and 70.9%, 77.8%, and 95.2%, respectively, in CLABSI.

AB  - Introduction: Data are limited on antibody response to the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222; Covishield®) in cirrhosis. We studied the antibody response following two doses of the ChAdOx1 vaccine, given 4−12 weeks apart, in cirrhosis. Methods: Prospectively enrolled, 131 participants (71% males; age 50 (43−58); alcohol-related etiology 14, hepatitis B 33, hepatitis C 46, cryptogenic 21, autoimmune 9, others 8; Child−Turcott−Pugh class A/B/C 52/63/16). According to dose intervals, the participants were grouped as ≤6 weeks (group I), 7−12 weeks (group II), and 13−36 weeks (group III). Blood specimens collected at ≥4 weeks after the second dose were tested for anti-spike antibody titre (ASAb; positive ≥ 0.80 U/mL) and neutralizing antibody (NAb; positive ≥20% neutralization) using Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S (Roche) and SARS-CoV-2 NAb ELISA Kit (Invitrogen), respectively. Data are expressed as number (proportion) and median (interquartile range) and compared using non-parametric tests. Results: Overall, 99.2% and 84% patients developed ASAb (titre 5440 (1719−9980 U/mL)) and NAb (92 (49.1−97.6%)), respectively. When comparing between the study groups, the ASAb titres were significantly higher in group II than in group I (2613 (310−7518) versus 6365 (2968−9463), p = 0.027) but were comparable between group II and III (6365 (2968−9463) versus 5267 (1739−11,653), p = 0.999). Similarly, NAb was higher in group II than in group I (95.5 (57.6−98.0) versus 45.9 (15.4−92.0); p < 0.001), but not between the groups II and III (95.5 (57.6−98.0) versus 92.4 (73.8−97.5); p = 0.386). Conclusion: Covishield® induces high titres of ASAb and NAb in cirrhosis. A higher titre is achieved if two doses are given at an interval of more than six weeks.

AB  - Leukemia is a heterogeneous group of hematological malignancies distinguished by differentiation blockage and uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid or lymphoid progenitor cells in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB). There are various types of leukemia in which intensive chemotherapy regimens or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are now the most common treatments associated with severe side effects and multi-drug resistance in leukemia cells. Therefore, it is crucial to develop novel therapeutic approaches with adequate therapeutic efficacy and selectively eliminate leukemic cells to improve the consequences of leukemia. Medicinal plants have been utilized for ages to treat multiple disorders due to their diverse bioactive compounds. Plant-derived products have been used as therapeutic medication to prevent and treat many types of cancer. Over the last two decades, 50 % of all anticancer drugs approved worldwide are from natural products and their derivatives. Therefore this study aims to review natural products such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenoids, nitrogen-containing, and organosulfur compounds as antileukemic agents. Current investigations have identified natural products efficiently destroy leukemia cells through diverse mechanisms of action by inhibiting proliferation, reactive oxygen species production, inducing cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in both in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies. Current investigations have identified natural products as suitable promising chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents. It played an essential role in drug development and emerged as a possible source of biologically active metabolites for therapeutic interventions, especially in leukemia.

T2  - Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to establish the role of inflammation in bortezomibinduced peripheral neuropathy (BIPN).
BACKGROUND: Peripheral neuropathy is the dose-limiting toxicity of bortezomib that can lead to discontinuation of the treatment. There are multiple mechanisms involved in the disposition of BIPN. However, the role of inflammatory mediators is still under investigation. A complete understanding of inflammatory markers in relation to BIPN can lead to the development of effective therapy for prophylaxis and treatment of peripheral neuropathy.
OBJECTIVE: Based on the available data, the role of inflammatory mediators in the development of peripheral neuropathy due to bortezomib has been postulated.
METHODS: The "Pubmed" and "Google Scholar" were used as the search engines with terms like "peripheral neuropathy", "bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy" and "inflammation". Original research, case reports and review articles were considered.
RESULTS: Bortezomib use is associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy. This effect is due to the damage to Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion neurons, mitochondrial damage, increased ion channel susceptibility, and higher infiltration of macrophages in the spinal cord. All these factors collectively increase the secretion of inflammatory mediators and lead to the development of neuropathic pain.
CONCLUSION: Targeting inflammatory mediators may be helpful in the treatment of bortezomibinduced peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - With the overuse and misuse of antibiotics amid COVID-19 pandemic, the antimicrobial resistance, which is already a global challenge, has accelerated its pace significantly. Finding novel and potential antibiotics seems one of the probable solutions. In this work, a novel Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 was isolated and found to be an excellent source of antimicrobials as confirmed by agar-plug assay. It showed antibacterial activity against infection-causing bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, Streptomyces sp. strain EMB24 inhibited the growth methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), tetracycline-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and ampicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Furthermore, to get deep insights about the genome and biosynthetic gene clusters producing antibiotics, whole genome sequencing was done. The strain EMB24 is closely related to the Streptomyces longispororuber as revealed by phylogenetic analysis which is a potential source of antibiotics and pigments as undecylprodigiosin and metacycloprodigiosin belonging to the class prodigiosin. Naphthyridinomycin, alkylresorcinols, desferrioxamine B and E, venezuelin, aborycin, MS-271, and siamycin are potent therapeutics that shared 100% similarity with the reference strain as revealed by the online antiSMASH tool.

AB  - Differentiating obstructive (OA) from non-obstructive (NOA) azoospermia is clinically important in managing infertile men. Classically, the differentiation has been based on clinical, hormonal and histological analysis. Histological tests are invasive and may miss spermatogenic areas. Seminal fluid can serve as a medium to assess the status of spermatogenesis and presence or absence of certain markers can help diagnosing and differentiating azoospermia. We evaluated the role of cell-free seminal markers: DDX4, PRM1 and PRM2 in diagnosing and differentiating between OA and NOA and classifying their subtypes. We observed DDX4 was more sensitive for NOA compared with OA. Among various subtypes of NOA, DDX4 positivity was higher in patients with maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis compared with Sertoli cell only syndrome. PRM1 and PRM2 had very low positivity rate for any meaningful comparison. Seminal cell-free markers can serve as non-invasive tests in diagnosing and differentiating etiologies of azoospermia but their validity needs to be proved in long-term trials with more refined molecular techniques.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a rare malignancy in India except in north-eastern states. We present our institutional experience of 16 years highlighting management, outcomes, responses and toxicities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: NPC patients registered at our center during the period of 2000-2015. The primary objective of the study was to assess the overall survival (OS). Secondary outcome included determinations of response rates, progression free survival (PFS) and to assess treatment-related toxicity (CTCAE v4.0). Institute ethics committee approval was obtained prior to initiation of this study.
RESULTS: Data was retrieved from complete records of 222 patients out of 390 registered during study period. There were 163 males (73.4%) and 59 females (26.6%) with a male to female ratio of 2.8:1. The median age was 35 years (range 6-73). Only 5.6% (n = 12) presented in early-stage disease (stage I and II) while 89.6% (n = 199) were advanced stage (stage III, IVA, IVB). Five patients (2.2%) presented as metastatic disease. Majority of patients were treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) {76.1%, n = 169}. Relapses were documented in 10.4% patients. 5% patients had loco-regional relapse while distant metastases were seen in 4% patients. The 3-year PFS and OS rates are 60.9% and 68.4%, respectively. Achieving a CR predicted superior OS on multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: NPC is a rare malignancy and majority presented with advanced stages. This data outlines our experience and outcomes with a predominantly induction chemotherapy followed by definitive CCRT based approach.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a scarcity of data from India on the impact of cell of origin (COO) on outcomes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This study was conducted to evaluate the impact of COO on outcomes of DLBCL patients treated with uniform rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (RCHOP) protocol.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective analysis included patients who received uniform RCHOP chemoimmunotherapy during the study period (2014-2020) at the Department of Medical Oncology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, India. The patients were classified as germinal center B-cell like (GCB) or activated B-cell (ABC) type using the Hans classification.
RESULTS: Four hundred seventeen patients with median age of 48 years (range, 18-76) and a male-female ratio of 2:1 were included in the analysis. B symptoms and bulky disease were seen in 42.9% and 35.5%. Extranodal involvement was seen in 50.8% of cases. ECOG performance status (0-2) was present in 65%, and 51% presented with advanced disease. GCB subtype was seen in 43%, and 47% were ABC type. Low- and intermediate-risk international prognostic index (IPI) score was seen in 76% of cases. The overall response rate to RCHOP was 85.8%, including a complete response rate of 74.8%. After a median follow-up of 30 months, the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 80% and 88%, respectively. The presence of B symptoms and poor ECOG performance status (3-4) was associated with inferior CR rate. Low albumin (p < 0.001), age >60 years (p = 0.001), bulky disease (p < 0.001), and extranodal involvement (p = 0.001) were associated with inferior EFS, whereas a high IPI risk score was associated with an inferior OS (p < 0.001). EFS and OS were not significantly different between the GCB and ABC subtypes. Grade III/IV anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were seen in 7.6%, 13.6%, and 2.7% of patients, respectively. Febrile neutropenia was seen in 8.9% of patients, and there were four treatment-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Cell of origin for DLBCL has no impact on CR, EFS, and OS if patients are appropriately treated with standard doses and frequency of RCHOP. RCHOP is well tolerated in our patients, and results are comparable with the Western data.

AB  - Background and objective Adolescents in general make poor food choices due to a lack of awareness, social pressure, and other factors, leading to a faulty lifestyle. On the other hand, the adolescent athletic population is associated with a healthy eating pattern. In light of this, this study aimed to evaluate the eating behavior of adolescent cyclists competing at the national level. Methods A total of 50 national-level adolescent cyclists (26 males and 24 females) were assessed for eating behavior, daily food consumption patterns, and eating habits around exercise time by using a pre-tested validated questionnaire, Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), and 24-hour Food Recall. Results The majority (82%) of the cyclists were non-vegetarians, followed by lacto-vegetarians (14%) and lacto-ovo vegetarians (14%). Of note, 72% of the cyclists consumed four meals consisting of breakfast, lunch, snacks, and dinner daily, while 28% skipped at least one of the meals. The preference for takeaways (52%) surpassed dine-outs (34%) and home-cooked (14%) food. Pre-training snack was consumed by 37% and post-training snack by 47%. Cyclists daily consumed breakfast cereals (76%), bread (94%), pulses (92%), fruits (100%), vegetables (62%), milk (84%), milk products (90%), egg (82%), poultry, fish, and meat (74%), dry fruits, nuts, and seeds (78%), and saturated fats (100%). Junk foods (94%) and sweetened beverages (70%) were consumed at least once a week. No significant difference was observed in eating behavior and daily food consumption pattern between male and female cyclists. Conclusion The eating behavior of adolescent cyclists was inclined towards the consumption of saturated fats, junk food, and sweetened beverages. Male and female athletes have similar food habits. There is a need for the implementation of behavior change-oriented nutrition strategies to inculcate healthy eating habits among adolescent cyclists.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Malnutrition in chronic pancreatitis (CP) has prognostic value and there is limited data on the prevalence, predictors of malnutrition in CP and its effect on Quality of life (QoL).
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted in patients with CP to assess the prevalence of malnutrition as per the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. Multivariable-adjusted regression was used to identify independent predictors of both malnutrition and global QoL.
RESULTS: A total of 297 patients were included and the most common etiology of CP was idiopathic (75%) and alcohol (25%). The prevalence of malnutrition was 46.4% as per GLIM criteria. On univariate analysis, the risk of malnutrition was significantly higher in alcoholic etiology (p = 0.001), current alcohol consumption (p = 0.001), smokers (p < 0.001), those having higher cumulative days of pain in last 6 months (p < 0.001) and lower daily calorie intake (p = 0.019). On multivariate analysis, malnutrition was independently associated with current alcohol consumption (Odds ratio: 3.22, p = 0.017), current smokers (OR: 2.23, p = 0.042) and those having higher cumulative days of abdominal pain (OR: 1.01, p < 0.001), while higher daily calorie intake (per 100 kcal) (OR:0.94, p = 0.023) has reduced risk of malnutrition. Malnutrition (p = 0.015) and higher cumulative days of abdominal pain (p < 0.001) were independently associated with lower global QoL in patients with CP.
CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is frequent in patients with CP; and current alcohol consumption, smoking and higher cumulative days of abdominal pain independently predicts risk of developing malnutrition. Patients with malnutrition and higher cumulative days of pain has poorer quality of life.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Quantitative fecal fat estimation is the gold standard test to diagnose steatorrhea (fecal fat >7 g/day) in chronic pancreatitis (CP), but cumbersome and inconvenient. So, fecal elastase-1 (FE) is proposed as a good alternative but the data on the diagnostic utility of FE to diagnose steatorrhea is variable.
METHODS: This retrospective study included adult CP patients evaluated with both 24-h fecal-fat and FE tests within a 3-month period. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FE to diagnose steatorrhea and to evaluate the FE progression over 9-month period.
RESULTS: Among the 147 included patients, the frequency of steatorrhea (fecal fat >7 g/day) was 34%. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative likelihood ratio (LR) of FE was 90%, 28.9% and 0.35 at cut-off of <100 μg/g stool to diagnose steatorrhea; and 96%, 11.3% and 0.35 at cut-off of <200 μg/g stool, respectively. The optimal cut-off of FE was <20 on receiver operating characteristic curve (sensitivity 66%; specificity 69%; positive LR 2.14). There was no statistically significant variation in FE levels over 9 months interval among a hundred patients.
CONCLUSION: Compared to FE ≥ 200 μg/g stool, FE ≥ 100 can used to exclude steatorrhea (better specificity and negative LR). FE < 20 alone cannot replace fecal fat estimation to confirm steatorrhea but to be interpreted with clinical features. Repeat FE testing for exocrine insufficiency progression can be done at least a year later.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is a highly time-sensitive and life-threatening condition. Early recognition and timely management are challenging in a busy emergency department (ED), especially in low/middle-income countries where emergency systems are often fragmented. The aim of our quality improvement (QI) project was to increase the percentage of patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with door to balloon (D2B) time of <90 min by 30% over 12 months.
METHODS: As part of the first step in QI, baseline data were collected at different points in the process of care. Using process maps and fishbone analysis, delays in patient registration, ECG and communication with cardiology were identified as some bottlenecks, and change ideas were tested using plan-do-study-act cycles using point-of-care QI methodology. The majority of the change ideas focused on interventions in the ED like strengthening triage, training frontline staff, early diagnosis and quick transportation of patients.
RESULTS: During the baseline phase, 22.22% of patients were found to have a D2B time of <90 min. We achieved an increase of 47.78% in patients receiving PCI within 90 min and hence increased to 70% at the end of the intervention phase. Data collected for 4 months after the intervention phase were found to have sustained the effort.
CONCLUSION: Significant improvement in the door to reperfusion time resulted from a meticulous assessment of emergency care processes by drawing process flow chart and implementation of change ideas like introduction of fast-track policy for patients with chest pain, reducing staff turnover in the triage area, formal training of staff, continuous engagement with cardiology team and by interchanging of processes which led to a reduction in time to ECG.

T2  - Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care
AB  - Bee sting can lead to allergic reactions which can present as life-threatening emergencies. Kounis syndrome is an acute coronary syndrome caused by mast cell activation after exposure to an allergen. Atrial fibrillation (AF) along with Kounis syndrome after allergen exposure is a rare presentation. A 40-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with multiple bee stings to the face and neck. He complained of retrosternal chest pain along with facial pain and swelling. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed AF with ST elevation in aVR and generalized ST segment depression. Troponin levels were elevated. He was diagnosed with Kounis syndrome along with AF secondary to a bee sting. The patient improved symptomatically with removal of stings and conservative management (steroids, antihistamines, antiplatelet drugs). ECG reverted to sinus rhythm and resolution of ST-T changes. He was discharged from the ED in stable condition. The bee sting may lead to significant cardiovascular events such as AF and Kounis syndrome, which require a high index of suspicion and prompt treatment. Kounis syndrome should be suspected in the ED in young patients with no cardiovascular risk factors after exposure to an allergen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent disruption of medical oxygen during the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused nationwide panic. This study attempts to objectively analyze the medical oxygen supply chain in India along the principles of value stream mapping (VSM), identify bottlenecks, and recommend systemic improvements.
METHODS: Process mapping of the medical oxygen supply chain in India was done. Different licenses and approvals, their conditions, compliances, renewals, among others were factored in. All relevant circulars (Government Notices), official orders, amendments, and gazette notifications pertaining to medical oxygen from April 2020 to April 2021 were studied and corroborated with information from Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization (PESO) official website.
RESULTS: Steps of medical oxygen supply chain right from oxygen manufacture to filling, storage, and transport up to the end users; have regulatory bottlenecks. Consequently, flow of materials is sluggish and very poor information flow has aggravated the inherent inefficiencies of the system. Government of India has been loosening regulatory norms at every stage to alleviate the crisis.
CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory bottlenecks have indirectly fueled the informal sector over the years, which is not under Government's control with difficulty in controlling black-marketing and hoarding. Technology enabled, data-driven regulatory processes with minimum discretionary human interface can make the system more resilient.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of sunlight exposure and oral vitamin D3 supplementation to achieve vitamin D sufficiency in infants at 6 months of age.
DESIGN: Open-label randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Public hospital in Northern India (28.7°N).
PARTICIPANT: Breastfed infants at 6-8 weeks of age.
INTERVENTION: Randomized to receive sunlight exposure (40% body surface area for a minimum of 30 minutes/week) or oral vitamin D3 supplementation (400 IU/day) till 6 months of age.
OUTCOME: Primary - proportion of infants having vitamin D sufficiency (>20 ng/mL). Secondary - proportion of infants developing vitamin D deficiency (<12ng/mL) and rickets in both the groups at 6 months of age.
RESULTS: Eighty (40 in each group) infants with mean (SD) age 47.8 (4.5) days were enrolled. The proportion of infants with vitamin D sufficiency increased after intervention in the vitamin D group from 10.8% to 35.1% (P=0.01) but remained the same in sunlight group (13.9%) and was significant on comparison between both groups (P=0.037). The mean (SD) compliance rate was 72.9 (3.4) % and 59.7 (23.6) % in the vitamin D and sunlight group, respectively (P=0.01). The geometric mean (95% CI) serum 25(OH) D levels in the vitamin D and sunlight group were 16.23 (13.58-19.40) and 11.89 (9.93-14.23) ng/mL, respectively; (P=0.02), after adjusting baseline serum 25(OH)D with a geometric mean ratio of 1.36 (1.06-1.76). Two infants in sunlight group developed rickets.
CONCLUSION: Oral vitamin D3 supplementation is more efficacious than sunlight in achieving vitamin D sufficiency in breastfed infants during the first 6 months of life due to better compliance.

AB  - Focal renal lesions in the background of chronic kidney disease (CKD) present a diagnostic challenge. Contrast administration is usually avoided in such a setting, undermining the usefulness of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Focal regenerating nodules may occur in the background of CKD and closely mimic renal neoplasms. The aim of the present article was to highlight the salient manifestations of such CKD pseudotumors on different imaging modalities and also to depict the differentiating features from malignancy. Radiologists must be aware of the imaging appearance of this uncommonly talked about entity so as to avoid inadvertent surgery or cause undue anxiety to the patient.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to present the procedural details and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings of perioperative chest-wall collateral embolization (PCCE) and compare intraoperative blood loss in patients of pulmonary aspergilloma (PA) undergoing lung resection with and without PCCE.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since November 2017, we have performed PCCE in 17 patients (14 males, three females, age 34.41 ± 12.85 years) before surgery for PA (embolization group). Retrospective evaluation of these patients was done, DSA findings were noted, and perioperative parameters (surgical approach, extent of resection, operative time, blood loss, blood transfusion, morbidity grade, and length of post-operative stay) were compared with a comparative cohort of 24 patients of PA (21 males, three females, mean age 36.13 ± 12.58 years) who underwent thoracic surgery without PCCE (May 2013-November 2017) (control group) using the Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: A total of 55 arteries were embolized in 17 patients (mean 3.23 arteries per patient). Technical success could be achieved in all patients without any procedure-related complications. The most common arteries embolized were posterior intercostal arteries (29) followed by costocervical trunk (10), superior thoracic (8), lateral thoracic (5), and internal thoracic arteries (3). The mean blood loss was significantly lower in the embolization group compared with the control group (676.47 vs. 1,264.58 mL, p = 0.015). Within the embolization group, patients who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery had even lower blood loss compared with open surgery cases (466 vs. 887.50 mL, p-value = 0.046).
CONCLUSION: PCCE is a simple and safe procedure, useful in reducing intra-operative blood loss in patients undergoing surgery for peripherally located PA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This multi-center randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a context-specific transition intervention program to improve clinic visit adherence and clinical outcomes among emerging adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Delhi, India.
METHODS: We will recruit patients with T1DM of duration ≥1 year and age 15-19.5 years from the participating pediatric sites. After a baseline assessment and a "basic introductory session", which apprises participants about the concept of transition, study participants (proposed sample size =156) will be randomly allocated into an intervention and control arm. Participants in the intervention arm will receive a structured transition program delivered over 15 months. On the other hand, control arm participants will continue to receive usual care from the pediatric site till the time of transfer to the adult site. The study assessments will be done at baseline, at the time of transfer, and at 1 and 2 years following the transfer. The primary outcome is the difference in clinic attendance rate between intervention and control arms at the end of 1 year post-transfer. The secondary outcomes include the difference in clinic attendance rate at the end of 2 years, the difference in proportion of participants with a minimum of 4 visits in the first follow-up year, and process indicators such as diabetes knowledge and self-management skills, diabetes treatment satisfaction, overall quality of life, diabetes-related distress, hospitalization for acute complications and screening for chronic diabetes complications, and HbA1c.
CONCLUSION: This study will provide important new evidence about a potential strategy to improve clinical care among adolescents and emerging adults with T1DM in lower resource contexts during the vulnerable phase of transition from pediatric to adult healthcare. The trial is registered on the Clinical Trials Registry of India (http://ctri.nic.in) under the CTRI registration number CTRI/2020/10/028379.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysfunction and denervation of myocardial nor-adrenergic sympathetic neurons has been documented in IPD patients with dysautonomia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of single tracer imaging of myocardial sympathetic and cerebral striatal involvement in these patients.
METHODS: Twenty-two controls (mean-age 59.09 ± 12.39 years, 15 men) with no clinical autonomic-dysfunction and normal striatal-uptake in 18F-FDOPA-PET/CT; and 28 patients (mean-age 58.18 ± 8.25 years, 18 men) with autonomic-dysfunction (in Autonomic Function Tests) and striatal dopaminergic-dysfunction were enrolled. Both cardiac-PET/CT (40 minutes post IV-injection of 185-259MBq 18F-FDOPA) and Brain-PET/CT (60 minutes post-IV) were acquired in same session. ROIs were drawn over the entire left ventricular myocardium, individual walls and mediastinum for quantification. Patients and controls were followed-up for 26.93 ± 5.43 months and 37.91 ± 8.63 months, respectively.
RESULTS: Striatal and myocardial-parameters were significantly lower in patients compared to controls; with Myocardium/mediastinal ratio (MwMR) yielding the area-under-the-curve of .941 (P < .001). MwMR correlated negatively with the drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) during AFTs {Pearson-coefficient (-).565, P = .002}. Mean MwMR in patients with abnormal-AFTs was significantly lower than patients with borderline-AFTs (1.39 ± .12 vs 1.55 ± .10; P = .002). 9/20 patients with abnormal-AFTs showed functional worsening during follow-up, compared to 2/8 with borderline-AFTs.
CONCLUSION: Single tracer, single session imaging of striatal and cardiac sympathetic dysfunction in patients with advanced IPD is feasible with use of 18F-FDOPA. Significantly reduced 18F-FDOPA uptake is seen in the myocardium of the IPD patients with sympathetic dysfunction.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics differ in their elution characteristics from bone cement. But no such data is available on piperacillin and tazobactam. Therefore, we performed an in vitro observational study to examine (1) in vitro elution characteristics of piperacillin and tazobactam from bone cement, (2) their biological activity using minimum inhibitory concentration and (3) elution characteristics and biological activity when combined with gentamicin in bone cement.
HYPOTHESIS: The null hypothesis was that piperacillin and tazobactam after elution from bone cement can achieve concentrations higher than minimum inhibitory concentration.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty milligrams bone cement was mixed with the following combination of antibiotics: without any antibiotic (sample A, control), 4g/0.50g piperacillin/tazobactam (sample B), 6g/0.75g piperacillin/tazobactam (sample C), 8g/1.0g piperacillin/tazobactam (sample D) and 4g/0.50g piperacillin/tazobactam and 400mg gentamicin (sample E). Samples were analysed on reverse-phase ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. Antibacterial activity in the elute were tested against standard American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) strains.
RESULTS: Detectable drug elution for piperacillin and tazobactam was seen till 21days. Peak drug levels for all formulations were seen at 48hours (140.8 & 297.5μg/mL for samples B of piperacillin and tazobactam respectively). About 0.83-1.24% of piperacillin and 23.17-29.17% of tazobactam were released from the samples. Gentamicin improved elution of piperacillin and tazobactam: 140.8 vs. 919.9μg/mL (p=0.000) for samples B & E of piperacillin respectively and 297.5 & 1138.4μg/mL (p=0.001) for samples B & E of tazobactam respectively at 2days. Sample E showed complete inhibition of tested microorganisms, while B sample was microbiologically less active compared to E on day 5.
CONCLUSIONS: Piperacillin and tazobactam eluted successfully from bone cement and also retained antimicrobial activity after elution. Maximum elution was seen up to day 2 after which it reduced drastically. Antimicrobial action was seen up to 7days.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is no satisfactory treatment for post tubercular arachnoiditis (TB arachnoiditis). We did this study to investigate the efficacy and safety of cyclophosphamide as adjuvant therapy for post TB arachnoiditis refractory to corticosteroids and anti-tubercular therapy (ATT).
METHODS: This was a retrospective case series of patients of refractory post TB arachnoiditis leading to paraparesis and vision loss who received cyclophosphamide as an adjuvant therapy along with standard ATT and corticosteroids. These patients were treated with intravenous cyclophosphamide (dose 500 mg/m2) once a month for 4 consecutive months after informed written consent and were assessed clinically and radiologically before and after cyclophosphamide therapy.
RESULTS: We had 4 patients with refractory post TB arachnoiditis of whom three became independently ambulatory. There was significant clinical as well as radiological improvement in all the patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophosphamide therapy could be an effective therapy for patients with refractory post TB arachnoiditis. Well-designed randomized controlled studies are essential to study the safety and efficacy of cyclophosphamide in this condition.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) and its association with the course and outcome of bipolar disorder (BD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 773 patients with BD were recruited from 14 centers in different parts of India, and they were evaluated for the prevalence of comorbid substance dependence, course and outcome, subjective cognitive functioning, and disability.
RESULTS: About one-fourth (22.9%) of the participants had one or more substance dependence. In terms of specific substance of abuse, 136 (17.6%) had nicotine dependence, 80 (10.3%) patients had alcohol dependence, 13 (1.7%) had cannabis dependence, and nine (1.2%) had opioid dependence. Compared to those without comorbid substance dependence, those with a dual diagnosis (i.e., using at least one substance in a dependent pattern) were less educated, more often males, more often currently single, more often employed, had a lower number of depressive episodes per year of illness, had a higher number of manic and mixed episodes per year of illness in the first 5 years of illness, had a higher level of disability, and more often had a history of hospitalization and a history of receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); also, a higher proportion of them had manic predominant polarity, more often had recurrent mania course, and were more often receiving a combination of lithium and valproate.
CONCLUSION: About one-fourth of BD patients have comorbid SUDs, and presence of SUD has a negative impact on the course and outcome of BD.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the risk factors associated with lifetime suicide attempts in bipolar disorder (BD) patients.
METHODOLOGY: 773 BD patients with a duration of illness of at least ten years, currently in clinical remission, were evaluated for suicidal attempts in their lifetime. Those with and without lifetime suicide attempt(s) were compared for various demographic and clinical risk factors.
RESULTS: 242 (31.3%) patients had a history of at least one lifetime suicide attempt. Compared to those without lifetime suicide attempts, those with suicidal attempts were less educated, were more often females, spent more time in episodes, and had a significantly more number of total episodes (in the lifetime, first five years of illness, and per year of illness), had significantly more number of total depressive episodes (in the lifetime, first five years of illness, and per year of illness), spent more time in depressive episodes, had more severe depressive episodes, more often had depression as the first episode in the lifetime, spent more time in mania/hypomania/mixed episodes, had higher residual depressive and manic symptoms, more often had rapid cycling affective disorder pattern in the lifetime, use of cannabis in dependence pattern, had poorer insight into their illness and had a higher level of disability (especially in three out of the four domains of Indian disability evaluation assessment scale).
CONCLUSIONS: About one-third of the patients with BD have at least one-lifetime suicidal attempt, and those with suicide attempts usually have a poorer course of illness.

AB  - AIM: Most of the available data on the prevalence and impact of psychotic symptoms on the course of bipolar disorder (BD) is from Western countries. We aimed to study the prevalence of at least one psychotic episode in the lifetime in patients with BD and its association with the long-term course and outcome.
METHODOLOGY: 773 patients recruited as part of the Bipolar Disorder Course and Outcome study from India (BiD-CoIN study) were divided into 2 groups, based on the presence or absence of at least one psychotic episode in the lifetime.
RESULTS: 326 (42.2%) patients had at least one psychotic episode in their lifetime. At least one psychotic episode in the lifetime was associated with overall more severe illness in terms of lower age of onset, a higher number of episodes in the first 5 years of illness; higher rates of BD-II, a higher rate of lifetime history of at least 1 suicide attempt, lifetime history of hospitalization, history of receiving Electroconvulsive Therapy, and a higher prescription rates of antipsychotics. However, presence of psychotics symptoms was associated with better cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the presence of psychotic symptoms during episodes in patients with BD is associated with poorer course of BD.

AB  - Population-based prospective cohort studies can yield vital new evidence. However, they are difficult to setup especially in non-western contexts such as India. We describe our experience in establishing the Longitudinal Cognition and Aging Research on Population of the National Capital Region (LoCARPoN) cohort, which was the first-of-its-kind public-funded study with target sample size of 15,000, 3 sites, and funds of approx. US$ five million for eight years (2014-2022). LoCARPoN aimed to study incident stroke and dementia in adults aged ≥50 years in urban and rural populations of north India. Among the numerous challenges encountered, important were inadequate funding, lack of adequate space for medical and field sites, difficulty in hiring manpower, lack of IT infrastructure, non-availability of storage facility for biological samples, and absence of dedicated MRI machines. Meticulous planning, adequate funding, trained personnel, institutional and community support are critical for establishing such cohorts in the non-western contexts.
FUNDING: The LoCARPoN cohort study was funded by the Department of Biotechnology (Grant No. BT/IN/Netherlands/03/KP/2012 dated 14/02/2014); and Department of Health Research (Grant No. R.11012/15/2018-HR, dated 09/08/2018), Government of India. The Erasmus component was funded through the Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and the Erasmus University, Rotterdam (Alzheimer NederlandWE.15-2014-09).

T2  - Leadership in Health Services (Bradford, England)
AB  - PURPOSE: Leadership skills are vital for efficient delivery of health reforms. India, a low- and middle-income country, is transforming its public health care significantly. The health workforce, particularly doctors, however lacks leadership skills. This study aims to highlight the leadership skills gap and raise concerns about how India might achieve its ambitious health reforms in the lack of formal, prospective leadership training for its workforce.
DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This study conducted nine management development programmes between 2012 and 2020 and collected data from 416 (N = 444, 94% response rate) health-care professionals using a questionnaire. Participants were asked to inform leadership challenges that they perceived critical. A total of 47 unique challenges were identified, which were distributed across five domains of American College of Healthcare Executives Competency Assessment Tool (2020). Relevant information was also obtained from review of secondary sources including journal articles from scientific and grey literature and government websites.
FINDINGS: Majority of participants (85.36%) had never attended any management training and were from public sector (56.1%). Mean total experience was 18 years. Top 5 challenges were lack of motivation (54.26%), communication (52.38%), contracts management (48.31%), leadership skills (47.26%) and retention of workforce (45.56%). Maximum challenges (29) were in domain of business skills and knowledge, followed by knowledge of health-care environment (9), leadership, professionalism, and communication and relationship management (3 each).
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In absence of the leadership training, senior health professionals particularly doctors in India, suffer leadership challenges. Efforts should be made to strengthen leadership capacity in Indian health-care system to advance the country's ongoing national health reforms.

AB  - Lymphoedema is a chronic debilitating condition characterised by diffuse swelling caused by lymphatic obstruction. The secondary form of lymphoedema is more common than the primary form. Untreated filariasis remains an important cause of lymphoedema in developing countries. The most common complication of chronic lymphoedema is cellulitis. It is also a risk factor for the development of neoplasms such as lymphangiosarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma. We report a case of a woman in her 60s who developed squamous cell carcinoma in the background of chronic lymphoedema.

AB  - The goal of parathyroid imaging in hyperparathyroidism is not diagnosis, rather it is the localization of the cause of hyperparathyroidism for planning the best therapeutic approach. Hence, the role of imaging to accurately and precisely localize the abnormal parathyroid tissue is more important than ever to facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy over bilateral neck exploration. The common causes include solitary parathyroid adenoma, multiple parathyroid adenomas, parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. It is highly imperative for the radiologist to be cautious of the mimics of parathyroid lesions like thyroid nodules and lymph nodes and be able to differentiate them on imaging. The various imaging modalities available include high resolution ultrasound of the neck, nuclear imaging studies, four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Contrast enhanced ultrasound is a novel technique which has been recently added to the armamentarium to differentiate between parathyroid adenomas and its mimics. Through this review article we wish to review the imaging features of parathyroid lesions on various imaging modalities and present an algorithm to guide their radiological differentiation from mimics.

T2  - The Indian Journal of Radiology & Imaging
AB  - Synthesized mammogram is a new technique that involves reconstruction of a two-dimensional (2D) image from the tomosynthesis images rather than separate acquisition of a standard 2D mammogram. The advent of a synthesized mammogram (s2D) has helped in reducing radiation exposure. The technique of back projection used in reconstruction makes the appearance of these images different from a standard 2D mammogram. Because this is a relatively new technique, it is associated with a learning curve. Hence, it is important for the new radiologists and technicians to be aware of certain common artifacts encountered while using s2D images, which may hinder interpretation. In this pictorial review, we would like to highlight the common artifacts encountered while reading synthesized mammographic images.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asian Indians show rapid conversion from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes (T2D). Novel dietary strategies are needed to arrest this progression, by targeting postprandial hyperglycaemia (PPHG).
DESIGN: We conducted a free-living randomized controlled open-label parallel arm study to evaluate the effect of a premeal load of almonds (20 g) 30 min before major meals on anthropometric, glycaemic, and metabolic parameters over 3 months. Sixty-six participants with prediabetes in the age range of 18-60 yrs were recruited. The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration no. NCT04769726).
RESULTS: Thirty participants in each arm completed the study. As per 'intention-to-treat' analysis, overall additional mean reductions were statistically significant for body weight, BMI, waist circumference (WC), subscapular and suprailiac skinfolds, and improved handgrip strength (Kg) (p < 0·001 for all) in the treatment arm vs. the control arm (after multiple adjustments). In the blood parameters, the additional mean reduction in the treatment arm vs. control arm was statistically significant for fasting and post-75 g oral glucose-load blood glucose, postprandial insulin, HOMA-IR, HbA1c, proinsulin, total cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0·001 for all). Most importantly, we observed a reversal to normoglycemic state (fasting blood glucose and 2 h post-OGTT glucose levels) in 23.3% (7 out of 30) of participants in the treatment arm which is comparable to that seen with Acarbose treatment (25%).
CONCLUSION: Incorporation of 20 g of almonds, 30 min before each major meal leads to significant improvement in body weight, WC, glycemia (particularly PPHG), and insulin resistance and shows potential for reversal of prediabetes to normal glucose regulation over 3 months.

AB  - Hypothermia is common occurrence in patients undergoing colonic surgeries. We hypothesized that the underbody forced air warming blankets will be better than conventional over-body forced air warming blankets for prevention of hypothermia during laparoscopic colon surgeries. After ethics approval, sixty patients undergoing elective laparoscopic colon surgeries were randomly divided into two groups to receive warming by underbody forced air warming blanket (n = 30) or over-body forced air warming blanket (n = 30). In the operating room, epidural catheter was inserted and thereafter warming was started with the forced air warmer with temperature set at 44 °C. Intraoperatively core temperature (using nasopharyngeal probe), vitals, incidence of postoperative shivering and time to reach Aldrete Score of 10 in the postoperative period were recorded. The core temperature was higher with an underbody blanket at 60 min (36.1 ± 0.5 °C vs. 35.7 ± 0.5 °C, P = 0.005), 90 min (35.9 ± 0.5 °C vs. 35.6 ± 0.5 °C, P = 0.009), 120 min (35.9 ± 0.5 °C vs. 35.5 ± 0.4 °C, P = 0.007), and 150 min (35.9 ± 0.5 °C vs. 35.6 ± 0.4 °C, P = 0.011). In the post anesthesia care unit, the time to reach an Aldrete score of 10 was also less in the underbody blanket group (14.3 ± 2.5 min vs. 16.8 ± 3.6 min) (P = 0.003). However, there were no clinically meaningful differences in any outcome. Underbody and over-body blankets were comparably effective in preventing hypothermia in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery under general anaesthesia.Trial registration CTRI (2019/06/019,576). Date of Registration: June 2019, Prospectively registered.

AB  - Thyroid cancer's incidence has increased by leaps and bounds over the last years and accounts for 2.8% of new cases of cancers. This increasing bar is partially assisted by enormous screening to understand the sub-clinical status. Advanced tumor growth is the leading cause of thyroid cancer-associated death. However, the complete understanding of the underlying cause is still to be disclosed. The updated clinical assessment evidenced a few major oncogenes viz. RAS, BRAF, and RET as key drivers in the development and progression of thyroid cancer. The BRAF mutation, a major cause of aggressive tumor type in papillary thyroid carcinoma, is frequently reported. The characteristic oncogenic changes imply thyroid cancer to be clinically an ideal model for targeted therapy against RET, RAS, and BRAF mutation. Though the sensitive biochemical marker assay has been improvised, the diagnosis of thyroid follicular neoplasms is still a big challenge as the biopsy aspiration cannot define the nature of the tumor in 30% of the cases. The main hurdle is assisted distinction between follicular thyroid lesions. The discrimination between follicular thyroid adenomas and carcinomas is histologically accomplished. This strictly necessitates the identification of sensitive diagnostic/prognostic markers to mitigate the risk of thyroid cancer and to avoid the unnecessary hurdles of biopsy and surgery. An array of prognostic biomarkers is being used for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer. However, Estrogen Related Receptor Gamma (ERRγ) is setting a new benchmark among the clinical biomarkers. The dramatic expression of ERRγ in thyroid cancer enables itself not only to serve as a characteristic diagnostic marker but also as a therapeutic target. Recently, we have reported that ERRγ is upregulated in 96 papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 26 poorly differentiated/ anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) samples. Various synthetic ERRγ inverse agonists viz. GSK5182, DN200434, and 24e are fully proved to modulate ERRγ expression in ATC to attain partial cure. If this finding can be assayed on a larger scale the evaluation of this marker may be warranted and informative. This review article highlights the ascending sheds of clinical biomarkers of thyroid cancer. This also reveals the clinical importance of ERRγ as an evolving diagnostic and therapeutic target in thyroid cancer.

AB  - Polytrauma victims are usually in severe pain with difficulty in breathing. There are limited regional analgesia options that cover the shoulder region as well as the rib and other associated fractures. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a versatile block which has established a role in the management of rib fracture pain and has emerging indications for managing pain in the shoulder and upper humerus regions. We examined the efficacy of ultrasound guided ESPB at the T2 level in two polytrauma patients with unilateral scapular, humerus, and rib fractures undergoing surgery in the shoulder region. It provided excellent postoperative analgesia and helped to alleviate pain of associated rib and other fractures, thereby facilitating early postoperative recovery and rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Due to shortcomings in death registration and medical certification, the excess death approach is recommended for COVID-19 mortality burden estimation. In this study the data from the civil registration system (CRS) from one district in India was explored for its suitability in the estimation of excess deaths, both directly and indirectly attributable to COVID-19.
METHODS: All deaths registered on the CRS portal at the selected registrar's office of Faridabad district in Haryana between January 2016 and September 2021 were included. The deaths registered in 2020 and 2021 were compared to previous years (2016-2019), and excess mortality in both years was estimated by gender and age groups as the difference between the registered deaths and historical average month wise during 2016-2019 using three approaches - mean and 95 per cent confidence interval, FORECAST.ETS function in Microsoft Excel and linear regression. To assess the completeness of registration in the district, 150 deaths were sampled from crematoria and graveyards during 2020 and checked for registration in the CRS portal. Agreement in the cause of death (CoD) in CRS with the International Classification of Diseases-10 codes assigned for a subset of 585 deaths after verbal autopsy was calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 7017 deaths were registered in 2020, whereas 6792 deaths were registered till 30 September 2021 which represent a 9 and 44 per cent increase, respectively, from the historical average for that period. The highest increase was seen in the age group >60 yr (19% in 2020 and 56% in 2021). All deaths identified in crematoria and graveyards in 2020 had been registered. Observed peaks of all-cause excess deaths corresponded temporally and in magnitude to infection surges in the district. All three approaches gave overlapping estimates of the ratio of excess mortality to reported COVID-19 deaths of 1.8-4 in 2020 and 10.9-13.9 in 2021. There was poor agreement (κ<0.4) between CoD in CRS and that assigned after physician review for most causes, except tuberculosis and injuries.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: CRS data, despite the limitations, appeared to be appropriate for all-cause excess mortality estimation by age and sex but not by cause. There was an increase in death registration in 2020 and 2021 in the district.

A thorough understanding of collateral anatomy and hemodynamics in cirrhosis, it is important to envisage diagnosis and outcomes of portal hypertension. The understanding of the patterns of aberrant portosystemic collateral channels has important implications both for the clinician and the interventionist. In this case report, our patient presented to us with the formation of aberrant collaterals at the site of subcostal hernia for which he underwent a mesh repair eight years back. The technical challenges in the management of shunt closure of these aberrant collaterals were discussed.

AB  - Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an emerging ailment of global concern. Its diagnosis at the early stages is critical for recovery. Therefore, efforts are underway to produce digital pathology tools with human-level intelligence that are efficient, scalable, accessible, and cost-effective. Following the trend, a medical imaging challenge on "Segmentation of Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cells in Microscopic Images (SegPC-2021)" was organized at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2021, France. The challenge addressed the problem of cell segmentation in microscopic images captured from the slides prepared from the bone marrow aspirate of patients diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma. The challenge released a total of 775 images with 690 and 85 images of sizes 2040×1536 and 1920×2560 pixels, respectively, captured from two different (microscope and camera) setups. The participants had to segment the plasma cells with a separate label on each cell's nucleus and cytoplasm. This problem comprises many challenges, including a reduced color contrast between the cytoplasm and the background, and the clustering of cells with a feeble boundary separation of individual cells. To our knowledge, the SegPC-2021 challenge dataset is the largest publicly available annotated data on plasma cell segmentation in MM so far. The challenge targets a semi-automated tool to ensure the supervision of medical experts. It was conducted for a span of five months, from November 2020 to April 2021. Initially, the data was shared with 696 people from 52 teams, of which 41 teams submitted the results of their models on the evaluation portal in the validation phase. Similarly, 20 teams qualified for the last round, of which 16 teams submitted the results in the final test phase. All the top-5 teams employed DL-based approaches, and the best mIoU obtained on the final test set of 277 microscopic images was 0.9389. All these five models have been analyzed and discussed in detail. This challenge task is a step towards the target of creating an automated MM diagnostic tool.

AB  - Neutropenic diet(ND) has been hypothesized to decrease the rate of febrile neutropenia(FN) occurring post-chemotherapy for pediatric cancers. Despite widespread use, it has not shown to be of benefit by randomized controlled trials(RCT) in western countries. No RCT has been conducted in India/LMIC to evaluate its efficacy against the standard Indian diet. Forty-two(42) children, aged 3-14 y, with cancer, scheduled to receive strongly myelosuppressive chemotherapy were randomized to receive either neutropenic diet(n = 21) or standard Indian diet(n = 21) for one chemotherapeutic cycle. FN rate was recorded as the primary outcome while the focus of infection, antibiotic length, the requirement for hospital admission, adherence to diet were the secondary outcomes. The groups were similar in baseline characteristics. Twelve patients (57%) in the neutropenic diet and nine patients(43%) in the standard diet arm developed FN. Patients in ND-arm had significantly higher chance of getting neutropenic enterocolitis(NEC) (33.33% vs 4.76% p = 0.044). Mortality (14.29%vs 0%, p = 0.23) and requirement for admission (47.6%vs 19.05%, p = 0.06), was more in the ND-arm but statistically non-significant. There was no significant difference in antibiotic length. Adherence was similar in both groups (95% vs 98%). Neutropenic diet was not effective in reducing FN rate and was associated with higher rate of NEC when compared to the standard diet.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected postgraduate medical education, training, and ongoing research work across specialties. Our survey aimed to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on challenges in pursuing research and academics and ascertain the stressors on residents across medical specialties.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The questionnaire was validated by 10 experts and following ethical approval, this google form-based survey was circulated to postgraduates across specialties across the country through social media platforms over 1 month (22 August 2020 to 21 September 2020). On clicking the link, the participants received brief information regarding the survey followed by the questionnaire. Weekly reminders were sent to the nonresponders till the desired sample size was attained, after which the survey was closed, and responses were analyzed.
RESULTS: Four hundred and nineteen of 900 residents completed the survey (46.6% response rate). Majority (88.8%) admitted that the inability to conduct the thesis and break in academics caused a significant amount of mental stress upon them. Though classes had resumed through online platforms for most residents (75.4%), the residents reported that lack of bedside learning (65.4%), inadequate progress tests (26.4%), and delay in thesis topic allotment (84.6% among those not allotted thesis) correlated with increased stress. Fear of extension of the course (53%; P = 0.019) and getting infected with COVID-19 (46.6%; P = 0.019) were most cited reasons for significant stress in most of the residents. Many residents (26%) were unable to sleep properly and 22.1% were unable to concentrate on academics. Majority believed that extension of the submission deadline, reduction in sample size, and change in topic would help to complete thesis.
CONCLUSION: The present survey revealed that there is a major impediment to research and academics of medical postgraduates during COVID-19 pandemic which has markedly increased their stress levels.

T2  - Anaesthesia Reports
AB  - The erector spinae plane block is a versatile regional anaesthesia technique used for a variety of truncal surgeries. A novel variation is the sacral erector spinae plane block which is gaining popularity for perineal and anorectal procedures. Local anaesthetic injected at this level blocks the sacral dermatomes and has the potential for more proximal spread to involve lumbar nerve fibres via spread to the lumbar plexus or the epidural space. The advantage of a sacral erector spinae plane block over a neuraxial block is that it is less invasive and may have a better safety profile: there is a reduced risk of epidural haematoma, epidural abscess, haemodynamic instability and motor weakness of the lower extremities. Until now, this approach has been used for midline surgical procedures when the local anaesthetic was injected bilaterally. Its application for lower limb procedures with a single unilateral injection has not been described. We report the use of a unilateral sacral erector spinae plane block at the level of the S2 median crest in two children undergoing lower limb procedures of the hip and thigh. The block was found to provide effective peri-operative analgesia with minimal need for any opioid analgesics and without any significant adverse effects.

AB  - Background and aims Regional anaesthesia has been advocated as a preferred modality during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) pandemic, but pursuing regional anaesthesia during COVID-19 is challenging. Our cross-sectional survey aimed to analyze the challenges in conducting regional anaesthesia and the alterations in practices imposed by the COVID‑19 pandemic across the nation. Material and methods The questionnaire was validated by seven experts. Following ethical approval and trial registration, this Google Forms-based survey was circulated to anaesthesiologists across the country via emails over 3 months (April 2021 to June 2021). Weekly reminders were sent to the non-responders till the desired sample size was attained, after which the survey was closed and responses were analyzed. Results Five hundred and thirty-two of 1100 anaesthesiologists completed the survey (48.3% response rate). Among the 532 respondents, 65.8% reported an increase in the use of regional anaesthesia due to the pandemic, with 77.4% reporting a change in practice. Almost 90% of the respondents used a dedicated operation theatre for all infected patients. Most respondents (75%) used disposable plastic drapes (75%) and full personal protective equipment (PPE) for COVID-19-positive patients during the procedure. However, using PPE resulted in poor vision due to fogging and multiple attempts and increased performance duration. Most respondents (74.4%) used gloves to maintain ultrasound probe sterility, while many other respondents (65.7%) used a sterile camera cover for the same. Many respondents ordered inflammatory markers during preoperative evaluation. Conclusion The present survey revealed that there was increased utilization of regional anaesthesia with increased utilization of PPE, sterility routines, and ordering of investigations. The use of PPE led to many challenges while performing regional anaesthesia. However, many deviations were identified from the accepted recommendations, and one needs to be aware of proper practices to achieve optimal patient outcomes and provider safety.

T2  - Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology
AB  - BACKGROUND: A ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is usually placed inside the peritoneal cavity for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Rarely, it can migrate to various pelvic visceral organs. Inside the pelvis, the distal end of the shunt can perforate anywhere from the uterus or adnexa to the vulva, and migration through the uterus is extremely rare.
CASE: A three-and-a-half-year-old girl presented with a cerebrospinal fluid leak through the vagina after uterine perforation by a VPS. The diagnosis was made with an ultrasound. Her symptoms resolved after revision surgery.
CONCLUSION: In a patient with a VPS in situ, presenting with a watery fluid leak through the vagina, perforation of the fornix or uterus must always be kept in mind. Timely diagnosis and intervention can result in the prevention of complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of intranodal lymphangiography using ethiodised oil (Lipiodol; Guerbet Japan, Tokyo, Japan) for the treatment of refractory cases of chylothorax and chylous ascites in the paediatric population.
METHODS: Between 2016 and 2020, eight children having chyle leak resistant to conservative management underwent intranodal lymphangiography using lipiodol injection. After ethical approval by the Institutional Review Board, these patients' data were retrospectively analysed. Technical success was defined by opacification of inguinal and retroperitoneal lymphatics while injection on fluoroscopy. Clinical success was defined as progressively decreasing drain output and eventual cessation of output within a week after the procedure. Long-term follow up was done as feasible.
RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all the patients. Complete cessation of drain output was noted within 1 week of procedure in all patients indicating clinical success. One patient had recurrence of chylous leakage after an interval of 1 month and intranodal lymphangiography was repeated for that patient. The child had technical as well as clinical success after the repeat procedure. Hence a total of 9 procedures were performed in 8 patients.
CONCLUSION: Intranodal lymphangiography may prove to be a valuable minimally invasive therapeutic tool in cases of refractory chylous leakage in paediatric patients with minimal risk of complications.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Intranodal lymphangiography using lipiodol may prove to be a minimally invasive alternative in paediatric patients with refractory lymphatic leaks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have shown an increased prevalence and incidence of hypertension as well as a higher incidence of stroke among patients suffering from RLS. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of RLS among patients with resistant hypertension (RH) and compare the clinical characteristics of these patients with patients of stroke pre-existing RLS and with patients with primary RLS presenting to the Sleep clinic.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with RH (without any identifiable cause on extensive work up) and consecutive in-patients with stroke were enrolled over a 3-year-period. Patients with RH fulfilling revised-IRLSSG-criteria for RLS comprised group 1 and those with stroke and RLS formed group 2. These were compared with patients diagnosed to have idiopathic RLS (iRLS) (Group 3). Prevalence of RLS in groups 1 and 2 and RLS characteristics in all groups were compared.
RESULTS: Sixteen out of 56 RH patients (29%) formed group 1 and 43 out 346 of stroke patients (12%) formed group 2, while 43 consecutive iRLS patients were included in group 3. Age was significantly higher, with male dominance in group 2. Median age at symptom onset was significantly lower in group 1. Positive family history was similar in RH and iRLS patients and was significantly less common in stroke patients. Asymmetrical/unilateral distribution of symptoms was significantly more common in stroke group, compared to RH and iRLS groups.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a high prevalence of RLS among patients with resistant hypertension. RLS characteristics are different from those in patients with stroke, and very similar to primary RLS.

AB  - The use of smartphone-based applications as a telenutrition tool could redefine the nutritional management of IBD. We developed and validated a digital health platform in the form of a smartphone application for the nutritional assessment of IBD patients. Our team of gastroenterologists and dieticians at the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi developed a smartphone application titled IBD NutriCare, which was made available in both Android and iOS interfaces in English and seven other Indian languages. The application includes >650 Indian recipes and provides subjective global assessment and IBD clinical activity scores in a patient-friendly manner. The utility of the smartphone app was validated in comparison with the traditional 24-h dietary recall method. A total of 49 IBD patients were enrolled in the study. The mean difference in energy intake between the two dietary assessment methods was −4.776 kJ (95% LOA, range −417.916−408.365 kJ). A total of 94% of patients found the smartphone application convenient and acceptable in comparison to the recall method for dietary assessment. Bland−Altman plots showed a good level of agreement for nutrients and food groups between the two methods. Telenutrition in the form of a smartphone application helps in real-time tracking of dietary details of IBD patients, thus making appropriate interventions and large-scale data acquisition feasible.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is an extremely dangerous multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative pathogen which poses a serious life-threatening risk in immunocompromised patients. Phosphopantothenoyl cysteine synthetase (PPCS) catalyzes the formation of an amide bond between L-cysteine and phosphopantothenic acid (PPA) to form 4'- Phosphopantothenoylcysteine during Coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. CoA is a crucial cofactor for cellular survival and inhibiting its synthesis will result in cell death. Bacterial PPCS differs from eukaryotic PPCS in a number of ways like it exists as a C-terminal domain of a PPCDC/PPCS fusion protein whereas eukaryotic PPCS exists as an independent protein. This difference makes it an attractive drug target. For which a conventional iterative approach of SBDD (structure-based drug design) was used, which began with three-dimensional structure prediction of AbPPCS using PHYRE 2.0. A database of FDA-approved compounds (Drug Bank) was then screened against the target of interest by means of docking score and glide energy, leading to the identification of 6 prominent drug candidates. The shortlisted 6 molecules were further subjected to all-atom MD simulation studies in explicit-solvent conditions (using AMBER force field). The MD simulation studies revealed that the ligands DB65103, DB449108 and DB443210, maintained several H-bonds with intense van der Waals contacts at the active site of the protein with high binding free energies: -11.42 kcal/mol, -10.49 kcal/mol and -10.98 kcal/mol, respectively, calculated via MM-PBSA method. Overall, binding of these compounds at the active site was found to be the most stable and robust highlighting the potential of these compounds to serve as antibacterials.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Orthopedic trauma is one of the commonest injuries necessitating surgical intervention in a trauma patient. The management protocols in such severely injured orthopedic patients have evolved from conservative treatment to 'early total care' (ETC) to 'damage control orthopedics' (DCO) and recently to 'early appropriate care' (EAC)/'safe definitive surgery' (SDS). 'DCO' involves emergent, basic minimum life- or limb-saving surgery with continued resuscitation and definitive fixation of fractures being done later, once the patient has been resuscitated and stabilized. An insight into the immunological processes at a molecular level evoked in a poly-traumatized patient led to the evolution of the 'two-hit theory;' 'first hit' being the injury itself while the 'second hit' caused by the surgical trauma. As the 'two-hit theory' gained popularity, it led to a delay of definitive surgery for 2-5 days following trauma, since a higher complication rate was observed following definitive surgery within the first 5 days of the injury. This is a review article on the historical perspectives of DCO, immunological mechanisms involved, and various injuries requiring damage control approach or EAC/ETC and their anesthetic management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing officers are an integral component of any medical team. They participate in taking care of basic airway management and assist in advanced airway management, specifically amidst the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
AIM: To assess the efficacy of a standardized web-based training module for nurses in preparedness to fight against COVID-19.
METHODS: The training was held in three sessions of 1 h each, consisting of live audio-visual lectures, case scenarios, and skill demonstrations. The sequence of airway equipment, drug preparation, airway examination, and plans of airway management was demonstrated through mannequin-based video-clips.
RESULTS: Pre- and post-test scores as well as objective structured clinical examination scores were analyzed using Student's t-test and the Likert scale was used for feedback assessment. It was found that the mean score out of the total score of 20 was 8.47 ± 4.2 in the pre-test, while in the post-test it was 17.4 ± 1.8 (P value < 0.001). The participants also felt self-reliant in executing the roles of airway assistant (63.3%) and drug assistant (74.3%). Fear of self-infection with COVID-19 was also high, as 66% of participants feared working with the patient's airway.
CONCLUSION: Amidst this COVID-19 emergency, when the health care systems are being persistently challenged, training of nursing staff in the safe conduct of airway management can ensure delivery of life-saving treatment.

AB  - Craniopagus conjoined twins are extremely rare, reported 1 in 2.5 million live births. To date, 62 separation attempts in 69 well-documented cases of craniopagus twins have been made. Of these, 34 were performed in a single-stage approach, and 28 were attempted in a multistage approach. One or both twins died of massive intraoperative blood loss and cardiac arrest in 14 cases. We report our surgical experience with conjoined craniopagus twins (JB) with type III total vertical joining and shared circumferential/circular sinus with left-sided dominance. A brief review of the literature is also provided. In our twins, the meticulous preoperative study and planning by the multidisciplinary team consisting of 125-member, first-staged surgical separation consisted of creation of venous conduit to bypass part of shared circumferential sinus and partial hemispheric disconnection. Six weeks later, twin J manifested acute cardiac overload because of one-way fistula development from blocked venous bypass graft necessitating emergency final separation surgery. Unique perioperative issues were abnormal anatomy, hemodynamic sequelae from one-way fistula development after venous bypass graft thrombosis, cardiac arrest after massive venous air embolism requiring prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and return of spontaneous circulation at 15 minutes immediately after separation. This is the first Indian craniopagus separation surgery in a complex total vertical craniopagus twin reported by a single-center multidisciplinary team. Both twins could be sent home, but one remained severely handicapped. Adequate perioperative planning and multidisciplinary team approach are vital in craniopagus twin separation surgeries.

AB  - The Human Aurora Kinase (AURK) protein family is the key player of cell cycle events including spindle assembly, kinetochore formation, chromosomal segregation, centrosome separation, microtubule dynamics, and cytokinesis. Their aberrant expression has been extensively linked with chromosomal instability in addition to derangement of multiple tumor suppressors and oncoprotein regulated pathways. Therefore, the AURK family of kinases is a promising target for the treatment of various types of cancer. Over the past few decades, several potential inhibitors of AURK proteins have been identified and have reached various phases of clinical trials. But very few molecules have currently crossed the safety criteria due to their various toxic side effects. In the present study, we have adopted a computational polypharmacological strategy and identified four novel molecules that can target all three AURKs. These molecules were further investigated for their binding stabilities at the ATP binding pocket using molecular dynamics based simulation studies. The molecules selected adopting a multipronged computational approach can be considered as potential AURKs inhibitors for cancer therapeutics.

AB  - AIM: To characterize Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokine profile (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) among different stages of COVID-19 infection.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study which included six healthy individuals and 68 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 in the Department of Medicine, at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, from July 2020 to September 2020. Patients were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 groups, and serum samples were drawn for the measurement of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-17A) which was done by BD™ Cytometric Bead Array.
RESULTS: All the cytokines showed dynamic expression in the COVID-19 group, of which only IL-6 was statistically significant. Among the three severity groups of COVID-19, increased severity did not transform into increased cytokine level, with the exception for IL-6, which was statistically significant.
CONCLUSIONS: In our small sample study, six cytokines expressions were evaluated however most of them were elevated in COVID-19 patients but were not statistically significant except IL-6.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have highlighted a possible influence of gingival and periodontal disease (PD) on COVID-19 risk and severity. However, the evidence is based on hospital-based studies and community-level data are sparse.
OBJECTIVES: We described the epidemiological pattern of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Delhi and evaluated the associations of gingival and PD with incident COVID-19 disease in a regionally representative urban Indian population.
METHODS: In a prospective study nested within the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South-Asia (CARRS) study, participants with clinical gingival and periodontal status available at baseline (2014-16) (n = 1,727) were approached between October 2021 to March 2022. Information on COVID-19 incidence, testing, management, severity was collected as per the WHO case criteria along with COVID-19 vaccination status. Absolute incidence of COVID-19 disease was computed by age, sex, and oral health. Differences in rates were tested using log-rank test. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate independent associations between gingival and PD and incidence of COVID-19, adjusted for socio-demographic and behavioral factors, presence of comorbidity, and medication use.
RESULTS: Among 1,727 participants, the mean age was 44.0 years, 45.7% were men, 84.5% participants had baseline gingival or PD and 89.4% participants had received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Overall, 35% (n = 606) participants were tested for COVID-19 and 24% (n = 146/606) tested positive. As per the WHO criteria total number of cases was 210, constituting 12% of the total population. The age and sex-specific rates of COVID-19 were higher among men and older participants, but women aged >60 years had higher rates than men of same age. The incidence rate did not differ significantly between those having gingival or PD and healthy periodontium (19.1 vs. 16.5/1,000 person-years) and there was no difference in risk of COVID-19 by baseline oral disease status.
CONCLUSION: Gingival and PD were not associated with increased risk of COVID-19.

AB  - Post-mortem MRI (PMMRI) can reliably detect most major organ malformations in cases of stillbirth. However, variable normal post-mortem changes mimicking pathology make the interpretation difficult. Varying morphological appearances of internal organs could be due to differences in gestational age of the fetuses being evaluated or the presence of maceration changes which occur after fetal demise in-utero. Final differentiation and detection of abnormality require a close interaction and inputs from the geneticist regarding clinical examination of the fetus and thorough evaluation of intranatal imaging records. With the increasing use of PMMRI in cases of fetal demise, it is prudent for the radiologists to be aware of normal post-mortem findings to avoid misdiagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In this study, we evaluate the cost and outcomes of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) plus fulvestrant, fulvestrant alone, and conventional chemotherapy as the second-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in India.
METHODS: Using a Markov model, the clinical effectiveness of managing HR+, HER2- MBC in postmenopausal women with either a CDK4/6i (either ribociclib or palbociclib) and fulvestrant, fulvestrant alone, and chemotherapy (single-agent paclitaxel or capecitabine) was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The costs were estimated from two different points of view: scenario I, as per the prevailing market prices of the drugs; and scenario II, as per the reimbursement rates set up by the publicly financed national health insurance scheme. Incremental cost per QALY gained with a given treatment option was compared against the next best alternative and was assessed for cost effectiveness using a threshold of 1-time the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in India from a societal perspective.
RESULTS: In scenario I, an MBC patient was found to incur a lifetime cost of Indian Rupees (₹) 2.54 million ($34,644), ₹2.53 million ($34,496), ₹512,598 ($6,984), ₹326,026 ($4,442) and ₹237,115 ($3,230) for the ribociclib and palbociclib combination arms, fulvestrant monotherapy, single-agent paclitaxel and the single-agent capecitabine treatment arms, respectively. The lifetime cost for CDK4/6i (ribociclib and palbociclib) combination therapy, fulvestrant monotherapy, paclitaxel, and capecitabine arms was estimated to be ₹1.94 million ($26,459), ₹1.92 million ($26,220), ₹315,387 ($4,296), ₹187,392 ($2,553) and ₹153,263 ($2,088), respectively, in scenario II. The mean QALYs lived per MBC patient with CDK4/6i (either ribociclib or palbociclib) combination therapy, fulvestrant, paclitaxel and capecitabine were estimated to be 1.4, 1.0, 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. None of the treatment arms are cost effective at current prices and reimbursement rates at a threshold of 1-time the per capita GDP of India. However, a 78% reduction in the current market price or a 72% reduction in the reimbursement rate of fulvestrant in the government-funded insurance program will make it a cost-effective treatment option for HR+, HER2- MBC patients in India.
CONCLUSION: CDK4/6i (ribociclib and palbociclib) therapy is not a cost-effective treatment option for MBC patients. A 72% reduction in the reimbursement rate for fulvestrant monotherapy will make it a cost-effective treatment option in the Indian context.

T2  - World Journal of Critical Care Medicine
AB  - Despite the remarkable technological advancement in the arena of critical care expertise, the mortality of critically ill patients remains high. When the organ functions deteriorate, goals of care are not fulfilled and life-sustaining treatment becomes a burden on the patient and caregivers, then it is the responsibility of the physician to provide a dignified end to life, control the symptoms of the patient and provide psychological support to the family members. Palliative care is the best way forward for these patients. It is a multidimensional specialty which emphasizes patient and family-based care and aims to improve the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Although intensive care and palliative care may seem to be at two opposite ends of the spectrum, it is necessary to amalgamate the postulates of palliative care in intensive care units to provide holistic care and best benefit patients admitted to intensive care units. This review aims to highlight the need for an alliance of palliative care with intensive care in the present era, the barriers to it, and models proposed for their integration and various ethical issues.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Limited treatment options are available for advanced stages of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Moreover, patients' relapse after a short remission period, which prompts them to identify a potent drug with the least toxicity. An Unani herbal formulation, Itrifal-e-Aftimoon (IEA) is used for certain neurological disorders, however, its antitumor potential has not been reported yet in any malignancy, including CML.
METHODS: The aqueous extract of IEA was characterized by HPLC/LC-MS and used alone or in combination with standard drug, imatinib in CML cell lines (K562, KU812) in vitro to assess its effect on cancer-associated parameters such as cytotoxicity, cell cycle, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, angiogenesis, and certain signalling pathways.
RESULTS: LC-MS characterization of IEA showed the presence of antitumor compounds including catechin and caffeic acid. Treatment with IEA caused cytotoxicity and arrested cells in the sub-G0/G1 phase. Subsequent assays confirmed apoptosis-mediated cell death with mitochondrial membrane depolarization and alleviation of oxidative stress. IEA abrogates IL-6, VEGF, angiopoietin-2, and alters Th1/Th2 cytokines. IEA potentiated the effect of imatinib even at lower doses by affecting FAK/STAT/Akt/ERK pathways.
CONCLUSION: IEA possesses antitumor potential against CML and increases the efficacy of imatinib when used in combination, suggesting utilization of IEA as an adjuvant therapy for better management of CML in the future.

AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer have a poor prognosis with a 1-year survival rate of 10%-15%. Recently, an antiangiogenic humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has shown to improve the survival of these patients. This study was designed to assess the cost effectiveness of incorporating bevacizumab with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer in India.
METHODS: Using a disaggregated societal perspective and lifetime horizon, a Markov model was developed for estimating the costs and health outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer treated with either standard chemotherapy alone or in combination with bevacizumab. Effectiveness data for each of the treatment regimen were assessed using estimates from Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 trial. Data on disease-specific mortality in metastatic cervical cancer, health system cost, and out-of-pocket expenditure were derived from Indian literature. Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainty.
RESULTS: Over the lifetime of one patient with advanced and metastatic cervical cancer, bevacizumab along with standard chemotherapy results in a gain of 0.275 (0.052-0.469) life-years (LY) and 0.129 (0.032-0.218) quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), at an additional cost of $3,816 US dollars (USD; 2,513-5,571) compared with standard chemotherapy alone. This resulted in an incremental cost of $19,080 USD (7,230-52,434) per LY gained and $34,744 USD (15,782-94,914) per QALY gained with the use of bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy.
CONCLUSION: Addition of bevacizumab to the standard chemotherapy is not cost effective for the treatment of advanced and metastatic cervical cancer in India at a threshold of 1-time per-capita gross domestic product.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intubation is a highly aerosol-generating procedure. Recent airway management guidelines advocate the use of appropriate personal protective equipment, videolaryngoscope, and "intubation box" while intubating a suspected or infected coronavirus patient. We undertook a study to compare C-MAC videolaryngoscope with McGrath videolaryngoscope for tracheal intubation using an intubation box by donned anaesthesiologists.
METHODS: The patients were randomly allocated to 2 groups by computer-generated random numbers, depending upon the videolaryngoscope used. In group C, C-MAC videolaryngoscope (n=30) was used, whereas McGrath videolaryngoscope was used in group M (n=30). The primary outcome was the total time required for successful intubation. The secondary outcomes included the number of attempts required, Cormack and Lehane grade, the percentage of glottis opening score, the difficulty faced while using the device, and the user's preference.
RESULTS: The time to intubation was 57.17 ± 19.98 seconds with C-MAC videolaryngoscope as compared to 57.93 ± 14.92 seconds with McGrath. Both the devices had a good percentage of glottis opening score. Twelve patients in each group were found to have a Cormack and Lehane grade of 1. The time to glottis visualization was more with McGrath than with C-MAC although not significant (23.8 ± 14.03 vs 20.10 ± 10.78 seconds). Both the devices were easy to use.
CONCLUSIONS: Both C-MAC and McGrath videolaryngoscopes are equally effective devices for intubation by a donned anaesthesiologist using an intubation box. McGrath with a disposable blade should be preferred for intubation in these conditions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To explore the burden, clinical features and associations of trichiasis due to trachomatous and non-trachomatous aetiologies.
METHODS: Consenting patients presenting with trichiasis of either eyelid (of one or both eyes) attending the outpatient department, cornea and oculoplasty clinics of a tertiary eye care hospital in New Delhi between August 2018 to March 2020 were included. A comprehensive examination including visual acuity and anterior segment evaluation and photography was performed. Grade of trichiasis, laterality, presence and grade of entropion, and information on corneal opacity, conjunctival scarring, Herbert's pits, and pannus, if present, were recorded in the case record form.
RESULTS: Overall, 302 patients (454 eyes) with trichiasis were recruited. The most common attributed cause of upper eyelid trichiasis (276 patients, 405 eyes) was trachoma (26% of patients), followed by Stevens-Johnson syndrome (23%), blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (17%) and old age (10%). A total of 296/405 eyes (73%) had some form of corneal involvement. Trachoma was not identified as the cause of trichiasis in any eye with lower eyelid-only disease.
CONCLUSION: Only about a quarter of upper eyelid trichiasis in this peri-elimination setting was attributed to trachoma. A distinction between trachomatous and non-trachomatous trichiasis is imperative to meaningfully determine whether elimination of trachoma as a public health problem has occurred. These data may have implications for population-based estimates of TT prevalence in India and other peri-elimination settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report clinical presentation, in vivo confocal microscopic features, and corneal phenotype in patients with trachomatous keratopathy (TK) and secondary amyloidosis.
METHODS: Histopathological records of all patients undergoing keratoplasty at the Dr. Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences over a 3-year period were scanned retrospectively for a diagnosis of TK and amyloidosis. Demographic profile and details of preoperative comprehensive ophthalmic assessment were extracted. The histopathology was freshly reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients (29 eyes) with TK and atypical corneal involvement due to amyloid deposition were identified. Herbert's pits and upper palpebral conjunctival scarring were present in all cases. Central or total diffuse corneal scarring was present involving the anterior stroma in 5 (31%) and the full thickness of the cornea in 11 (69%) of the eyes. Eight (73%) of 11 patients with deep stromal amyloid deposits revealed bilateral, discrete, blue-white opacities at the level of deep stroma and Descemet membrane (DM). Endothelial cells were atrophic and flattened with gutta formation. Confoscans revealed hyperreflective, needle-shaped crystalline deposits of extracellular amyloid at various depths of the corneal stroma up to DM. All host corneal buttons demonstrated Congo red-positive amyloid deposits on histopathological examination.
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a distinct form of TK unlike the usual presentation of dense, leucomatous, vascularized corneal scarring in trachoma. We believe that amyloid deposits in DM and the corneal endothelium have not previously been reported in patients with trachoma.

AB  - The outcomes of pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have improved with the use of imatinib mesylate (IM). Multiple reports of growth deceleration with IM have raised concerns, necessitating careful monitoring and evaluation in children with CML. We systematically searched the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CENTRAL, and conferences-abstracts, reporting the effect of IM on growth among children with CML, and published in the English language from inception till March 2022. For observational studies, the modified Newcastle Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Pooled estimates were derived using a random-effects meta-analysis, and heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q statistic test of heterogeneity and I2 statistic. Of the 757 studies identified through electronic search, 15 (n=265) were included in the final analysis. Six studies (n=178) were included in the meta-analysis of the primary outcome. There was a significant deleterious effect of IM on height-standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.52 (95% CI: -0.76; -0.28) ( I2 =13%). The adverse effect of IM on height was significant among studies with a follow-up period <3 years [SMD: -0.66 (95% CI: -0.93, -0.40), I2 =0%, P =0.59] but not in studies with follow-up period ≥3 years [SMD: -0.26 (95% CI: -0.63, 0.11), I2 =0, P =0.44], indicating that the effect of IM on height is a short-term effect. The effect of IM on height was not dependent upon pubertal status at the initiation of therapy. Prospective studies with adequate sample size are required to confirm the findings of the effect of IM on height in children with CML.

AB  - Acute pancreatitis (AP) is one of the common gastrointestinal conditions presenting as medical emergency. Clinically, the severity of AP ranges from mild to severe. Mild AP has a favorable outcome. Patients with moderately severe and severe AP, on the other hand, require hospitalization and considerable utilization of health care resources. These patients require a multidisciplinary management. Pancreatic fluid collections (PFCs) and arterial bleeding are the most important local complications of pancreatitis. PFCs may require drainage when infected or symptomatic. PFCs are drained endoscopically or percutaneously, based on the timing and the location of collection. Both the techniques are complementary, and many patients may undergo dual modality treatment. Percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) remains the most extensively utilized method for drainage in patients with AP and necrotic PFCs. Besides being effective as a standalone treatment in a significant proportion of these patients, PCD also provides an access for percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy and minimally invasive necrosectomy. Endovascular embolization is the mainstay of management of arterial complications in patients with AP and chronic pancreatitis. The purpose of the present guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for the percutaneous management of complications of pancreatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Governments have imposed lockdowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals have restricted outpatient clinics and elective services meant for non-COVID illnesses. This has led to patients facing unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. This study was carried out to assess patients' concerns and apprehensions about the effect of the lockdown on their treatments.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ambispective, observational cross-sectional single centre study was conducted. Patients were contacted telephonically and requested to answer a structured questionnaire. Their responses were documented and summarized as frequency and proportions.
RESULTS: A total of 727 patients were interviewed. Epilepsy (32%) was the most common neurological illness in our cohort followed by stroke (18%). About half the patients and/or their caregivers reported health-related concerns during the lockdown. The primary concern was how to connect with their treating neurologist if need arose. Forty-seven patients (6.4%) had drug default. Among patients on immunomodulatory treatments, only eight patients had drug default. High compliance rates were also observed in the stroke and epilepsy cohorts. Of the 71 patients who required emergency care during the lockdown, 24 could reach our hospital emergency. Fourteen patients either had a delay or could not seek emergency care. Two-thirds of our patients found the telemedicine experience satisfactory.
CONCLUSION: The ongoing pandemic will continue to pose challenges to both physicians and patients. Patients in follow-up may need to be contacted regularly and counselled regarding the importance of maintaining drug compliance. Telemedicine can be used to strengthen the healthcare delivery to patients with non-COVID illnesses.

AB  - AIM: To estimate the prevalence, socio-demographic determinants, common disease combinations, and health impact of multimorbidity among a young rural population.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among participants aged ≥30 years in rural Punjab, North India, from Jan 2019 to April 2019. Multimorbidity was defined as the coexistence of ≥two conditions using a 14-condition tool validated in India. We also calculated a multimorbidity-weighted index (MWI), which provides a weight to each disease based on its impact on physical functioning. Logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the association with sociodemographic variables, mental health (PHQ-9), physical functioning (ADL scale), and self-rated health (SRH).
RESULTS: We analyzed data from 3213 adults [Mean age 51.5 (±13), 54% women]. Prevalence of single chronic condition, multimorbidity, and MWI was 28.6, 18% and - 1.9 respectively. Age, higher wealth index and ever use alcohol were significantly associated with multimorbidity. Overall, 2.8% of respondents had limited physical functioning, 2.1% had depression, and 61.5% reported low SRH. Poorer health outcomes were more prevalent among the elderly, women, less educated, and those having lower wealth index and multimorbidity, were found to be significantly associated with poor health outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: The burden of multimorbidity was high in this young rural population, which portends significant adverse effects on their health and quality of life. The Indian health system should be reconfigured to address this emerging health priority holistically, by adopting a more integrated and sustainable model of care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rational use of medicines as per the World Health Organization (WHO) should be practiced globally. However, data regarding the completeness of the prescriptions and their rational use is lacking from developing countries like India. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the prescribing patterns of drugs and completeness of prescriptions as per WHO core drug use and complementary indicators to provide real-life examples for the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) online prescribing skill course for medical graduates.
METHODS: Prescriptions of the patients, fulfilling inclusion criteria, attending Outpatient Departments of various specialties of tertiary care hospitals, were collected by thirteen ICMR Rational use of medicines centers located in tertiary care hospitals, throughout India. Prescriptions were evaluated for rational use of medicines according to the WHO guidelines and for appropriateness as per standard treatment guidelines using a common protocol approved by local Ethics committees.
RESULTS: Among 4838 prescriptions, an average of about three drugs (3.34) was prescribed to the patients per prescription. Polypharmacy was noted in 83.05% of prescriptions. Generic drugs were prescribed in 47.58% of the prescriptions. Further, antimicrobials were prescribed in 17.63% of the prescriptions and only 4.98% of prescriptions were with injectables. During the prescription evaluation, 38.65% of the prescriptions were incomplete due to multiple omissions such as dose, duration, and formulation.
CONCLUSION: Most of the parameters in the present study were out of the range of WHO-recommended prescribing indicators. Therefore, effective intervention program, like training, for the promotion of rational drug use practice was recommended to improve the prescribing pattern of drugs and the quality of prescriptions all over the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated Systolic Hypertension (ISH) and Isolated Diastolic Hypertension (IDH) are often the ignored forms of hypertension and are determinants of future cardiac and neurological events and contribute to mortality. However, the nationally representative estimates of both these forms of hypertension remain unknown from India.
AIM: To estimate the ISH and IDH from a nationally representative survey of India.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study used data from 7,23,181 people (15-54 years), recorded during the fourth round (2015-2016) of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), India. The prevalence of ISH and IDH was calculated for state comparison, while multilevel logistic regression analysis was done to assess the correlates of both types of hypertension.
RESULTS: The prevalence of ISH and IDH was found to be 1.2% (95% CI 1.0-1.4) and 5.7% (95% CI 5.2-6.2), respectively. The prevalence of both ISH and IDH increased with age, with a more significant increase in systolic pressure towards the higher age. Northeastern states of India (Assam, Meghalaya, and Arunachal Pradesh) had the highest prevalence of both forms of hypertension. On multilevel logistic regression, male gender, increasing age groups (highest odds ratio (OR) being in 45-49 year age group), alcohol, and diabetes positively predicted both ISH and IDH. Urban residence, literacy, and tobacco were positive predictors of IDH, whereas urban residence, smoking, and literacy negatively predicted ISH.
CONCLUSION: ISH and IDH have a significant presence among the population of India. This data provides insights to formulate strategies at the primary and primordial prevention levels.

T2  - Indian Journal of Pediatrics
AB  - Adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) is a rare disorder of the adrenal gland due to mutations in the nuclear receptor superfamily 0, group B, member 1 (NR0B1) gene. It commonly presents with adrenal insufficiency and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, but there is a wide variability in the age as well as the clinical phenotype at presentation. Also, the mechanism of pubertal abnormalities in this condition, which include not just delayed or absent pubertal development, but also precocious puberty in a small proportion of cases, is not clear. In this paper, three unrelated patients with 3 different mutations are described, who presented with variable age of onset of adrenal insufficiency, gonadal development, and puberty, highlighting the need for high index of suspicion of this condition in children presenting with atypical features of adrenal insufficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Robotic surgeries often require a relatively long duration of pneumo-peritoneum and trendelenburg position which may accentuate changes in endo-tracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressure leading to pressure related complications. The aim of this study was to analyze changes in ETT cuff pressures during various stages of pneumo-peritoneum and surgical positioning and its correlation with airway pressure changes.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was planned after approval of institutional review board on 60 patients undergoing elective robotic pelvic surgery requiring head down position. Baseline cuff pressure was adjusted to 25 cm H2O. ETT cuff pressure, peak airway pressure and end tidal CO2 (ETCO2) was measured at various time intervals before and after pneumo-peritoneum and head down. Ventilatory parameters were kept fixed after baseline setting. Those requiring any change were excluded. Pearson's coefficient was used for correlation and ANOVA for trend of parameters at different time intervals (P value <0.05 was considered significant).
RESULTS: Baseline cuff pressure after manual inflation was 46.2 ± 17.4 cm H2O. Significant correlation was observed between change in cuff pressure and increase in peak airway pressure at the end of the surgery (r = 0.4, P < 0.05). Serial measurements of ETT cuff pressure, peak airway pressure and ETCO2 were significantly increased compared to baseline (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Significant increases in ETT cuff pressure may be seen in robotic surgeries, with a positive correlation between change in cuff pressure and increase in airway pressures. Objective adjusted measurement of cuff pressure and airway pressures is recommended for such surgeries.

AB  - Development of computer-aided cancer diagnostic tools is an active research area owing to the advancements in deep-learning domain. Such technological solutions provide affordable and easily deployable diagnostic tools. Leukaemia, or blood cancer, is one of the leading cancers causing more than 0.3 million deaths every year. In order to aid the development of such an AI-enabled tool, we collected and curated a microscopic image dataset, namely C-NMC, of more than 15000 cancer cell images at a very high resolution of B-Lineage Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (B-ALL). The dataset is prepared at the subject-level and contains images of both healthy and cancer patients. So far, this is the largest (as well as curated) dataset on B-ALL cancer in the public domain. C-NMC is available at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA), USA and can be helpful for the research community worldwide for the development of B-ALL cancer diagnostic tools. This dataset was utilized in an international medical imaging challenge held at ISBI 2019 conference in Venice, Italy. In this paper, we present a detailed description and challenges of this dataset. We also present benchmarking results of all the methods applied so far on this dataset.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Intubation in head and neck carcinoma (HNC) is difficult due to many reasons. Various guidelines recommend strategies for airway management in such anticipated difficult airway cases. However, literature is limited on airway management planning as per the level of difficulty based on airway assessment in these patients. EL-Ganzouri risk index (EGRI) has been proposed to aid in making airway management plan in HNC cases by some authors. This retrospective study was conducted to look at the data related to the pre-anesthetic airway assessment and the airway management plan executed by the anesthesiologists in 1000 patients of HNC in the previous nearly four years in order to determine how the choices made conformed to EGRI scores.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records of all the patients with oral cancer posted for surgery over four years from January 2014 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed for preoperative airway assessment using El Ganzouri risk index assessment (EGRI), the intraoperative technique for nasotracheal intubation, airway management plan, and any intraoperative complications.
RESULTS: The risk of predicted airway difficulty was low (EGRI <4) in 38 patients and was high in the rest. The EGRI score was higher in the FOB group [4-9] as compared to DL [2-3] and VL [1-6]. The patients with EGRI >7 were intubated awake and those with EGRI <7 were intubated under general anesthesia (79.8%). Overall, the technique of choice for intubation was fibreoptic bronchoscopy (54%) followed by video laryngoscopy (42.6%).
CONCLUSION: The airway management plan used in a tertiary care cancer center conformed to the approach suggested by the multivariate El Ganzouri risk index (EGRI). EGRI appears to be a useful means to ascertain the appropriate strategies for intubation in head and neck cancer patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We retrospectively analysed the perioperative anesthetic management in patients undergoing HIPEC surgery.
METHODS: After ethics approval, we reviewed the records of patients who underwent CRS/HIPEC from 2015 until 2020. We noted the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI), blood loss, anastomoses done, total amount of fluid given, delta temperature and duration of surgery. These were correlated with the need for postoperative ventilation, length of ICU stay, Clavien-Dindo score and 30 day mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 180 patients reviewed, the majority were women (85%) with a mean age of 48 years who had ovarian tumors (n=114). The total amount of fluid given was associated with an increased length of ICU stay (p=0.008). Prolonged surgery resulted in increased length of ICU stay (p<0.001), need for postoperative ventilation (p=0.006) and a poor Clavien-Dindo score (p=0.039). A high PCI score correlated with increased ICU stay, 30 day mortality (p<0.001), and the need for postoperative ventilation (0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: PCI, duration of surgery and blood loss were major predictors of postoperative morbidity. Additionally, the amount of fluid given and delta temperature affected patient outcome and should be individualized to the patient's needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Access to pain management has been recognized as a fundamental human right. Inadequate pain relief hampers the quality of life and has a physiological and psychosocial impact on the patient and caregivers. Inadequate pain relief remains the leading cause of suffering in hospitalized patients worldwide.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to provide adequate pain relief to hospitalized patients through proper assessment, treatment, and monitoring of pain by the trained health-care workers through a sustainable and effective institutional pain management policy.
METHODS: The formulation of pain management policy at a tertiary care teaching institute was conducted in three phases - Phase 1: need assessment by an open-label, uncontrolled, prospective observational study over 1 month period, Phase 2: teaching, training, and awareness of health-care workers, and Phase 3: constitution of the committee at the institute level with the formation of pain resource teams.
RESULTS: An open-label, prospective observational study conducted over 1 month revealed that among 814 hospitalized patients, 108 out of 235 (46%) patients in medical and 385 out of 579 (66.5%) patients in the surgical cohort had NRS score of ≥3, implying an inadequate pain relief even at 24 h following medical or surgical intervention, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The provision of effective and adequate pain relief to hospitalized patients requires trained health-care workers and a uniform and structured pain management policy at the institutional level. Recognition and addressal of the barriers and challenges while framing an institutional pain policy is of utmost importance.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed and correlated neurochemical levels and cognitive functions in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left hippocampus in euthymic patients with bipolar disorder and compared these with healthy controls METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five right-handed euthymic patients (HAM-D score < 7, and YMRS score < 7) with bipolar disorder and 20 age and gender matched controls were compared for neurometabolites (n-acetylaspartate - tNAA, choline - Cho, creatinine - Cr, myoinositol - Ins, and glutamine/glutamate - Glu/Gln) measured in left DLPFC and left hippocampus using single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and cognitive functions assessed using trail making test (TMT - A and B), wisconsin card sorting test (WCST), and wechsler memory scale (WMS-III Indian adaptation).
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable on socio-demographic variables. tNAA levels in DLPFC and hippocampus, and glutamate levels in hippocampus were found to be significantly lower and Inositol and glutamine levels in hippocampus were found to be significantly higher in patients as compared to controls. Patients performed significantly poorly as compared to controls on TMT A & B, all subscales of WMS - III, 5 subscales of WCST, including perseverative responses and errors. The tNAA and glutamate levels in left DLPFC in patients correlated with scores on TMT A & B, and several subscales of WCST and WMS-III. tNAA concentration in left hippocampus in patients correlated with scores on subscales of WMS-III.
CONCLUSION: Neurochemical dysfunction in select brain areas directly correlates with impairment in cognitive functions seen in patients with bipolar disorder in euthymic phase.

T2  - The British Journal of Radiology
AB  - Renal hydatid is an uncommon finding, reported in less than 5% patients with hydatid infection. Hydatid involvement of ureter and urinary bladder is an even rarer entity. Renal hydatid is typically unilateral, solitary and arises from cortex. It is essential to be aware of the imaging features of the hydatid cyst for proper diagnosis. Knowledge of the imaging features of various stages is essential since treatment decision is based on cyst stage. Hydatid cyst can mimic several entities both benign and malignant. We present a pictorial review to illustrate the radiological imaging features of hydatid disease involving kidney, ureter and bladder region and its complications.

TI  - Methodological issues in conducting yoga- and meditation-based research: A narrative review and research implications
AU  - Gupta, Snehil

T2  - Journal of Ayurveda and Integrative Medicine
AB  - Yoga and meditation-based interventions have been extensively utilized in the field of contemporary complementary and alternative medicine for various physical and mental health conditions. Ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has rekindled the interest of researchers in yoga and meditation for its preventive and therapeutic utilities. However, the available literature in this area has several methodological concerns, limiting formers' clinical utility. A comprehensive literature on this topic would stimulate researchers and guide them to conduct research on this topic with robust methodologies. The current review highlights the methodological issues with the yoga and meditation-based Research (henceforth, MBR), discusses some of the contentious issues, and provides future directions. The PubMed, Medline, and google scholar databases were searched to screen records dealing with the methodological issues on MBR. The search yielded 299 records, upon screening, only 24 articles were found suitable for the current study. Common methodological issues with MBR: lack of the consensus definitions of the yoga and meditations, interventions lacking theoretical framework of meditation; inadequate description of the study design; difficulty with participants recruitment, setting up the control groups, and blinding; difficulty in assessing the baseline characteristics of the participants, and validity issues with the outcome measures. A few research, however, have also highlighted the potential measures to overcome these methodological challenges. Yoga and meditation-based interventions are promising for several health conditions. However, literature suffers from considerable methodological issues, thus, limiting its utility in modern clinical practice. The study findings can stimulate and guide future research on this topic.

TI  - Prevalence of serum cobalamin and folate deficiency among children aged 6-59 months: A hospital-based cross-sectional study from Northern India
AU  - Gupta, Surbhi
AU  - Haldar, Partha

T2  - Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care
AB  - CONTEXT: Cobalamin and folate are essential for the synthesis of nucleic acids and in the maintenance of myelin. They are required during the period of the rapid growth of infancy and childhood. Their deficiency may result in nutritional anemia and neurological manifestations. There is paucity of literature regarding the prevalence of cobalamin and folate deficiency among North Indian children aged 6-59 months.
AIM: The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of serum cobalamin and folate deficiency among children aged 6-59 months, attending a secondary care hospital.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Children were recruited from pediatrics OPD of the sub-district hospital (SDH), Ballabgarh, Haryana, through systematic random sampling. Hemoglobin was measured by an automated analyzer. Serum cobalamin and serum folate were estimated using enhanced chemiluminescence based immunoassay.
RESULTS: A total of 420 children were recruited, of which 392 provided a blood specimen. Prevalence of cobalamin, folate deficiency, and anemia were 22.3% (95% CI: 18.3-26.7), 10.9% (95% CI: 8.2-14.6), and 81.9% (95% CI 77.7-85.4), respectively. The proportion of children with cobalamin deficiency who had anemia was 97.7% compared to 95.7% among those with no cobalamin deficiency (P = 0.396). Similarly, the proportion of children with folate deficiency who had anemia was 95.2% compared to 96.2% among those with no folate deficiency (P = 0.765).
CONCLUSION: We found that almost one in five children aged 6-59 were deficient in cobalamin, and one in ten were deficient in folate.

T2  - Experimental Cell Research
AB  - BACKGROUND: Small Extracellular vesicles (EV) are emerging as crucial intercellular messengers that contribute to the physiological processes. EVs contain numerous functional proteins and nucleic acids derived from their parent cells and have different roles depending on their origin. Functionally, EVs transfer these biological materials from the parent cell to the recipient and thus exhibits a novel therapeutic platform for delivering therapeutics molecules to the target tissue. In this regard, EVs derived from stem cells such as Mesenchymal Stem Cells and iPSCs have demonstrated a higher ability to benefit regenerative medicine. Even though these stem cells share some common properties, due to the differences in their origin (cell sources, the hierarchy of potency, etc) the EVs cargo profiling and functionality may vary.
METHOD: We used iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to conduct a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation of EVs derived from iPSCs and various tissue-specific MSCs in this study. Additionally, the data was analyzed using a variety of bioinformatic tools, including ProteinPilot for peptide and protein identification and quantification; Funrich, GO, Reactome, and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) for pathway enrichment; the STRING database, and the inBio Discover tool for identifying known and predicted Protein-Protein networks.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed 223 differentially expressed proteins in these EVs; however, Wharton's jelly MSC-EV contained more exclusive proteins with higher protein expression levels. Additionally, 113 proteins were abundant in MSC-EVs, while others were shared between MSC-EVs and iPSC-EVs. Further, based on an in-depth examination of the proteins, their associated pathways, and their interactions with other proteins, it was determined that these proteins are involved in bone regeneration (9.3%), wound healing (4.4%), immune regulation (8.9%), cardiac regeneration (6.6%), neuro regeneration (8.9%), and hepatic regeneration (3.5%).
CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of our proteomic analysis indicate that EVs derived from MSCs have a more robust profile of proteins with higher expression levels than iPSCs. This is a significant finding, as it demonstrates the critical therapeutic role of EVs in a variety of diseases, as demonstrated by enrichment analysis, their versatility, and broad application potential.

AB  - Netarsudil is a hypotensive drug that reduces intraocular pressure (IOP). Although it is used to treat corneal decompensation/edema in normotensive eyes, we observed the occurrence of corneal epithelial edema with corneal honeycombing in children with uncontrolled IOP (primary or secondary glaucoma) on maximal topical medication following netarsudil (0.02%) therapy of >2 weeks. Of 16 eyes of 16 children, 9 (56%) developed corneal honeycombing. They were younger than those without honeycombing (median age, 3.1 vs 9.7 years [P = 0.016]), had higher baseline IOP (35.6 ± 7.4 vs 27.2 ± 5.6 mm Hg [P < 0.001]), and usually had preexisting corneal edema (7/9 eyes vs none [P < 0.001]).

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare posterior corneal morphology between older treated and younger untreated children with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) and intraoperative OCT (iOCT), respectively.
METHODS: In this comparative study, ASOCT of older PCG children were compared with iOCT of younger untreated PCG patients. Differences between the two groups with respect to posterior corneal morphology were studied.
RESULTS: Observed morphological patterns within posterior cornea in older treated (age: 72-300 months) children (87 eyes) included Descemet's membrane (DM) excrescences (70%), thickened DM (35%), intracameral twin protuberances (92%), and DM detachment (26%). Changes within pre-Descemet's layer (PDL) (28%) included thickening, breaks, and detachments. Extent of Haab's striae was associated with thickness of DM/PDL complex (P = 0.008) when analyzed in the treated group. In contrast, in the untreated group (n = 53 eyes, age 1-63 months), posterior corneal changes were limited to diffuse hyper-reflectivity of the DM/PDL complex, with absence of DM tears.
CONCLUSION: Posterior cornea thickens and Haab's striae become more circumscribed in eyes of older treated children compared to untreated PCG eyes, probably reflecting a healing response of posterior cornea over time.

T2  - BMJ case reports
AB  - We highlight the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) as a supplementary modality to ultrasound (USG) examination in ovarian torsion in this case report. The reported patient had clinical history suspicious of ovarian torsion; however, USG and Doppler flow study findings were equivocal. CEUS was performed to solve the diagnostic dilemma and to know the status of ovarian parenchymal viability which revealed non-enhancement of the ovarian cyst wall and pedicle throughout the USG examination thus establishing the diagnosis of non-viable or infarcted ovarian parenchyma. The per operative and histopathology findings were consistent with our CEUS findings. CEUS is an emerging promising modality which provides information regarding parenchymal perfusion, resulting in a reliable diagnosis of ovarian torsion along with information on ovarian parenchymal viability. This ability makes CEUS equivalent to contrast-enhanced CT or MRI.

AB  - Accessory cavitated uterine mass (ACUM) is a rare form of developmental mullerian anomaly which causes chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility in young females. It is a non-communicating, accessory cavity within an otherwise normal uterus, lined by functional endometrium and surrounded by myometrium-like smooth muscle cells which imparts it uterus-like appearance. USG and MRI are the imaging modalities which help in reaching the diagnosis. Knowledge of this entity and awareness of its imaging features can help diagnose this often underdiagnosed and surgically correctable cause of dysmenorrhea.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the discriminatory value of various impulse oscillometry (IOS) parameters, and to find the cutoff value of the appropriate parameter for identifying exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in children with asthma.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in India from October 2016 to March 2018 in children with asthma who were 6-15 years of age. One hundred and five children were enrolled and subjected to pre-exercise IOS and spirometry followed by free running treadmill test as an exercise challenge. All children could achieve minute ventilation >17.5-21 times of FEV1 during the exercise challenge test. Then, IOS and spirometry were performed at 10 ± 2, 20 ± 2, and 30 ± 2 min post-exercise challenge. EIB was defined as reduction of FEV1 ≥10% within 30 min of exercise. For purposes of analysis, the children were grouped into two categories: "EIB Present" or "EIB Absent".
RESULTS: The prevalence of EIB in our study was 20.95% (n = 22). ΔR5max percentage within 30 min post-exercise (AUC 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.84) had the best discriminating capacity among all IOS parameters for identifying EIB. A cutoff value of 14.1% increase in R5 within 30 min post-exercise was obtained for detection of EIB (sensitivity-95.45%, specificity-50.6%, PPV-33.87% and NPV-97.67%).
CONCLUSIONS: A percentage change in R5 with a cutoff value of 14.1% increase post-exercise had the best discriminatory capacity among all IOS parameters for detection of EIB in children with asthma. However, low positive predictive value (PPV) with high negative predictive value (NPV) made this cutoff value more apt to rule out EIB.

AB  - Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are emerging as an ideal candidate for regenerative medicine. It is known that the culture conditions impact the cellular properties of MSCs and their therapeutic behavior. Moreover, maintenance of MSCs in low oxygen tension for a short duration has shown to be beneficial for MSCs as it is similar to that of their physiological niche. However, the precise mechanism through which hypoxia pre-conditioning affects MSCs is not clear yet. Thus, in this study, we have investigated the effect of hypoxia exposure (1% O2) on tissue-specific MSCs over a period of time under serum-free culture conditions and evaluated the changes in expression of immuno-modulatory molecules and exosome biogenesis and secretion markers. It was observed that all MSCs responded differentially towards hypoxia exposure as indicated by the expression of HIF-1α. Moreover, this short-term exposure did not induce any changes in MSCs cellular morphology, proliferation rate, and surface marker profiling. In addition, we observed an enhancement in the expression of immunomodulatory factors (HLA-G, PGE-2, and IDO) after hypoxia exposure of 12 to 24 h in all tissue-specific MSCs. Interestingly, we have also observed the upregulation in exosome secretion that was further corelated to the upregulation of expression of exosome biogenesis and secretion markers (ALIX, TSG101, RAB27a, RAB27b). Though there was a differential response of MSCs where WJ-MSCs and BM-MSCs showed upregulation of these markers at 6-12 h of hypoxia pre-conditioning, while AD-MSCs showed similar changes beyond 24 h of hypoxia exposure.

AB  - A 38-year-old woman with a 2-month history of per vaginal bleeding and episodes of palpitations, headache, and vomiting underwent 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT for evaluation, which revealed a left suprarenal mass and a large uterine mass, both of which were intensely tracer avid. Histopathology of the masses after surgery revealed a left pheochromocytoma and uterine leiomyoma. SSTR-expressing leiomyoma is an uncommon finding and must be kept in mind as a differential diagnosis of DOTANOC-avid uterine mass.

AB  - The hemodynamics of anomalous origin of the pulmonary artery (PA) from the aorta is challenging. Different sources of blood supply to the lungs lead to a unique state of differential flow, pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance in each lung. The decision for surgical reimplantation of the anomalous PA during infancy is easy. The assessment of operability beyond infancy, however, is perplexing. In this report, we describe stepwise multimodal hemodynamic evaluation and successful surgical management in a 15-year-old boy with an isolated anomalous origin of the right PA from the aorta. We also report 5-year hemodynamic data confirming sustained benefit over the long term, thus providing much-needed clinical validation of often cited Poiseuille's and Ohm's laws.

AB  - Despite optimal medical management, an 8-year-old boy had persistent pleural drainage following total cavopulmonary connection. Detailed evaluation, including computed tomography angiography, confirmed obstruction at the lower end of the circuit due to infolding of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Balloon dilation of the obstruction resulted in prompt resolution of pleural effusion with sustained relief at 1-year follow-up. The case demonstrates the importance of careful assessment in the diagnosis and successful nonsurgical management of an unusual cause of obstruction in the Fontan circuit.

AB  - Copy number alteration (CNA) status and CNA risk profiles of IKZF1 plus , UK-ALL CNA risk groups and MRplus scores, were evaluated for clinical and prognostic impact in a cohort of 493 B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases diagnosed and treated under the Indian Collaborative Childhood Leukemia group (ICiCLe) protocol trial. Overall CNA frequency was 59% with 60% of cases showing 2-loci deletion. CDKN2A/B deletion was most common CNA (36.3%), while IKZF1 deletion and IKZF1 plus profile were noted in 19.5% and 13.4% of cases, respectively. IKZF1 deletions and other CNA risk profiles were significantly associated with poor (PR)/high risk (HR) clinical and genetic profile parameters (P < 0.001). In addition, the 3-year OS, event-free survival (EFS) was significantly poor with high relapse rate (RR) of 38.6%, 46.5%, and 35.2% for IKZF1 deletions, IKZF1 plus profiles, and UK-ALL CNA-intermediate risk (IR)+PR risk groups, respectively (P < 0.001). Integrated evaluation of UK-ALL CNA risk profile with ICiCLe trial risk stratification groups revealed a worse overall survival, EFS, and RR of 63.3%, 43.2%, and 35.2% for CNA-IR+PR profile compared to CNA-good risk profile (81.3%, 65.0%, and 21.0%; P < 0.001). Hence, routine CNA testing in our setting is must to identify standard risk and IR cases likely to benefit from HR treatment.

AU  - Gupta, Saurabh Kumar
T2  - Annals of Pediatric Cardiology
AB  - Despite right-to-left shunt, not all patients with so-called cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD) are cyanosed at all times. Moreover, despite undisputed clinical utility, cyanosis is unreliable for the detection of arterial desaturation. Pulse oximetry, on the other hand, provides a much easier, reliable, and accurate method for detecting arterial desaturation. For optimal detection, therefore, it is perhaps sensible to replace cyanosis with pulse oximetry-based detection of arterial desaturation in all cases with suspected CHD.

AB  - Binder's syndrome, a rare congenital malformation of nasomaxillary complex, first described in 1962, has a hexad of characteristic clinical and radiographic features consisting of arhinoid face, intermaxillary hypoplasia with malocclusion, abnormal position of nasal bones, atrophy of nasal mucosa, reduced or absent anterior nasal spine and hypoplastic/absent frontal sinus. The typical facies due to mid-face hypoplasia may also be accompanied by other midline malformations such as cleft palate, spinal, skeletal and cardiac abnormalities. It is usually sporadic, of unknown etiology although various environmental and genetic mechanisms are implicated due to few familial cases predominantly in the Swedish population. A case of inherited Binder's syndrome is presented in an Indian female patient with an unusual finding of ankyloglossia (AG). The development of the anterior nasal spine and AG are chronologically related as they both occur during the 5th-6th weeks of gestation. The possible etiopathogenetic mechanisms for this rare association are reviewed.

AB  - India has been witnessing an epidemic of diabetes for several years now. A large proportion of patients with undiagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes are at great risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) and irreversible blindness. The goal of DR screening is to identify people with sight-threatening DR early so that prompt treatment can be initiated, and blindness can be prevented. Systematic DR screening is essential to identify disease early, and a national effort for the same is required. We adopt a health system approach to outline the actions that need to take place for effective DR screening in the public sector in India. We discuss the role of national leadership, needs assessment, finalization of DR screening and referral pathway, trainings, strategies to improve the uptake, allocation of roles and responsibilities, public-private partnerships, quality control, and financing.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the severity of primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) among children born of consanguineous marriage.
METHODS: In this case-control study, the medical records of unrelated consanguineous patients and unrelated nonconsanguineous (control) PCG patients seen at a single tertiary eye care facility were retrospectively reviewed. Those with a minimum of 5 years' follow-up were included. Data collected included age at presentation, corneal diameter, axial length, corneal haze at presentation and its persistence after surgery, need for repeat surgery, and final visual acuity.
RESULTS: A total of 130 PCG patients were included: 30 patients born of consanguineous marriage and 100 nonconsanguineous control patients. The median age of presentation for consanguineous cases was 3 months (range, 1-36) compared with 10 months (range, 2-24) for nonconsanguineous cases (P < 0.001). Mean corneal diameter for consanguineous cases was 13 ± 0.82 mm and for nonconsanguineous cases was 12.41mm ± 1.18 mm (P = 0.002). Consanguineous cases also had a significantly higher prevalence of corneal haze persisting after surgery (P < 0.001) and need for repeat IOP-lowering surgery (P = 0.039). The consanguineous group had 44 eyes (73%) with severe PCG compared with 69 (34.5%) in the nonconsanguineous group (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study cohort, children with PCG born of consanguineous parents were more severely affected at presentation compared with children born of nonconsanguineous parents; they also had poorer outcomes with IOP-lowering surgery independent of severity at presentation. It is however possible that a founder effect with consanguinity over multiple generations could account for our observations.

TI  - Biomechanics of skin grafts: effect of pattern size, spacing and orientation
AU  - Gupta, Vivek
AU  - Chanda, Arnab
T2  - Engineering Research Express
AB  - Skin graft expansion is the key to the treatment of severe burn injuries requiring skin transplantation. While high expansions have been claimed by a majority of graft manufacturers, the realistic expansions reported to date with skin grafts are much lower. To clarify this discrepancy, we attempted to understand the biomechanics of skin grafts through the study of common graft pattern sizes, spacing, and orientation, and their influence on mesh expansion and induced stress. A novel skin simulant material and additive manufacturing were employed to develop the skin graft models. Tensile testing experiments were conducted to study expansion and overall stresses, and a finite element model (FEM) was used to characterize the local trends. At low strains (i.e., <1), the mesh expansion ratio was reported to be below 1, which increased up to 1.93 at a high strain of 2. The pattern size and spacing were not observed to affect the expansion much (i.e., <10%). With a change in orientation, the expansion decreased across all graft models and strains. High localized induced stresses were reported for high strains, which varied with graft orientation. The novel observations highlight the achievable expansions without overstressing, with standard slit patterning in skin grafts. These findings will not only help achieve better mesh expansion outcomes in burn surgeries but also guide the development of novel graft patterns for enhanced expansion in the future.

TI  - Finite element analysis of a hybrid corrugated hip implant for stability and loading during gait phases
AU  - Gupta, Vivek
AU  - Chanda, Arnab
T2  - Biomedical Physics & Engineering Express
AB  - Implants used in total hip replacements (THR) exhibit high failure rates and up to a decade of operational life. These surgical failures could be mainly attributed to the improper positioning, post-surgical stability and loading, of the implants during different phases of the gait. Typically, revised surgeries are suggested within a few years of hip implantation, which requires multiple femoral drilling operations to remove an existing implant, and to install a new implant. The pain and trauma associated with such procedures are also challenging with the existing hip implants. In this work, we designed a novel corrugated hip implant with innovative dimensioning as per ASTM standards, and grooves for directed insertion and removal (using a single femoral drilling and positioning operation). Biocompatible titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) was chosen as the implant material, and the novel implant was placed into a femur model through a virtual surgery to study its stability and loading during a dynamic gait cycle. A detailed mesh convergence study was conducted to select a computationally accurate finite element (FE) mesh. Tight fit and frictional fit attachment conditions were simulated, and the gait induced displacements and stresses on the implant, cortical and cancellous bone sections were characterized. During walking, the implant encountered the maximum von-Mises stress of 254.97 MPa at the femoral head. The analyses indicated low micro-motions (i.e., approximately 7μm) between the femur and implant, low stresses at the implant and bone within elastic limits, and uniform stress distribution, which unlike existing hip implants, would be indispensable for bone growth and implant stability enhancement, and also for reducing implant wear.

AU  - Gupta, Vivek

AU  - Chanda, Arnab
T2  - Emerging Materials Research
AB  - Millions of burn injuries are reported every year, with severe cases needing skin graft implantation. To date, the highest achievable expansion produced by split-thickness skin grafting has been reported to be just three times, which is insufficient for covering large burn sites with limited donor site skin. In this work, the authors studied the expansion potential of skin grafts with rotating-triangle (RT)-shaped auxetic incision patterns, which are known to exhibit a highly negative Poisson’s effect. Ten two-layer skin graft models with RT angles varying from 0 to 135° were developed and tested under uniaxial and biaxial tensile loads. Poisson’s effect, meshing ratios (MRs) and induced stresses were quantified across all models and loads up to the ultimate tensile stress. Very high expansions (MR > 45), varying widely across uniaxial and biaxial loads and without rupture, were observed for low RT angles. However, for RT angles greater than 45°, the expansions significantly decreased, with the lowest MR reported at 135°. Beyond an RT angle of 90°, the induced stresses were very high, with potential for skin rupture. Such expansion potentials and stress estimations with skin grafts have not been reported previously and would be indispensable for initiating groundbreaking advances in burn surgery research.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the association of blood donor variables on the outcome of patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients who had cardiac surgery between January 2018 and December 2020. Blood donor characteristics such as age (≤ or >30 years), sex, and body mass index (BMI) (≤ or >25 kg/m2) were analyzed for association with patient outcomes (length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission). Sex matching was done as fully match, fully mismatch, and partial mismatch. Cox regression and Linear regression models were used to study the association with mortality and readmission, and LOS.
RESULTS: During the study period, 5788 patients had cardiac surgery; receiving a total of 20,348 red cell units. Of which, 522 (9%) died, 531 (9.2%) re-admitted and median LOS was 11 days (IQR 7-18). BMI >25 kg/m2 (β, 2.96; p = 0.000), female to male transfusion (partial mismatch: β, 4.42; p = 0.001; fully mismatch: β, 9.0; p = 0.02) negatively affected LOS. BMI >25 kg/m2 (HR, 2.07; p = 0.00) and partial mismatch transfusion to male patients (HR, 1.60; p = 0.01) increased mortality. Fully mismatch transfusion to female patients (HR, 1.24; p = 0.01) and partial mismatch to male patients (HR, 1.86; p = 0.01) increased readmission. No association of donor age on patient outcome was observed.
DISCUSSION: Blood donor sex, and BMI can influence mortality and LOS in cardiac surgery patients. The use of computer tools to match the patient's and donor's characteristics can assist to eliminate these types of adverse consequences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma is described as a primary open-angle glaucoma, with an age of onset before 40 years. These patients have a higher prevalence of myopia.
PURPOSE: We describe the phenotype of juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma in a patient with a rare variant in EFEMP1 gene, who was also detected to have Stickler syndrome(STL).
METHODS: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was undertaken in 40 unrelated families where the proband had juvenile onset open-angle glaucoma (JOAG).
RESULTS: Out of these, eight were autosomal dominant, while the rest did not have any other affected first-degree relative. Out of the 8 autosomal dominant JOAG families, MYOC mutations were detected in 3(37.5%) and LTBP2 in 1(12.5%). One family (12.5%) had a rare EFEMP1 sequence variant in both affected father and daughter. The daughter also had high myopia and a pathogenic COL11A1 sequence variant that led to a coincidental diagnosis of STL in her.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a rare association of EFEMP1 and COL11A1 sequence variants in a JOAG patient with STL. The study also reiterates the association of JOAG with EFEMP1, which should be looked for, especially in families with autosomal dominant JOAG.

T2  - World Journal of Cardiology
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need to evaluate the burden of cardiometabolic risk factors in young South Asian adults, who are not preselected for glycaemia.
AIM: To evaluate young North Indian men (aged 20-50 years) for burden of cardiometabolic risk factors, in relation to parameters of homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (oral disposition index [oDI]).
METHODS: Study participants were invited in a fasting state. Sociodemographic, anthropometric, and medical data were collected, and 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was performed with serum insulin and plasma glucose estimation at 0, 30, and 120 min. Participants were divided into quartiles for HOMA-IR and oDI (category 1: Best HOMA-IR/oDI quartile; category 3: Worst HOMA-IR/oDI quartile) and composite HOMA-IR/oDI phenotypes (phenotype 1: Best quartile for both HOMA-IR and oDI; phenotype 4: Worst quartile for both HOMA-IR and oDI) were derived.
RESULTS: We evaluated a total of 635 men at a mean (± SD) age of 33.9 ± 5.1 years and body mass index of 26.0 ± 3.9 kg/m2. Diabetes and prediabetes were present in 34 (5.4%) and 297 (46.8%) participants, respectively. Overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension were present in 388 (61.1%), 258 (40.6%), and 123 (19.4%) participants, respectively. The prevalence of dysglycaemia, metabolic syndrome, and hypertension was significantly higher in participants belonging to the worst HOMA-IR and oDI quartiles, either alone (category 3 vs 1) or in combination (phenotype 4 vs 1). The adjusted odds ratios for dysglycaemia (6.5 to 7.0-fold), hypertension (2.9 to 3.6-fold), and metabolic syndrome (4.0 to 12.2-fold) were significantly higher in individuals in the worst quartile of HOMA-IR and oDI (category 3), compared to those in the best quartile (category 1). The adjusted odds ratios further increased to 21.1, 5.6, and 13.7, respectively, in individuals with the worst, compared to the best composite HOMA-IR/oDI phenotypes (phenotype 4 vs 1).
CONCLUSION: The burden of cardiometabolic risk factors is high among young Asian Indian men. Our findings highlight the importance of using parameters of insulin resistance and beta-cell function in phenotyping individuals for cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to evaluate the differences in the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)-based glycemic parameters between women with normoglycemia and early gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) identified on the basis of mild fasting plasma glucose elevation (FPG, 5.1-5.5 mmol/L) and/or post-load plasma glucose elevation (PLG, 1-h ≥ 10.0 mmol/L or 2-h ≥ 8.5 mmol/L).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included women with singleton pregnancy (8+0 to 19+6 weeks of gestation) and normoglycemia or GDM per World Health Organization (WHO) 2013 criteria. We evaluated the glycemic parameters of clinical interest using blinded CGMS evaluation and reported them per standard methodology proposed by Hernandez et al. RESULTS: A total of 87 women (GDM, n = 38) were enrolled at 28.6 ± 4.5 years. Among women with GDM, 10 (26.3%) had isolated mild FPG elevation (5.1-5.5 mmol/L), 10 (26.3%) had isolated PLG elevation (1-h ≥ 10.0 mmol/L or 2-h ≥ 8.5 mmol/L), and 7 (18.4%) had a combination of both. The remaining 11 (28.9%) had elevated FPG (≥ 5.6 mmol/L) with or without PLG elevation. Thus, when an isolated FPG cutoff ≥ 5.6 mmol/L is used to diagnose GDM, 27 (71.0%) women would be perceived as normoglycemic. Such women had significantly higher CGMS parameters of clinical interest, such as 24-h mean glucose, fasting glucose, 1-h and 2-h postprandial glucose (PPG), 1-h PPG excursion, and peak PPG.
CONCLUSIONS: An isolated FPG threshold, especially the higher cutoff ≥ 5.6 mmol/L, can potentially miss a large proportion of women (nearly three-fourths) diagnosed with GDM per WHO 2013 criteria. Eventually, such women fare significantly differently from normoglycemic women in various CGMS parameters of clinical interest.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the differences in the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) profiles of women in early pregnancy stratified based on different HbA1c levels known to be predictive of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) at 24-28 weeks of gestation (≥ 5.2%) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (≥ 5.5%) in Indian women.
METHODS: We enrolled women at 8+ 0 to 19+ 6 weeks of gestation (early pregnancy), evaluated the glycaemic parameters of clinical interest using CGMS, and reported them per standard methodology proposed by Hernandez et al. WHO 2013 criteria were used for diagnosis of early GDM.
RESULTS: Ninety-six women were enrolled at 14.0 ± 3.2 weeks of gestation. Of these, 38 were found to have early GDM (diagnosed before 20 weeks of gestation) on evaluation. Of 96 women, 33 (34.4%) had HbA1c value ≥ 5.5% [11 (19.0%) with normoglycaemia and 22 (57.9%) with GDM]. The women with elevated HbA1c differed significantly from those with HbA1c < 5.5% for all evaluated parameters. The differences for overall women were > 10 mg/dl (0.56 mmol/l) for 1-h postprandial glucose (difference of 0.78 mmol/l), 2-h postprandial glucose (difference of 0.59 mmol/l), peak postprandial glucose (difference of 0.75 mmol/l), and 1-h postprandial glucose excursion (difference of 0.59 mmol/l). Of 58 women with normoglycaemia, 29 (50.0%) had an HbA1c value  ≥ 5.2%. In comparison, in the normoglycaemic group of women with and without HbA1c ≥ 5.2% (known to be predictive of future GDM), the results were significant for 1-h (difference of 0.44 mmol/l), 2-h (difference of 0.278 mmol/l), and peak postprandial glucose (difference of 0.35 mmol/l).
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that women with elevated HbA1c (≥ 5.5%) in early pregnancy significantly differ from those with HbA1c < 5.5% in all glycaemic parameters evaluated in this study, suggesting that HbA1c at this cut-off has a role to play in early pregnancy.

AB  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: We aimed to evaluate and compare continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)-based glycemic parameters in women in early pregnancy (<20 weeks of gestation) who were classified as: (i) gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG), but normoglycemia by alternate (UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Canadian Diabetes Association and Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India) criteria; and (ii) normoglycemia by both (IADPSG and alternate) criteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, eligible women underwent standard 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, followed by the placement of a CGMS. Glycemia-related parameters were calculated using the standard approach for CGMS data in pregnancy.
RESULTS: We enrolled 96 women at 14.0 ± 3.2 weeks of gestation. Of the women diagnosed as GDM by IADPSG criteria, 34.2%, 26.3% and 44.7% were classified as normoglycemic by UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, Canadian Diabetes Association and Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India criteria, respectively. Mean 1-h postprandial glucose and time above range were significantly higher in women who were GDM by IADPSG, but normoglycemia by Canadian Diabetes Association criteria, compared with women with normoglycemia using both criteria. Similarly, mean 1-h postprandial glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose, peak postprandial glucose, 1-h postprandial glucose excursion and time above range were significantly higher in women who were not identified as GDM by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence criteria. Finally, women missed by the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study group of India criteria had significantly higher mean 1-h postprandial glucose, 2-h postprandial glucose, peak postprandial glucose, postprandial glucose excursion, 24-h glucose and time above range parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: More than one-quarter of women diagnosed as GDM by IADPSG criteria are not identified by alternate criteria. Such women are significantly different from normoglycemic women in terms of several CGMS-based glycemic parameters of clinical significance.

AB  - Neglected traumatic cervical dislocation can be difficult to treat as such and more so if they are accompanied by an associated post traumatic syringomyelia (PTS). We present the case of a 55 year old gentleman who had a traumatic C6-C7 grade 2 listhesis which was neglected and presented 6 year later with 6 months history of neck pain, spastic quadriparesis and bowel bladder involvement. The patient was diagnosed with a PTS extending from C4 to D5. The possible aetiology and management of such cases has been discussed. The patient was successfully treated with decompression, adhesiolysis of arachnoid bands and syringotomy without the correction of deformity. The patient improved neurologically and had complete resolution of syrinx at final followup.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endobronchial administration of voriconazole is a potential therapeutic option for inoperable aspergilloma.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of endobronchial instillation of voriconazole for inoperable pulmonary aspergilloma.
METHOD: Patients with mild to moderate hemoptysis, due to inoperable aspergilloma, were randomized to receive either medical therapy (MT) alone or bronchoscopic instillation of voriconazole with MT and followed up till 3 months. The primary objective of this study was to compare the percentage of patients achieving reduction in the severity of hemoptysis assessed on visual analogue scale (VAS) in intervention and control arm at 3 months.
RESULTS: This study included 60 patients (female = 47) with mean (SD) age of 40.6 (13.2) years who were randomized to receive either bronchoscopic instillation of voriconazole (n = 30) or MT alone (n = 30). At 3-month follow-up, the primary objective was achieved in 26/30 (86.7%) patients in intervention group as compared to 11/30 (36.7%) in the control group (p value <0.0001). The VAS score at 3 months was significantly lower in voriconazole group 13.9 (9.3) mm as compared to MT alone group 22.3 (11.5) mm, p value of 0.003. Bronchoscopic instillation of voriconazole was also associated with reduction in cough severity and size of the aspergilloma; however, there was no benefit of this therapy in terms of requirement of hospitalization and BAE.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that for nonoperable aspergilloma, bronchoscopic instillation of voriconazole is associated with reduction in the severity of hemoptysis. This therapy should be evaluated in large multi-center trials.

AB  - Background
Better patient-ventilator interactions, during neurally adjusted ventilator assist (NAVA), are expected to result in lower rate of diaphragm dysfunction.
Objective
This study was planned to compare the rate of diaphragm dysfunction between the conventional modes of mechanical ventilation and NAVA.
Methods
Patients who were initiated on mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure were randomized to continue either conventional mode of mechanical ventilation or switched to NAVA. The rates of diaphragm dysfunction were compared between two groups.
Results
This study included 46 participants (male 30/46) with a mean age of 58 years. Mean APACHE II and SOFA scores were 15 and 3, respectively. The mean (SD) diaphragm thickness fraction in the conventional mechanical ventilation and NAVA group were 37.12% (18.48) and 39.27% (27.65), respectively. The diaphragm dysfunction was observed in 5 (22.7%) and 8 (34.7%) patients in NAVA and conventional arm, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups (p-value = 0.37). Diaphragm excursion was better in the NAVA group as compared with the conventional mechanical ventilation group. Diaphragm thickness and thickness fraction were comparable between two groups.
Conclusion
Switching from the conventional mode of mechanical ventilation to NAVA leads to statistically non-significant reduction in the occurrence of diaphragm dysfunction. Adequately powered studies are required to assess the exact role of NAVA on diaphragm functions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has an affinity for the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, which are present abundantly on the diaphragm. This study aims to describe temporal changes in diaphragmatic thickness and excursion using ultrasonography in subjects with acute COVID-19.
METHODS: This prospective observational study included adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past 48 hours. The diaphragm thickness at end-expiration (DTE), diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF), and diaphragm excursion during tidal breathing (DE) and maximal inspiration (DEmax) were measured using ultrasonography daily for 5 days. The changes in DTE, DTF, DE, and Demax from day 1 to day 5 were assessed.
RESULTS: This study included 64 adults (62.5% male) with a mean (SD) age of 50.2 (17.5) years. A majority (91%) of the participants had mild or moderate illness. The median (IQR) DTE, DTF (%), DE and Demax on day 1 were 2.2 (1.9, 3.0) mm, 21.5% (14.2, 31.0), 19.2 (16.5, 24.0) mm, and 26.7 (22.0, 30.2) mm, respectively. On day 5, there was a significant reduction in the DTE (p=0.002) with a median (IQR) percentage change of -15.7% (-21.0, 0.0). The DTF significantly increased on day 5 with a median (IQR) percentage change of 25.0% (-19.2, 98.4), p=0.03. There was no significant change in DE and Demax from day 1 to day 5, with a median (IQR) percentage change of 3.6% (-5.2, 15) and 0% (-6.7, 5.9), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Non-intubated patients with COVID-19 exhibited a temporal decline in diaphragm thickness with increase in thickening fraction over 5 days of hospital admission. Further research is warranted to assess the impact of COVID-19 pneumonia on diaphragmatic function.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As millions of people worldwide recover from COVID-19, a substantial proportion continue to have persistent symptoms, pulmonary function abnormalities, and radiological findings suggestive of post-COVID interstitial lung disease (ILD). To date, there is limited scientific evidence on the management of post-COVID ILD, necessitating a consensus-based approach.
AREAS COVERED: A panel of experts in pulmonology and thoracic radiology was constituted. Key questions regarding the management of post-COVID ILD were identified. A search was performed on PubMed and EMBASE and updated till 1 March 2022. The relevant literature regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of post-COVID ILD was summarized. Subsequently, suggestions regarding the management of these patients were framed, and a consensus was obtained using the Delphi approach. Those suggestions which were approved by over 80% of the panelists were accepted. The final document was approved by all panel members.
EXPERT OPINION: Dedicated facilities should be established for the care of patients with post-COVID ILD. Symptom screening, pulmonary function testing, and thoracic imaging have a role in the diagnosis. The pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic options for the management of post-COVID ILD are discussed. Further research into the pathophysiology and management of post-COVID ILD will improve our understanding of this condition.

AU  - Local Burden of Disease sub-Saharan Africa HIV Prevalence Collaborators
T2  - BMC medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA.
METHODS: We analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5 × 5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units.
RESULTS: We found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.
CONCLUSIONS: As the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.

T2  - Journal of Cardiac Critical Care TSS
AB  - Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is the implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) in a patient who experienced a sudden and unexpected pulseless condition attributable to cessation of cardiac mechanical activity. The aim of ECPR is to provide adequate perfusion to the end organs when the potentially “reversible” conditions were managed. ECPRs are mostly done in tertiary care center in India. There is little scope for out of hospital arrest as poor quality of CPR and response time exists with lack of awareness about ECPR, which hinders its wider usage even in IHCA. Emergency department doctors need to be involved to counsel, recognize candidates activate, and initiate ECPR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The vulnerability of female sex workers (FSWs) to HIV infection increases if unprotected heterosexual anal intercourse (HAI) is practiced.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of HAI among FSWs, and associated factors, and prevalence of consistent condom use (CCU) during HAI and associated factors.
METHODS: Analysis of cross-sectional data from nationwide biological and behavioural survey, conducted at 73 randomly selected domains with sample size of 27,000 in India.
RESULTS: A total of 25,932 FSWs were included in the analysis, after excluding 1075 (3.9%) FSWs for which the data were incomplete. The prevalence of HAI was 29.9% (95% CI, 29.3, 30.4); The CCU during HAI in the last one month was 58.9%. Younger age at the start of sex work, use of mobile phone/internet for soliciting client, home as a place of sex work, consumption of alcohol/drug, and physical violence against FSWs were associated with higher odds of HAI. Frequent contact with outreach workers, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, and older age at the start of sex work was associated with CCU.
CONCLUSION: Prevalence of HAI was high among FSW in India. The national program could target those factors that reduce the odds of HAI and/or promote CCU.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine if metabolic risk factors are associated with poor sleep quality and obstructive sleep apnea-like symptoms (OSA symptoms) independent of psychosocial problems and demographic and lifestyle factors in older Indian adults.
METHODOLOGY: We analyzed baseline data from adults (≥ 50 years) from a population-based cohort, the LoCARPoN study, in India. Variables were grouped as (a) demographic and lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity; (b) psychosocial problems including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress; and (c) metabolic risk factors including glycated hemoglobin, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, body mass index, and hypertension. Variables were examined as predictors of poor sleep quality and OSA symptoms. Groups of variables were added stepwise to a logistic regression. Variance explained by nested models was quantified using McFadden's pseudo R2, and change was formally tested with the log-likelihood ratio test.
RESULTS: Among 7505 adults, the prevalence of poor sleep quality was 16.9% (95% CI: 16.0, 17.7), and OSA symptoms were present in 7.0% (95% CI: 6.4, 7.6). Psychosocial problems had a strong independent association with both poor sleep quality (pseudo R2 increased from 0.10 to 0.15, p < 0.001) and more OSA symptoms (pseudo R2 increased from 0.08 to 0.10, p < 0.001). Metabolic risk factors had a modest independent association with sleep quality (pseudo R2 increased from 0.14 to 0.15, p < 0.01), but a strong association with OSA symptoms (pseudo R2 increased from 0.08 to 0.10, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Psychosocial and metabolic risk factors were independently associated with sleep quality and OSA symptoms. This fact implied that OSA symptoms may affect both mental health and physical health. Our findings have public health implications because the number and proportion of the elderly in India is increasing, while the prevalence of metabolic risk factors and psychosocial problems is high already. These facts have the potential to exacerbate not only the burden of sleep disorders and OSA symptoms but also associated cardiovascular and neurologic sequelae, further stretching the Indian health-care system.

AB  - Genetics and genomics play a role in the causation of various human diseases. A large number of human reproductive disorders also arise as a result of genetic and genomic abnormalities. Reproductive disorders associated with predominantly genetics and genomic abnormalities are infertility, early pregnancy loss, congenital malformations, difference or disorder of sex development and reproductive cancers. The genetic etiology of human reproductive disorders is increasing with improved molecular biology techniques such as DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing.
Infertility is one of the significant areas of reproductive disorders where genetics/genomics plays a substantial role and may result from chromosomal, copy number variation, Yq &amp; pseudo autosomal region microdeletion/microduplication, gene mutation (monogenic, oligogenic, polygenic), multifactorial, epigenetic, mitochondrial, etc. abnormalities. All idiopathic infertile couples should be screened for genetic disorders before assisted reproduction to prevent transmission, if any, in offspring. Pregnancy wastage in early pregnancy is very high (about 70%) and is mainly related to chromosome number, copy number variation, and some monogenic or epigenetic abnormalities. Therefore, all early pregnancy loss cases should also be tested for genetic causes. Congenital malformations are structural defects in embryo, fetus, or newborns and affect about 3% (major malformations) of all births. The malformations could be due to the abnormalities of chromosomes, copy number variation, monogenic, oligogenic, multifactorial, or environmental. Array CGH &amp;/or NGS should be used as the first step to screen congenital malformations. Differences/disorder of sex development is a developmental defect in which the determination and/or differentiation of chromosomal, gonadal, or phenotypic/anatomic sex is abnormal. It is a common disorder and is primarily related to genetic abnormalities. Therefore, a precise diagnosis, mainly through an array CGH and/or NGS, is crucial for the proper management to prevent future psychosexual problems and another birth with the disorder. Cancer is a genomic disorder characterized by genomic instability (due to a defect in DNA repair mechanism), uncontrolled replication (due to lack of response to inhibitory factors/loss of contact inhibition), neo-angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. All cancer cases should be investigated for genomic markers (both hereditary and somatic) for precise diagnosis, prognosis, and genetic counseling. In this review, we will try to evaluate the role of genetics and genomics in the above-mentioned reproductive disorders, along with genetic &amp; genomic techniques used and reproductive counseling in addition to our experiences. &nbsp;

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infections including tuberculosis (TB) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). We systematically reviewed the prevalence of mycobacterial infections in patients with IIM.
METHODS: We screened PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases and conference abstracts (2015-20) for original articles using Covidence. Pooled estimates of prevalence were calculated.
RESULTS: Of 83 studies (28 cohort studies, two case control and 53 case reports), 19 were analysed. Of 14 043 IIM patients, DM (54.41%) was the most common subset among TB. Most studies were from Asia with high prevalence (5.86%, 2.33%-10.60%). Pooled prevalence of mycobacterial infections among IIM was 3.58% (95% CI: 2.17%, 5.85%, P < 0.01). Disseminated and extrapulmonary forms (46.58%; 95% CI: 39.02%, 54.31%, P = 1.00) were as common as pulmonary TB (49.07%; 95% CI: 41.43%, 56.75%, P =0.99) both for I2=0. Muscle involvement, an otherwise rare site, was frequently seen in case reports (24.14%). M. tuberculosis (28.84%) was the most common pathogen followed by Mycobacterium avium complex (3.25%). Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were less common overall (6.25; 95% CI: 3.49%, 10.93%) I2=0, P =0.94. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression based on high vs low TB regions found prevalence 6.61% (2.96%, 11.33%) in high TB regions vs 2.05% (0.90%, 3.56%) in low TB regions. While death due to TB was occasionally reported (P =0.82), successful anti-tubercular treatment was common (13.95%).
CONCLUSION: TB is common in IIM, particularly in endemic regions though current data is largely heterogeneous. Extra-pulmonary forms and atypical sites including the muscle are frequent. Limited data suggests fair outcomes, although larger prospective studies may offer better understanding.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: End points to determine the efficacy and safety of medical therapies for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are evolving. Given the heterogeneity in current outcome measures, harmonizing end points in a core outcome set for randomized controlled trials is a priority for drug development in inflammatory bowel disease.
METHODS: Candidate outcome domains and outcome measures were generated from systematic literature reviews and patient engagement surveys and interviews. An iterative Delphi process was conducted to establish consensus: panelists anonymously voted on items using a 9-point Likert scale, and feedback was incorporated between rounds to refine statements. Consensus meetings were held to ratify the outcome domains and core outcome measures. Stakeholders were recruited internationally, and included gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, methodologists, and clinical trialists.
RESULTS: A total of 235 patients and 53 experts participated. Patient-reported outcomes, quality of life, endoscopy, biomarkers, and safety were considered core domains; histopathology was an additional domain for UC. In CD, there was consensus to use the 2-item patient-reported outcome (ie, abdominal pain and stool frequency), Crohn's Disease Activity Index, Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease, C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and co-primary end points of symptomatic remission and endoscopic response. In UC, there was consensus to use the 9-point Mayo Clinic Score, fecal urgency, Robarts Histopathology Index or Geboes Score, fecal calprotectin, and a composite primary end point including both symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Safety outcomes should be reported using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.
CONCLUSIONS: This multidisciplinary collaboration involving patients and clinical experts has produced the first core outcome set that can be applied to randomized controlled trials of CD and UC.

AB  - The increase of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens has created challenges in treatment and warranted the design of antibiotics against comparatively less exploited targets. The peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis delineates unique pathways for the design and development of a novel class of drugs. Mur ligases are an essential component of bacterial cell wall synthesis that play a pivotal role in PG biosynthesis to maintain internal osmotic pressure and cell shape. Inhibition of these enzymes can interrupt bacterial replication and hence, form attractive targets for drug discovery. In the present work, we focused on the PG biosynthesis pathway enzyme, UDP-N-acetylpyruvylglucosamine reductase, from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (stMurB). Biophysical characterization of purified StMurB was performed to gauge the molecular interactions and estimate thermodynamic stability for determination of attributes for possible therapeutic intervention. The thermal melting profile of MurB was monitored by circular dichroism and validated through differential scanning calorimetry experiment. Frequently used chemical denaturants, GdmCl and urea, were employed to study the chemical-induced denaturation of stMurB. In the search for natural compound-based inhibitors, against this important drug target, an in silico virtual screening based investigation was conducted with modeled stMurB structure. The three top hits (quercetin, berberine, and scopoletin) returned were validated for complex stability through molecular dynamics simulation. Further, fluorescence binding studies were undertaken for the selected natural compounds with stMurB alone and with NADPH bound form. The compounds scopoletin and berberine, displayed lesser binding to stMurB whereas quercetin exhibited stronger binding affinity than NADPH. This study suggests that quercetin can be evolved as an inhibitor of stMurB enzyme.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The presence of gastric content increases the risk of aspiration during general anesthesia. Diabetic patients have delayed gastric emptying; however, despite adequate fasting because of diabetic gastroparesis these patients have a high risk of aspiration. This study aimed to compare ultrasound-guided measurement of residual gastric volume between diabetic and non-diabetic patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia.
METHODS: This prospective observational study included 80 patients divided into two groups of 40 diabetic patients with a minimum of 8 years history of diabetes and 40 nondiabetic patients aged >18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I-II kept with similar fasting intervals. Before induction of general anesthesia, gastric ultrasound was performed using standard gastric scanning protocol to measure craniocaudal (CC) and anteroposterior (AP) diameters followed by calculation of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and gastric volume in semi-sitting (SS) and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position using curved array probe. The gastric antrum volume (GV) was classified as Grade 0, 1, or 2, and risk stratification for aspiration was done. The nasogastric tube was inserted after induction of anesthesia to aspirate and compare the gastric content.
RESULTS: In the semi-sitting position, the mean CC and AP diameters were 16.38 ± 3.31 mm and 10.1 ± 2.53 mm in the non-diabetic group and 25.19 ± 4.08 mm and 15.8 ± 3.51 mm in the diabetic group, respectively. In RLD, CC was 1.91 ± 0.38 cm and AP was 1.19 ± 0.34 cm in the non-diabetic group as compared to the CC of 2.78 ± 0.4 cm and AP of 1.81 ± 0.39 cm in the diabetic group. The calculated CSA of 318.23 ± 97.14 mm2 and 4 ± 1.1 cm2 in diabetic were significantly higher than 133.12 ± 58.56 mm2 and 1.83 ± 0.83 cm2 of non-diabetic, in SS (p < 0.0001) and RLD (p < 0.0001) positions, respectively. The GV of 15.48 ± 11.18 ml in the diabetic group was significantly higher than (-) 9.77 ± 18.56 ml in the non-diabetic group (p < 0.0001). Despite the differences in CSA and GV between diabetic and non-diabetic groups, both groups showed a low gastric residual volume (<1.5 ml/kg). The gastric tube aspirate in the non-diabetic and diabetic groups was 0.3 ± 0.78 ml and 1.24 ± 1.46 ml, respectively, and was statistically significant (p = 0.0006).
CONCLUSION: Patients with long-standing diabetes showed higher gastric residual and antral CSA when compared with non-diabetic patients. The clinical significance of these findings needs further evidence for the formulation of specific guidelines for diabetic patients.

AB  - AIMS: Limited data on the uptake of guideline-directed medical therapies (GDMTs) and the mortality of acute decompensated HF (ADHF) patients are available from India. The National Heart Failure Registry (NHFR) aimed to assess clinical presentation, practice patterns, and the mortality of ADHF patients in India.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The NHFR is a facility-based, multi-centre clinical registry of consecutive ADHF patients with prospective follow-up. Fifty three tertiary care hospitals in 21 states in India participated in the NHFR. All consecutive ADHF patients who satisfied the European Society of Cardiology criteria were enrolled in the registry. All-cause mortality at 90 days was the main outcome measure. In total, 10 851 consecutive patients were recruited (mean age: 59.9 years, 31% women). Ischaemic heart disease was the predominant aetiology for HF (72%), followed by dilated cardiomyopathy (18%). Isolated right HF was noted in 62 (0.6%) participants. In eligible HF patients, 47.5% received GDMT. The 90 day mortality was 14.2% (14.9% and 13.9% in women and men, respectively) with a re-admission rate of 8.4%. An inverse relationship between educational class based on years of education and 90 day mortality (high mortality in the lowest educational class) was observed in the study population. Patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with mildly reduced ejection fraction who did not receive GDMT experienced higher mortality (log-rank P < 0.001) than those who received GDMT. Baseline educational class, body mass index, New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, dependent oedema, serum creatinine, QRS > 120 ms, atrial fibrillation, mitral regurgitation, haemoglobin levels, serum sodium, and GDMT independently predicted 90 day mortality.
CONCLUSION: One of seven ADHF patients in the NHFR died during the first 90 days of follow-up. One of two patients received GDMT. Adherence to GDMT improved survival in HF patients with reduced and mildly reduced ejection fractions. Our findings call for innovative quality improvement initiatives to improve the uptake of GDMT among HF patients in India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biomarkers to predict the risk of disease recurrence in Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients are urgently needed to improve treatment. We developed proteins expression-based risk model to predict recurrence free survival for ESCC patients.
METHODS: Alterations in Wnt pathway components expression and subcellular localization were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 80 ESCCs, 61 esophageal dysplastic and 47 normal tissues; correlated with clinicopathological parameters and clinical outcome over 86 months by survival analysis. Significant prognostic factors were identified by multivariable Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: Biomarker signature score based on cytoplasmic β-catenin, nuclear c-Myc, nuclear DVL and membrane α-catenin was associated with recurrence free survival [Hazard ratio = 1.11 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.17), p < 0.001, C-index = 0.68] and added significant prognostic value over clinical parameters (p < 0.001). The inclusion of Slug further improved prognostic utility (p < 0.001, C-index = 0.71). Biomarker Signature Scoreslug improved risk classification abilities for clinical outcomes at 3 years, accurately predicting recurrence in 79% patients in 1 year and 97% in 3 years in high risk group; 73% patients within low risk group did not have recurrence in 1 year, with AUC of 0.76.
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive risk model predictive for recurrence allowed us to determine the robustness of our biomarker panel in stratification of ESCC patients at high or low risk of disease recurrence; high risk patients are stratified for more rigorous personalized treatment while the low risk patients may be spared from harmful side effects of toxic therapy.

AB  - Pain, a physiological protective mechanism, turns into a complex dynamic neural response when it becomes chronic. The role of neuroplastic brain changes is more evident than the peripheral factors in the maintenance, modulation and amplification of chronic low back pain (cLBP). In this background, we summarise the brain changes in cLBP in a coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Databases ('PubMed', 'Scopus' and 'Sleuth') were searched till May 2022 and the activity pattern was noted under the 'without stimulation' and 'with stimulation' groups. A total of 312 studies were selected after removing duplicates. Seventeen (553 cLBP patients, 192 activation foci) studies were fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included in the 'without stimulation' group. Twelve statistically significant clusters are localized in the prefrontal cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor cortex, parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus amygdala, occipital lobe, temporal lobe and associated white matter in this group. Ten studies (353 cLBP patients, 125 activation foci) were selected in the' with stimulation' groups. In this group, seven statistically significant clusters were found in the frontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, premotor cortex, parietal cortex, claustrum and insula. These statistically significant clusters indicate a probable imbalance in GABAergic modulation of brain circuits and dysfunction in the descending pain modulation system. This disparity in the pain neuro-matrix is the source of spontaneous and persisting pain in cLBP.

AB  - A mass or a tumor may not always be an underlying cause for a clinically apparent swelling. A wide range of myotendinous disorders can present as pseudomasses. These include muscle/myofascial hernia, tendon tears, benign hypertrophy, accessory muscles, tendon xanthomas, diffuse myositis, and exertional compartment syndromes. We have briefly reviewed these lesions highlighting their typical radiological findings and have also highlighted the role of different imaging modalities and the role of dynamic imaging. Although rare, radiologists should be aware of these entities to avoid mislabeling a pseudomass as a mass or malignancy and to detect the abnormality in not-so-apparent masses.

AB  - PURPOSE: Neuroblastoma (NB) is childhood's most common extracranial solid malignancy. We have compared two imaging modalities, 131I-MIBG and 18F-DOPA PET/CT, to evaluate NB. Also, feasibility of the application of standardised scoring systems, SIOPEN and Curie scoring systems, in 18F-DOPA PET/CT was explored.
METHODS: Patients with histopathology-proven NB underwent 131I-MIBG (planar and SPECT/CT) and 18F-DOPA PET/CT scans, as per standard imaging protocols. Duration between scans ranged from 1 to 30 days (median = 8 days). Number of lesions in Curie and SIOPEN scoring systems applied on both modalities was compared.
RESULTS: Forty-six patients were included (M:F = 29:17) with a median age of 36 months. Both 131I-MIBG and 18F-DOPA scans were positive in 39 patients and negative in four patients. 18F-DOPA PET/CT was positive in additional three patients, in which 131I-MIBG was negative (p = 0.25). Overall, 18F-DOPA identified significantly greater number of lesions than 131I-MIBG, especially metastatic skeletal lesions (p < 0.05). Significant difference was observed between Curie scores in the two modalities, unlike SIOPEN scores. However, when the cut-off age of 18 months was taken, no significant difference was seen in either of the scoring systems in both the scans (p > 0.05). CS and SIOPEN scores were significantly higher in bone marrow-positive patients.
CONCLUSION: 18F-DOPA PET/CT detected more lesions than 131I-MIBG but had little impact on staging of the disease. For evaluation of NB, both scans can be used interchangeably as per the availability. Furthermore, both SIOPEN and Curie scoring systems, standardised for MIBG, can also be used to semi-quantify disease extent in 18F-DOPA PET/CT.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for 0.9% of cancer diagnoses, and incidence and mortality rate have increased in previous years. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-computed tomography (CT) is an established modality for MM evaluation. MR imaging is helpful where 18F-FDG PET-CT is lacking. To standardize PET reporting, methods like Italian Myeloma Criteria for PET Use and Deauville criteria have been studied. Tracers like 11C-acetate and 11C-choline/18F-fluoromethylcholine (FCH) have shown higher sensitivity and detected more focal lesions and diffuse involvement than 18F-FDG PET-CT. 18F-FCH showed higher maximum standardized uptake value than 18FDG. 11C-methionine appears to be the best radiopharmaceutical, apart from 18F-FDG, for evaluating MM.

AB  - In early stages of breast cancer, breast conservation therapy (BCT) with lumpectomy and adjuvant irradiation is preferred. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is considered as an alternative to whole breast irradiation. The reasons are it requires less number of irradiation fractions, shorter treatment time, and decreased size of irradiation. The procedure includes insertion of several brachycatheters, which is associated with significant pain in the postoperative period. We report case series of 8 patients of APBI where perioperative pain management was done using ultrasound (USG)-guided serratus anterior plane (SAP) block with catheter insertion. The catheter was placed between the serratus anterior muscle and external intercostal muscle. The drug used was 0.4 mL.kg-1 of 0.375% Ropivacaine with a maximum value of 30 mL. On the day of the procedure, all patients were given two boluses of ropivacaine 20 mL each at an interval of 6 h. From the next day onward, they received ropivacaine boluses on demand basis when Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was >4. There were no complications during the procedure. None of the patients required extra fentanyl boluses intraoperatively. One patient did not have an SAP catheter inserted during primary insertion, as she failed to give consent for block. On repositioning of catheters, she experienced severe pain with a NRS of 8/10. After obtaining proper consent, SAP catheter was inserted and she had NRS of 1/10 postoperatively. 2/8 patients received rescue analgesics in the form of diclofenac. 7/8 SAP catheters were removed on day 5. Only one SAP catheter was removed accidentally on day 3. It was concluded that USG-guided SAP catheters are a novel, safe, and effective regional anesthesia technique for perioperative pain management in breast cancer surgeries undergoing APBI.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an understudied pathogen that causes infection through fecal contaminated drinking water and is prominently found in South Asian countries. The virus affects ~20 million people annually, leading to ~60,000 infections per year. The positive-stranded RNA genome of the HEV genotype 1 has four conserved open reading frames (ORFs), of which ORF1 encodes a polyprotein of 180 kDa in size, which is processed into four non-structural enzymes: methyltransferase (MTase), papain-like cysteine protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and RNA helicase. MTase is known to methylate guanosine triphosphate at the 5'-end of viral RNA, thereby preventing its degradation by host nucleases. In the present study, we cloned, expressed, and purified MTase spanning 33-353 amino acids of HEV genotype 1. The activity of the purified enzyme and the conformational changes were established through biochemical and biophysical studies. The binding affinity of MTase with magnesium ions (Mg2+) was studied by isothermal calorimetry (ITC), microscale thermophoresis (MST), far-UV CD analysis and, fluorescence quenching. In summary, a short stretch of nucleotides has been cloned, coding for the HEV MTase of 37 kDa, which binds Mg2+ and modulate its activity. The chelation of magnesium reversed the changes, confirming its role in enzyme activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing guidelines for managing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), evidence-based treatments are still scarce and large-scale studies on the provision and impact of specific rehabilitation services are needed. This study aimed to describe the provision of rehabilitation to patients after complicated and uncomplicated mTBI and investigate factors associated with functional outcome, symptom burden, and TBI-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) up to six months after injury.
METHODS: Patients (n = 1379) with mTBI from the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) study who reported whether they received rehabilitation services during the first six months post-injury and who participated in outcome assessments were included. Functional outcome was measured with the Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE), symptom burden with the Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ), and HRQOL with the Quality of Life after Brain Injury - Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS). We examined whether transition of care (TOC) pathways, receiving rehabilitation services, sociodemographic (incl. geographic), premorbid, and injury-related factors were associated with outcomes using regression models. For easy comparison, we estimated ordinal regression models for all outcomes where the scores were classified based on quantiles.
RESULTS: Overall, 43% of patients with complicated and 20% with uncomplicated mTBI reported receiving rehabilitation services, primarily in physical and cognitive domains. Patients with complicated mTBI had lower functional level, higher symptom burden, and lower HRQOL compared to uncomplicated mTBI. Rehabilitation services at three or six months and a higher number of TOC were associated with unfavorable outcomes in all models, in addition to pre-morbid psychiatric problems. Being male and having more than 13 years of education was associated with more favorable outcomes. Sustaining major trauma was associated with unfavorable GOSE outcome, whereas living in Southern and Eastern European regions was associated with lower HRQOL.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with complicated mTBI reported more unfavorable outcomes and received rehabilitation services more frequently. Receiving rehabilitation services and higher number of care transitions were indicators of injury severity and associated with unfavorable outcomes. The findings should be interpreted carefully and validated in future studies as we applied a novel analytic approach.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Some studies have found an association of incidence of aneurysmal Sub arachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) seasonal variations and weather patterns but others have refuted this. With conflicting reports in the literature, we tried to find out whether climatic conditions influence the incidence of aSAH.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective single centre study involving patients with aSAH operated in a tertiary care hospital over one calendar year. Meteorological parameters like temperature, barometric pressure, humidity and sunshine hours were noted for 2 consecutive days prior to the ictus and on the day of ictus.
RESULTS: 392 patients of aSAH who underwent clipping were enrolled. There was no significant difference in the incidence of aSAH across various seasons (p > 0.05). Pre ictus fall in temperature lead to a surge in number of cases. 241 patients (61.5%) reported were from geographical areas which had experienced a fall in temperature over preceding 2 days, with a mean fall in temperature of 1.1(SD 2.1) degree celsius (p less then 0.05). The incidence of aSAH patients in low sunshine hour seasons (1.13 patients/day) was significantly more than that in higher sunshine hour seasons (0.9 patients/day) (p less than 0.05 ).
CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal variation had no direct bearing on the incidence of aSAH. Pre ictus fall in temperature lead to a rise in number of cases. Also, higher incidence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage was seen in lower sunshine hour seasons.

AB  - BACKGROUND: N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFR) are used by health care workers for prevention of airborne infection, and its use has increased manifolds during COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged use may result in carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation, affect hemodynamics, and blood gas values. Although arterial blood gas values accurately measure the blood CO2 levels, venous blood gas values also show acceptable correlation.
AIM: To evaluate the physiological impact of N95 FFRs on health care workers, including hemodynamic changes and venous blood levels of CO2 during a period of 6 h.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective observational study in a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: The study was conducted on 30 health care workers who performed routine duties while wearing N95 FFR. Venous blood gas values (CO2, pH, and bicarbonate) and vitals (respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and saturation) were noted at baseline, 2 (T2), and 6 h (T6) after wearing the mask. Discomfort level was also measured on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) of 1-10.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Repeated measures analysis was done using repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman's test. Group comparisons for continuously distributed data were made using independent sample "t" test or Wilcoxon test.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic and blood gas values did not change over time. The VAS for discomfort because of respirator use was 1.33 (1.42) at T2 and 2.77 (1.91) at T6. This was a significant increase in discomfort over time (P = 0.001). About 80% of participants experienced discomfort during this period. N95 FFR did not lead to significant alteration in hemodynamics or change in blood gas values after 6 h of continuous usage. However, discomfort significantly increased over time.

AB  - FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) promotes glioblastoma (GBM) by promoting protumorigenic inflammatory cytokine expression in tumor cells. However, tumors also have an immunosuppressive microenvironment maintained by mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-β cytokines. Here, we have studied the role of FAT1 in tumor immune suppression. Our preliminary TIMER2.0 analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database revealed an inverse correlation of FAT1 expression with infiltration of tumor-inhibiting immune cells (such as monocytes and T cells) and a positive correlation with tumor-promoting immune cells [such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)] in various cancers. We have analyzed the role of FAT1 in modulating the expression of TGF-β1/2 in resected human gliomas, primary glioma cultures, and other cancer cell lines (U87MG, HepG2, Panc-1, and HeLa). Positive correlations of gene expression of FAT1 and TGF-β1/2 were observed in various cancers in TCGA, Glioma Longitudinal Analysis Consortium (GLASS), and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases. Positive expression correlations of FAT1 were also found with TGF-β1/2 and Serpine1 (downstream target) in fresh-frozen GBM samples using q-PCR. siRNA-mediated FAT1 knockdown in cancer cell lines and in primary cultures led to decreased TGF-β1/2 expression/secretion as assessed by q-PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA. There was increased chemotaxis (transmigration) of THP-1 monocytes toward siFAT1-transfected tumor cell supernatant as a consequence of decreased TGF-β1/2 secretion. Reduced TGF-β1 expression was also observed in THP-1 cultured in conditioned media from FAT1-depleted glioma cells, thus contributing to immune suppression. In U87MG cells, decreased TGF-β1 upon FAT1 knockdown was mediated by miR-663a, a known modulator. FAT1 expression was also observed to correlate positively with the expression of surrogate markers of MDSCs [programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), PD-L2, and interleukin (IL)-10] in glioma tumors, suggesting a potential role of FAT1 in MDSC-mediated immunosuppression. Hence, our findings elaborate contributions of FAT1 to immune evasion, where FAT1 enables an immunosuppressive microenvironment in GBM and other cancers via TGF-β1/2.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The small cell variant is a relatively uncommon but aggressive form of lung cancer. The present study aims to analyse the clinical characteristics, treatment outcomes and prognostic factors of an ambispectively enrolled large cohort of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the Indian population over a decade-long period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed with SCLC between 2008 and 2020 at a tertiary care lung cancer clinic were included. The clinical details, demographics, details of investigations, treatment and survival outcomes were recorded and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 361 patients were included. The majority were males (86.4%) with a mean (SD) age of 57.3 (12.3) years. Further, 34.9% were current smokers, with the median smoking index being 520 (interquartile range [IQR]: 260-1000). The majority had good performance status, that is, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale (ECOG) 0 or 1 (65%), and Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) ≥70 (85.9%). Also, 73.3% had extensive stage disease. The median time from symptom onset to definitive diagnosis was 91 days. Treatment details were available for 179 patients: chemotherapy only (n = 128), combined chemo-radiotherapy (n = 41) and radiotherapy only (n = 10). The median (IQR) progression-free survival (PFS) was 182 (94 to 306) days and the median (IQR) overall survival (OS) was 205 (94 to 429) days. On univariate analysis, factors that significantly affected survival included smoking index and performance status. However, on multivariate analysis, only the performance status significantly affected PFS, whereas none of these factors were significant for OS.
CONCLUSIONS: SCLC predominantly affects males with a heavy smoking index. The diagnosis is usually made late; survival remains poor and is predominantly affected by the performance status.

AB  - AIM: Globally, the incidence of lung cancer amongst women appears to be increasing. We aimed to compare the socio-epidemiological and clinical characteristics of lung cancer amongst men and women from a large cohort at a tertiary care hospital in Northern India.
METHODS: Records of patients diagnosed with lung cancer between January 2008 and March 2020 were reviewed. Baseline epidemiological data, clinical characteristics, histologic profiles, treatment administered, and survival were compared between males and females.
RESULTS: A total of 2054 male and 438 female patients were included in analysis. Compared to males, female patients were younger [median age, 56 vs. 60 years, P < 0.001)], less likely to be working, less educated beyond secondary level and less likely to be smokers (29.1% vs. 84.9%, P < 0.0001). No difference in baseline performance status was observed. Females were more frequently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma (54.2% vs. 30.2%, P = <0.0001), stage IV disease (70.8% vs. 63%, P = 0.001), and had higher rate of EGFR mutation (37.2% vs. 21.5%, P < 0.0001). There was no difference in the proportion of females receiving cancer-specific therapy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model revealed higher progression-free survival [median 9.17 vs. 7.23 months; P = 0.007] and overall survival [median 13.80 vs. 9.10 months respectively, P = 0.001] amongst females compared to males.
CONCLUSION: Amongst a large cohort of lung cancer, females demonstrated several distinct and characteristic demographics as well as disease-related features, especially better survival outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is associated with high short-term mortality. There is a paucity of data about the spectrum of neuroimaging abnormalities in the brain in ACLF patients. The present study was aimed to study the prevalence of cerebral edema and other parenchymal changes in MR imaging of the brain in patients with ACLF.
METHODS: In this prospective observational study, MR imaging was done in patients with ACLF (n = 41), and findings were compared with age and sex-matched patients with acute decompensation (AD) (n = 13) and those with cirrhosis but without any decompensation at recruitment (n = 21).
RESULTS: Forty-one patients with ACLF (24.4% Grade 1 and Grade 2, 51.2% Grade 3) with 14 (34.1%) having cerebral failure were included in the study. T2-weighted (T2W) diffuse white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and focal WMHs were seen in 17 (41.4%) and 7 (17%) patients, respectively. T1W basal ganglia hyperintensities in 20 (48.7%), cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in 6 (14.6%), and 2 (4.8%) patients had cerebral edema. In patients with AD, T2W diffuse WMHs were seen in 3 (23%), T2W focal WMHs in 3 (23%) patients. None of the patients with AD had cerebral edema or CMBs. In compensated cirrhosis patients, T2W diffuse WMHs were present in 7 (33.3%), T2W focal WMHs in 5 (23.8%), while 3 (14.2%) patients had CMBs. T1 weighted hyperintensities in basal ganglia were more common in AD [9 (69.2%)] and compensated cirrhosis [15 (71.4%)] as compared to ACLF patients [20 (48.7%)], P = 0.174. The survival time of 30 and 90 days for patients with diffuse T2W WMHs was significantly lesser than patients without T2W WMHs (P = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: Cerebral edema is uncommon in ACLF patients, and T2-weighted diffuse white matter hyperintensities may be associated with worse outcomes. However, due to the limited scope of the present study, the same needs to be explored further in larger cohorts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: People from all over the world have been affected by the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The lockdown during the pandemic has impacted the lifestyle of most of the population. The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of COVID lockdown-1 and lockdown-2 on the lifestyle of the obese Indian population.
METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown on obese adults. A well-structured questionnaire was developed and administered among the study population. The study was conducted in two phases (lockdown-1 and lockdown-2). A total of 390 subjects were included in the study (260 subjects in the lockdown-1 phase and 130 subjects in the lockdown-2 phase). Data on diet, sleep, stress, and physical activity were obtained and analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean age of the participants of phase-1 in the study was 41.7 ± 10.2 years and the participants of phase-2 were 44.5 ± 9.2 years. Statistically significant differences were observed between lockdown-1 and lockdown-2 in terms of monitoring of weight and other comorbid conditions, changes in the consumption of refined flour and processed foods, sugar and sugar-sweetened foods, oils and ghee, duration of physical activity, changes in the duration of sleep, and the stress levels related to COVID-19 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The impact of the lockdowns on health was very significant and different areas of lifestyle were affected in both the lockdowns. Weight gain was reported in both phases of the lockdown. The monitoring of health parameters, eating frequency, diet, and stress levels were affected during lockdown-1, whereas during lockdown-2, sleep duration and physical activity were affected. A comprehensive lifestyle modification plan is required to be developed to avoid these effects in the future.

AB  - Intracapsular fractures of the proximal femur are one of the most common fractures of the lower limbs. Most cases require osteosynthesis with suitable implants, and intraoperative positioning of the patient on the fracture table is a prerequisite to facilitate fracture manipulation, traction, reduction and fluoroscopy assessment. However, positioning the limbs of bilateral above-knee amputees for internal fixation of related proximal femoral fractures is a difficult task, which requires customized inventory for effective limb positioning and fracture manipulation. This study reported a rare case following a crush injury of bilateral lower limb in a road traffic accident, and described some technical tips of acute femoral neck fractures in bilateral above-knee amputation. The patient was managed with immediate guillotine amputation and later secondary wound closure followed by internal fixation of the right-sided femoral neck fracture with multiple cancellous cannulated screws.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in muscle thickness and echogenicity, reflecting muscle bulk and quality, respectively, of quadriceps femoris (QF), in critically ill children.
METHODS: This study was done on 58 children aged 1-18 y requiring mechanical ventilation, admitted in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital from January 2018 to June 2019. QF thickness was measured twice in longitudinal plane and twice in transverse plane, and an average of these four measurements was used. Muscle quality was assessed using ImageJ software to determine the mean echogenicity, and was calculated separately for vastus intermedius and rectus femoris. These observations were repeated on day 3 and day 7 of the ICU stay.
RESULTS: The median muscle thickness of QF was 1.58 cm, and vastus intermedius and rectus femoris echogenicity was 35.5 and 25.88 units, respectively in the present cohort, with median age of 6 y. Only 36 of the 58 patients underwent day 7 ultrasonography, as the remainder were either extubated or died. There was no significant change in the muscle thickness over 7 d. Rectus femoris echogenicity increased significantly over 7 d by 16.1% (p = 0.03). Baseline vastus intermedius echogenicity was significantly higher in patients who subsequently died during the course of their illness (p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: There was a significant change in rectus femoris echogenicity, but not in QF thickness. Echogenicity rather than muscle thickness may be a more sensitive marker for changes in muscle properties.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to evaluate the association of the Myocardial Performance Index (MPI) and Cerebro-Placental Ratio (CPR) in predicting adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses who are appropriately-grown (AGA), small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and growth restricted (FGR).
METHODS: Singleton pregnancies were recruited after 24 weeks. The patients were recruited after having been classified as AGA (AC/EFW > 10th centile), SGA (AC/EFW-3rd-10th centile without doppler abnormalities), and FGR (AC/EFW < 3rd centile or 3rd-10th centile with doppler abnormalities). A total of 103 cases comprising 48 AGA, 11 SGA, and 44 FGRfetuses were recruited. The Pulsatility Index of the Umbilical artery, Middle cerebral artery, Ductus Venosus, and Aortic Isthmus was obtained. MPI and CPR were calculated too. The primary outcome was to evaluate the predictive value of MPI and CPR for the composite adverse perinatal outcome.
RESULTS: The mean gestational age of recruitment was 30 weeks. The OR for Composite Adverse Perinatal Outcome in FGR group for MPI > .47 and CPR < 1.67 was 3.48 (95% CI: 1.00-12.24, p-value < .05) with sensitivity and specificity of 65% each and 11.08 (95% CI: 2.62-46.83, p-value = .001) with the sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 70%, respectively. When combined together, MPI and CPR yielded an OR of 58.5 (95% CI: 4.58-746.57, p-value = .002) with a sensitivity of 56.5% and specificity of 95% in the FGR group.
CONCLUSIONS: MPI in conjunction with CPR can be used together to predict adverse perinatal outcomes in FGR.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The evaluation of plasma cell (PC) compartment is influenced by the quality of bone marrow aspirate (BMA). Herein, we evaluated the impact of sequence of pull on quality of clinical assessment in plasma cell proliferative disorders (PCPDs).
METHODS: Histomorphology along with smears from first pull and second pull BMA and flow cytometric immunophenotyping (FCMI) data from second pull aspirate were evaluated for cellularity and PC%.
RESULTS: Of the 484 samples, BMA smears were adequate in 87.4% of first pull (median PC = 7%; IQR = 2-25%) and 51.2% of second pull samples (median PC = 2%; IQR = 0.5-12%; p < 0.001). Recovery of PC was least on FCMI (median PC = 0.59%; IQR = 0.14-3.07%), however, sample adequacy was met in 42.6% of samples with acquisition of ≥3 million events. Second pull smears under-reported PC% in 34% of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) (<10% PC) and 46% of MM on therapy (<5% PC), resulting in suboptimal assessment. Bone marrow biopsy (BMBx) was evaluated in a total of 309 cases (median PC = 10.0%; IQR 4.0-40.0%) with significantly higher numbers of BMPC% on BMBx compared with first pull smears (Mean ± 2SD: 25.9% ± 30.54 vs. 20.77% ± 20.20; p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: First pull BMA smears were of superior quality but inadequate in one-tenth of samples. Second pull smears underreported PC% and recovery of PC compartment was poorest on FCMI. Concurrent bone marrow biopsy and use of the first pull sample for FCMI along with acquisition of a higher number of cells on FCMI may enhance the quality of assessment in PCPDs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the current study was to test our hypothesis that older patients sustaining high energy trauma need to be evaluated for their comorbidities similar to geriatric patients sustaining low energy trauma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a retrospective-prospective analysis of 173 patients of more than 50 years of age enrolled between November 2017 and December 2018. Herewith, we have compared retrospectively collected laboratory investigations of 124 fragility fracture patients with prospectively collected laboratory investigations of 49 patients with high energy trauma. The laboratory investigations, including the liver function tests, renal function tests, indices of calcium metabolism, serum electrolytes, complete blood counts, and bone mineral density (BMD) scores.
RESULTS: Both groups were similar to each other as far as baseline demographic characteristics were concerned. The proportion of female patients and patients with non-osteoporotic range BMD (T-score >-2.5) was significantly higher in the high-energy fracture group (P value <0.05). Hypoalbuminemia (<3.4gm/dl) 17.3%, abnormalities sodium (<135mmol/L or >148mmol/L) 23.2%, Anaemia (<10g/dl) 12.7%, Hypercalcemia (>10.4mg/dl) 16.3%, Vitamin D deficiency (<20ng/ml) 17.3% are the common laboratory abnormality found in study population. No statistically significant difference was found among the two groups in terms of laboratory investigation abnormalities.
CONCLUSION: The laboratory investigation abnormality in an older patient with a clinical fracture is independent of the mechanism of injury. The results of the current study emphasise the need for a comprehensive laboratory workup in older patients with either high- energy fractures or fragility fractures.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no randomized controlled trials comparing the eTEP with IPOM repair and this randomized study was designed to compare the two techniques in terms of early pain, cost effectiveness, and quality of life.
METHOD: This was a prospective randomized trial with intention to treat analysis. The primary outcome was immediate post-operative pain scores. Operative time, conversions, peri operative morbidity, hospital stay, return to daily activities, incremental cost effectiveness ratio and quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF) were secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: Sixty patients were randomized equally. Early post-operative pain scores and seroma rates were significantly lower and with a significantly earlier return to activity in eTEP group (p value &lt; 0.05). With negative costs and positive effects, eTEP group was 2.4 times more cost effective.
CONCLUSION: eTEP repair is better in terms of lesser early post-operative pain, earlier return to activities and cost effectiveness in small and medium size defects.

AB  - Poison ingestion is a medical emergency requiring immediate care in the emergency department. Respiratory symptoms with ingested poisons can occur due to aspiration, cardiopulmonary effects, or direct lung toxicity due to injury of the alveolar epithelium. Chest imaging (chest radiographs/CT) is usually performed in the emergency setting to evaluate such symptoms. It is often impossible to elicit the nature of the poison ingested by the patients due to their unconscious state. Identification of the culprit poison can expedite the patient's management towards a specific antidote or help understand the underlying mechanism causing the pulmonary symptoms. The imaging manifestations depend on the underlying mechanisms, varying for each ingested poison, forming an imaging signature which has not been adequately discussed in existing literature. Poisons like paraquat and organophosphate are important to differentiate as indiscriminate use of oxygen therapy in the former can exacerbate the lung injury caused by redox cycling. In this pictorial assay, we present the chest imaging spectrum of commonly ingested poisons, and further suggest algorithmic approach towards identification of common poisons based on their chest imaging.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this exploratory in vitro study was to compare and evaluate the load-bearing capacity (LBC) of ceramic-veneered zirconia and composite-veneered polyetheretherketone (PEEK) three-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) with and without thermocycling (TC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 40 samples of three-unit FDPs replacing mandibular first molars. The four groups included were: ceZIR (feldspathic ceramic-layered zirconia), ceZIR TC (feldspathic ceramic-layered thermocycled zirconia), cPEEK (composite-layered PEEK), and cPEEK TC (composite-layered thermocycled PEEK) (n = 10 per group). All frameworks were CAD/CAM milled. Ten PEEK and 10 zirconia samples were subjected to TC (6,000 cycles). All 40 FDP specimens were loaded by applying static load, using a universal testing machine. The maximum load required to fracture the specimens denoted the LBC. The comparison of LBC between the four groups was done by using two-way ANOVA with Tukey's post-hoc analysis (α = .05).
RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between LBC of cPEEK and ceZIR (P > .001) without thermal aging. LBC values decreased considerably for thermally aged specimens. Statistically significant differences were observed between LBC of cPEEK TC and ceZIR TC (P < .001), cPEEK TC and cPEEK (P < .001), and ceZIR TC and ceZIR (P = .001). On fracture analysis, cPEEK showed delamination failures whereas ceZIR displayed catastrophic connector fractures.
CONCLUSION: This comparative evaluation offers preliminary data highlighting substantial depreciation in the LBC of layered PEEK under simulated intraoral conditions, thus raising a question regarding the clinical longevity of layered PEEK multi-unit restorations. In contrast, feldspathic-layered zirconia can be suitable for use in posterior FDPs.

This was a retrospective study including all splenectomies and splenic biopsies from 2015 to September 2021. All the cases were retrieved from Department of Pathology. Detailed histopathological, clinical and demographic evaluation was done. All the lymphomas were classified according to WHO 2016 classification. A total of 714 splenectomies were performed for a variety of benign causes, as part of tumor resections and for the diagnosis of lymphoma. Few core biopsies were also included. A total of 33 lymphomas diagnosed in the spleen, primary splenic lymphomas constituted 84.84% (n = 28) of the cohort with 5 (15.15%) having the primary site elsewhere. The primary splenic lymphomas constituted 0.28% of all the lymphomas arising at various sites. Adult population (19-65 years) formed the bulk (78.78%) with a slight male preponderance. Splenic marginal zone lymphomas (n = 15, 45.45%) comprised of major proportion of cases followed by primary splenic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 4, 12.12%). Splenectomy was the main course of treatment for SMZL with a good overall outcome, with chemotherapy ± radiotherapy forming the mainstay in other lymphomas. Lymphomas in spleen can be infiltrative or a primary, hence proper clinic-radiological and pathological evaluation is required. Appropriate management is guided by the precise and detailed evaluation by the pathologist, requiring understanding of the same.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: South Asian body composition is characterized by higher body fat at any given BMI. While this does not occur during fetal growth, it is important to understand if inappropriate fat accretion then begins in the first 2 years in Indian infants.
METHODS: The fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) of healthy term newborns was evaluated at 12 days, 3.5 months, 1 year, and 2 years, by deuterium oxide (D2O) dilution. The effect of being born small versus appropriate for gestational age (SGA vs. AGA), and accelerated early growth pattern on FM and FFM accretion was also investigated.
RESULTS: Newborns (262 total, 150 males) with mean birth weight of 2863 ± 418 g were enrolled. FM percentage (FM%) assessed by D2O in 144, 166, 81, and 115 infants at 12 days, 3.5 months, 1 year, and 2 years respectively, was11.6 ± 6.8, 21.1 ± 7.0, 17.9 ± 8.2 and 22.4 ± 9.5%. Boys had higher FFM at all ages, but FM% was similar in both sexes. Children born SGA had similar FM index (FMI) but a lower FFM index (FFMI) at 2 years compared with those born AGA. Infants with catch-up growth between 0 and 2 years had higher FMI at 2 years compared to those without. Infants in the present study had a lower FM% and FMI till 1 year of age in comparison to previous studies from other countries, but had an increase in adiposity between 1 and 2 years, whereas in previous studies FM% remained stable or declined between 1 and 2 years of age.
CONCLUSION: There was an upward inflection in the curve of FM% and FMI between 1 and 2 years of age in the present study, which may represent an early adiposity rebound. Further longitudinal body composition data for Indian infants as well as those of other ethnicities but with low birth weight will clarify whether early accelerated growth pattern contributes to greater accrual of fat rather than lean mass during childhood.

AB  - Conservative management of metachronous second primary carcinoma of head and neck is preferred in order to preserve form and function. The purpose of the case report is to describe the treatment of metachronous second primary carcinoma of soft palate by high-dose-rate, remote, afterload brachytherapy. The brachytherapy was done in remote settings by afterloading Iridium 192 isotope carried through a custom fabricated surface mold. The mold enabled good adaptation, stability, and repeatable positioning of the radiation source at each treatment session of fractionated brachytherapy offering consistent dosimetric advantage through a single dosimetry calculation. Collaborative efforts of radiation oncologist and prosthodontist ensured conservative treatment in outpatient set up with minimal adverse effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension among adolescents is a public health problem, which is going to become more severe given the current obesity epidemic. There is a scarcity of information on the reference range value for blood pressure (BP) cut-off for adolescents.
AIM: We aimed to establish BP distribution in adolescents aged 15-19 years by using the nationally representative National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS-4) data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the data of 15,936 boys and 1,04,132 girls aged 15-19 years in the NFHS-4 survey. We took the mean of systolic and diastolic BPs. Height for age z scores for each individual was calculated using the WHO Anthro plus. The sampling weight was taken as provided by the demographic and health surveys (DHS) website. Nomograms of systolic and diastolic BPs were made by calculating their 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles for each age (in months), gender, and height percentile for age categories.
RESULTS: Both systolic and diastolic BPs increased with age and height centiles. The BP was higher in boys than girls. The average annual increase in systolic and diastolic BPs was 2.52 and 1.20 mmHg in boys and 0.50 and 0.46 mmHg in girls, respectively, when adjusted for height centiles.
CONCLUSION: This study provides a BP nomogram that can be generalized to all the Indian population. Research is required for the diagnostic performance of this nomogram for the diagnosis of adolescent hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension, is a crucial risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies assessing the risk of developing CVD among high-risk groups like hypertensives is limited.
AIM: The purpose of this study was to find the distribution of CVD risk with respect to hypertension status among Indian adults.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of NFHS-4 survey data. The distribution of CVD risk among hypertensive participants using 2019 WHO CVD risk prediction charts was compared with normotensive participants among women aged 40-49 years and men in the age group of 40-54 years.
RESULTS: The proportion of hypertension was higher among women who consumed alcohol (31.5%) than those who did not (24.3%). The proportion of hypertensives increased with increasing BMI, with maximum proportion among obese women (37.3%). Among women, majority (95.7%) had low CVD risk (<5%) while 4.2% had 5% to <10% CVD risk, and only 0.1% had >10% risk. Among men, those with low CVD risk (<5%) was 65%, those with 5% to <10% CVD risk was 32.3%, 10% to <20% was 2.7%, and a meagre 0.03% had 20 to <30% risk.
CONCLUSION: In the current study, prevalence of hypertension was seen to be increasing with age and was higher in urban residents than rural among both men and women. Both high blood pressure reading during the survey and self-reported hypertension was found to be higher among richest wealth index category. Although risk was higher among hypertensives, self-reported hypertensives who had their blood pressure controlled, had risk similar to normotensives indicating the importance of management of hypertension.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the aetiopathogenesis of facial neuritis in coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis patients who presented with peripheral facial nerve palsy from January 2021 to July 2021. The clinico-radiological details of four patients were assessed to examine the potential mechanism of facial nerve involvement.
RESULTS: Serial radiological evaluation with contrast-enhanced computed tomography and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed infratemporal fossa involvement in all cases, with the inflammation extending along fascial planes to reach the stylomastoid foramen. Ascending neuritis with an enhancement of the facial nerve was demonstrated in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The likely explanation for facial palsy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 associated mucormycosis, backed by radiology, is the disease abutting the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen and causing ascending neuritis of the facial nerve.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the utility of ApneaGraph® AG 200 in diagnosing Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) as compared to Polysomnography, localization of the site of upper airway obstruction, and the success rate of surgery.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted including fifteen patients of OSA undergoing surgical treatment. All patients underwent sequential overnight ApneaGraph (AG) and Polysomnogram (PSG) before and after 3 months following surgery. The preoperative and post-operative Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) values were compared between AG and PSG. The success of surgery was defined as mean reduction in AHI by ≥ 50% and post-operative AHI < 20.
RESULTS: The mean preoperative AHI using PSG was 53.7 and using AG was 44.9 (r = 0.83, p = 0.0001). All patients underwent AG-directed site-specific surgery. The mean postoperative AHI using PSG was 15.3 and using AG was 13.8 (r = 0.67, p = 0.0062). There was significant improvement in AHI post-surgery (p < 0.05, AG & PSG). The surgical success was achieved in 93.3%. The median follow-up was 14 months.
CONCLUSION: ApneaGraph is a reliable alternative to PSG to diagnose OSA with an added advantage to localize the site of obstruction, yielding good surgical outcomes.

TI  - Low-dose propofol as a solo agent for sedation in postoperative ventilated liver transplant recipients: A preliminary observational study
AU  - Jaju, Rishabh
AU  - Prakash, Kelika
AU  - Arora, M. K.
T2  - Journal of Anaesthesiology, Clinical Pharmacology
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Propofol is a commonly used sedative agent, in a dose of 1.5-4.5 mg.kg-1.h-1. Following liver transplantation (LT), drug metabolism may be altered due to liver mass, altered hepatic blood flow, reduced levels of serum proteins, and liver regeneration. Thus, we hypothesized that propofol requirements in this group of patients would be different as compared to the standard dose. This study evaluated the dose of propofol used for sedation in electively ventilated living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) recipients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: After patients were shifted to the postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) following LDLT surgery, propofol infusion was started at a dose of 1 mg.kg-1.h-1 and titrated to maintain a bispectral index (BIS) value of 60-80. No other sedatives such as opioids or benzodiazepines were used. Dose of propofol, noradrenaline, and arterial lactate levels were noted 2 hourly.
RESULTS: The mean propofol dose required in these patients was 1.02 ± 0.26 mg.kg-1.h-1. Noradrenaline was gradually tapered off and stopped within 14 h of shifting to ICU. The mean duration between the time of cessation of propofol infusion till extubation was 2.06 ± 1.44 h. Propofol dose did not correlate with respective lactate levels, ammonia levels, or graft-to-recipient weight ratio.
CONCLUSION: The dose range of propofol required for postoperative sedation in LDLT recipients was lower than the conventional dose.

AB  - Obesity is a metabolic disease, which is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality, where therapeutic options are limited. Treatment of obesity is necessary as it is associated with fatal complications like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, osteoarthritis, and many more. Liraglutide (Lir), a synthetic analogue of Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1), is the FDA approved anti-obesity drug, however, its major limitation is its clinical application which needs frequent parenteral injections. To address the issue of regular injection, we have synthesized a fat fighting oral nano-formulation of liraglutide with a sustained release feature, which was evaluated against high fat diet (HFD) induced obesity in mice. Experimental obesity was induced in mice by feeding HFD for 26 weeks. Lir nanoparticles (NP) were fabricated with chitosan via ion-gelation technique and were coated with Eudragit@S100 to protect the drug in harsh gastric conditions. Physiochemical characterization of Eu-Lir-Cs-NP demonstrated a small particle size of 253.1 ± 1.21 nm with ∼ 9.74 % loading and ∼ 72.11 % encapsulation efficiency of the drug. In-vitro studies showed successful cellular uptake of NP in Caco-2 cells and were stable in various enteric fluid pH conditions. Eudragit@S100 coated chitosan NP were able to protect the drug from harsh gastric pH conditions with more than ∼ 74% of recovery. Treatment of two weeks of liraglutide Eu-Lir-Cs-NP (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg, orally; twice daily) moderately reduces obesity in mice as evidenced by a reduction in the body weight, blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride, serum resistin and serum insulin level of mice. In addition, significant reduction of liver weight, abdominal white adipose tissue, and hepatic oxidative stress were noted. Our results suggest that chitosan-based NP of liraglutide can be an effective and convenient formulation for the management of obesity.

AB  - Psychological distress associated with surgery is an emerging issue. The study was conducted to assess the impact of structured patient education viz-a-viz routine patient education on anxiety and depression levels in patients undergoing elective chest surgery. It is a prospective, double-blind randomized study, conducted from February 2019 to February 2020 at a tertiary care center in India, on patients who underwent elective chest surgeries. A total of 300 patients were randomized using a computer-generated randomization sequence, into 2 equal groups (150 subjects each). Study group included patients who underwent structured patient education (Group A), whereas control group included patients who underwent routine patient education (Group B). The 2 groups were compared for anxiety and depression levels at admission as well as discharge using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Also, at the time of discharge, the groups were compared for the effectiveness of patient education using a validated Questionnaire B. In comparison to routine education, patients receiving structured education showed significantly lesser scores for anxiety and depression at discharge (P < .001). Also, structured patient education proved to be effective in comparison to the routine education in educating the patients in all parameters as determined by the Questionnaire B (P < .05). It can be concluded that structured educational intervention is strongly recommended in patients undergoing chest surgery which can help alleviate perioperative anxiety and depression. Such intervention helps patient get an understanding of the surgical procedure and assist them in facing the condition in a better way.

AB  - Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction predominantly occurring in patients of asthma and cystic fibrosis. The typical radiological findings in ABPA include central bronchiectasis and fleeting opacities. In this retrospective study, the aim was to describe cases of ABPA in children who had a mass-like lesion in the lung. There were 5 cases of ABPA in children, who presented as mass-like lesions that responded very well to treatment for ABPA. All cases, except 1, had asthma as the underlying disease. There was a delay in the diagnosis of ABPA in all 5 cases. There had been unnecessary invasive investigations in some of these cases before the diagnosis of ABPA was made. To conclude, children with ABPA may present with a mass-like lesion in the lung and high index of suspicion is required to diagnose ABPA timely to prevent its consequences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Retrospective case record analysis of children with Neurobehavioral Deterioration associated with Sleep-augmented Epileptiform abnormalities (NDSE).
METHODS: Hospital records of children with NDSE (July, 2015 through December, 2016) were analyzed. Children were categorized as: Encephalopathy with electrical status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) if sleep EEG Spike-wave-Index (SWI) was ≥50% and sleep-induced epileptiform activity (SIEA)-related cognitive dysfunction if SWI ≥25% but <50%. Demography, neurobehavior profile (IQ/SQ and behavior using validated psychometric tools), etiology, investigations and treatment details were documented. Outcome assessment was based on three-month follow-up records.
RESULTS: Eighteen children with NDSE {12 boys; median age at diagnosis: 7.5 years (IQR: 6-10 years); SIEA (7); ESES (11)} were included. Etiology was structural (23%) and presumed genetic (77%). All children received intravenous-methylprednisolone pulse followed by oral steroids for eight weeks. Electroencephalography of children with SIEA was partly organized with median SWI of 40% (IQR 35, 42), with anterior-predominant epileptiform abnormalities and less apparent secondary synchronization. Children with ESES had a disorganized EEG background with median SWI of 80% (IQR 66, 95). Both SIEA and ESES groups had a similar neurobehavior profile. Behavior scores improved in 6/8 children with ESES and 5/7 in SIEA post steroids. In both the groups, median SWI improved (to <5% in SIEA, 45% in ESES). Mild improvement in IQ/SQ was also noted {SIEA [Median (IQR): 3 (1.6, 4.3)]; ESES [Median (IQR): 3.8 (2.8, 7)]}.
CONCLUSION: The study supports the fact that SWI >50% in the nap EEG is not mandatory for the diagnosis of ESES, thus it should not be a constraint for steroid treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Mutations in human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) are associated with increased telomerase activity in cutaneous melanomas. Conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma, also referred to as ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma, is cancer on the surface of the eye. Recent studies have identified UV signat`ure mutations in TERT promoters in ocular melanoma and ocular surface squamous neoplasia. However, its immunohistochemical status has not been reported in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. This study aimed to explore the immunohistochemical and mutational status of TERT in ocular surface SCC.
METHODS: The immunohistochemical expression of TERT and mutational status of TERT promoter was evaluated in 19 ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma cases. Conjunctival melanoma tissue was used as a positive control.
RESULTS: The cytoplasmic overexpression of TERT was detected in 11/19 (57%), and TERT promoter mutations were identified in 6/19 (31%) of ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. Out of these, 66% had a C228T mutation, and 33% had a C250T mutation. The TERT expression was found to be associated with a high (≥T3) AJCC category (P = 0.023), and TERT immunoexpression was significantly correlated with reduced disease-free survival (P = 0.024, log-rank analysis) in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma patients.
CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that TERT promoter mutations with UV signatures are frequent in ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma. The increased expression of TERT could be of biological significance in aggressive ocular surface squamous cell carcinoma.

AB  - Background: Ayurveda, the indigenous medical system of India, has chemosensory property (rasa) as one of its major pharmacological metric. Medicinal plants have been classified in Ayurveda under six rasas/tastes-sweet, sour, saline, pungent, bitter and astringent. This study has explored for the first time, the use of Electronic tongue for studies of rasa-based classification of medicinal plants. Methods: Seventy-eight medicinal plants, belonging to five taste categories (sweet, sour, pungent, bitter, astringent) were studied along with the reference taste standards (citric acid, hydrochloric acid, caffeine, quinine, L-alanine, glycine, β-glucose, sucrose, D-galactose, cellobiose, arabinose, maltose, mannose, lactose, xylose). The studies were carried out with the potentiometry-based Electronic tongue and the data was analysed using Principle Component Analysis, Discriminant Function Analysis, Taste Discrimination Analysis and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy. Results: Chemosensory similarities were observed between taste standards and the plant samples-citric acid with sour group plants, sweet category plants with sucrose, glycine, β-glucose and D-galactose. The multivariate analyses could discriminate the sweet and sour, sweet and bitter, sweet and pungent, sour and pungent plant groups. Chemosensory category of plant (classified as unknown) could also be identified. Conclusion: This preliminary study has indicated the possibility of fingerprinting the chemosensory-based ayurvedic classification of medicinal plants using E-tongue coupled with multivariate statistical analysis.

AB  - The management of traumatic dental injury aims at functional and esthetic rehabilitation. After luxation injury, a displaced tooth must be replaced into its normal position as soon as possible. Incorrect tooth repositioning can cause discomfort to the patient and compromise the outcome. This report documents a novel digital technology-based approach for the management of teeth following luxation injury with displacement. A 25-year-old female reported 2 days after traumatic dental injury to her maxillary right central incisor tooth #8. After clinical and radiographic examination, a diagnosis of lateral luxation of tooth #8 was made. The preoperative high-resolution cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) image data set confirmed palatal luxation of tooth #8 with fractured and displaced labial cortical plate. The CBCT data were imported into a medical image processing software program, and a segmentation tool was used to segment the fractured cortical plate, luxated tooth, and alveolar process. The socket is reconstructed by realigning fractured cortical bone over the alveolar process and repositioning the tooth in the virtual planning software. A three-dimensional (3D) guiding template was designed over the repositioned tooth and adjacent teeth and printed. This 3D printed guide was used for the repositioning of luxated tooth #8 and stabilizing it during the splinting procedure. This technique of using CBCT and 3D guide for repositioning is an objective, precise, and predictable approach. The 3D printed model of the dental arch after virtual tooth alignment can be used by the dentist to determine the exact splint length and contour before splinting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High prevalence (more than 80%) rates of tobacco smoking have been found both in, opioid-dependent subjects and among opioid-dependent subjects on opioid substitution treatment (OST) with buprenorphine or methadone.
AIM: We aimed to explore the efficacy of combined nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and individual counseling (IC) when compared to NRT alone in subjects on OST with buprenorphine.
METHODS: This study was carried out in a tertiary medical care center. It was an open-label randomized clinical trial. A total of 57 buprenorphine maintained smokers were recruited and randomized into two groups. They were assigned nicotine gum for 4 weeks plus either (1) a baseline IC session, and a second IC session after 1 week, or (2) simple advice to quit. In the first group, 31 subjects received NRT with IC and in the second group, 26 subjects received NRT plus simple advice to quit. The primary outcomes of this study were seven days point prevalence abstinence, biochemically confirmed by carbon monoxide (CO) breath analyzer, and reduction in smoking (mean no. of cigarettes or bidis/day). The smoking behavior during the 4 weeks follow-up period was assessed by the timeline follow-back (TLFB) method and confirmed by the CO breath analyzer.
RESULTS: The group of subjects who received NRT with IC showed higher rates of smoking cessation at the end of treatment (51%) as compared to the NRT and simple advice group where smoking cessation rates were around 8% (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: A multi-component approach (pharmacotherapy and counseling) enhances treatment outcomes and enhances rates of abstinence from smoking.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) alone or its combination with platelet counts [Baveno-VI criteria (B6C)] is an important non-invasive tool to predict risk of clinical decompensation in patients with advanced compensated cirrhosis. We compared its utility to decide need for beta-blockers in this regard compared with hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) estimation.
METHODS: Patients with compensated cirrhosis with available baseline HVPG and LSM were followed up over a median follow-up of 26 (IQR 7-55) months to determine onset of clinical decompensations. Optimal cut-off for LSM for predicting decompensations was identified and compared with HVPG of 10 mmHg and B6C. Feasibility of initiating beta-blockers based on these strategies was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA) at different threshold probabilities of rates of clinical decompensation.
RESULTS: 626 patients (mean age: 50.8 ± 12.4 years, 72.4% males) related to alcohol (30.3%), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (26.4%), hepatitis C (16.6%), hepatitis B (10.2%) were included. Altogether, 132 (21.0%) patients developed clinical decompensation. The time-dependant area under curve over 5 years for HVPG and LSM for predicting clinical decompensation was 0.716-0.742 and 0.709-0.784, respectively. A LSM of 22 kPa (Sensitivity-88.6%/Specificity-51.8%) had a similar negative predictive value but a higher positive predictive value [37.9% (LSM) vs.30.9% (HVPG)vs.30.6% (B6C), p = 0.026 at 3 years] for incident decompensations. On DCA, LSM-based strategy emerged superior for deciding beta-blocker initiation with 150, 47, and 18 additional patients meriting treatment identified over and above B6C and HVPG based strategy at 5%, 10%, 20% annual rates of clinical decompensation, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Measurement of liver stiffness alone can be a useful alternative to B6C and HVPG in deciding need for beta-blockers to prevent decompensations in compensated cirrhosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation hazards are accountable for extensive damage in the biological system and acts as a public health burden. Owing to the rapid increasing in radiation technology, both Ionizing radiation (IR) from natural and man made source poses detrimental outcome to public health. IR releases free radicals which induces oxidative stress and deleterious biological damage by modulating radiation induced signalling intermediates. The efficacy of existing therapeutic approach and treatment strategy are limited owing to their toxicity and associated side effects. Indian system of traditional medicine is enriched with prospective phytochemicals with potential radioprotection ability.
PURPOSE: The present review elucidated and summarized the potential role of plant derived novel chemical compound with prospective radioprotective potential.
METHOD: So far as the traditional system of Indian medicine is concerned, plant kingdom is enriched with potential bioactive molecules with diverse pharmacological activities. We reviewed several compounds mostly secondary metabolites from plant origin using various search engines.
RESULTS: Both compounds from land plants and marine source exhibited antioxidant antiinflammatory, free radical scavenging ability. These compounds have tremendous potential in fine-tuning of several signalling intermediates, which are actively participated in the progression and development of a pathological condition associated with radiation stress.
CONCLUSION: Development and explore of an operational radioprotective agent from originated from plant source that can be used as a novel molecular tool to eliminate the widespread damage caused by space exploration, ionizing radiation, nuclear war and radiotherapy has been significantly appreciated. Through extensive literature search we highlighted several compounds from both land plant and marine origin can be implemented for a better therapeutic potential against radiation induced injury. Furthermore, extensive clinical trials must be carried out in near future for better therapeutic modality and clinical efficacy.

AB  - High prevalence of anaemia is a severe public health problem in India. In 2018, India launched the Anemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy that focuses on six beneficiary groups for coverage, six institutional mechanisms for health system strengthening and six programmatic interventions to accelerate reductions in anaemia prevalence. This paper uses the Health Management Information System data (2017-18 to 2019-20) to examine gains in IFA coverage across Indian states. A coverage-based AMB index is computed to review performance across states. After the launch of AMB strategy, the Iron and Folic Acid (IFA) supplementation coverage between 2017-18 and 2019-20 has increased for all beneficiary groups [pregnant women from 78% to 90%; lactating mothers from 34% to 49%; school going adolescent girls (boys) from 23% to 40% (21% to 42%); out-of-school adolescent girls from 6% to 23%; children 5-9 years from 8% to 3% and children 6-59 months from 7% to 15%]. Coverage was relatively low for target groups being served through a multi-departmental convergence mechanism (health and other departments such as education department for schools or women and child development department for Anganwadi centres) than compared to those served by health department alone. However, no major gender disparities are noted in the coverage of IFA supplementation among school-going girls and boys. Bulk of the variations in coverage is attributable to state-specific differences. Training and sensitization workshops for state and district officials are found to be associated with increased coverage across beneficiary groups. The paper argues that despite following international best practices in the field, it is important to harness synergy in programme implementation across line departments to eliminate coverage inefficiencies.

AB  - AIMS: To examine clinical and social correlates of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with heart failure (HF) from high- (HIC), upper middle- (UMIC), lower middle- (LMIC) and low-income (LIC) countries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2020, 23 292 patients with HF (32% inpatients, 61% men) from 40 countries were enrolled in the Global Congestive Heart Failure study. HRQL was recorded at baseline using the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ)-12. In a cross-sectional analysis, we compared age- and sex-adjusted mean KCCQ-12 summary scores (SS: 0-100, higher = better) between patients from different country income levels. We used multivariable linear regression examining correlations (estimated coefficients) of KCCQ-12-SS with sociodemographic, comorbidity, treatment and symptom covariates. The adjusted model (37 covariates) was informed by univariable findings, clinical importance and backward selection. Mean age was 63 years and 40% of patients were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV. Average HRQL was 55 SD 27. It was 62.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.0-63.1) in HIC, 56.8 (56.1-57.4) in UMIC, 48.6 (48.0-49.3) in LMIC, and 38.5 (37.3-39.7) in LICs (p < 0.0001). Strong correlates (estimated coefficient [95% CI]) of KCCQ-12-SS were NYHA class III versus class I/II (-12.1 [-12.8 to -11.4] and class IV versus class I/II (-16.5 [-17.7 to -15.3]), effort dyspnoea (-9.5 [-10.2 to -8.8]) and living in LIC versus HIC (-5.8 [-7.1 to -4.4]). Symptoms explained most of the KCCQ-12-SS variability (partial R2  = 0.32 of total adjusted R2  = 0.51), followed by sociodemographic factors (R2  = 0.12). Results were consistent in populations across income levels.

AB  - Background The Covid-19 pandemic severely affected surgical training as the number of surgeries being done was reduced to a bare minimum. Teaching and training of clinical skills on a simulator are desirable as they may have an even larger role during the Covid-19 pandemic. Commercially available simulators with optimum fidelity are costly and may be difficult to sustain because of their recurring cost. The development of low-cost simulators with optimum fidelity is the need of the hour. Methods We developed animal tissue-based simulators for imparting skills training to surgical residents on some basic and advanced general surgical procedures. Porcine tissue and locally available materials were used to prepare these models. The models were pilot-tested. Standard operating procedures were developed for each skill that was shared with the participants well before the 'hands-on' exercise. An online pre-test was conducted. The training was then imparted on these models under faculty guidance adhering to Covid-19-appropriate behaviour. This was followed by a post-test and participant feedback. The entire exercise was paperless. Results Sixty residents were trained in 10 sessions. Most of the participants were men (44; 73%). The mean pre-test and post-test scores were 40.92 (standard deviation [SD] 6.27) and 42.67, respectively (SD 4.06). Paired sample t-test suggested a significant improvement in the post-test score (p<0.001). The activity and the models were well appreciated by the residents. Conclusion The animal tissue-based indigenous models are easy to prepare, cost-effective and provide optimum fidelity for skill training of surgical residents. In addition to skill acquisition, training on such modules may alleviate the stress and anxiety of the residents associated with the loss of surgical training during a time-bound residency period.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Providing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to a coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patient is challenging for the healthcare providers (HCP). COVID-19 cases have specific CPR requirements, which differ from standard resuscitation efforts.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to evaluate whether online learning can be an effective methodology for imparting information on the management of cardiopulmonary arrest in COVID-19 patients due to a novel virus unknown to HCP based on evaluation of knowledge acquisition and satisfaction of the nurses in the new area of medicine and virology.
METHODOLOGY: In a single-arm, one group before and after design, from a cohort of 160 nurses trained in comprehensive cardiac life support (CCLS) formulated by the Indian Resuscitation Council (IRC), 73 nurses participated in the study. After obtaining informed consent through the email from the nurses, baseline data including demographic profile and knowledge related to CPR in COVID-19 patients were collected. An online intervention spread over 1 week was given using a validated e-learning module. The online intervention was found to be effective (pre- and post-intervention knowledge score 13.65 ± 3.01 vs 19.92 ± 1.94, p = 0.001). The majority of nurses were highly satisfied with the content and the training methodology (37.23 ± 4.70).
CONCLUSION: A well-structured, online study material can be used in imparting knowledge and demonstrating the basic and essential skills to nurses, required for giving CPR to COVID-19 patients.

AB  - With the advancement of clinical research and the increased burden on laboratory services, there is an unmet need for guidelines regarding proper laboratory functioning and reliable data generation. Several organizations from all over the world have published guidelines for these clinical and research laboratories. Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) are stepwise procedures aimed at strengthening the quality of test results produced by all clinical laboratories engaged in human sample analysis. In this article, we attempt a comparison of the GCLP guidelines recently issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research with the guidelines released by the World Health Organization and the European Medicines Agency. Also, we have included and discussed several suggestions that, if included, will lead to the strengthening of the laboratory practices used for both research and patient care for overall improvement in the Indian healthcare system.

AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Global developmental delay (GDD) is a relatively common neurodevelopmental disorder; however, paucity of published literature and absence of uniform guidelines increases the complexity of clinical management of this condition. Hence, there is a need of practical guidelines for the pediatrician on the diagnosis and management of GDD, summarizing the available evidence, and filling in the gaps in existing knowledge and practices.
PROCESS: Seven subcommittees of subject experts comprising of writing and expert group from among members of Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) and its chapters of Neurology, Neurodevelopment Pediatrics and Growth Development and Behavioral Pediatrics were constituted, who reviewed literature, developed key questions and prepared the first draft on guidelines after multiple rounds of discussion. The guidelines were then discussed by the whole group in an online meeting. The points of contention were discussed and a general consensus was arrived at, after which final guidelines were drafted by the writing group and approved by all contributors. The guidelines were then approved by the Executive Board of IAP.
GUIDELINES: GDD is defined as significant delay (at least 2 standard deviations below the mean with standardized developmental tests) in at least two developmental domains in children under 5 years of age; however, children whose delay can be explained primarily by motor issues or severe uncorrected visual/hearing impairment are excluded. Severity of GDD can be classified as mild, moderate, severe and profound on adaptive functioning. For all children, in addition to routine surveillance, developmental screening using standardized tools should be done at 9-12 months,18-24 months, and at school entry; whereas, for high risk infants, it should be done 6-monthly till 24 months and yearly till 5 years of age; in addition to once at school entry. All children, especially those diagnosed with GDD, should be screened for ASD at 18-24 months, and if screen negative, again at 3 years of age. It is recommended that investigations should always follow a careful history and examination to plan targeted testing and, vision and hearing screening should be done in all cases prior to standardized tests of development. Neuro-imaging, preferably magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, should be obtained when specific clinical indicators are present. Biochemical and metabolic investigations should be targeted towards identifying treatable conditions and genetic tests are recommended in presence of clinical suspicion of a genetic syndrome and/or in the absence of a clear etiology. Multidisciplinary intervention should be initiated soon after the delay is recognized even before a formal diagnosis is made, and early intervention for high risk infants should start in the nursery with developmentally supportive care. Detailed structured counselling of family regarding the diagnosis, etiology, comorbidities, investigations, management, prognosis and follow-up is recommended. Regular targeted follow-up should be done, preferably in consultation with a team of experts led by a developmental pediatrician/ pediatric neurologist.

AB  - Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a C-cell-derived epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasm. With the exception of rare examples, most are well-differentiated epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms (also known as neuroendocrine tumors in the taxonomy of the International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] of the World Health Organization [WHO]). This review provides an overview and recent evidence-based data on the molecular genetics, disease risk stratification based on clinicopathologic variables including molecular profiling and histopathologic variables, and targeted molecular therapies in patients with advanced MTC. While MTC is not the only neuroendocrine neoplasm in the thyroid gland, other neuroendocrine neoplasms in the thyroid include intrathyroidal thymic neuroendocrine neoplasms, intrathyroidal parathyroid neoplasms, and primary thyroid paragangliomas as well as metastatic neuroendocrine neoplasms. Therefore, the first responsibility of a pathologist is to distinguish MTC from other mimics using appropriate biomarkers. The second responsibility includes meticulous assessment of the status of angioinvasion (defined as tumor cells invading through a vessel wall and forming tumor-fibrin complexes, or intravascular tumor cells admixed with fibrin/thrombus), tumor necrosis, proliferative rate (mitotic count and Ki67 labeling index), and tumor grade (low- or high-grade) along with the tumor stage and the resection margins. Given the morphologic and proliferative heterogeneity in these neoplasms, an exhaustive sampling is strongly recommended. Routine molecular testing for pathogenic germline RET variants is typically performed in all patients with a diagnosis of MTC; however, multifocal C-cell hyperplasia in association with at least a single focus of MTC and/or multifocal C-cell neoplasia are morphological harbingers of germline RET alterations. It is of interest to assess the status of pathogenic molecular alterations involving genes other than RET like the MET variants in MTC families with no pathogenic germline RET variants. Furthermore, the status of somatic RET alterations should be determined in all advanced/progressive or metastatic diseases, especially when selective RET inhibitor therapy (e.g., selpercatinib or pralsetinib) is considered. While the role of routine SSTR2/5 immunohistochemistry remains to be further clarified, evidence suggests that patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-avid metastatic disease may also benefit from the option of 177Lu-DOTATATE peptide radionuclide receptor therapy. Finally, the authors of this review make a call to support the nomenclature change of MTC to C-cell neuroendocrine neoplasm to align this entity with the IARC/WHO taxonomy since MTCs represent epithelial neuroendocrine neoplasms of endoderm-derived C-cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Genome wide association studies have scaled up both in terms of sample size and range of complex disorders investigated, but these have explained relatively little phenotypic variance. Of the several reasons, phenotypic heterogeneity seems to be a likely contributor for missing out genetic associations of large effects. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian system of medicine is one such tool which adopts a holistic deep phenotyping approach and classifies individuals based on their body constitution/prakriti. We hypothesized that Ayurveda based phenotypic stratification of healthy and diseased individuals will allow us to achieve much desired homogeneous cohorts which would facilitate detection of genetic association of large effects. In this proof of concept study, we performed a genome wide association testing of clinically diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis patients and healthy controls, who were re-phenotyped into Vata, Pitta and Kapha predominant prakriti sub-groups.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: Genotypes of rheumatoid arthritis cases (Vata = 49; Pitta = 117; Kapha = 78) and controls (Vata = 33; Pitta = 175; Kapha = 85) were retrieved from the total genotype data, used in a recent genome-wide association study performed in our laboratory. A total of 528461 SNPs were included after quality control. Prakriti-wise genome-wide association analysis was employed.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This study identified (i) prakriti-specific novel disease risk genes of high effect sizes; (ii) putative candidates of novel therapeutic potential; and (iii) a good correlation between genetic findings and clinical knowledge in Ayurveda. Adopting Ayurveda based deep phenotyping may facilitate explaining hitherto undiscovered heritability in complex traits and may propel much needed progress in personalized medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE: One of the major limitations of the 2D fracture evaluation (Schatzker classification) is its failure to adequately assess fracture lines in the frontal plane and fracture displacement in the antero-posterior direction. 3D fracture line mapping includes steric assessment which can aid decision making with regards to the surgical approach and fixation scheme. We hypothesized that there are consistent fracture patterns and zones of comminution for proximal tibial fractures.
METHODS: Radiographic data of 228 proximal tibia fractures were retrospectively included in this study. Fracture lines and zones of comminution were graphically superimposed onto a 3D template of an intact tibia after virtual reduction and normalization to identify major patterns of fracture and comminution.
RESULTS: Out of 206 male and 21 female patients, 89 had a fracture of the lateral condyle only (Schatzker I and II), 53 involved the medial plateau only (Schatzker IV) and 86 had a high-grade fracture involving both the condyles (Schatzker V and VI). 64.5% of the fracture lines involving the medial plateau alone were in the coronal plane, and this number was even lesser (44.2%) in medial plateau involvement of bicondylar fractures. In bicondylar fractures, lines were usually not seen to pass directly through the posteromedial region.
CONCLUSIONS: Medial tibial plateau fractures have a mix of coronal or sagittal fracture alignment. A clearer understanding of the 3D orientations of fractures based on CT scans can aid in diagnosing the pattern of fracture and adequate positioning of plates can be done to eventually improve operative outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this subanalysis of data from centres across urban areas in India of the Global Asthma Network (GAN) was to study 1) the prevalence of symptoms of asthma in children and adults, 2) the change in prevalence of asthma and its trigger factors since the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC), and 3) current asthma treatment practice.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional, multicentre, school-based and self-administered questionnaire, responses from children aged 6-7 years and 13-14 years, and their respective parents, were analysed.
RESULTS: The GAN Phase I study included 20 084 children in the 6-7-year age group, 25 887 children in the 13-14-year age group and 81 296 parents. The prevalence of wheeze in the previous 12 months was 3.16%, 3.63% and 3.30% in the three groups, respectively. In comparison to the ISAAC studies, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of current wheeze (p<0.001). Bivariate analysis revealed a significant reduction in the prevalence of trigger factors. Almost 82% of current wheezers and 70% of subjects with symptoms of severe asthma were not clinically diagnosed as having asthma. The daily use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) was less than 2.5% in subjects with current wheeze and those with symptoms of severe asthma but less than 1% used daily ICS when asthma remained undiagnosed.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of current wheeze and its causal factors showed a significant reduction compared to previous ISAAC studies. Among subjects with current wheeze and symptoms of severe asthma, the problem of under-diagnosis and under-treatment was widespread.

METHODS: Seventy young women with PCOS aged 15-24 years with delayed cycles were randomized into two groups and were treated for 6 months with MI + DCI (550 + 150 mg, 3.6:1 ratio) twice a day and CHC (ethinyl estradiol 20 µg + drospirenone 3 mg) once a day.
RESULTS: Spontaneous menses resumed in 28 (84.85%) young women on MI + DCI, compared with withdrawal bleeding in 34 (100%) on CHC. The mean cycle length reduced with both MI + DCI (124.54 ± 8.08 to 57.75 ± 3.00 days, P < 0.001) and CHC (105.88 ± 7.96 to 30.53 ± 2.95 days, P < 0.001). Regular menstrual cycles were established in 9 (27.27%) young women with MI + DCI (P = 0.001) and 30 (88.23%) with CHC (P < 0.001). Three months after stopping the treatment, 24 young women (85.71%) on MI + DCI and 25 (73.53%) on CHC continued to have spontaneous cycles. Anti-Müllerian hormone decreased with both the drugs (P = 0.001), whereas luteinizing hormone (P = 0.001) and testosterone (P = 0.04) decreased with CHC and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (P < 0.001) with MI + DCI.
CONCLUSION: Myo-inositol and d-chiro-inositol in combination (3.6:1 ratio) are effective in regularizing menstrual cycles and improving insulin resistance.

AB  - Mass on the aortic valve is extremely rare in children, and the differential diagnosis includes vegetation, thrombus, and primary cardiac tumors. A rise in infective endocarditis in infants is seen due to increasing survival of children with congenital heart diseases and sick newborn infants with prolonged hospitalization. We report a 4-month-old infant born prematurely with early-onset sepsis requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment and valvular aortic stenosis presenting with sudden hemodynamic compromise due to aortic vegetation extending into the ascending aorta eroding through its posterior wall. The report details management of our case and a brief description of available alternative treatment strategies.

AB  - Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly given to all patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery. However, currently, there is no consensus if pro- phylactic usage of antibiotics in cochlear implantation accords any benefit and if the duration of such use varies according to the surgeon's experience or institutional preference. A systematic review was conducted to gather evidence on ideal duration for antibiotic prophylaxis rec- ommended for patients undergoing cochlear implantation. We registered the protocol in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021235079) and reported the systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analysis statement. Of the 278 screened articles, 6 full-text original articles satisfied the inclusion criteria and were included. There were a total of 2081 participants in these 6 retrospective studies and all studies except 1 included both adult and pediatric populations. Antibiotic therapy was given as intervention, either as single dose or multiple doses, and compared with other group(s) receiving either no antibiotic prophylaxis or a different duration of prophylaxis. Three studies did not find any significant difference between infection rates when a different duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was given, while 2 studies found a single dose to be more efficacious, and yet another study concluded that a longer dura- tion of antibiotic prophylaxis was more beneficial. Based on the available data, the ideal duration of post-operative antibiotic therapy to be given after cochlear implant surgery could not be defined. However, administrating a single dose of intraoperative antibiotic seems to be the most consistent practice so far.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sinonasal mucormycosis is a serious fungal infection. Early diagnosis and prompt antifungal therapy along with surgical intervention is the key to its management. Liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) given intravenously is the antifungal agent of choice. However, the current literature is not clear on its optimum dosage. We did a retrospective study to find the optimum dose of LAmB in cases with sinonasal mucormycosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients diagnosed with mucormycosis involving sinonasal, rhino-orbital, or rhino-orbito-cerebral regions and receiving only LAmB as pharmacotherapy were included in our retrospective study from 2017 to 2020. A multiple logistic regression model was developed to correlate the total dose of LAmB and other parameters with the final outcome which was defined clinico-radiologically as improved, worsened, or death. The dose of LAmB which led to the first significant change in urea, creatinine, and potassium levels was also determined.
RESULTS: The model showed a good fit in goodness-to-fit analysis (Pearson = 0.999, deviance = 0.995), while the likelihood ratio was statistically significant (0.001). The overall model prediction was 83.3%. However, the correlation of outcome with any of the variables, including mean LAmB dose per kilogram (82.2 ± 13.02 mg/kg), was statistically not significant.
CONCLUSION: Many patient-related factors (such as age, comorbidities, extent of the disease, and side effects from LAmB therapy), which vary on a case-to-case basis, contribute to the outcome in a mucormycosis patient. The optimum dose of LAmB for improved outcome still requires individualization guided by experience, till well-designed studies address the question.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Various metals play role in the survival and pathogenesis of the invasive fungal disease. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of heavy metals in patients with chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (CIFR) and healthy controls, and to analyze their role in disease outcome.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients (15 with invasive mucormycosis and 8 with invasive aspergillosis, Group 1), and 14 healthy controls (Group 2) were recruited. Blood samples were collected from each group into ion-free tubes and analyzed for serum levels of Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Gallium (Ga), Arsenic (As), Selenium (Se), Rubidium (Rb), Strontium (Sr), Cadmium (Cd), and Lead (Pb). The final outcome of the patients during their hospital stay was categorized clinico-radiologically as improved or worsened, or death.
RESULTS: The levels of all metals were higher in Group 1 except for As and Pb. However, the differences in Cu (p=0.0026), Ga (p=0.002), Cd (p=0.0027), and Pb (p=0.0075) levels were significant. Higher levels of Zn (p=0.009), Se (p=0.020), and Rb (p=0.016) were seen in the invasive aspergillosis subgroup. Although Zn (p=0.035), As (p=0.022), and Sr (p=0.002) levels were higher in patients with improved outcome, subgroup analysis showed no differences.
CONCLUSION: The levels of some heavy metals in CIFR significantly differ from those of the general population and also vary with the type of the disease and its outcome. These levels may not have a direct effect on the outcome of the patient, but they do play a role in the pathogenesis of the invading fungus.

TI  - Frontal sinus stenting: A feasible option for post-traumatic recurrent giant mucocele compromising vision
AU  - Kajal, Smile

T2  - National Journal of Maxillofacial Surgery
AB  - Giant mucocele of frontal sinus following facial trauma is not uncommon. It can lead to the gradual erosion of anterior and posterior bony walls and may extend to the orbital and intracranial structures leading to visual compromise or intracranial complications. A 52-year-old man presented with a history of swelling above the right eye, right eye proptosis, and decreased vision. He had a history of a road traffic accident 30 years ago following which he had lost vision in his left eye and had undergone surgery twice earlier for right frontal mucocele. Computed tomography showed cranialization of the right frontal sinus and a well-defined mass lesion in the region of frontal sinus compressing on the right eye globe. Naso-orbital meningoencephalocele was considered as a differential but magnetic imaging resonance confirmed the lesion as a mucocele. As this was the second recurrence and there was an endangered vision in the only functional eye, he underwent emergency excision of mucocele and recreation of the frontal sinus outflow tract (FSOT) with silastic stenting to maintain its patency. Post-operatively, the patient's vision returned to normal at a 1-week interval. There was a reduction in swelling and proptosis in a 6-month period and the stent was removed after 1 year. Treatment of recurrent frontal sinus mucocele can be challenging. Frontal sinus stenting can be considered in such cases to maintain the patency of FSOT for a prolonged period. Regular follow-up, inspection, and cleaning of the nasal cavity and the stented area are important to prevent any stent-related complications.

AB  - Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare, poorly defined sinonasal epithelial neoplasm from which several genetically defined entities are emerging. IDH1/2 mutations were recently identified in a subset of SNUC. However, the ideal method for the detection of these mutations remains to be established. Cases diagnosed as SNUC between 2010 and 2020 were retrieved. Immunohistochemistry was performed using IDH1/2 mutant-specific antibody MsMab-1. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue using 2 kits to detect IDH1/2 mutations. Sanger sequencing was performed in a subset of cases. Thirty-eight cases of SNUC were identified, 18 of which showed IDH1/2 mutations by qPCR (47.4%). IDH2 R172K and R140x were most frequent, each seen in 6 cases (33.3%). Sanger sequencing identified IDH1/2 mutations in 4 out of 21 cases (19%) and did not detect mutations identified by qPCR in 7 cases. On immunohistochemistry, strong IDH positivity was present in 2 cases (5.3%), 1 of which had IDH2 mutation, while no mutation was detected in the other. Our results demonstrating IDH2 R172K and IDH2 R140x variants are a novel finding in SNUC. Immunohistochemistry and Sanger sequencing have low sensitivity for detection of IDH1/2 mutations, and qPCR-based assays may be utilized, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to sophisticated sequencing techniques are difficult.

AB  - Behaviour change is the basic foundation in the management of obesity. Such behaviour change is difficult to achieve due to several psychosocial and behavioural barriers that often remain unidentified and unaddressed in a weight management programme. This is even more challenging in postpartum and midlife women because of several biopsychosocial factors. The non-availability of psychologists or trained healthcare counsellors further complicates the attainment of behavioural changes. Therefore, clinicians, who are often the first point of contact for treating these population groups, are hamstrung by the lack of a multidisciplinary approach for weight reduction. Some of the common psychological, social and behavioural barriers have been identified in this article, and evidence-based techniques such as goal setting, stimulus control and cognitive restructuring are presented in a step-wise approach, to help clinicians cater to these population groups in a holistic manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With rising trends in research and scientific writing, various ethical organizations have been vigilant over developing rigorous authorship criteria. There may be times, when authors tend to publish more due to their seniority or previously earned credit for former publications, proving the existence of Matthew effect in scientific research. It indicates that the majority of publications in a field are contributed by smaller number of authors. It was hypothesized that the Matthew effect may be still applicable for scientific work published by Indian pediatric dentists in the official Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry (JISPPD) from 2015 to 2019.
METHODOLOGY: To assess the number of times each author has published in the official Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry, we downloaded all issues for the 5-year period from the journal website. Full names of all authors were entered year-wise in Microsoft Excel 2007 and descriptive statistics were used for finding out contribution percentages.
RESULTS: A total of 372 papers were published during the study period by 1148 authors. About 82% had at least one publication, followed by 12% publishing at least two papers; only 1% of the total authors had contributed to more than five publications. The result showed the absence of Matthew effect for publications in the JISPPD.
CONCLUSION: The final results of the study did not show any presence of Matthew effect among authorship in the JISPPD.

AB  - Although epidural catheter insertion under ultrasound (US) guidance in the pediatric age group has been reported in the literature, it is yet to be adopted widely in clinical practice. The incomplete fusion of bones in pediatric patients provides an acoustic window for the US. The epidural space in children is at shallow depth, hence a high-frequency probe, which provides better resolution can be used. We present a case series in which real-time US-guided epidural catheter placement was performed in 10 infants in lower thoracic and upper lumbar interspaces. We reiterate that the use of real-time US during epidural catheter placement in patients increases the success rate of epidural catheter placement while decreasing procedural complications.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Chest X-ray (CXR) is an important screening tool for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Accessibility to CXR facilities in difficult-to-reach and underserved populations is a challenge. This can potentially be overcome by deploying digital X-ray machines that are portable. However, these portable X-ray machines need to be validated before their deployment in the field. Here, we compare the image quality of CXR taken by a newly developed handheld X-ray machine with routinely used reference digital X-ray machine through the conduct of a feasibility study.
METHODS: A total of 100 participants with suspected pulmonary TB were recruited from the outpatient departments of a medical college and a community health centre in Agra. Each participant underwent CXR twice, once with each machine. Both sets of de-identified images were independently read by two radiologists, who were blinded to the type of X-ray machine used. The primary outcome was agreement between image qualities produced by these two machines.
RESULTS: The intra-observer (radiologist) agreements regarding the status of the 15 CXR parameters ranged between 74 per cent and 100 per cent, with an unweighted mean of 87.2 per cent (95% confidence interval: 71.5-100). The median Cohen's kappa values for intra-observer agreement were 0.62 and 0.67 for radiologists 1 and 2, respectively. In addition, on comparison of the overall median score of quality of the image, the handheld machine images had a higher score for image quality.
INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The current study shows that a handheld X-ray machine, which is easy to use and can potentially be carried to any area, produces X-ray images with quality that is comparable to digital X-ray machines routinely used in health facilities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined profile and treatment outcomes of young patients with tuberculosis (TB) registered at a district TB centre under the National TB Elimination Programme in Faridabad district of Haryana state in India.
METHODS: In this secondary data analysis, we studied the records of young TB patients aged 15-24 years registered under a TB programme during October 2013-December 2017 in Faridabad district of Haryana state.
RESULTS: We analysed records of 5257 young patients with TB. Majority (58.7%) were patients with pulmonary TB and most of them (83.6%) were registered as new patients. Majority of the young patients with TB (93.2%) had a successful treatment outcome, and patients having sputum result 2+ or less and patients who did not have a previous history of TB were found to be significantly associated with a successful treatment outcome on multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSION: There was a high treatment success rate noted in young patients with TB. More focus is needed to patients having a history of TB and sputum result >2+. Targeted interventions can be designed for these groups in future programmatic strategies to reduce disease burden in this section of young population.

AB  - An 11-year-old girl presented to the pediatric gastroenterology outpatient department of our institution with gradually increasing painless abdominal distention. The distention started 2 years earlier and was not associated with any other constitutional symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, jaundice, hematemesis, or melaena. She reported early satiety and heaviness in the lower abdomen. The abdominal swelling was predominantly in the infraumbilical region and was soft at palpation. She was the first child of nonconsanguineous parents and had an uneventful perinatal course after a normal vaginal delivery. Her developmental milestones were normal. She had an average scholastic performance at school. There was no history of visual problems, seizures, or inappropriate behaviors. She had an early menarche 2 years previously. Her menstrual cycles were regular, and there was no abnormal vaginal discharge. Her breast development was normal (Tanner stage III), while pubic and axillary hair were absent (Tanner stage I). She was short for her age (104 cm; normal range, 120-154 cm). There was no history of short stature among her siblings or parents. Laboratory investigations were performed to measure thyroid-stimulating hormone (1354.34 µIU/mL; normal range, 0.35-5.5 µIU/mL), triiodothyronine (<2.5 ng/dL [0.0385 pmol/L]; normal range, 100-200 ng/dL [1.54-3.08 pmol/L]), thyroxine (1.35 µg/dL [17.37 nmol/L]; normal range, 5-12 µg/dL [64.35-154.44 nmol/L]), β-human chorionic gonadotropin (<1.2 mIU/mL; normal, <5 mIU/mL), luteinizing hormone (0.08 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.1-6.0 mIU/mL), and follicle-stimulating hormone (6.93 mIU/mL; normal range, 0.3-2.0 mIU/mL) levels. Complete blood count was normal. An abdominal mass was suspected, and abdominopelvic CT was performed and followed by US; these examinations revealed multiple large cysts in both ovaries. The uterus was pubertal in shape, and endometrial thickness was 9 mm, representing normal follicular phase measurement. Serum CA-125 and inhibin levels were normal. To evaluate short stature, radiographs of the hand and pelvis were obtained as part of a limited skeletal survey, keeping in mind the possible skeletal changes associated with hypothyroidism. In view of the hypothyroidism, US of the neck was also performed. Treatment was started based on the clinical and radiologic parameters, and the child's condition improved with medical treatment.

T2  - BMJ case reports
AB  - A man in his 20s presented with diminished vision in the left eye. He had a history of Pott's spine and had been diagnosed elsewhere as having left eye tubercular granuloma in the retina. He was started on anti-tubercular therapy and high-dose oral steroids. He presented to us 1 month later. Presently fundus examination revealed a yellow to whitish mass temporal to disc with diffuse hard exudates throughout the retina. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (SSOCT) revealed a hyper-reflective mass involving the retina. SSOCT angiography and fundus fluorescein angiography revealed vascularity within the lesion. We made a diagnosis of a secondary reactive retinal astrocytic vasoproliferative tumour (VPT) and hence tapered the steroids and given intravitreal bevacizumab injection. At 6 weeks follow-up after intravitreal bevacizumab, there was some amount of resolution of hard exudates along with reduction of the vascular pattern of the lesion. The peripapillary location and development of a VPT following resolution of a presumed tubercular granuloma is rare.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the thickness of levator palpebra superioris-Muller's muscle complex (LMC) on ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and to correlate with the clinical response to botulinum toxin A (BTA) injection in patients with inactive-stage of thyroid-related upper eyelid retraction (UER). We also studied the correlation of clinical parameters, preinjection with postinjection values.
METHODS: This was a prospective, interventional study. Patients with thyroid-related UER who underwent subconjunctival injection of BTA were recruited. Demographic data and clinical details were evaluated. UBM (50 MHz) was done to measure the thickness of LMC. Patient's satisfaction was graded at each follow-up. Follow-up was done at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months' time intervals.
RESULTS: A total of 13 patients were recruited and 26 eyes were divided into two groups; group 1 included eyes with UER (n = 17), and group 2 included eyes without UER (n = 9). There was a statistically significant reduction in margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1) after BTA injection at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-months follow-up with maximum reduction at 1 month. The mean LMC thickness of 26 eyes was 0.96 mm which was found to be significantly more than normal controls. On comparison of mean LMC thickness with the amount of UER and reduction in MRD1, we did not find a significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with TED have significantly thicker LMC on UBM than controls. Further studies are needed with a larger sample size on the correlation of UBM features of levator aponeurosis with response to BTA injection.

AB  - Tracheal implantation remains a major therapeutic challenge due to the unavailability of donors and the lack of biomimetic tubular grafts. Fabrication of biomimetic tracheal scaffolds of suitable materials with matched rigidity, enhanced flexibility and biocompatibility has been a major challenge in the field of tracheal reconstruction. In this study, customized tubular grafts made up of FDA-approved polycaprolactone ( PCL  ) and polyurethane ( PU  ) were fabricated using a novel solvent-based extrusion 3D printing. The printed scaffolds were investigated by various physical, thermal, and mechanical characterizations such as contact angle measurement, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), radial compression, longitudinal compression, and cyclic radial compression. In this study, the native goat trachea was used as a reference for the fabrication of different types of scaffolds (cylindrical, bellow-shaped, and spiral-shaped). The mechanical properties of the goat trachea were also compared to find suitable formulations of PCL / PU  . Spiral-shaped scaffolds were found to be an ideal shape based on longitudinal compression and torsion load maintaining clear patency. To check the long-term implantation, in vitro degradation test was performed for all the 3D printed scaffolds and it was found that blending of PU  with PCL  reduced the degradation behavior. The printed scaffolds were further evaluated for biocompatibility assay, live/dead assay, and cell adhesion assay using bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). From biomechanical and biological assessments, PCL 70 / PU 30  of spiral-shaped scaffolds could be a suitable candidate for the development of tracheal regenerative applications.

AB  - To evaluate the role of 18FDG-WBPET-CT, Examination under anesthesia (EUA), and multiple-site biopsy in detecting the occult site in head & neck carcinoma of unknown primary (HN-CUP). In this prospective study, 22 patients with diagnosed CUP, after a thorough outpatient endoscopic evaluation of upper airway and radiological evaluation (CT/MRI) that ruled out a primary lesion were included. These patients subsequently underwent whole-body PET-CT and EUA. Based on the presence of suspicious findings ( +) or their absence (-) on 18FDG-WBPET-CT (P) and EUA (E), we divided the patients into 5 groups: P-E-, P-E + , P + E-, P + E + , and P + or E + . All these patients underwent bilateral palatine tonsillectomy, bilateral nasopharyngeal biopsy, and ipsilateral lingual tonsillectomy for identification of occult primary. Out of 22 patients, the primary could be detected in 4 patients (18%) after the workup (three in the oropharynx and one in the hypopharynx, all ipsilateral). 18FDG-PET-CT suspected primaries in 7 patients; biopsy was positive for three (sensitivity-75%, specificity-77%, PPV-43%, NPV-93%). Out of 5 patients, who had suspicious findings on EUA, 3 of the biopsies revealed malignancy (sensitivity-75%, specificity-88%, PPV-60%, NPV-94%). Both PET-CT and EUA when combined, yield a NPV of 100% if both are negative and PPV of 100% when both are positive for suspicious findings. No primary was identified in the absence of a suspicion by PET-CT or EUA. Without a suspicion on 18FDG-WBPET-CT and EUA, there is a limited role of multiple-site biopsies in patients of HN-CUP.

AB  - PURPOSE: To develop a viable in vivo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model to study the growth and invasion of patient-derived retinoblastoma (RB) and choroidal melanoma (CM) xenografts (PDXs). The study utilizes primary tumor samples instead of cancer cell lines, which provides a more authentic representation of tumors due to conserved morphology and heterogeneity.
METHODS: Fertilized chicken eggs were procured, windowed, and their CAM layers were dropped. On embryonic development day (EDD) 10, freshly cut patient-derived CM and RB tumors were implanted on the CAM layer and the setup was incubated for 7 days. The tumor-embedded CAM layer was harvested on EDD 17, and the extracted tumor samples were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemical analysis to evaluate the extent of tumor invasion.
RESULTS: Significant changes in the vascularity around the RB and CM PDXs were observed, indicating an angiogenic environment. The cross-sectional histological view of the tumor implant site revealed the invasion of both the tumors into the CAM mesoderm. Invasion of CM into CAM mesoderm was visualized in the form of pigmented nodules, and that of RB was indicated by synaptophysin and Ki-67 positivity in Immunohistochemistry (IHC).
CONCLUSION: The CAM xenograft model was successfully able to support the growth of CM and RB PDXs and their invasion in CAM, thus presenting as a feasible alternative to mammalian models for studying tumorigenicity and invasiveness of ocular tumors. Moreover, this model can further be utilized to develop personalized medicine by inoculating patient-specific tumors for preclinical drug screening.

AB  - Although intracranial aneurysms are rare in the paediatric population, the proportion of those involving posterior circulation is higher than that of adults (approximately 25% vs. 8%, respectively). Moreover, posterior circulation aneurysms in kids tend to be larger in size, many of them being giant dissecting types, and treatment of them is often challenging. Treatment of giant dissecting aneurysms, especially involving the Basilar artery is difficult due to strategic location and haemodynamic factors. Use of reconstructive techniques viz. flow-diverters and braided stents is difficult in children because of the lack of standard protocol for use of antiplatelet therapy and the need for prolonged use of the same. Continuous growth of parent vessel is also suggested as a pitfall for the use of a flow diverter/ braided stent which has a fixed caliber. Carefully planned endovascular parent or feeder branch artery occlusion (FAO) is a time-tested method to achieve flow reversal or favourable flow modifications in an arterial segment harbouring dissecting aneurysm. Here, in this case report, we describe a case of a ruptured distal giant basilar artery dissecting aneurysm in a 10-year-old boy treated with flow diversion by FAO. The dominant left vertebral artery was occluded, thereby diverting flow from the right vertebral artery towards the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery and decreasing flow through the aneurysm. On 1-year follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic and on check angiography, there was complete involution of the aneurysm with increased flow through bilateral posterior communicating arteries to distal posterior circulation which proved our hypothesis correct.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Existing therapeutic options for complicated Crohn's disease (CD) like biologics and surgery are limited by inadequate long-term efficacy, cost, and adverse effects. Tissue hypoxia is important in CD pathogenesis and may be ameliorated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). We assessed the efficacy and tolerability of HBOT in small bowel stricturing CD.
METHODS: This pilot study included patients of small bowel stricturing CD (from April 2019 to January 2020) who underwent HBOT. These patients were refractory to conventional medical treatment or had multiple strictures not amenable to resection. Each session of HBOT was given for 60 minutes with a pressure of 1.5-2.5 atm. Clinical, biochemical responses and Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SIBD) questionnaire were evaluated at 2 and 6 months, and radiological response was evaluated at 6 months.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (mean age, 42.9±15.7 years; male, 50%) were subjected to 168 HBOT sessions. Thirteen patients (92.7%) had strictures and 1 patient had enterocutaneous fistula in addition. Median number of HBOT sessions was 11 (range, 3-20) which were administered over a median of 4 weeks. Most patients tolerated it well except 1 who had hemotympanum. At 2 and 6 months of follow-up, 64.2% of patients had a clinical response, 50% and 64.2% of patients had clinical remission respectively. Steroid-free clinical remission was seen in 8 (57%) of patients with radiological improvement in 50%. There was a significant improvement in SIBD scores at 2-month follow-up (59.4 vs. 44.5, P=0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: HBOT can be a safe and effective therapeutic option in patients with stricturing small bowel CD refractory to conventional medical treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The information on seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and its comparison to healthy controls is sparse. We compared the seroprevalence rates in patients with IBD and healthy controls (HCs).
METHODS: Patients with IBD and HCs (contact of patients) underwent SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing (chemiluminescent immunoassay: Siemens kit IgG against antigen-S1RBD) between July 2020 and April 2021. Information on demography, disease characteristics, drug history and past history of SARS-CoV-2 infection were noted. Patients on 5-aminosalicylic acid or no treatment were considered not on immunosuppressants and those who had received steroids, thiopurines or methotrexate within six months of inclusion were considered being on immunosuppressants.
RESULTS: A total of 235 patients (51.9%, males; mean age, 38.7 ± 12.4 years; median disease duration, 60 months [interquartile range, IQR: 36-120]) (ulcerative colitis [UC]: 69.4%, Crohn's disease [CD]: 28.9%, IBD unclassified [IBDU]: 1.7%) and 73 HCs (mean age, 39.6 ± 10.9 years, 80% males) were enrolled. Of the 235 patients, 128 (54.5%) patients were on immunosuppressants and 107 (45.5%) were not on immunosuppressants. Seventy-four (31.5%) patients were seropositive, of which two (0.9%) had previous history of SARS-CoV-2 infection and none received coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) vaccine. Seroprevalence between IBD patients and HCs (32% vs. 27%, p > 0.05) and between patients with and without immunosuppressants (28.1% vs. 36%, p > 0.05) was similar. Age, gender, disease type, duration and activity in the last six months; and medication use were similar between patients with positive and negative serology. There was a progressive increase in seroprevalence from July 2020 to April 2021.
CONCLUSION: Up to 1/3rd of patients with IBD were seropositive for immunoglobulin G (IgG) SARS-Cov-2 antibody indicating high seroprevalence in patients with IBD from Northern India.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Curing Coma Campaign (CCC) was launched by the Neurocritical Care Society (NCS) in 2019, with the purpose to bring together a diverse group of coma scientists, neurointensivists, and neurorehabilitationists.
METHODS: The aim of this campaign is to move beyond the limitations imposed by current definitions of coma and identify mechanisms to improve prognostication, identify test therapies, and impact outcomes. At the moment, whole approach of the CCC appears ambitiously challenging.
RESULTS: This could be true only for the Western world, such as the North America, Europe, and few developed countries. However, the whole concept of CCC may face potential challenges in the lower-middle income countries. India has several stumbling blocks that need to and can be addressed in the future, for a meaningful outcome, as envisaged in the CCC.
CONCLUSION: India has several potential challenges, which we aim to discuss in this article.

T2  - Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine: Peer-Reviewed, Official Publication of Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: Midline shift (MLS) of the brain is an important clinical finding diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) imaging and transcranial sonography (TCS) can help diagnose MLS at the bedside and facilitate interventions to improve outcomes. The study aimed to find an association between TCS- and CT-based assessments of MLS in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included all adult patients with moderate-to-severe TBI of either gender, aged between 18 and 65 years, undergoing intracranial surgery under general anesthesia over a period of 3 months. Consciousness was assessed with the help of the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and Glasgow coma scale-pupillary (GCS-P) score. We calculated MLS using a CT scan and TCS. Bland Altman graph along with Pearson's and Spearman's coefficient tests was used.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were analyzed in this study. The MLS was 0.52 ± 0.90 cm using TCS and 0.58 ± 0.39 cm using CT scan. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r 2) of the difference between MLS measured by TCS and CT imaging was 0.002 (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Transcranial sonography could detect MLS in patients with TBI, provided a minimum time window is used between MLS measurements by TCS and CT scan.

AB  - PURPOSE: Wrist reconstruction after distal radial tumor resection poses a challenge to the orthopedic oncologist. We evaluated the functional outcomes of centralization of the ulna with ulnocarpal arthrodesis as a method of reconstruction following resection of distal radius tumors, using impairment measures and patient-reported outcomes.
METHODS: Evaluation of functional outcome was performed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 scoring system and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. We also determined hand grip strength on the affected side, time to radiologic union at the ulnocarpal junction and reduction in wrist circumference. Local complications and oncologic outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: The study included 26 patients with Campanacci grade 3 giant cell tumor of the distal radius. Mean follow-up period in the study was 32.8 ± 12 months. Mean resection length was 10.3 ± 2.5 cm. Radiologic union at the ulnocarpal junction was achieved in 38.5%, 77% and 96% of the patients by 4, 5, and 6 months respectively. Mean hand grip strength was 74 ± 3.9% of the contralateral side whereas mean reduction in wrist circumference was 16.9 ± 6.4%. A good functional outcome with a mean the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 score of 26 ± 1.4 and mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score of 10.5 ± 6.3 was observed. Fracture of the ulna, hardware loosening, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy were each noted in 1 patient, with an overall complication rate of 10.7% (3/28). No patient had nonunion, infection, or local recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: This is a simple and effective modality of reconstruction after resection of distal radial tumors. It provides good functional outcome and preservation of good hand grip strength, with low complication rates.

AB  - PURPOSE: Re-implantation of the tumor bearing autograft following extracorporeal radiation therapy (ECRT) has been established as an oncologically safe biological reconstruction technique following resection of bone sarcomas. However, factors affecting the ECRT graft-host bone incorporation have not been fully investigated. An insight into the factors that influence graft incorporation can circumvent the complications and increase graft survival.
METHODS: A total of 96 osteotomies in 48 patients with intercalary resections of primary extremity bone sarcomas (mean age 15.8 years, mean follow-up 42.1 months) were analyzed retrospectively for factors ECRT autograft-host bone union.
RESULTS: On univariate analysis, age < 20 years, metaphyseal osteotomy site, V-shaped diaphyseal osteotomy, and use of additional plate at diaphyseal osteotomy had a significantly faster time to union, while gender, tumour type, bone involved, resection length, chemotherapy, type of fixation, and use of intra-medullary fibula did not influence union time. In multivariate analysis, V-shaped diaphyseal osteotomy and use of additional plate at diaphyseal ostetomy were the independent factors with favourable time to union. None of the analyzed factors was found to have a significant effect on the union rate. The major complications were non-union in 11.4% patients, graft failure in 2.1%, infection in 12.5%, and soft tissue local recurrences in 14.5% patients.
CONCLUSION: Modified diaphyseal osteotomy and augmentation of the stability of the reconstruction using additional small plates enhance the incorporation of ECRT autograft.

AU  - Digge, Vijay Kumar
T2  - Journal of Orthopaedics
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of tendoachilles (TA) tendon using double row reconstruction (speedbridge technique) following excision of haglund deformity is relatively newer technique. The purpose was to assess the clinical outcome and effects of early postoperative mobilization with speedbridge technique.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study performed between January 2018 to February 2019. All the patients underwent open excision of haglund deformity after complete detachment of TA tendon. Reconstruction of TA tendon was done using fibretape and 4.75 mm biocomposite Swivelock [ArthrexAchilles SpeedBridge Convenience Pack (AR-8928 BC-CP)].Clinical evaluation was done using American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Hind Foot Score (HFS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Patients were followed at 6weeks, 6 months,12 months,18 months and 2 years.
RESULTS: 11 female and 2 male patients (16 feet) with mean age of 53.00 ± 4.93 years were analyzed. Full weight bearing mobilization was started on an average of 10 days postoperatively.The mean postoperative HFS, at 24 months of postoperative period, was 87.61 ± 4.69 compared to mean preoperative HFS of 53.07 ± 5.93.
CONCLUSION: Haglund deformity excision and reconstruction of Tendoachilles using double row technique is an agile construct for early mobilization with an excellent clinical outcome.

T2  - Indian Journal of Anaesthesia
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is an effective analgesic technique for breast surgery, although it has many associated complications. Ultrasound (US)-guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block requires less technical expertise, is safe and may be an alternative to TEA. We aimed to compare the efficacy of TEA with US-guided continuous ESP block for post-operative analgesia in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy (MRM) surgeries.
METHODS: Sixty-six female patients of age group 18-65 years, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, undergoing MRM surgeries were recruited. Patients received TEA in Group Ep and US-guided ESP block in Group Er, before induction of general anaesthesia. Both the groups received 0.2% ropivacaine 15 mL, followed by 5 mL.h-1 infusion for 24 h. The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia. Secondary outcomes were total doses of rescue analgesics in 24 hours and visual analogue scale (VAS) scores at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h.
RESULTS: The mean duration of analgesia was 21.72 ± 4.73 hours in Ep group and 20.60 ± 5.77 hours in Er group (P = 0.39). The total dose of rescue analgesics in the postoperative period was comparable between both the groups. There was no significant difference in VAS scores between the groups over 24 h.
CONCLUSION: US-guided ESP block can be used as safe and easy to perform alternative analgesic technique over thoracic epidural analgesia for peri-operative pain management in breast cancer surgeries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with multi-vessel disease presenting with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the efficacy and safety of ischemia-guided, vs routine non-culprit vessel angioplasty has not been adequately studied.
METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, non-inferiority trial comparing ischemia-guided non-culprit vessel angioplasty to routine non-culprit vessel angioplasty, following primary PCI for STEMI. The primary outcome was the between-group difference in percent ischemic myocardium at follow-up stress MPI. All MPI images were processed and analyzed at a central core lab, blinded to treatment allocation.
RESULTS: In all, 109 patients were enrolled from nine countries. In the ischemia-guided arm, 25/48 (47%) patients underwent non-culprit vessel PCI following stress MPI. In the routine non-culprit PCI arm, 43/56 (77%) patients underwent angioplasty (86% within 6 weeks of randomization). The median percentage of ischemic myocardium on follow-up imaging (mean 16.5 months) was low, and identical (2.9%) in both arms (difference 0.13%, 95%CI - 1.3%-1.6%, P < .0001; non-inferiority margin 5%).
CONCLUSION: A strategy of ischemia-guided non-culprit PCI resulted in low ischemia burden, and was non-inferior to a strategy of routine non-culprit vessel PCI in reducing ischemia burden. Selective non-culprit PCI following STEMI offers the potential for cost-savings, and may be particularly relevant to low-resource settings. (CTRI/2018/08/015384).

AB  - Punicalagin is the most bioactive pomegranate polyphenol with high antioxidant and free-radical scavenging activity and can potentially cure different ailments related to the cardiovascular system. The current research work was envisioned to predict the targeting efficiency of punicalagin (PG) nanoparticles to the macrophages, more specifically to bone marrow macrophages. For this, we selected mannose-decorated PLGA-punicalagin nanoparticles (Mn-PLGA-PG), and before formulating this nanocarrier in laboratory settings, we predicted the targeting efficiency of this nanocarrier by in silico analysis. The analysis proceeded with macrophage mannose receptors to be acquainted with the binding affinity and punicalagin-based nanocarrier interactions with this receptor. In silico docking studies of macrophage mannose receptors and punicalagin showed binding interactions on its surface. PG interacted with hydrogen bonds to the charged residue ASP668 and GLY666 and polar residue GLN760 of the Mn receptor. Mannose with a docking score of -5.811 Kcal/mol interacted with four hydrogen bonds and the mannose receptor of macrophage, and in PLGA, it showed a -4.334 Kcal/mol docking score. Further, the analysis proceeded with density functional theory analysis (DFT) and HOMO-LUMO analysis, followed by an extensive 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation to analyse the trajectories showing the slightest deviation and fluctuation. While analysing the ligand and protein interaction, a wonderful interaction was found among the atoms of the ligand and protein residues. This computational study confirms that this nanocarrier could be a promising lead molecule to regulate the incidence of drug-induced neutropenia. Furthermore, experimental validation is required before this can be stated with complete confidence or before human use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: India accounts for one-fifth of the global burden of cervical cancer cases and mortality. A safe and effective vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the primary cause of cervical malignancies, is available in India but multiple barriers lead to its low uptake in the country. Physicians are a key stakeholder and communicator in the Indian health system and have the potential to increase HPV vaccine uptake.
OBJECTIVE: We undertook formative research to understand awareness, perceptions and choices of physicians when recommending the HPV vaccine to parents of adolescent girls.
METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 32 physicians in two districts of West Bengal. Data collection was carried out between July and August 2019. The data was transcribed, coded, and analyzed using NVivo software using the thematic analysis technique.
RESULTS: Our findings suggest that while physicians are generally aware about the burden of cervical cancer and its prevention by HPV vaccination, they face several barriers to recommending the HPV vaccine routinely and strongly. These include the lack of national-level guidance on the age eligibility and dosage, lack of practice-level opportunities such as well or non-sick visits and other routine adolescent vaccines, practice-level barriers like out-of-pocket cost and vaccine availability, and perceived parental hesitancy arising from reluctance to discuss cervical cancer, its prevention, and HPV vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians in our study exhibited hesitancy when recommending the HPV vaccine. They also faced logistical barriers. It is important that the barriers pertaining to when and how physicians recommend the vaccine be tackled through further education, policy change, and development and implementation of interventions that are evidenced-based.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A novel agar-based phantom was developed and assessed for ultrasonography (USG)-guided brain biopsy training. The phantom provides visual cues combined with sonologic cues, allowing multimodal training. Impact of multimodal training is evaluated through pretraining and posttraining trials.
METHODS: Twenty-five participants were divided based on experience with USG-based procedures into familiar (≥3 procedures performed in the past) (n = 14) and unfamiliar (<3 procedures performed) (n = 11). Agar phantoms with an opaque top and transparent middle layer were constructed in transparent glass bowls, each having 12 embedded targets. Participants underwent 2 supervised trials of USG-guided biopsy with aluminum foil covering the glass bowls, eliminating visual cues. Between 2 trials, participants underwent unsupervised self-training on a phantom without foil cover, providing visual cues. Performance was measured through insonation efficiency (EfI), biopsy efficiency (EfB), efficiency score (Ef), error score (Er), and performance score (PS). Scores were compared between and within the 2 groups before and after training. Impact of the self-training session on subjective comfort levels with the procedure was assessed through feedback forms.
RESULTS: Familiars had better pretraining EfB, Ef, Er, and PS (P < 0.001) compared with unfamiliars. After training, both performed similarly on all metrics. After training, familiars improved only in EfI (P = 0.001), with the unfamiliars showing significance in all metrics except EfI.
CONCLUSIONS: Simulation and phantom-based models can never supplant training through supervised skill application in vivo but our model supplements training by enabling technical skill acquisition, especially for beginners in USG-guided brain biopsy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare associated infections (HAIs) are prevalent and difficult to treat worldwide. Most HAIs can be prevented by effective implementation of Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) measures. A survey was conducted to assess the existing IPC practices across a network of Indian Hospitals using the World Health Organization designed self-assessment IPC Assessment Framework (IPCAF) tool.
METHODS: This was a cross sectional observation study. Thirty-two tertiary care public and private facilities, part of the existing Indian HAI surveillance network was included. Data collected was analyzed by a central team at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, a tertiary care hospital of India. The WHO questionnaire tool was used to understand the capacity and efforts to implement IPC practices across the network.
RESULTS: The overall median score of IPCAF across the network was 620. Based on the final IPCAF score of the facilities; 13% hospitals had basic IPC practices, 28% hospitals had intermediate and 59% hospitals had advanced IPC practices. The component multimodal strategies had the broadest range of score while the component IPC guidelines had the narrowest one.
CONCLUSIONS: Quality improvement training for IPC nurses and healthcare professionals are needed to be provided to health facilities.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the second wave of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), superinfection caused by fungus and multidrug-resistant bacteria worsened the severity of illness in COVID-19 patients. Limited studies from India reported the antimicrobial resistance pattern of secondary infections. In this study, we aim to study the epidemiology of pathogens causing superinfections and genotyping of Gram-negative isolates in COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 center, India. The identification of bacteria/fungi was done by Vitek2® and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry system. Identification of beta-lactamase genes was done using thermal cycler. The diagnosis of mucormycosis was based on 10% potassium hydroxide direct microscopy. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 15.1 (StataCorp., College Station, TX, USA). For continuous variables, mean and standard deviation were computed. For comparing proportions of secondary infections across admission location and outcomes, the Chi-squared test of independence was used. To compare the mean and median between intensive care units and outcomes, an independent t-test and a Mann-Whitney test were used.
RESULTS: Of all the clinical samples, 45.4% of samples were cultured positive for secondary infections. Acinetobacter baumannii (35%) was the most common Gram-negative pathogen, while among Gram positive, it was Enterococcus faecium (40%). Among fungus, Candida spp. (61%) predominates followed by molds. Colistin and tigecycline proved effective against these pathogens. blaNDM was the most prevalent gene followed by the blaOX among the carbapenemase genes.
CONCLUSIONS: The mortality rate among COVID-19 patients with secondary infection was significantly higher compared to the overall mortality rate in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyze macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), a bone remodeling biomarker in the peri-miniscrew implant crevicular fluid (PMICF) after insertion and orthodontic loading.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 40 miniscrew implant (MSI) sites in 10 subjects undergoing fixed orthodontic mechanotherapy utilizing miniscrew anchorage. After dental alignment, miniscrews were inserted between the second premolar and first molar roots. After 21 days of insertion, MSIs were direct loaded with closed-coil springs (200 g force) for en masse retraction of anterior teeth. PMICF was collected with Periopaper™ strips from the gingival crevice around MSIs at six time points (T1-T6: 1 hour, 1 day, 21 days postinsertion, and 7, 21, and 42 days postloading). PMICF was quantified for M-CSF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Paired comparison of mean M-CSF concentrations before and after loading stages (T1-T6) was made using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
RESULTS: The mean M-CSF concentration showed a significant peak at T3 (21 days postinsertion; 12.646 pg/mL; T1 vs T3: P < .0001). After orthodontic loading of miniscrews, M-CSF levels increased to 13.570 pg/mL at T4 (7 days after loading; T1 vs T4: P < .001) and maintained at a plateau to T5 (21 days postloading; 11.994 pg/mL). However, the difference between preloading and postloading was not statistically significant (T3 vs T4).
CONCLUSIONS: The maximum M-CSF activity around MSIs was observed at around 3 weeks of miniscrew insertion, suggesting underlying bone remodeling after surgical injury. However, orthodontic force on MSIs did not cause any significant surge in M-CSF levels postloading.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) presents with a spectrum of cognitive impairment due to stroke and poses a huge socioeconomic burden especially in low middle-income countries. There is a critical need for early recognition and identification of VCI patients. Therefore, we developed and validated culturally appropriate neuropsychological instruments, the ICMR-Neuro Cognitive Tool-Box (ICMR-NCTB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to diagnose vascular MCI and dementia in the Indian context.
METHODS: A total of 181 participants: 59 normal cognition, 25 stroke with normal cognition, 46 vascular MCI (VaMCI) and 51 vascular dementia (VaD) were recruited for the study. The ICMR-NCTB and MoCA were administered to patients with VCI and major cognitive domains were evaluated.
RESULTS: The ICMR-NCTB was found to have good internal reliability in VaMCI and VaD. The sensitivity of the ICMR-NCTB to detect VaMCI and VaD ranged from 70.8% to 72.9% and 75.9% to 79.7%, respectively, and the specificity for VaMCI and VaD ranged from 84.8% to 86.1% and 82.5% to 85.2%, respectively. The MoCA had excellent sensitivity and specificity to detect VaMCI and VaD at ideal cut-off scores.
CONCLUSION: The ICMR-NCTB is a valid neuropsychological toolbox that can be used for comprehensive cognitive assessment and diagnosis of VCI in India. In addition, the Indian version of MoCA is more adept as a screening instrument to detect VCI due to its high sensitivity. The ICMR-NCTB will aid in early detection and management of many patients, thereby reducing the burden of vascular MCI and dementia in India.

AB  - Diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using biomarkers in order to identify the risk of progressing to active TB and therefore predicting a preventive therapy has been the main bottleneck in eradication of tuberculosis. We compared two assays for the diagnosis of LTBI: transcript signatures and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), among household contacts (HHCs) in a high tuberculosis-burden population. HHCs of active TB cases were recruited for our study; these were confirmed to be clinically negative for active TB disease. Eighty HHCs were screened by IGRA using QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) to identify LTBI and uninfected cohorts; further, quantitative levels of transcript for selected six genes (TNFRSF10C, ASUN, NEMF, FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5) were determined. Machine learning (ML) was used to construct models of different gene combinations, with a view to identify hidden but significant underlying patterns of their transcript levels. Forty-three HHCs were found to be IGRA positive (LTBI) and thirty-seven were IGRA negative (uninfected). FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5 transcripts differentiated LTBI from uninfected among HHCs using Livak method. ML and ROC (Receiver Operator Characteristic) analysis validated this transcript signature to have a specificity of 72.7%. In this study, we compared a quantitative transcript signature with IGRA to assess the diagnostic ability of the two, for detection of LTBI cases among HHCs of a high-TB burden population; we concluded that a three gene (FCGR1B, GBP1, and GBP5) transcript signature can be used as a biomarker for rapid screening. IMPORTANCE The study compares potential of transcript signature and IGRA to diagnose LTBI. It is first of its kind study to screen household contacts (HHCs) in high TB burden area of India. A transcript signature (FCGR1B, GBP1, & GBP5) is identified as potential biomarker for LTBI. These results can lead to development of point-of-care (POC) like device for LTBI screening in a high TB burdened area.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Early dementia diagnosis in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) is challenging due to limited availability of brief, culturally appropriate, and psychometrically validated tests. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is one of the most widely used cognitive screening tests in primary and secondary care globally. In the current study, we adapted and validated MoCA in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam) and determined the optimal cut-off points that correspond to screening for clinical diagnosis of dementia and MCI.
METHODS: A systematic process of adaptation and modifications of MoCA was fulfilled. A total of 446 participants: 214 controls, 102 dementia, and 130 MCI were recruited across six centers.
RESULTS: Across five languages, the area under the curve for diagnosis of dementia varied from 0.89 to 0.98 and MCI varied from 0.73 to 0.96. The sensitivity, specificity and optimum cut-off scores were established separately for five Indian languages.
CONCLUSIONS: The Indian adapted MoCA is standardized and validated in five Indian languages for early diagnosis of dementia and MCI in a linguistically and culturally diverse population.

T2  - Addiction & Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recovery capital helps in the assessment of the personal strengths and challenges that exist in an individual with substance use which may have an impact on recovery process. This study aims at finding out the factors which help such individuals to sustain their recovery and how these factors differ across the two groups of people suffering from Alcohol Dependence Syndrome and Opioid Dependence Syndrome.
METHODS: A cross-sectional observational was designed where sociodemographic and clinical variables, the recovery capital ARC (Assessment of Recovery Capital) Scale and Severity of substance use SDS (Severity of Dependence) Scale of patients diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence Syndrome (ADS group) and those with Opioid Dependence Syndrome (ODS group) were assessed among patients not reporting withdrawal symptoms.
FINDINGS: A total of 49 subjects in the ODS group and 30 subjects in the ADS group were enrolled. The majority of the subjects in both groups were married, belonged to urban areas, practiced Hinduism, and were living in nuclear families. There was a significant difference between the educational status (p<0.001), religion practiced (p<0.001), age of onset of dependence (p<0.001), severity of dependence (p=0.11), and duration of abstinence (p<0.001) between the ADS and ODS groups. The mean scores on ARC Scale were 45.9 (S.D. =3.5) in the ODS group and 47.4 (S.D. =4.3) in the ADS group. ADS group had higher scores in Social Support Domain (p=0.034) and Housing and Safety domain (p=0.025). Other domains like global health, citizenship, meaningful activities, risk-taking, coping, and recovery experience did not significantly differ between the groups.
CONCLUSION: This study aims at comparing the recovery capital of ADS patients with ODS patients. It also suggests that tailored treatment plans for people with ADS and ODS especially in housing and social support and common treatment approach in other domains of recovery will help them sustain the state for a longer term.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study consists of retrospective data in which 356 Tc-99m MDP bone scan images (178 anterior and 178 posterior) were processed using dynamic stochastic resonance algorithm, block-matching 3D filter, and then restored using BD algorithm. Two nuclear medicine (NM) physicians compared restored image with its input image; they especially lookedfor: (a) improvement in lesions detectability, (b) artifacts if any, (c) deterioration in ribs and vertebra, and (d) contrast enhancement in adjacent vertebra and adjacent ribs. They selected one out of two (restored and input) images, which had better quality. The overall image quality was also assessed using the following image quality metrics: brightness, blur, global contrast factor, and contrast per pixel. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied for finding significant difference between the value of image quality metrics of restored image and input image at level of significance alpha = 0.05.
RESULTS: According to NM physicians, 80.3% (286 out of 356) of restored images were acceptable, whereas 19.6% (70 out of 356) were unacceptable. Ribs and vertebrae were prominent in 161 out of 178 posterior restored images. Lumbar vertebrae were enhanced and well differentiated from adjacent vertebrae in 125 out of 178 anterior restored images. The value of image quality metrics of restored and input images were found to be significantly different ( P -value < 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Ribs, vertebrae, and lesions present in them become prominent in the most of Tc-99m MDP bone scan images (80.3%) restored using BD algorithm.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In pathology practice, one frequently encounters benign lesions which superficially resemble malignancy clinically and histopathologically. The diagnostic pitfalls can be avoided if the approach exemplified in the present study is followed. We expect that familiarity of these cases will be helpful for pathologists at the beginning of their career.
METHODS: Clinical case records of all the pathological specimens reported in our laboratory from January 2018 to September 2019 were queried. Cases displaying pseudotumor features were reviewed along with the special stains were performed and immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies. A working classification of pseudotumors presenting in the oral cavity was proposed.
RESULTS: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease, nodular fasciitis, fibrolipoma, odontogenic keratocyst with giant cell granuloma, juvenile ossifying fibroma with central giant cell granuloma and tumor-induced osteomalacia were the most common diagnoses where the tissue specimens resembled malignancies on routine clinicoradiological evaluation and light microscopy of tissue specimens. Their differential diagnosis and the pathological diagnostic dilemmas are explained. We have also highlighted the importance of correlating clinical, radiological and microscopic details with the findings deduced from advanced pathological aids to establish the final diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Pathologists should be aware of the conditions where the diagnosis of malignancy needs stricter evaluation to rule out malignant mimics. In such scenarios, correlation of light microscopy findings with clinical and radiological details cannot be overemphasized. Advanced pathological aids such as IHC, where necessary are often indispensable for reaching the accurate diagnosis in these cases.

T2  - The Journal of Contemporary Dental Practice
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the flexural strength of heat polymerized denture base resin after thermocycling and different surface treatments done prior to repair or relining.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this in vitro study, 80 specimens were made with heat-polymerized denture base resin and thermocycled (500 cycles between 5 and 55 °C). The specimens were divided in four groups based on different types of surface treatment: group I (control group: without surface treatment), group II (chloroform for 30 seconds), group III [methyl methacrylate (MMA) for 180 seconds], and group IV (dichloromethane for 15 seconds). The flexural strength was assessed using a Universal testing machine with three-point bending test. The obtained data were subjected to statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests.
RESULTS: The values of average flexural strength of denture base resin measured were as follows: group I: 111.1 MPa, group II: 86.9 MPa, group III: 73.1 MPa, and group IV: 78.8 MPa. Groups II and IV possessed superior flexural strength than group III. The maximum values were observed with the control group.
CONCLUSION: The flexural strength of heat-polymerized denture base resin gets affected by different surface treatments done prior to relining procedures. Lowest flexural strength was obtained when treated with MMA monomer for 180 seconds as compared to the other etchants used.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Prior to denture repair procedures, operators must choose the chemical surface treatment judiciously. It should not affect the mechanical properties such as flexural strength of denture base resins. Reduction in flexural strength of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) denture base can predispose the prosthesis to deteriorated performance when in function.

AB  - The high prevalence and persistence of microplastics (MPs) in pristine habitats along with their accumulation across environmental compartments globally, has become a matter of grave concern. The resilience conferred to MPs using the material engineering approaches for outperforming other materials has become key to the challenge that they now represent. The characteristics that make MPs hazardous are their micro to nano scale dimensions, surface varied wettability and often hydrophobicity, leading to non-biodegradability. In addition, MPs exhibit a strong tendency to bind to other contaminants along with the ability to sustain extreme chemical conditions thus increasing their residence time in the environment. Adsorption of these co-contaminants leads to modification in toxicity varying from additive, synergistic, and sometimes antagonistic, having consequences on flora, fauna, and ultimately the end of the food chain, human health. The resulting environmental fate and associated risks of MPs, therefore greatly depend upon their complex interactions with the co-contaminants and the nature of the environment in which they reside. Net outcomes of such complex interactions vary with core characteristics of MPs, the properties of co-contaminants and the abiotic factors, and are required to be better understood to minimize the inherent risks. Toxicity assays addressing these concerns should be ecologically relevant, assessing the impacts at different levels of biological organization to develop an environmental perspective. This review analyzed and evaluated 171 studies to present research status on MP toxicity. This analysis supported the identification and development of research gaps and recommended priority areas of research, accounting for disproportionate risks faced by different countries. An ecological perspective is also developed on the environmental toxicity of contaminated MPs in the light of multi-variant stressors and directions are provided to conduct an ecologically relevant risk assessment. The presented analyses will also serve as a foundation for developing environmentally appropriate remediation methods and evaluation frameworks.

AB  - Hypertension is the leading single preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI) project was designed to improve hypertension control in public sector clinics. The project was launched in 2018-2019 in 26 districts across five states: Punjab (5), Madhya Pradesh (3), Kerala (4), Maharashtra (4), and Telangana (10), with five core strategies: standard treatment protocol, reliable supply of free antihypertensive drugs, team-based care, patient-centered care, and an information system to track individual patient treatment and blood pressure control. All states implemented simple treatment protocols with three drugs: a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (amlodipine), angiotensin receptor blocker (telmisartan), and thiazide or a thiazide-like diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide or chlorthalidone). Medication supplies were adequate to support at least one month of treatment. Overall, 570,365 hypertensives were enrolled in 2018-2019; 11% did not have follow-up visits in the most recent 12 months. Clinic-level blood pressure control averaged 43% (range 22-79%) by Jan-March, 2020. The proportion of the estimated people with hypertension who had it controlled and documented in public clinics increased three-fold, albeit from very low levels (1.4-5.0%). The IHCI demonstrated the feasibility of implementing protocol-based hypertension treatment and control supported by a reliable drug supply and accurate information systems at scale in Indian primary health care facilities. Lessons from the IHCI's initial phase will inform plans to improve screening in health care facilities, increase retention in care, and ensure a sustained supply of drugs as part of a nationwide hypertension control program.

AB  - PURPOSE: Penetrating abdominal trauma was traditionally managed by mandatory exploration, which led to high rates of non-therapeutic surgery and prolonged hospital stay. Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) is a less-invasive alternative; however, it requires general anaesthesia and carries a potential risk of iatrogenic injuries. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT)-guided selective non-operative management (SNOM) may avoid surgery altogether, but there is apprehension of missed injury. Randomised trials comparing these two modalities are lacking. This study is aimed at comparing outcomes of these two management approaches.
METHODS: Hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating trauma to anterior abdominal wall were randomised in 1:1 ratio to DL or CECT-based management. Primary outcome was length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary outcomes were rate of non-therapeutic surgery, complications, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.
RESULTS: There were 52 patients in DL group and 54 patients in CECT group. Mean LOS was comparable (3 vs 3.5 days; p = 0.423). Rate of non-therapeutic surgery was significantly lower in CECT group (65.4 vs 17.4%, p = 0.0001). Rate of complications and length of ICU stay were similar. Selective non-operative management based on CECT findings was successful in 93.8% of patients; 2 patients had delayed surgery.
CONCLUSION: In patients with penetrating trauma to anterior abdominal wall, DL and CECT-based management led to comparable hospital stay. Significant reduction in non-therapeutic surgery could be achieved using a CECT-based approach.

AU  - Kaur, Tejinder
AU  - Joshi, Akshay
AU  - Singh, Neetu
T2  - Biomaterials Advances
AB  - Any interference in the timely and orderly progression through all the phases of healing process can turn a minor injury into a chronic wound. Most of the wound dressings available in the market are moderately effective and have not shown satisfactory improvement in healing. Along with the appropriate wound management, it is imperative for a dressing to facilitate the wound repair process too. In the present research, we hypothesize to improve the wound healing process by applying cost effective natural cocktail of various bioactive factors. Bovine colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins, lactoferrin, hormones and cytokines which play significant role in wound healing. Hence, multifunctional colostrum conjugated PCL-PEG based nanofibrous dressings were developed and analyzed for their physicochemical properties and cellular responses. The dressings were also evaluated for cell migration, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties. In-vivo wound healing ability was validated on a rat wound model. Numerous growth factors present in the colostrum showed their role in stimulation of skin repair and regeneration by direct action on genetic material. Significantly less inflammation in colostrum treated wounds was observed due to anti-inflammatory properties of lactoferrin. Thus obtained results confirmed the suitability of these multifunctional colostrum conjugated nanofibrous dressings for improved wound healing.

T2  - Indian Journal of Public Health
AB  - BACKGROUND: An outreach (OR) health-care facility providing broad specialty outpatient services was started by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in rural area of district Jhajjar, Haryana.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to ascertain the resource requirement for establishing an OR health-care facility and patient satisfaction with regard to the services being provided.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2017 at an OR Outpatient Department (OPD) of AIIMS, New Delhi, at Jhajjar. Service delivery model adopted for health-care delivery was hub and spoke. Traditional method of costing was used for economic evaluation. Feedback pro forma of 400 patients who attended OPD services was analyzed to measure health service accessibility.
RESULTS: Capital expenditure to set up the facility was calculated to be approximately INR 17,57,49,074/- ($ 2,703,832) and operational cost per year was approximately INR 8,73,86,370/- ($ 1,344,406). Approximate per-patient cost for single OPD consultation was calculated to be INR 874 ($13.45) which included medicines and investigations. High scores for all domains of accessibility of health care were observed.
CONCLUSION: The study provides a preliminary evidence that OR health-care facilities can be instrumental in increasing access to health-care delivery with lesser capital outlays, however, large-scale multicentric studies are needed to arrive at any conclusion. The services have been very well accepted by the local community members being quality medical care with highly subsidized health-care services.

TI  - Effect of sevoflurane versus desflurane on blood glucose level in patients undergoing intracranial neurosurgery: A randomised controlled study
AU  - Kaushal, Ashutosh
AU  - Bindra, Ashish
AU  - Dube, Surya Kumar
T2  - Indian Journal of Anaesthesia
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Anaesthetic agents can affect the neuroendocrine response to surgical stress. Along with affecting other parameters, this can affect blood glucose levels. This study aimed to compare the effect of sevoflurane and desflurane on hourly intraoperative blood glucose levels in non-diabetic patients undergoing intracranial surgery.
METHODS: A total of 70 adults (18-65 years) of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II undergoing elective intracranial surgery for supratentorial and infratentorial lesions were enroled. Patients were randomised to receive either sevoflurane or desflurane as the maintenance anaesthetic agent. The blood glucose level was measured hourly after induction until the completion of surgery. Parametric tests, non-parametric tests, Friedman test, generalised estimating equations, Chi-square test, and Fisher's exact test were used to analyse the data.
RESULTS: In the sevoflurane group, the mean (standard deviation) blood glucose (mg/dL) increased from 93.34 (9.33) at the baseline to a maximum of 102.00 (8.61) at the 9 hours timepoint. This change was statistically significant (P < 0.001). In the desflurane group, the mean blood sugar (mg/dL) increased from 89.34 (9.85) at the baseline to a maximum of 92.37 (9.92) at the 4 hours timepoint and then decreased to 88.50 (0.71) at 9 hours timepoint.
CONCLUSION: Desflurane caused an initial rise followed by a decline, whereas a gradual increase in intraoperative blood glucose level was seen with sevoflurane use in non-diabetic adult patients undergoing elective neurosurgery. The intraoperative change in blood sugar was statistically significant but was within the normal clinical range.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gut-barrier dysfunction is well recognized in pathogenesis of both non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). However, comparison of components of this dysfunction between the two etiologies remains unexplored especially in early stages of NAFLD.
METHODS: Components of gut-barrier dysfunction like alterations in intestinal permeability (IP) by lactulose mannitol ratio (LMR) in urine, systemic endotoxemia (IgG and IgM anti-endotoxin antibodies), systemic inflammation (serum tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-α] and interleukin-1 [IL-1] levels), tight junction (TJ) proteins expression in duodenal biopsy and stool microbiota composition using Oxford Nanopore MinION device were prospectively evaluated in patients with NAFLD (n = 34) with no cirrhosis, ALD (n = 28) and were compared with disease free controls (n = 20).
RESULTS: Patients with ALD had more advanced disease than those with NAFLD (median liver stiffness -NAFLD:7.1 kPa [5.9-8.9] vs. ALD:14.3 kPa [9.6-24], P < 0.001]. Median LMR was significantly higher in NAFLD and ALD group when compared to controls (NAFLD 0.054 [0.037-0.17] vs. controls 0.027 [0.021-0.045] (P = 0.001)) and ALD 0.043 [0.03-0.068] vs. controls 0.027 [0.021-0.045] (P = 0.019)]. Anti-endotoxin antibody titer (IgM) (MMU/mL) was lowest in NAFLD 72.9 [3.2-1089.5] compared to ALD 120.6 [20.1-728]) (P = 0.042) and controls 155.3 [23.8-442.9]) (P = 0.021). Median TNF-α (pg/mL) levels were elevated in patients with NAFLD (53.3 [24.5-115]) compared to controls (16.1 [10.8-33.3]) (P < 0.001) and ALD (12.3 [10.1-42.7]) (P < 0.001). Expression of zonulin-1 and claudin-3 in duodenal mucosa was lowest in NAFLD. On principal co-ordinate analysis (PCoA), the global bacterial composition was significantly different across the three groups (PERMANOVA test, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: While remaining activated in both etiologies, gut-barrier dysfunction abnormalities were more pronounced in NAFLD at early stages compared to ALD despite more advanced disease in the latter.

AB  - In the absence of a sensitive and specific diagnostic modality capable of detecting all forms of tuberculosis (TB), proteomics may identify specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) proteins in urine, with a potential as biomarkers. To identify candidate biomarkers for TB, proteome profile of urine from pulmonary TB patients was compared with non-disease controls (NDC) and disease controls (DC, Streptococcus pneumonia infected patients) using a combination of two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS). Eleven differentially expressed host proteins and Eighteen high abundant M.tb proteins were identified. Protein-protein interactome (PPI) and functional enrichment analyses like Gene Ontologies, Reactome pathway etc. demonstrated that the human proteins mainly belong to extracellular space and show physiological pathways for immune response and hematological disorders. Whereas, M.tb proteins belong to the cell periphery, plasma membrane and cell wall, and demonstrated catalytic, nucleotide binding and ATPase activities along with other functional processes. The study findings provide valuable inputs about the biomarkers of TB and shed light on the probable disease consequences as an outcome of the bacterial pathogenicity.

AB  - JUSTIFICATION: Febrile seizures are quite common in children but there are controversies in many aspects of their diagnosis and management.
METHODS: An expert group consisting of pediatric neurologists and pediatricians was constituted. The modified Delphi method was used to develop consensus on the issues of definitions and investigations. The writing group members reviewed the literature and identified the contentious issues under these subheadings. The questions were framed, pruned, and discussed among the writing group members. The final questions were circulated to all experts during the first round of Delphi consensus. The results of the first round were considered to have arrived at a consensus if more than 75% experts agreed. Contentious issues that reached a 50-75% agreement was discussed further in online meetings and subsequently voting was done over an online platform to arrive at a consensus. Three rounds of Delphi were conducted to arrive at final statements.
RESULTS: The expert group arrived at a consensus on 52 statements. These statements pertain to definitions of febrile seizures, role of blood investigations, urine investigations, neuroimaging, electroencephalography (EEG), cerebrospinal fluid analysis and screening for micronutrient deficiency. In addition, role of rescue medications, intermittent anti-seizure medication and continuous prophylaxis, antipyretic medication and micronutrient supplementation have been covered.
CONCLUSIONS: This consensus statement addresses various contentious issues pertaining to the diagnosis and management of febrile seizures. Adoption of these statements in office practice will improve and standardize the care of children with this disorder.

AB  - Pain after prosthesis implant is a common clinical problem which requires distinction of septic from aseptic causes since the treatment differs. Non-invasive imaging methods play an important role in the diagnosis. Radiolabelled ubiquicidin can be used for imaging infection by binding directly to bacterial cell wall. We describe a case of a 24-year-old man with right lower limb megaprosthesis which did not show any loosening on computed tomography (CT) but was accurately diagnosed as infected prosthesis with 68Ga-NOTA-ubiquicidin(29-41) acetate scan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To ascertain presence of physiological uptake and derive standardized uptake values (SUV) of 68Ga-DOTANOC in normal myocardium and establish reference values.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Dedicated cardiac 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT studies of patients referred for evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) or myocarditis and found to be normal on visual assessment and on cardiac MRI were analyzed semiquantitatively. The studies were acquired 45-60 minutes after intravenous injection of 111-185 MBq of 68Ga-DOTANOC. Myocardial SUVmax normalized to lean body mass (SUVmax_lbm) values for septum, anterior wall, proximal lateral wall, distal lateral wall, inferior wall, and apical region were 1.12 ± .39, 1.09 ± .42, 1.26 ± .49, 1.16 ± .40, 1.23 ± .39, and 1.05 ± .40, respectively. Myocardial SUVmax_lbm-to-blood pool SUVmean_lbm ratios were calculated for each region and 95th percentile values of these ratios were considered the upper limit of normal. 95th percentile values of myocardial SUVmax_lbm-to-blood pool SUVmean_lbm ratio for the corresponding regions were 1.70, 1.70, 2.00 1.95, 2.05, and 1.70, respectively.
CONCLUSION: There can be physiological uptake of 68Ga-DOTANOC in normal myocardium and the reference values of semiquantitative parameters established in this study may be employed as a corroborative tool for visual assessment in patients undergoing 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT for suspected CS or myocarditis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-invasive biomarkers for early chemotherapeutic response in Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) are useful for optimizing existing treatment protocol.
PURPOSE: To assess the role of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the early evaluation of chemotherapeutic response in ESFT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 28 patients (mean age = 17.2 ± 5.6 years) with biopsy proven ESFT were analyzed prospectively. Patients underwent MRI acquisition on a 1.5-T scanner at three time points: before starting neoadjuvant chemotherapy (baseline), after first cycle chemotherapy (early time point), and after completion of chemotherapy (last time point). RECIST 1.1 criteria was used to evaluate the response to chemotherapy and patients were categorized as responders (complete and partial response) and non-responders (stable and progressive disease). Tumor diameter, absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and normalized ADC (nADC) values in the tumor were measured. Baseline parameters and relative percentage change of parameters after first cycle chemotherapy were assessed for early detection of chemotherapy response.
RESULTS: The responder:non-responder ratio was 21:7. At baseline, ADC ([0.864 ± 0.266 vs. 0.977 ± 0.246]) × 10-3mm2/s; P = 0.205) and nADC ([0.740 ± 0.254 vs. 0.925 ± 0.262] × 10-3mm2/s; P = 0.033) among responders was lower than the non-responders and predicted response to chemotherapy with AUCs of 0.6 and 0.735, respectively. At the early time point, tumor diameter (27% ± 14% vs. 4.6% ± 10%; P = 0.002) showed a higher reduction and ADC (75% ± 44% vs. 52% ± 72%; P = 0.039) and nADC (81% ± 44% vs. 48% ± 67%; P = 0.008) showed a higher increase in mean values among responders than the non-responders and identified chemotherapy response with AUC of 0.890, 0.723, and 0.756, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Baseline nADC and its change after the first cycle of chemotherapy can be used as non-invasive surrogate markers of early chemotherapeutic response in patients with ESFT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the status of brain tumor programs in Asia and Africa and propose comprehensive evidence-based short- and long-term measures for improving the existing systems.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in June 2022 by the Asia-Africa Neurosurgery Collaborative. A 27-item questionnaire was designed and distributed to gain insight into the status and future directions of brain tumor programs in Asia and Africa. Six components of brain tumor programs were identified-surgery, oncology, neuropathology, research, training, and finances-and assigned scores of 0-14. The total scores allowed subclassification of each country into levels of brain tumor program from I to VI.
RESULTS: A total of 110 responses from 92 countries were received. These were subdivided into 3 groups: group 1, countries with response from neurosurgeons (73 countries); group 2, countries with no neurosurgeons (19 countries); and group 3, countries without a neurosurgeon response (16 countries). The components associated with the highest level of brain tumor program were surgery, neuropathology, and oncology. Most countries in both continents had level III brain tumor programs with a mean surgical score of 2.24. The major lag between each group was with respect to the advances in neuropathology and financial support.
CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to improve and develop existing and nonexistent neuro-oncology infrastructure, personnel, and logistics in countries across the continents, especially for the countries with no neurosurgeons.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Microbiome and dietary manipulation therapies are being explored for treating ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to examine the efficacy of multidonor faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and anti-inflammatory diet in inducing remission followed by long-term maintenance with anti-inflammatory diet in patients with mild-moderate UC.
DESIGN: This open-labelled randomised controlled trial (RCT) randomised patients with mild-moderate (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) 3-9) endoscopically active UC (Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS)>1) on stable baseline medications in 1:1 ratio to FMT and anti-inflammatory diet (FMT-AID) versus optimised standard medical therapy (SMT). The FMT-AID arm received seven weekly colonoscopic infusions of freshly prepared FMT from multiple rural donors(weeks 0-6) with anti-inflammatory diet. Baseline medications were optimised in the SMT arm. Clinical responders (decline in SCCAI>3) at 8 weeks in both arms were followed until 48 weeks on baseline medications (with anti-inflammatory diet in the FMT-AID arm). Primary outcome measures were clinical response and deep remission (clinical-SCCAI <2; and endoscopic-UCEIS <1) at 8 weeks, and deep remission and steroid-free clinical remission at 48 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the 113 patients screened, 73 were randomised, and 66 were included in (35-FMT-AID; 31-SMT) modified intention-to-treat analysis (age-35.7±11.1 years; male-60.1%; disease duration-48 (IQR 24-84) months; pancolitis-34.8%; SCCAI-6 (IQR 5-7); UCEIS-4 (IQR 3-5)). Baseline characteristics were comparable. FMT-AID was superior to SMT in inducing clinical response (23/35 (65.7%) vs 11/31 (35.5%), p=0.01, OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 9.6)), remission (21/35 (60%) vs 10/31 (32.3%), p=0.02, OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.1 to 8.7)) and deep remission (12/33 (36.4%) vs 2/23 (8.7%), p=0.03, OR 6.0 (95% CI 1.2 to 30.2)) at 8 weeks. Anti-inflammatory diet was superior to SMT in maintaining deep remission until 48 weeks (6/24 (25%) vs 0/27, p=0.007).
CONCLUSION: Multidonor FMT with anti-inflammatory diet effectively induced deep remission in mild-moderate UC which was sustained with anti-inflammatory diet over 1 year.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 infections among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-vaccinated individuals are of clinical concern, especially in those requiring hospitalization. Such real-world data on ChAdOx1 nCoV-19- and BBV152-vaccinated individuals are scarce. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand their clinical profile and outcomes.
METHODS: A 1:1 pair-matched study was performed among vaccinated and unvaccinated COVID-19 patients admitted between March 2021 and June 2021 at a tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. The vaccinated group (received at least one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or BBV152) was prospectively followed till discharge or death and matched [for age (±10 years), sex, baseline disease severity and comorbidities] with a retrospective group of unvaccinated patients admitted during the study period. Paired analysis was done to look for clinical outcomes between the two groups.
RESULTS: The study included a total of 210 patients, with 105 in each of the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups. In the vaccinated group, 47 (44.8%) and 58 (55.2%) patients had received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BBV152, respectively. However, 73 patients had received one dose and 32 had received two doses of the vaccine. Disease severity was mild in 36.2%, moderate in 31.4% and severe in 32.4%. Two mortalities were reported out of 19 fully vaccinated individuals. All-cause mortality in the vaccinated group was 8.6% (9/105), which was significantly lower than the matched unvaccinated group mortality of 21.9% (23/105), p = 0.007. Vaccination increased the chances of survival (OR = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.42-10.18) compared to the unvaccinated group.
CONCLUSION: In the second wave of the pandemic predominated by delta variant of SARS CoV-2, vaccination reduced all-cause mortality among hospitalized patients, although the results are only preliminary.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A rapid surge in cases during the COVID-19 pandemic can overwhelm any healthcare system. It is imperative to triage patients who would require oxygen and ICU care, and predict mortality. Specific parameters at admission may help in identifying them.
METHODOLOGY: A prospective observational study was undertaken in a COVID-19 ward of a tertiary care center. All baseline clinical and laboratory data were captured. Patients were followed till death or discharge. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to find predictors of the need for oxygen, need for ICU care, and mortality. Objective scoring systems were developed for the same using the predictors.
RESULTS: The study included 209 patients. Disease severity was mild, moderate, and severe in 98 (46.9%), 74 (35.4%), and 37 (17.7%) patients, respectively. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) >4 was a common independent predictor of the need for oxygen (p<0.001), need for ICU transfer (p=0.04), and mortality (p=0.06). Clinical risk scores were developed (10*c-reactive protein (CRP) + 14.8*NLR + 12*urea), (10*aspartate transaminase (AST) + 15.7*NLR + 14.28*CRP), (10*NLR + 10.1*creatinine) which, if ≥14.8, ≥25.7, ≥10.1 predicted need for oxygenation, need for ICU transfer and mortality with a sensitivity and specificity (81.6%, 70%), (73.3%, 75.7%), (61.1%, 75%), respectively.  Conclusion: The NLR, CRP, urea, creatinine, and AST are independent predictors in identifying patients with poor outcomes. An objective scoring system can be used at the bedside for appropriate triaging of patients and utilization of resources.

AU  - Gupta, Pooja

T2  - Immunologic Research
AB  - Chemotherapeutic agents may adversely affect the nervous system, including the neural precursor cells as well as the white matter. Although the mechanisms are not completely understood, several hypotheses connecting inflammation and oxidative stress with neurotoxicity are now emerging. The proposed mechanisms differ depending on the class of drug. For example, toxicity due to cisplatin occurs due to activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), which alters hippocampal long-term potentiation. Free radical injury is also involved in the cisplatin-mediated neurotoxicity as dysregulation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) has been seen which protects against the free radical injury by regulating glutathione S-transferases and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1). Thus, correcting the imbalance between NF-κB and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways may alleviate cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. With newer agents like bortezomib, peripheral neuropathy occurs due to up-regulation of TNF-α and IL-6 in the sensory neurons. Superoxide dismutase dysregulation is also involved in bortezomib-induced neuropathy. This article reviews the available literature on inflammation and oxidative stress in neurotoxicity caused by various classes of chemotherapeutic agents. It covers the conventional medicines like platinum compounds, vinca alkaloids, and methotrexate, as well as the newer therapeutic agents like immunomodulators and immune checkpoint inhibitors. A better understanding of the pathophysiology will lead to further advancement in strategies for management of chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - AIM: This systematic review aimed to investigate the drugs used and their potential effect on noninvasive ventilation (NIV).
BACKGROUND: NIV is used increasingly in acute respiratory failure (ARF). Sedation and analgesia are potentially beneficial in NIV, but they can have a deleterious impact. Proper guidelines to specifically address this issue and the recommendations for or against it are scarce in the literature. In the most recent guidelines published in 2017 by the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) relating to NIV use in patients having ARF, the well-defined recommendation on the selective use of sedation and analgesia is missing. Nevertheless, some national guidelines suggested using sedation for agitation.
METHODS: Electronic databases (PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and Cochrane library) from January 1999 to December 2019 were searched systematically for research articles related to sedation and analgosedation in NIV. A brief review of the existing literature related to sedation and analgesia was also done.
REVIEW RESULTS: Sixteen articles (five randomized trials) were analyzed. Other trials, guidelines, and reviews published over the last two decades were also discussed. The present review analysis suggests dexmedetomidine as the emerging sedative agent of choice based on the most recent trials because of better efficacy with an improved and predictable cardiorespiratory profile.
CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that sedation has a potentially beneficial role in patients at risk of NIV failure due to interface intolerance, anxiety, and pain. However, more randomized controlled trials are needed to comment on this issue and formulate strong evidence-based recommendations.

AB  - This multi-centric prospective study (InPOG-HL-15-01) assessed epidemiological, clinical and outcome data of advanced stage Hodgkin Lymphoma (IIB, III and IV) in children and adolescents (N = 262). Chemotherapy regimen was ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) and radiotherapy (RT) was restricted to patients with bulky disease at diagnosis or with suboptimal response at early response assessment (ERA). ERA revealed complete response in 175 (68.1%), partial response in 77 (29.9%), stable disease in 2 (0.8%), and progressive disease in 3 (1.2%) patients. RT was administered to 111 (97 bulky disease, 14 suboptimal response) patients. Five-year event free (EFS) and overall survival for the whole cohort was 81.1% and 90.8% respectively. On multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant predictor of EFS was use of RT (89% versus 74.2%; p-value <0.001). This study reinforces the benefit of consolidative RT in bulky disease and in those with suboptimal response at ERA on an ABVD backbone.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 was paralleled by an equally overwhelming publication of scientific literature. This scientometric analysis was performed to evaluate the 100 most cited articles on COVID-19 imaging to highlight research trends and identify common characteristics of the most cited works. A search of the Web of Science database was performed using the keywords "COVID CT," "COVID Radiograph," and "COVID Imaging" on June 29, 2021. The 100 top cited articles found were arranged in descending order on the basis of citation counts and citations per year and relevant data were recorded. Our search revealed a total of 4,862 articles on COVID-19 imaging published in the years 2020 to 2021. The journal with maximum number of publications ( n  = 22), citation count ( n  = 8,788), and impact was Radiology . Citations for the top 100 articles ranged from 70 to 1,742 with the most cited article authored by A.I. Tao and published in Radiology . Two authors tied at first spot, having maximum impact, with both having 5 publications and a total of 3,638 citations among them. China was the leading country with both the maximum number of publications ( n  = 49) and total citations ( n  = 13,892), the United States coming second in both. This study evaluates publication and citation trends in literature and shows that the countries most affected by the pandemic early on have contributed to the majority of the literature. Furthermore, it will help radiologists to refer to the most popular and important article texts on which to base their unbiased and confident diagnoses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize baseline T1 values of tumors, measure changes after the course of chemotherapy, and evaluate its potential as a marker of response assessment in patients with osteosarcoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 35 patients (male:female = 27:8; age = 17.9 ± 6 years; metastatic:localized = 11:24) with biopsy-proven osteosarcoma were analyzed prospectively. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) (baseline) and after NACT completion (follow-up), followed by surgery and histopathological evaluation. Histopathological necrosis served as the gold standard for assessing chemotherapy response (responder: ≥50% necrosis and non-responder: <50% necrosis). Three-dimensional spoiled gradient recalled echo images were acquired with varying flip angles (50, 100, 200, and 300) using a 1.5 Tesla scanner. T1 values were estimated in healthy muscle tissue and tumors at baseline and follow-up, and the relative percentage changes after NACT (ΔT1) were evaluated, and histogram analysis was performed to characterize the T1 value of the tumor and predict the NACT response using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
RESULTS: At baseline, a significantly higher T1-mean (830.96 ± 193.88 msec versus 683.29 ± 210.00 msec; p = 0.003) and lower T1-skewness (0.86 ± 1.66 versus 1.60 ± 1.55; p = 0.02) were observed in osteosarcoma than healthy tissue. Responder:non-responder ratio was 13:22. At baseline, a significantly higher T1-mean (936.14 ± 193.17 msec versus 768.82 ± 169.25 msec; p = 0.018) and lower T1-skewness (-0.17 ± 0.85 versus 1.47 ± 1.73; p = 0.003) were observed among responders, than non-responders. After NACT, ΔT1 in tumor was significantly higher among responders than non-responders (-27.22 ± 12.17% versus -15.70 ± 18.99%; p = 0.034). ΔT1-mean and ΔT1-skewness after NACT were moderately correlated (r =  - 0.4, p = 0.030; r = 0.4, p = 0.011) with histopathological necrosis. For predicting NACT response, T1-mean and T1-skewness jointly produced an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80 at baseline, and ΔT1-mean and ΔT1-skewness jointly produced AUC = 0.76 after NACT.
CONCLUSION: The mean and skewness of T1 values in osteosarcoma are potential non-invasive imaging markers for chemotherapy response assessment.

AB  - Objective To study the perinatal outcomes in women with complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies undergoing selective fetal reduction using radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Methods This retrospective study included 44 patients with monochorionic twin pregnancies, between 14 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, who underwent RFA for selective fetal reduction. Perinatal and maternal outcomes and procedure-related complications were analyzed. Results The procedure was technically successful in all 44 cases. Indications for selective fetal reduction included twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (52.3%), twin reversed arterial perfusion (20.5%), twins discordant for anomaly (15.9%), and selective fetal growth restriction (11.4%). Median gestational age at procedure was 222/7 weeks (range 14–266/7). Live birth rate was 77.3% with three neonatal deaths; so overall survival was 70.5%. Median procedure-to-delivery interval was 123/7 weeks (range 24/7–23). There were eight losses before 24 weeks of pregnancy, which included two co-twin deaths. Median gestational age at delivery was 35 weeks (interquartile range 321/7–37 weeks). The preterm delivery rate was 66.7% (24/36) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) occurred in 22.7% (10/44) of patients. Conclusion Selective fetal reduction using RFA is safe and effective in complicated monochorionic pregnancies. However, the rates of PPROM and preterm delivery remain high.

T2  - Australasian Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine
AB  - BACKGROUND: The orbital structures are ideally suited for ultrasound examination due to their superficial location and cystic composition of the eye. However, orbital ultrasound remains an underutilised modality due to preference for other cross-sectional modalities in general practice.
AIM: In this article, we review the basic principles, clinical uses and technique of orbital ultrasound in peadiatric patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical utility of orbital ultrasound in peadiatric patients is demonstrated using selected cases.
RESULTS: Ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of various posterior segment pathologies, especially in conditions causing opacification of light-conducting media of the eye. It is also beneficial in diagnosing various orbital pathologies, particularly in differentiating solid from cystic lesions.
DISCUSSION: The added advantages of its use in children include lack of ionising radiation and reduced requirement of sedation or general anesthesia. Ultrasound is the most practical initial investigation in cases where ophthalmoscopy is limited by opacification of ocular media. The addition of color Doppler on ultrasound can give additional information about the vascularity of the lesion.
CONCLUSION: Use of ultrasound can be streamlined into the workup of various orbital and ocular pathologies either as an initial investigation or as a problem-solving tool in cases with a diagnostic dilemma on other modalities.

AB  - Morrison's pouch is the intraperitoneal space in the supramesocolic compartment located between the right liver lobe and right kidney. Pathological conditions that can involve this peritoneal space include fluid collections, infectious or inflammatory processes, and neoplasms. Frequent involvement by disease entities can be attributed to its dependent location, communication with the inframesocolic compartment, close proximity to the adjacent organs and peritoneal fluid dynamics. Knowledge of the appearance of pathological entities on various imaging modalities helps the radiologist in making the correct diagnosis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The InPOG-HL-15-01, a multicentric prospective study, used a risk-stratified and response-based approach with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) backbone to treat children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and reduce the use of radiation therapy (RT). Children/adolescents with bulky disease or inadequate response at early response assessment (ERA) after two cycles of chemotherapy were assigned to receive RT. For ERA, positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) was recommended but not mandatory in view of limited access. This study aimed to compare the impact of using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and PET-CT on treatment decisions and outcomes.
METHODOLOGY: 396 patients were enrolled and 382 had an ERA at the assigned time point. Satisfactory response was defined as Deauville score 3 or less for patients undergoing PET-CT and complete response (CR)/very good partial response (VGPR) for patients undergoing CECT. Outcomes of interest incorporate 5 year event-free survival (EFS), EFS including abandonment (EFSa), and overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: At ERA, satisfactory response was documented in 277 out of 382 (72.5%) participants and this was significantly higher in PET-CT (151 out of 186, 81.2%) as compared with CECT-based assessments (126 out of 196, 64.3%) respectively (p value < .001). Amongst the 203 patients with nonbulky disease (wherein the indication for RT was entirely dependent on ERA), 96 out of 114 (84.2%) and 61 out of 89 (68.5%) patients achieved a satisfactory response according to the PET-CT and CECT (p value = .008) respectively and hence a lesser proportion of patients in the PET-CT arm received RT. Despite a lower usage of RT the 5 year OS of both groups, ERA based on CECT (91.8%) versus PET-CT (94.1%) was comparable (p value = .391) and so was the 5 year EFS (86.7 vs. 85.5%, p value = .724).
CONCLUSION: Use of PET-CT as the modality for ERA is more likely to indicate a satisfactory response as compared with CECT and thereby decreases the need for RT in response-based treatment algorithm for HL-afflicted children. The reduction in the application of RT did not impact the overall outcome and plausibly would lower the risk of delayed toxic effects.

T2  - Journal of Orthopaedics
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
PURPOSE: Traumatic fracture dislocation of the spine injury is essentially a three column injury that optimally needs surgical intervention to decompress, stabilize and fuse the spinal column. This study evaluate the outcome of posterior and posterolateral decompression, instrumentation and 360° fusion achieved with help of locally harvested autologus morcellized grafts in traumatic fracture dislocation of thoracolumbar spine.
METHODS: 53 patients were included in this retrospective study. Patients aged 16-55 years, single level fracture dislocation of thoraco-lumbar spine (D5-L5) were included. Patients with multiple level fractures, coexisting degenerative diseases of spine,pathological fractures, patients presenting more than three weeks after initial trauma, patients with concomitant severe head injury that necessitated emergency surgery for the same were excluded from the study. Patients underwent posterior and posterolateral decompression, posterior instrumentation and interbody as well as posterolateral fusion with use of morcellized bone from resected posterior elements. Follow up data at immediate post operative period, 12 months and yearly thereafter up to minimum 7 years was obtained from previous record.
RESULTS: There were 46 males and 7 females. Mean age was 31.15 ± 9.64 yrs. Mean follow up period was 7.4 yrs (range 7-10 yrs). Thoracolumbar dislocation was most frequently noted at thoraco lumbar junction (T10-L2). Thirty six patients had complete neurological deficit (ASIA A) and sixteen had incomplete neurology. At one year follow up, osseous fusion was noted in 48 (90.56%) patients and 5 patients (9.44%) had fibrous union which was determined on CT scan. Immediete post operative, one year and 7 year kyphosis angle was calculated and change in kyphosis angle was not statistically significant. There was no implant failure till last follow up.
CONCLUSION: Morcellized locally harvested autologus grafts are sufficient to achieve 360° spinal fusion in fracture dislocation of thoracolumbar spine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stricturing Crohn's disease (CD) is difficult to manage medically with limited treatment options, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy being the first-line therapy. Although thiopurines are also recommended first-line treatment option for maintenance of remission in steroid-dependent CD, evidence on their use in stricturing CD is lacking. We evaluated the efficacy of azathioprine (AZA) in patients with stricturing CD.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study (January 2005 to July 2020), patients with stricturing CD who were managed with AZA as a primary therapy for at least 6 months, and had a follow-up of at least 6 months after AZA initiation were included. Disease characteristics, complications, long-term response, and adverse events were noted.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifteen patients were included (mean age 33.8±14 years, 67.8% males, median disease duration 98 months [IQR: 60-158], median follow-up duration 60 months [IQR: 50-96]). 46.1% (n=53) patients had significant anemia at presentation, and 73% (n=84) had isolated small bowel involvement. Median dose of AZA was 100 mg (equivalent to 1.5 mg/kg). Median therapy and follow-up duration (after AZA initiation) was 17 (IQR: 9-42) and 33 months (IQR 18-60), respectively. The cumulative probability of maintaining response without treatment failure at 1, 2, and 5 years was 73.1%, 40.7%, and 18.5%, respectively. Among patients with AZA failure, 15.6% received methotrexate, 13% received anti-TNFs, and 9.5% underwent surgery. Significant anemia (&lt;10 g/dL) at presentation and steroid dependence predicted AZA failure. 31.3% patients experienced adverse events, commonest being leukopenia (n=29, 25.2%).
CONCLUSION: Azathioprine demonstrated good short-term and modest long-term response rates in patients with stricturing CD.

AB  - Medical dressings play an important role in the field of tissue engineering owing to their ability to accelerate the process of wound healing. Great efforts have been made to fabricate wound dressings with distinctive features for promoting wound healing. However, most of the current synthesis methods either generate dressings of uniform size or involve complex fabrication techniques, thus limiting their commercialization for the personalized dressings. We report here a dressing, which presents a paradigm shift in the design of the dressing from uniform films to a micro-patterned film. The hypothesis driving the design is the ability of the 3D patterns to provide an efficient transient matrix filling the depth of the wound rather than just providing a barrier and slight re-epithelialization. We demonstrate the use of the digital light processing 3D printing technique to generate micro-pyramid-decorated wound healing dressings with individualized design and with bio-compatible gelatin methacryloyl to contact the wounded areas. In addition to providing better adhesion to the migratory cells, the micro-pyramids also enable covalent conjugation of heparin, providing capability to sequester endogenous growth factors (GFs). Based on these advantages, the developed dressing not only adheres strongly to the wound bed but also promotes the treatment of a rat wound model by utilizing the power of endogenous GFs for tissue regeneration. Thus, it is believed that the developed dressing can break through the limitation of traditional wound treatment and be an ideal candidate for wound healing.

T2  - Frontiers in Immunology
AB  - Trimethylamine (TMA) is produced by the intestinal microbiota as a by-product of metabolism of dietary precursors. TMA has been implicated in various chronic health conditions. However, the effect of TMA in the colon and the underlying mechanism was not clear. In this study, TMA exhibited toxic effects in vitro as well as in vivo. TMA-induced oxidative stress causes DNA damage, and compromised cell membrane integrity leading to the release of LDH outside the cells which ultimately leads to cell death. Besides, TMA also exhibited pronounced increase in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in both HCT116 and HT29 cell lines. TMA was found to be genotoxic and cytotoxic as the TMA concentration increased from 0.15 mM. A decreased ATP intracellular content was observed after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner. For in vivo research, TMA (100 mM, i.p. and intra-rectal) once a week for 12 weeks caused significant changes in cellular morphology of colon and rectum epithelium as assessed by H & E staining. TMA also significantly increased the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the colon and rectal epithelium indicating the severity of inflammation. In addition, TMA caused extensive mucosal damage and distortion in the epithelium, decrease in length of small intestine compared to control mice. In conclusion, these results highlight the detrimental effects of TMA in the colon and rectal epithelium.

AB  - The Gallbladder Reporting and Data System (GB-RADS) ultrasound (US) risk stratification is proposed to improve consistency in US interpretations, reporting, and assessment of risk of malignancy in gallbladder wall thickening in non-acute setting. It was developed based on a systematic review of the literature and the consensus of an international multidisciplinary committee comprising expert radiologists, gastroenterologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and pathologists using modified Delphi method. For risk stratification, the GB-RADS system recommends six categories (GB-RADS 0-5) of gallbladder wall thickening with gradually increasing risk of malignancy. GB-RADS is based on gallbladder wall features on US including symmetry and extent (focal vs. circumferential) of involvement, layered appearance, intramural features (including intramural cysts and echogenic foci), and interface with the liver. GB-RADS represents the first collaborative effort at risk stratifying the gallbladder wall thickening. This concept is in line with the other US-based risk stratification systems which have been shown to increase the accuracy of detection of malignant lesions and improve management.

AB  - Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging is a useful method in the diagnosis of acute myocarditis. We present a case of a 54-year-old male with a clinical diagnosis of acute myocarditis in whom, 68Ga-DOTANOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT showed diffuse left ventricular myocardial uptake. SSTR imaging can act as a surrogate marker of active inflammation. SSTR imaging is useful in deciding site of biopsy, assessing response to therapy and for prognostication.
