AB  - Background. In this study, the authors aimed to assess the association of loneliness and disability with oral health in 2 groups older adults (>= 60 years) in central India.
   Methods. A total of 421 older adults participated in the study; 316 (75.1%) attended outpatient services at the Department of Dentistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhopal, India, and 105 (24.9%) were from old age homes. The authors used the Patients Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System's social isolation 8a short form to assess loneliness. Disability was assessed using the 12-item version of the self-administered World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale. The authors conducted regression analyses to establish the association of loneliness and disability with the decayed, missing, and filled tooth index; periodontal disease; and edentulousness.
   Results. Poor oral health findings were noted in both groups. Eighty-eight (20.9%) participants had never visited a dentist, and 201 (88.5%) had unmet dental prosthetic needs. Loneliness and disability were associated with decayed, missing, and filled tooth index scores; periodontal disease; and edentulousness, with odds ratios of 1.86, 1.29, 2.37 and 4.63, 3.85, 3.63 respectively (P < .001). Age, sex, socioeconomic status, type of residence, tobacco use, and use of oral health care were also independent variables associated with oral health (P < .001).
   Conclusions. Loneliness and disability were found to be significantly associated with oral health. The study results found poor oral health, low use of oral health care, and high unmet need for dental prosthetics in the 2 groups of older adults.
   Practical Implications. Practicing dentists need to understand the significance of loneliness and social isolation on oral health. Interventions to reduce isolation and disability can be beneficial in improving the oral health of older adults.

AB  - Hangman's fracture, also known as traumatic spondylolisthesis of the axis, causes widening of the neural canal and thus a low rate of neurological deficits. This low rate is one of the reasons it is neglected and patients present with late neurological deficits. In an effort to preserve motion at the C1-2 joint, the authors devised a new technique of bilateral C2 pedicle reconstruction. They describe the first two cases in the literature of an old hangman's fracture with resorbed C2 pedicles due to chronic fracture, in which bilateral C2 pedicles were reconstructed. One of the two cases (case 2) is the first reported case of severe C2-3 spondyloptosis with C2 displaced up to the level of C4. Case 1 had a follow up of 21 months, while case 2 had a follow up of 12 months. Both patients experienced neurological improvement with evidence of fusion and artificial pedicle formation at last follow-up. Bilateral C2 pedicle reconstruction is a feasible technique that can be used with a good outcome in select patients.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to report the results of an on-line survey to evaluate the practice pattern of Indian retina specialists in administering intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection. Methods: A structured questionnaire on the intravitreal injection (IVI) procedure protocols was sent online to all members of the All India Ophthalmological Society (AIOS) with a request to the retina specialists to respond. A unique link that directed to the web-based questionnaire page allowed a single response only. Participating physicians were masked from each others' responses. The responses were categorized into pre-injection patient preparation, injection aliquoting, injection administration, and post-injection care. The results were compared with similar surveys in Europe, the UK, and the USA. Results: Response was received from 741 of 1016 (73%) retina specialists (of 16,000 AIOS ophthalmologists). The survey showed: 43.5% evaluated patient's cardiac risk factors, 60% used prophylactic topical antibiotic, 90.9% performed injection under topical anesthesia, 55% aliquoted from the bevacizumab vial at the eye care facility, 66.2% used a single puncture technique, 91.4% injected in the main operating room, 98% wore masks and sterile gloves during the procedure, 96% used lid speculum, and 89.3% advised topical antibiotic after the procedure. Peri procedure antibiotic use, injection in the min operating room, wearing of gloves and mask were higher than practices in other countries. Conclusion: Ophthalmologists in India practice asepsis in IVI procedure. There is no uniform protocol for aliquoting bevacizumab. Single use bevacizumab vial for exclusive ophthalmic use will further improve the safety of the procedure.

AB  - Introduction. The glossopharyngeal nerve lies posterior to the internal carotid artery at the submandibular region. The primary objective of this study was to compare ultrasound-guided glossopharyngeal nerve block (UGPNB) and landmark glossopharyngeal nerve block (GPNB). Materials & Methods. Inclusion criteria were patients with unilateral Eagle syndrome and ear pain. Group UGPNB (N =25) received three UGPNBs at weekly intervals with 1.5 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine and 20 mg of methylprednisolone. Group GPNB (N =26) received landmark GPNB. Pain intensity was evaluated with the numerical rating scale (NRS) before every block, 30 minutes after every block, and at one, three, and five weeks after the third block. Quality of life, assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), and satisfaction scores were noted. Results. NRS scores before the second and third blocks and a week after were significantly lower in group UGPNB and comparable at weeks 3 and 5. NRS scores 30 minutes after every block were significantly decreased from the preblock values but were comparable between groups. In 68% of patients, a curvilinear probe delineated the internal carotid artery (ICA). Out-of-plane needle trajectory was required in 64% of patients. BPI and satisfaction scores were significantly better in the UGPNB group in the "block" weeks. Conclusions. UGPNB with 1.5 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine and 20 mg of methylprednisolone injected posterior to the ICA in the submandibular region provides better pain relief for at least a week compared with an extraoral landmark technique when three weekly consecutive blocks are given. In most patients, a curvilinear probe and out-of-plane needle trajectory are most suitable for ultrasound block.

AB  - Background: Scrub typhus was once thought to be a disease of rural origin and was confined to specific pockets in South Asia. Early diagnosis and treatment is extremely important as it is associated with high mortality if left untreated.
   Aim: To delineate the clinical and molecular epidemiology of scrub typhus in patients presenting with acute febrile illness from various parts of India.
   Methods: During the study period of 5 years (October 2013 to October 2018), a total of 1742 patients with acute febrile illness <15 days were enrolled after taking informed consent. Patients were diagnosed using IgM Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the pre-determined region specific cut offs. Patients with positive IgM ELISA were also subjected to IgM Immunofluorescence assay and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. The demographic and relevant clinical details of the patients were documented and analyzed.
   Results: A total of 210 (12.1%) patients were diagnosed with scrub typhus. Of these, nested PCR was positive in only 85 patients. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the predominant circulating genotypes were Gilliam and Karp. On multivariate analysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocarditis, encephalitis/encephalopathy, jaundice and splenomegaly were significantly more common in those patients who were diagnosed with scrub typhus. A total of 14 patients diagnosed with scrub typhus succumbed to the illness.
   Conclusion: Patients with fever, headache, pulmonary manifestations, CNS manifestations, myocarditis, transaminitis or thrombocytopenia presenting in the monsoon and post-monsoon season should be evaluated for scrub typhus irrespective of the geographical location in India.

AB  - Pancreatic disease can be associated with polyarthritis and panniculitis in a small number of patients, and this triad constitutes PPP syndrome. Early diagnosis is critical as it has high morbidity and mortality. Panniculitis can occur in fat present anywhere in the body. Involvement of fat in bone marrow is relatively uncommon, and radiologic imaging shows osteolytic lesions involving long bones. Here we present a case of acute pancreatitis, referred to our department for evaluation of severe joint pain and multiple bone pain. Tc-99m-MDP scan with SPECT/CT has been done, which showed medullary expansion with heterogenous tracer uptake, that is, moth-eaten appearance.

AB  - Purpose To study the distribution and morphometry of vascular foramina of adult human talus in Indian population. Methods The study was carried out by using 56 adult human tali. The location, size, number and foraminal index of vascular foramina on head, neck and body of each bone were examined macroscopically. The difference in location of vascular foramina was further studied in relation to the pattern of calcaneal articular facets on talus. Results The vascular foramina were present on the superior neck, inferior neck and medial surface of talar body in all (100%) the bones. The Kruskal-Wallis test followed by series of Mann-Whitney test for post hoc analysis showed the number of vascular foramina was significantly greater on inferior surface of neck and medial surface of body. The number of vascular foramina ranged from 0 to 25. About 77.05% of foramina were >= 0.5 mm in size. The mean foraminal index of the closest foramina on inferior surface of neck and medial surface of body was 47.90% and 37.23%, respectively. The mean foraminal index of the farthest foramina on inferior surface of neck and medial surface of body was 75.08% and 71.35%, respectively. Conclusion The present study has provided additional information on the vascular foramina of tali. This knowledge is important to the orthopedic, vascular and podiatric surgeons while performing the surgeries of hind foot. We opine that the lateral approach would be more beneficial in the surgical procedures to talus.

AB  - The deficiency, as well as overconsumption of essential metal ions, has serious health implications. Hence, the design and synthesis of sensors for detection of such ionic species are of great significance. In this work, a Dehydroacetic acid-based chemosensor DHB ((E)-N-(1-(2-hydroxy-6-methyl-4-oxo-4H-pyran-3-yl) ethylidene benzohydrazide) was developed for instant detection of Cu2+. A visible colour transition from light yellow to bluish green was observed on the addition of Cu2+. No transition in colour was observed with any other ionic species indicating its specificity. The binding of DHB to Cu2+ caused a blue shift accompanied by an increased intensity due to an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The absence of any interference from other competitive ionic species confirmed the selectivity of the probe for Cu2+. Single-crystal X-ray analysis, titration studies and Job's plot, indicated a 1:2 stoichiometry between Cu2+ and DHB. The experimental results agreed with the theoretical results obtained from Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The successful application of the probe for the detection of Cu2+ in spiked real samples of water collected from different sources affirmed its practical applicability. The sensor could detect Cu2+ as low as 0.156 mu M in the aqueous media which is very less than the permissible value of 20 mu M in water.

AB  - Objective and method:Betel (areca) nut has recently received interest from researchers and policy makers for its role as a psychoactive substance. It was historically limited to Asia-pacific region, but with the advent of globalization, it has become an equally challenging public health problem across the globe. Previously published literature can give us valuable insights in terms of historical interest and understanding related to betel nut. With the expansion of biomedical research a huge number of articles have been published on the same. In terms of understanding the impact of an article, citations are considered a proxy estimate measure. Thus we decided to analyze the top 100 cited articles (till November 2018) related to betel nut. The search in Google scholar database was done with the help of freely available software, Publish or Perish.Results:Overall we found that most articles were published from the fields of dentistry and oncology, with relatively minimal contribution from the field of Addiction Psychiatry. Hence, most articles have addressed the issue of epidemiology and mechanism with lesser share of treatment related publications. Various important information related to these articles have been discussed including the institutions, countries, journals and impactful authors in the field.

AB  - C. albicans infections are increasingly becoming a threat to public health with emergence of drug resistant strains. It emphasizes the need to look for alternate drug targets through genome-wide screening. In the present study, whole proteome of C. albicans SC5314 was analyzed in single click target mining workflow of TiDv2. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) for the resulting putative targets was generated based on String da- tabase. Ninety four proteins with higher connectivity (degree 10) in the network are noted as hub genes. Among them, 24 are observed to be known targets while 70 are novel ones. Further, chokepoint analysis revealed FAS2, FOL1 and ERG5 as chokepoint enzymes in their respective pathways. Subsequently, the chokepoints were selected as prior interest for in silico gene knockout via MATLAB and COBRA Toolbox. In silico gene knockout pointed that FAS2 inhibition reduced the growth rate of pathogen from 0.2879 mmol.gDW(-1) .h(-1) to zero. Furthermore, enzyme inhibition assay of FAS2 with cerulenin strengthen the computational outcome with MIC 1.25 mu g/mL. Hence, the study establishes FAS2 as a promising target to design therapeutics against C. albicans.

AB  - The present review describes the posterior segment complications following surgical management of glaucoma. Although the majority of glaucoma cases are managed medically, still a large number of patients may require surgery. Moreover, with the advent of newer surgical techniques and adjuncts, encountering retinal complications post-surgery is not uncommon. The incidence, signs, management, and prognosis of common complications such as anesthesia-related retinal toxicity, vitreous loss, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, serous choroidal detachment, hypotonic maculopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment and endophthalmitis will be discussed in detail. Awareness of these complications is necessary as their proper and timely management can save vision in an already compromised eye.

AB  - One of the earliest events in the development of atherosclerosis is endothelial activation, which is estimated in vitro at the functional level by quantifying monocyte adhesion. This involves the incubation of fluorescently labeled monocytes on top of cultured endothelial cells and quantifying the number of adhered monocytes. Currently, the quantification of adhered monocytes is done using microscopy or by lysing the cells and estimating the fluorescence. Here we present a novel flow cytometry-based method for the quantification of monocyte adhesion. This method could quantify the average number of monocytes adhered to a single endothelial cell after monocyte adhesion assay, and was also sensitive to the level of activation of endothelial cells. Flow cytometry-based quantification requires less time and effort compared with microscopy-based quantification.
   METHOD SUMMARY
   Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were seeded at 1x10(4) cells per cm(2) in six-well plates. Treatment with TNF-alpha (2.5, 5 or 10 ng/ml) or lipopolysaccharide (0.5, 1 or 5 mu g/ml) treatment was carried out for 12 h to activate the HUVECs, then 5 x 10(5) fluorescently labeled THP1 monocytes were added and incubated for 30 min. Unbound monocytes were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Adherent monocytes and HUVECs were dissociated and resuspended in PBS as single cells and quantified by fluorescence using flow cytometry.

AB  - Background: Staffing ratios based on hospital beds and norms do not adequately address the requirement of infection preventionists (IP) in hospitals. We, therefore, aimed to determine staffing of IP (nursing category) based on actual workload involved.
   Methods: The study design was quantitative and longitudinal conducted for 1 year. The study was structured around the steps of the World Health Organization's Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN).
   Results: We identified infection control activities, support activities and additional activities to be performed by 4 IP with a total available working time of 6,132 hours for an annual workload of 6,238.25 (+/- 372) hours in an acute care hospital with 182 beds and 69,331 annual admissions. Core infection control activities consumed 78% time. Support and additional activities consumed the remaining 22% time. Active surveillance required 44% time and education consumed 32% time. WISN ratio of available staff and required staff was 0.75.
   Discussion: A WISN ratio less than 1 suggests inadequate staffing. Therefore, the WISN method recommends 4 IP instead of 3 based on existing workload. We compared our results with the existing quantification-based staffing studies.
   Conclusions: WISN is a valuable method to measure all infection control activities and translate workload into IP (nursing) full time equivalents. (C) 2020 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low back pain with radiation to lower limbs is due to nerve root impingement or involvement in most cases. F-18-FDG PET/CT has shown sacral nerve root involvement in several peripheral nerve pathologies, including neurolymphomatosis, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and plexopathies. We present 2 cases of a low back pain with ulcerative colitis and metastatic neuroendocrine tumor who underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT and Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT, respectively. PET/CT can be used as an adjunct tool to evaluate sacral nerve root involvement to look for malignant or inflammatory nerve involvement.

AB  - Objective The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the key imaging manifestations of COVID-19 on chest CT in adult patients by providing a comprehensive review of the published literature. Methods We performed a systematic literature search from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and WHO databases for studies mentioning the chest CT imaging findings of adult COVID-19 patients. Results A total of 45 studies comprising 4410 patients were included. Ground glass opacities (GGO), in isolation (50.2%) or coexisting with consolidations (44.2%), were the most common lesions. Distribution of GGOs was most commonly bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, and posterior with predilection for lower lobes. Common ancillary findings included pulmonary vascular enlargement (64%), intralobular septal thickening (60%), adjacent pleural thickening (41.7%), air bronchograms (41.2%), subpleural lines, crazy paving, bronchus distortion, bronchiectasis, and interlobular septal thickening. CT in early follow-up period generally showed an increase in size, number, and density of GGOs, with progression into mixed areas of GGOs plus consolidations and crazy paving, peaking at 10-11 days, before gradually resolving or persisting as patchy fibrosis. While younger adults more commonly had GGOs, extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidations was prevalent in the older population and those with severe disease. Conclusion This review describes the imaging features for diagnosis, stratification, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients. The most common CT manifestations are bilateral, peripheral/subpleural, posterior GGOs with or without consolidations with a lower lobe predominance. It is pertinent to be familiar with the various imaging findings to positively impact the management of these patients.

TI  - A systematic review of the role of carbon ion radiation therapy in recurrent rectal cancer
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
KW  - PREOPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY
KW  - REIRRADIATION
KW  - MULTICENTER
AB  - Background:Colorectal cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated death in the world. The 5-year local recurrence rates in patients undergoing multimodality therapy are approximately 5-10%. The standard approach to treat locally recurrent rectal is re-irradiation followed by surgical resection. Recent reports have suggested that the treatment outcomes with carbon ion radiation therapy (CIRT) in recurrent rectal cancer are promising and have superior results compared to photon therapy. Hence, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the patterns of care and treatment outcomes of recurrent rectal cancer patients treated with CIRT. Methodology:We performed a systematic search to identify the articles that reported on CIRT use in recurrent rectal cancer. Results:Systematic search of PubMed and Cochrane Central resulted in 98 abstracts. Eight studies fulfilled the predefined inclusion criteria. Among eight studies, one study is a prospective phase I/II study done in Japan; three prospective studies are ongoing (PANDORA-01 trial, HIMAT1351trial, and a phase II study of reirradiation for prior CIRT), and five studies are institutional reports on role of CIRT. These studies were predominantly reported from Japan and Germany. All reports except one were performed in patients who have not received prior radiation. The most commonly utilized treatment prescription was 73.4 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions over 4 weeks in patients without any prior history of radiation and 36 Gy in 12 fractions over 3 weeks at 3 Gy per fraction in patients with prior photon radiation to the pelvis. There is one ongoing trial assessing the role of carbon ion re-irradiation in patients who had prior CIRT for rectal cancer. Conclusion:CIRT holds immense promise in improving outcomes in locally recurrent rectal cancer. There is a need for more multi-institutional prospective clinical trials to assess the role of CIRT.

AB  - Persons with drug refractory TLE have the option of being managed by surgery. They may develop memory impairment with specific etiology of mesial temporal sclerosis and anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR). The study evaluated the semantic verbal memory outcomes in pre- and post-surgery temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients using functional MRI and voxel morphometric methods. Twenty consecutive persons with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and 20 healthy controls were recruited after obtaining the institute ethics approval. The fMRI scans were performed on a 1.5 T MR Scanner using standardized semantic verbal memory tasks using a native Hindi paradigm, before and after an anterior temporal lobectomy (in cases). A task-based functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using a conn toolbox. Data analysis was carried out using the statistical parametric imaging (SPM12) and CAT12 toolbox. Post-surgery TLE group showed increased robust FC in the right middle and posterior temporal regions as compared to pre-surgery session. A significant reduction in grey matter volume was observed in the left temporal lobe post-operatively as compared to pre-surgery and healthy control groups. In the post-surgery TLE group, neuropsychological scores were reduced in specific PGI domains such as visuospatial, working memory, and executive functioning. Our results may help in understanding of memory reorganization in TLE post-operatively.

AB  - The discovery of Sanal flow choking is a scientific breakthrough and a paradigm shift in the diagnostics of the detonation/hemorrhage in real-world fluid flow systems. The closed-form analytical models capable of predicting the boundary-layer blockage factor for both 2D and 3D cases at the Sanal flow choking for adiabatic and diabatic fluid flow conditions are critically reviewed here. The beauty and novelty of these models stem from the veracity that at the Sanal flow choking condition for diabatic flows all the conservation laws of nature are satisfied at a unique location, which allows for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code verification. At the Sanal flow choking condition both the thermal choking and the wall-friction-induced flow choking occur at a single sonic fluid throat location. The blockage factor predicted at the Sanal flow choking condition can be taken as an infallible data for various in silico model verification, validation, and calibration. The 3D blockage factor at the Sanal flow choking is found to be 45.12% lower than the 2D case of a wall-bounded diabatic fluid flow system with air as the working fluid. The physical insight of Sanal flow choking presented in this review article sheds light on finding solutions, through in silico experiments in base flow and nanoflows, for numerous unresolved problems carried forward over the centuries in physical, chemical, and biological sciences for humankind.

T2  - NEUROLOGY
KW  - HEADACHES
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Objective To evaluate the effectiveness of yoga as an adjuvant to conventional medical management on clinical outcomes in patients with migraine. Methods CONTAIN was a prospective, randomized, open-label superiority trial with blinded endpoint assessment carried out at a single tertiary care academic hospital in New Delhi, India. Patients enrolled were aged 18-50 years with a diagnosis of episodic migraine and were randomized into medical and yoga groups (1:1). Randomization was computer-generated with a variable block size and concealed. A predesigned yoga intervention was given for 3 months. Outcomes were recorded by a blinded assessor. The primary endpoint was a decrease in headache frequency, headache intensity, and Headache Impact Test (HIT)-6 score. Secondary outcomes included change in Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score, pill count, and proportion of headache free patients. Results Between April 2017 and August 2018, 160 patients with episodic migraine were randomly assigned to medical and yoga groups. A total of 114 patients completed the trial. Baseline measures were comparable except for a higher mean headache frequency in the yoga group. Compared to medical therapy, the yoga group showed a significant mean delta value reduction in headache frequency (delta difference 3.53 [95% confidence interval 2.52-4.54];p< 0.0001), headache intensity (1.31 [0.60-2.01];p= 0.0004), HIT score (8.0 [4.78-11.22];p< 0.0001), MIDAS score (7.85 [4.98-10.97];p< 0.0001), and pill count (2.28 [1.06-3.51];p< 0.0003). Conclusion Yoga as an add-on therapy in migraine is superior to medical therapy alone. It may be useful to integrate a cost-effective and safe intervention like yoga into the management of migraine. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier CTRI/2017/03/008041. Classification of evidence This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with episodic migraine, yoga as adjuvant to medical therapy improves headache frequency, intensity, impact, and disability.

AB  - Background Accurate diagnosis of anemia by community workers using a point-of-care device is a challenge. The objective of the study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care devices for detecting anemia in community settings. Methods It was diagnostic accuracy study with cross-sectional design on adult patients attending the outpatient department of rural/ urban health centres of Medical colleges from India. The index tests were HemoCue, TrueHb, Massimo's device and spectroscopic device, compared against autoanalyzer (gold standard). Accuracy was expressed by sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, predictive values, area under the curve (AUC) and levels of agreement. For the diagnostic accuracy component, 1407 participants were recruited with a minimum of 600 for each device. An additional 200 participants were considered to elucidate the performance of devices in different weather conditions. Results HemoCue and TrueHb performed better than Massimo and spectroscopic devices. Detection of anemia by technicians was similar between TrueHb and HemoCue (AUC 0.92 v/s 0.90, p > 0.05). Community workers performed better with Hemocue for detecting anemia compared to TrueHb (AUC 0.92 v/s 0.90, p < 0.05). For detection of severe anemia, accuracy of TrueHb was significantly better with technicians (AUC 0.91 v/s 0.70; p < 0.05) and community workers (AUC 0.91 v/s 0.73; p < 0.05). HemoCue showed a bias or mean difference (95%CI) of 0.47 g/dl (0.42, 0.52) for all values, and 0.92 g/dl (0.82, 1.03) for severe anemia. For TrueHb, it was - 0.28 g/dl (- 0.37, - 0.20) for all readings, and 0.06 g/dl (- 0.52, 0.63) for severe anemia. TrueHb appeared to be more consistent across different weather conditions, although it overestimated Hb in extreme cold weather conditions. Conclusion For detection of anemia, True Hb and HemoCue were comparable. For severe anemia, True Hb seemed to be a better and feasible point-of-care device for detecting anemia in the community settings.

AB  - Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(JMML) is a pediatric myeloproliferative disorder. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the only curative treatment for JMML. Pre-transplant therapy is a matter of controversy, and there are no firm recommendations. Whether chemotherapy is effective in achieving durable remission is questionable. Patients diagnosed as JMML at our center from January-2014 to December-2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients treated with at least one cycle of sequential therapy with subcutaneous cytarabine and oral 6-mercaptopurine were further assessed. The total number of patients diagnosed during the study period was 33. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who did not get any chemotherapy (n = 13) and ones who received at least one cycle of chemotherapy(n = 20). Age, total leukocyte count (TLC), monocyte percent, platelet count and spleen size were comparable between the two groups. There was no difference in the overall survival between the two groups, but 6 out of 20 patients showed a response to chemotherapy (2 complete remission, 4 partial remission). Two patients out of 20 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The patients who achieved complete remission received 12 cycles of chemotherapy and have been in follow up for 28 months and 50 months respectively. Our results showed that sequential therapy with 6-mercaptopurine and cytarabine may be offered to patients in whom HSCT is not feasible or as a bridge therapy in those awaiting HSCT. The advantages of this approach include low cost, out-patient management and decreased requirement of blood components. In a subset of patients it may achieve remission.

AB  - Background India has made substantial progress in improving child survival over the past few decades, but a comprehensive understanding of child mortality trends at disaggregated geographical levels is not available. We present a detailed analysis of subnational trends of child mortality to inform efforts aimed at meeting the India National Health Policy (NHP) and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets for child mortality.
   Methods We assessed the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) and neonatal mortality rate (NMR) from 2000 to 2017 in 5 x 5 km grids across India, and for the districts and states of India, using all accessible data from various sources including surveys with subnational geographical information. The 31 states and groups of union territories were categorised into three groups using their Socio-demographic Index (SDI) level, calculated as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study on the basis of per-capita income, mean education, and total fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. Inequality between districts within the states was assessed using the coefficient of variation. We projected U5MR and NMR for the states and districts up to 2025 and 2030 on the basis of the trends from 2000 to 2017 and compared these projections with the NHP 2025 and SDG 2030 targets for U5MR (23 deaths and 25 deaths per 1000 livebirths, respectively) and NMR (16 deaths and 12 deaths per 1000 livebirths, respectively). We assessed the causes of child death and the contribution of risk factors to child deaths at the state level.
   Findings U5MR in India decreased from 83.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 76.7-90.1) in 2000 to 42.4 (36.5-50.0) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, and NMR from 38.0 (34.2-41.6) to 23.5 (20.1-27.8) per 1000 livebirths. U5MR varied 5.7 times between the states of India and 10.5 times between the 723 districts of India in 2017, whereas NMR varied 4.5 times and 8.0 times, respectively. In the low SDI states, 275 (88%) districts had a U5MR of 40 or more per 1000 livebirths and 291 (93%) districts had an NMR of 20 or more per 1000 livebirths in 2017. The annual rate of change from 2010 to 2017 varied among the districts from a 9.02% (95% UI 6.30-11.63) reduction to no significant change for U5MR and from an 8.05% (95% UI 5.34-10.74) reduction to no significant change for NMR. Inequality between districts within the states increased from 2000 to 2017 in 23 of the 31 states for U5MR and in 24 states for NMR, with the largest increases in Odisha and Assam among the low SDI states. If the trends observed up to 2017 were to continue, India would meet the SDG 2030 U5MR target but not the SDG 2030 NMR target or either of the NHP 2025 targets. To reach the SDG 2030 targets individually, 246 (34%) districts for U5MR and 430 (59%) districts for NMR would need a higher rate of improvement than they had up to 2017. For all major causes of under-5 death in India, the death rate decreased between 2000 and 2017, with the highest decline for infectious diseases, intermediate decline for neonatal disorders, and the smallest decline for congenital birth defects, although the magnitude of decline varied widely between the states. Child and maternal malnutrition was the predominant risk factor, to which 68.2% (65.8-70.7) of under-5 deaths and 83.0% (80.6-85.0) of neonatal deaths in India could be attributed in 2017; 10.8% (9.1-12.4) of under-5 deaths could be attributed to unsafe water and sanitation and 8.8% (7.0-10.3) to air pollution.
   Interpretation India has made gains in child survival, but there are substantial variations between the states in the magnitude and rate of decline in mortality, and even higher variations between the districts of India. Inequality between districts within states has increased for the majority of the states. The district-level trends presented here can provide crucial guidance for targeted efforts needed in India to reduce child mortality to meet the Indian and global child survival targets. District-level mortality trends along with state-level trends in causes of under-5 and neonatal death and the risk factors in this Article provide a comprehensive reference for further planning of child mortality reduction in India.

AB  - Dental anomalies and short stature (DASS) has been recently identified as a distinct entity, associated with bi-allelic hypomorphic variants in LTBP3 gene. Only 20 individuals from nine families have been previously reported, with a consistent phenotype of short stature, brachyolmia, and amelogenesis imperfecta. We report the first case from India, with novel radiographic and molecular findings in LTBP3 gene, thereby expanding the phenotypic spectrum of DASS.

AB  - Somatic hypermutation (SHM) status provides an important prognostic indicator for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a very common type of mature B-cell leukemia. Owing to the adverse prognosis associated with an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (IGHV) status, SHM testing is performed as a standard of care in CLL. Conventionally, SHM testing has been performed using labor intensive and primarily analog Sanger sequencing method following PCR amplification of the clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements in CLL cells. In comparison, recent availability of next generation sequencing (NGS) allows more versatile detection and direct identification of clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in neoplastic B-cell populations. The ability to identify specific clonal IGHV signature(s) in both baseline (diagnostic) and post-treatment settings enables unique clinical applications of NGS such as determination of SHM status, minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring, clonal heterogeneity and B cell receptor IG stereotypy. We provide a review of current practices and recommendations for SHM determination using NGS including examples of difficult cases.

AB  - In this endeavor, a novel electrochemical biosensor was designed using multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)- and nickel nanoparticles (NiNPs)-embedded anandamide (AEA) imprinted polymer. The NiNPs so synthesized were mortared with MWCNTs and molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), which enhanced sensitivity and selectivity of the developed sensor, respectively. The characterization methods of AEA-based MIP included X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis, which supported the successful synthesis of the polymer. Electrochemical studies of fabricated sensor were performed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in potentiostatic mode (PEIS). In this first phase of AEA-specific sensor development, MWCNT/NiNP/MIP@SPE was found to successfully discriminate between different concentrations of AEA. The developed sensing platform demonstrated a 100 pM-1 nM linear range with a 0.01 nM detection limit (LOD), 0.0149 mA/pM sensitivity, and 50% stability within 4 months. The sensor demonstrated selectivity toward AEA: although acetylcholine (ACh) and dopamine acted as strong interfering components because of their chemical similarity, the spiked AEA samples demonstrated similar to 90% recoveries. Hence, our results have passed the first step in AEA detection at home, although with a clinical setup, future advancement is still required.

AB  - The development of multidrug resistance in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi currently forms a major roadblock for the treatment of enteric fever. This poses a major health problem in endemic regions and extends to travellers returning from developing countries. The appearance of fluoroquinolone non-susceptible strains has resulted in use of ceftriaxone as drug of choice with azithromycin being recommended for uncomplicated cases of typhoid fever. A recent sporadic instance of decreased susceptibility to the latest drug regime has necessitated a detailed analysis of antimicrobial resistance genes and possible relationships with their phenotypes to facilitate selection of future treatment regimes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was conducted for 133 clinical isolates from typhoid patients. Sequence output files were processed for pan-genome analysis and prediction of antimicrobial resistance genes. The WGS analyses disclosed the existence of fluoroquinolone resistance conferring mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes of all strains. Acquired resistance determining mechanisms observed included catA1 genes for chloramphenicol resistance, dfrA7, dfrA15, sul1 and sul2 for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and bla(TEM-116)/bla(TEM-1B) genes for amoxicillin. No resistance determinants were found for ceftriaxone and cefixime. The genotypes were further correlated with their respective phenotypes for chloramphenicol, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. A high correlation was observed between genotypes and phenotypes in isolates of S. Typhi. The pan-genome analysis revealed that core genes were enriched in metabolic functions and accessory genes were majorly implicated in pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. The pan-genome of S. Typhi appears to be closed (B-pan=0.09) as analysed by Heap's law. Simpson's diversity index of 0.51 showed a lower level of genetic diversity among isolates of S. Typhi. Overall, this study augments the present knowledge that WGS can help predict resistance genotypes and eventual correlation with phenotypes, enabling the chance to spot AMR determinants for fast diagnosis and prioritize antibiotic use directly from sequence.

AB  - Background A mysterious cluster outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019 was traced to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 and declared a Pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020. The pandemic has spread rapidly causing widespread devastation globally. Purpose This review provides a brief understanding of pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis and management of COVID-19 and highlights the current knowledge as well as best practices for orthopaedic surgeons. These are likely to change as knowledge and evidence is gained. Results Orthopaedic surgeons, like other front-line workers, carry the risk of getting infected during their practice, which as such is already substantially affected. Implementation of infection prevention and control as well as other safety measures for health care workers assumes great importance. All patients/visitors and staff visiting the hospital should be screened. Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment except for those requiring urgent/emergent care. During lockdown all elective surgeries are to be withheld. All attempts should be made to reduce hospital visits and telemedicine is to be encouraged. Inpatient management of COVID-19 patients requires approval from concerned authorities. All patients being admitted to the hospital in and around containment zones should be tested for COVID-19. There are special considerations for anaesthesia with preference for regional anaesthesia. A separate Operation room with specific workflow should be dedicated for COVID-19 positive cases. Conclusions Despite the magnitude of challenge, the pandemic offers significant lessons for the orthopaedic surgeon who should seek the opportunity within the adversity and use this time wisely to achieve his/her Ikigai.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences are linked to poor attentive behaviors during adolescence, as well as increased risk for mental health disorders in adults. However, no study has yet tested targeted interventions to optimize neurocognitive processes in this population. Here, we investigated closed-loop digital interventions in a double-blind randomized controlled study in adolescents with childhood neglect, and evaluated the outcomes using multimodal assessments of neuroimaging, cognitive, behavioral, and academic evaluations. In the primary neuroimaging results, we demonstrate that a closed-loop digital meditation intervention can strengthen functional connectivity of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in the cingulo-opercular network, which is critically developing during the adolescent period. Second, this intervention enhanced sustained attention and interference-resolution abilities, and also reduced behavioral hyperactivity at a 1-year follow-up. Superior academic performance was additionally observed in adolescents who underwent the digital meditation intervention. Finally, changes in dACC functional connectivity significantly correlated with improvements in sustained attention, hyperactivity, and academic performance. This first study demonstrates that closed-loop digital meditation practice can facilitate development of important aspects of neurocognition and real-life behaviors in adolescents with early childhood neglect.

AB  - Present study reports the temperature dependent optically stimulated luminescence (TA-OSL) properties of KCl:Sm in the range of 40-310 degrees C. KCl:Sm was synthesized by high-temperature solid-state reaction method with optimized dopant concentration of Sm (0.45%). The morphological and structural properties of KCl:Sm are carried out using SEM, and XRD. KCl:Sm is found to be polycrystalline in nature with average crystallite size 30-70 nm as confirmed by XRD. SEM images of KCl:Sm showed the uniform morphology within the range of 0.1 mu m. The KCl:Sm exhibits good TA-OSL intensity at 100 degrees C (at a fixed dose of 10 Gy of gamma photons) as well as the linear response. The optimized elevated temperature for KCl:Sm is found to be 100 degrees C because of the maximum TA-OSL intensity on this temperature due to the depletion of its filled traps. The Arrhenius analysis estimated the activation energy of E-a, is 0.2 +/- 0.05 eV. In this work, we also report thermally stimulated luminescent (TSL) characteristics till 500 degrees C. Intense and broad TSL peaks are obtained at 265 degrees C, 310 degrees C & 340 degrees C when irradiated to the low energy HCPs protons and carbon beams of 250 keV. In this analysis, the prominent glow peak temperature shifts towards lower temperature region. The trapping kinetic parameters are estimated (for knowing the trap structure) and glow curves are analyzed though de-convolution techniques. The temperature dependence characteristics of KCl:Sm with respect to low LET gamma photons and high LET HCPs have been discussed with reference to medical as well as high radiation dosimetry.

AB  - The establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in humans proceed through a continuous change of biochemical and biophysical processes. It requires a constant interaction between the fetus and the maternal system. The present prospective study aims to elucidate changes in salivary proteome from the early to middle stages of term pregnancy, and establishing an expressional trajectory for modulated proteins. To date, a comprehensive characterization of the longitudinal salivary proteome in pregnancy has not been performed and it is our immediate interest. In the discovery phase, maternal saliva (N=20) at 6-13, 18-21, and 26-29 weeks of gestation was analyzed using level-free proteomics (SWATH-MS) approach. The expression levels of 65 proteins were found to change significantly with gestational age and distributed into two distinct clusters with a unique expression trajectory. The results revealed that altered proteins are involved in maternal immune modulation, metabolism, and host defense mechanism. Further, verification of 12 proteins was employed using targeted mass spectrometry (MRM-MS) in a separate subset of saliva (N=14). The MRM results of 12 selected proteins confirmed a similar expression pattern as in SWATH-MS analysis. Overall, the results not only demonstrate the longitudinal maternal saliva proteome for the first time but also set the groundwork for comparative analysis between term birth and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major concern that necessitates the development of unique therapeutics. The essential requirement of serine acetyltransferase (SAT/CysE) for survival of several human pathogens makes it a very promising target for inhibitor designing and drug discovery. In this study, as an initial step to structure-based drug discovery, CysE from K. pneumonia was structurally and biochemically characterized. Subsequently, blind docking of selected natural products into the X-ray crystallography determined 3D structure of the target was carried out. Experimental validation of the inhibitory potential of the top-scorers established quercetin as an uncompetitive inhibitor of Kpn CysE. Molecular dynamics simulations carried out to elucidate the binding mode of quercetin reveal that this small molecule binds at the trimer-trimer interface of hexameric CysE, a site physically distinct from the active site of the enzyme. Detailed analysis of conformational differences incurred in Kpn CysE structure on binding to quercetin provides mechanistic understanding of allosteric modulation. Binding of quercetin to CysE leads to conformation changes in the active site loops and proximal loops that affect its internal dynamics and consequently its affinity for substrate/cofactor binding, justifying the reduced enzyme activity.

AB  - The world is facing Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is causing a large number of deaths and burden on intensive care facilities. It is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) originating in Wuhan, China. It has been seen that fewer children contract COVID-19 and among infected, children have less severe disease. Insights in pathophysiological mechanisms of less severity in children could be important for devising therapeutics for high-risk adults and elderly. Early closing of schools and day-care centers led to less frequent exposure and hence, lower infection rate in children. The expression of primary target receptor for SARS-CoV-2, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), decreases with age. ACE-2 has lung protective effects by limiting angiotensin-2 mediated pulmonary capillary leak and inflammation. Severe COVID-19 disease is associated with high and persistent viral loads in adults. Children have strong innate immune response due to trained immunity (secondary to live-vaccines and frequent viral infections), leading to probably early control of infection at the site of entry. Adult patients show suppressed adaptive immunity and dysfunctional over-active innate immune response in severe infections, which is not seen in children. These could be related to immune-senescence in elderly. Excellent regeneration capacity of pediatric alveolar epithelium may be contributing to early recovery from COVID-19. Children, less frequently, have risk factors such as co-morbidities, smoking, and obesity. But young infants and children with pre-existing illnesses could be high risk groups and need careful monitoring. Studies describing immune-pathogenesis in COVID-19 are lacking in children and need urgent attention.

AB  - Objective To synthesise the evidence for estimating the direct and indirect patient costs of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis care in India.
   Method PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, IndMED and Google Scholar were searched for studies conducted in India between 2000 and 2018 and published in English. The search terms were "tuberculosis" AND "costs" (cost Analysis, economics, cost of illness, health care costs, health expenditures, direct service costs, catastrophic cost) AND "India". The cost of TB care was from the patient's perspective. Data regarding costs were extracted, indexed to the year 2018 using cumulative inflation rate and converted to US dollars at the exchange rate of 2018.
   Results Thirteen studies were included in this review. The mean (unweighted) total cost incurred by patients being treated for drug-sensitive TB in a public health facility was $ 235.00 (SD- 222.10), and the median of means was $ 170.60 (range - 43.70-718.40). The mean direct cost was 45.5% of the total cost. Only one study, which was conducted in a private facility, reported the mean total cost for drug-resistant TB as $ 7778.04. Catastrophic cost (total cost >= 20% of the total annual household income) was experienced by 7% to 32.4% of drug-sensitive TB patients and by 68% of drug-resistant TB patients.
   Conclusion Despite free diagnostic and treatment services provided under the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme, the patient cost of tuberculosis care is high. Relevant studies vary widely in methodology and cost reporting.

AB  - Stroke care in India has evolved rapidly in the last decade with a focus on stroke awareness, prevention, rapid triage, treatment, and rehabilitation. But acute stroke care and poststroke rehabilitation in the country have limitations owing to the economic constraints and poor access to health care. The SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has made stroke care even more challenging. We outline the unfavorable circumstances in stroke care induced by the pandemic; propose mitigating measures; crisis management; and provide a comparative evaluation of stroke care between India and the United States during the pandemic. There is a need for public health systems in both developed and developing countries to improve awareness, implement proper strategies of triage, acute treatment, well-defined rehabilitation plans, telemedicine services, and virtual check-ins.

T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   The outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), which started from Wuhan, China, in late 2019, have spread worldwide. A total of 5,91,971 cases and 2,70,90 deaths were registered till 28th March, 2020. We aimed to predict the impact of duration of exposure to COVID-19 on the mortality rates increment.
   Methods
   In the present study, data on COVID-19 infected top seven countries viz., Germany, China, France, United Kingdom, Iran, Italy and Spain, and World as a whole, were used for modeling. The analytical procedure of generalized linear model followed by Gompertz link function was used to predict the impact lethal duration of exposure on the mortality rates.
   Findings
   Of the selected countries and World as whole, the projection based on 21st March, 2020 cases, suggest that a total (95% Cl) of 76 (65-151) days of exposure in Germany, mortality rate will increase by 5 times to 1%. In countries like France and United Kingdom, our projection suggests that additional exposure of 48 days and 7 days, respectively, will raise the mortality rates to10%. Regarding Iran, Italy and Spain, mortality rate will rise to 10% with an additional 3-10 days of exposure. World's mortality rates will continue increase by 1% in every three weeks. The predicted interval of lethal duration corresponding to each country has found to be consistent with the mortality rates observed on 28th March, 2020.
   Conclusion
   The prediction of lethal duration was found to have apparently effective in predicting mortality, and shows concordance with prevailing rates. In absence of any vaccine against COVID-19 infection, the present study adds information about the quantum of the severity and time elapsed to death will help the Government to take necessary and appropriate steps to control this pandemic.

AB  - Celiac disease (CeD) is an autoimmune enteropathy caused by gluten intake in genetically predisposed individuals. We investigated the metabolism of CeD by metabolic profiling of intestinal mucosa, blood plasma and urine using NMR spectroscopy and multivariate analysis. The metabolic profile of the small intestinal mucosa was compared between patients with CeD (n = 64) and disease controls (DCs, n = 30). The blood plasma and urinary metabolomes of CeD patients were compared with healthy controls (HCs, n = 39). Twelve metabolites (proline (Pro), arginine (Arg), glycine (Gly), histidine (His), glutamate (Glu), aspartate, tryptophan (Trp), fumarate, formate, succinate (Succ), glycerophosphocholine (GPC) and allantoin (Alln)) of intestinal mucosa differentiated CeD from controls. The metabolome of blood plasma with 18 metabolites (Pro, Arg, Gly, alanine, Glu, glutamine, glucose (Glc), lactate (Lac), acetate (Ace), acetoacetate (AcAc), beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB), pyruvate (Pyr), Succ, citrate (Cit), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), phosphocreatine (PCr) and creatinine) and 9 metabolites of urine (Pro, Trp, beta-OHB, Pyr, Succ, N-methylnicotinamide (NMN), aminohippurate (AHA), indoxyl sulfate (IS) and Alln) distinguished CeD from HCs. Our data demonstrated changes in nine metabolic pathways. The altered metabolites were associated with increased oxidative stress (Alln), impaired healing and repair mechanisms (Pro, Arg), compromised anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective processes (Gly, His, NMN), altered energy metabolism (Glc, Lac, beta-OHB, Ace, AcAc, Pyr, Succ, Cit, Cho, Cr and PCr), impaired membrane metabolism (GPC and Cho) and intestinal dysbiosis (AHA and IS). An orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis model provided clear differentiation between patients with CeD and controls in all three specimens. A classification model built by combining the distinguishing metabolites of blood plasma and urine samples gave an AUC of 0.99 with 97.7% sensitivity, 93.3% specificity and a predictive accuracy of 95.1%, which was higher than for the models built separately using small intestinal mucosa, blood plasma and urine. In conclusion, a panel of metabolic biomarkers in intestinal biopsies, plasma and urine samples has potential to differentiate CeD from controls and may complement traditional tests to improve the diagnosis of CeD.

AB  - Aortitis includes conditions with infectious or non-infectious etiology, characterized by inflammatory changes in one or more layers in aortic wall. Age at onset, geographic predilections, distribution and pattern of involvement in aorta, its branches and pulmonary arteries, and systemic associations provide a clue to etiology. Clinical presentations are often non-specific. An integrated approach including clinical, laboratory and imaging assessment is essential to confirm diagnosis and plan treatment. Assessment of disease activity is the key as it influences timing and outcome of treatment. Markers of activity include clinical, laboratory and imaging. Medical management remains the first-line therapy. Revascularization is indicated in the presence of hemodynamically significant stenosis and inactive disease. In the presence of flash pulmonary edema, left ventricular dysfunction or hypertensive encephalopathy, revascularization is performed irrespective of disease activity. Endovascular management is favored over surgery due to its high success and low restenosis rates. Symptomatic aneurysmal disease is usually managed by surgery.

AB  - Diffuse lipomatosis of thyroid is a very rare entity with very few case reports cited in literature. In this, there is diffuse, abnormal deposition of mature fat into the thyroid gland. Symptoms usually arise due to subsequent atrophy of the gland and also due to mass effect. The diagnosis can be well established on imaging wherein there is demonstration of fat within the thyroid gland or can be diagnosed by histopathological analysis. Herein we report an uncommon case of diffuse thyroid lipomatosis detected incidentally on imaging.

TI  - Train-Associated Injuries Pose a Significant Burden on Trauma Care Systems of Emerging Economies
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - RAILWAY SUICIDES

AB  - Background The Indian railway system is the fourth largest in the world and causes about 15 deaths every day, due to intentional or unintentional reasons. This study presents a 5-year retrospective analysis of patients injured due to train-associated events, managed at a level-1 trauma center in India. Materials and methods Hospital-based trauma registry data of train-associated injuries presenting between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Data from 726 patients were analyzed for demographics, injury events, injury regions, their management and outcomes. ISS and NISS were used to quantify the injury severity. Results Mean age was 33 years, with male-to-female ratio 86 to 14%. The majority of patients (62%) were between 20-40 years. The median ISS was 9 (IQR 4-16), median hospital stays 11 days (IQR6-23), with in-hospital mortality of 17.4%. Presence of head injury; ISS > 9 and CPR in ED were independent risk factors of mortality. Trespassers on the rail track had significantly more severe injuries compared to passengers (Median ISS 13 vs. 9, p = 0.012; Median NISS 22 vs.17, p = 0.015); however, mortality and hospital length of stay were not significantly different. Location of injury event (on platform or tracks) showed no difference between the severity of injuries, mortality and hospital length of stay. Conclusions Current study reports comprehensive injury patterns and outcomes of train-associated injuries from a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). Apart from the mortality, there is a high incidence of permanent disabilities from extremity amputations. No significant difference was noted in the severity and outcomes among patients injured on or off train platforms, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety measures including enforcement and promoting safe behavior not only on locations like train tracks but equally at platforms.

AB  - The essentiality of DNA Gyrase in basic cellular processes in bacterial pathogens makes it an ideal drug target. Though the Gyrase has a conserved mechanism of action, the complete DNA wrapping and binding process is still unknown. In this study, we have identified six arginine residues R556, R612, R667, R716, R766, and R817 in the DNA GyraseA - C-terminal domain from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (StGyrA-CTD) to be essential for DNA wrapping and sliding by a sequence and structure analysis. Through site-directed mutagenesis and EMSA studies, we observed that the substitution of R667 (blade 3) and R716 (blade 4) in StGyrA-CTD led to loss of DNA binding. Whereas, upon mutation of residue R612 (blade2), R766 (blade5) and R817 (blade6) along with supporting residue R712 (blade 4) a decrease in binding affinity was seen. Our results indicate that R667 and R716 act as a pivot point in DNA wrapping and sliding during gyrase catalytic activity. In this study, we propose that the DNA wrapping mechanism commences with DNA binding at blade3 and blade4 followed by other blades to facilitate the DNA sliding during supercoiling activity. This study provides a better understanding of the DNA binding and wrapping mechanism of GyrA-CTD in DNA Gyrase.

AB  - Primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDD) are a group of disorders presenting with recurrent infections. The authors retrospectively reviewed the imaging records of 24 proven cases of PIDD and correlated the imaging findings with the type of defect. Final diagnoses were categorized in four groups; Group I (humoral immunodeficiency), Group 2 (cell mediated immunodeficiency), Group 3 (phagocytic disorders) and Group 4 (others). Group 3 was the commonest, followed by 1 and 2. Three most common disorders encountered were chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (7/24), hyper IgE syndrome (5/24) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) (4/24). Consolidation (12/24), nodules (10/24), bronchiectasis (9/24) and lymphadenopathy (8/24) were the commonest imaging findings. Although not statistically significant, some definite imaging trends could be established. Presence of consolidation and nodules; with absence of bronchiectasis was the striking finding in Group 3. Group 2 disorders predominantly showed bronchiectasis, whereas presence of consolidation, nodules, bronchiectasis all were very common in Group 1.

AB  - Background and objectives Shared decision making in patients with glomerular disease remains challenging because outcomes important to patients remain largely unknown. We aimed to identify and prioritize outcomes important to patients and caregivers and to describe reasons for their choices.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements We purposively sampled adult patients with glomerular disease and their caregivers from Australia, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Participants identified, discussed, and ranked outcomes in focus groups using the nominal group technique; a relative importance score (between zero and one) was calculated. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically.
   Results Across 16 focus groups, 134 participants (range, 19-85 years old; 51% women), including 101 patients and 33 caregivers, identified 58 outcomes. The ten highest-ranked outcomes were kidney function (importance score of 0.42), mortality (0.29), need for dialysis or transplant (0.22), life participation (0.18), fatigue (0.17), anxiety (0.13), family impact (0.12), infection and immunity (0.12), ability to work (0.11), and BP (0.11). Three themes explained the reasons for these rankings: constraining day-to-day experience, impaired agency and control over health, and threats to future health and family.
   Conclusions Patients with glomerular disease and their caregivers highly prioritize kidney health and survival, but they also prioritize life participation, fatigue, anxiety, and family impact.

AB  - Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome newly affects 1-3 per 100,000 children per year. Approximately 85% of cases show complete remission of proteinuria following glucocorticoid treatment. Patients who do not achieve complete remission within 4-6 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment have steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). In 10-30% of steroid-resistant patients, mutations in podocyte-associated genes can be detected, whereas an undefined circulating factor of immune origin is assumed in the remaining ones. Diagnosis and management of SRNS is a great challenge due to its heterogeneous etiology, frequent lack of remission by further immunosuppressive treatment, and severe complications including the development of end-stage kidney disease and recurrence after renal transplantation. A team of experts including pediatric nephrologists and renal geneticists from the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA), a renal pathologist, and an adult nephrologist have now developed comprehensive clinical practice recommendations on the diagnosis and management of SRNS in children. The team performed a systematic literature review on 9 clinically relevant PICO (Patient or Population covered, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, formulated recommendations and formally graded them at a consensus meeting, with input from patient representatives and a dietician acting as external advisors and a voting panel of pediatric nephrologists. Research recommendations are also given.

AB  - Introduction Radiation therapy is considered the standard treatment for early glottic cancers; and recent trials have evaluated the role of hypofractionation with mixed results. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the impact of hypofractionation in early glottic cancers. Methods We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase and Google scholar to look for studies which have evaluated the role of hypofractionation in early glottic cancers. Only prospective trials were included in the present analysis. RevMan software (Cochrane Collaboration's Information Management System) was used for the meta-analysis. Results The analysis included a total of five studies and 1153 patients. Hypofractionation was found to significantly improve local control rates with an Odds ratio of 0.55 [95% CI 0.13-0.85]. The voice preservation rates with hypofractionation ranged from 86 to 94%. No significant improvement in overall survival was noted with the used of hypofractionation [hazard ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.69-1.71]. There was an increased incidence of grade 2 or higher acute mucositis toxicity with use of hypofractionation [Odds ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.12-2.11]. The incidence of acute skin toxicity was not increased with use of hypofractionation. Late toxicity was very low and not increased with use of hypofractionation. Conclusion Moderate hypofractionation as compared to conventional fractionation, in laryngeal cancer, is associated with significantly improved local control without impact on overall survival. The use of hypofractionation is associated with an increased incidence of acute mucositis though incidence of long-term toxicity was not significantly increased. Hence, moderate-dose hypo-fractionation should be considered as the new standard of care in early laryngeal cancer.

KW  - ARTERIOVENOUS-FISTULA
KW  - HELICAL CT
AB  - Background:
   Renal artery-inferior vena cava (IVC) fistula is usually caused by penetrating injury to the back. However, it is a very rarely reported entity with only 20 cases reported in the literature. They may present acutely with hemodynamic instability or chronically as congestive heart failure. A thorough examination and adequate imaging are required to avoid missing such injuries.
   Case Presentation:
   A 28-year-old gentleman presented after sustaining stab injury to the back. The stab had penetrated the renal artery and IVC, leading to arteriovenous fistula. He was managed surgically, as he went into hemorrhagic shock, with a successful outcome. The case is also unique as an accessory renal artery was also involved in the fistula.
   Conclusion:
   Early identification and management of renal artery-IVC fistula is important to ensure a successful outcome. Such fistulas can be managed by either endovascular approach or surgical approach. The decision of approach depends on the level of expertise available and hemodynamic status of the patient.

Herein, water behaved as a quasi-spherical porogen, for engineering polysaccharide-rich and chemically defined 3D-microarchitecture, with semi-interpenetrating networks (S-IPNs). Furthermore, their viscoelastic behavior along with a heterogeneous, fibroporous morphology, facilitated instructive, self-remodeling of the bioartificial scaffolds, thence effectively permitting and promoting the growth of 3D tumor spheroids of divergent origins. The hybrid composites displayed reproducible, uniform tumor spheroids with a Z-depth of similar to 65 +/- 2 mu m in case of human adenocarcinoma (DLD-1) and similar to 54 +/- 3 mu m for human glioblastoma cells (U-251) (vs. nonuniform spheroids, on Agarose matrix). Thereafter, their capacity for anticancer drug screening was examined using limited cancer drugs. The conflicting drug screening results for Etoposide's reduced efficacy on glioblastoma cells cultured on our 3D matrix could be ascribed to decreased drug access and thus lower ingression. Nonetheless, adenocarcinoma's resistance to Camptothecin was paralleled. Moreover, their potential for real-time, high-content, phenotypic precision oncology was affirmed by the exceptional transparency of the synthesized composite. Since this 3D microarchitecture typifies ECM bioautomaton, this matrix can also be wielded for precision oncology.

AB  - Obesity, a risk factor for multiple diseases (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, cancers) originates through complex interactions between genes and prevailing environment (food habit and lifestyle) that varies across populations. Indians exhibit a unique obesity phenotype with high abdominal adiposity for a given body weight compared to matched white populations suggesting presence of population-specific genetic and environmental factors influencing obesity. However, Indian population-specific genetic contributors for obesity have not been explored yet. Therefore, to identify potential genetic contributors, we performed a two-staged genome-wide association study (GWAS) for body mass index (BMI), a common measure to evaluate obesity in 5973 Indian adults and the lead findings were further replicated in 1286 Indian adolescents. Our study revealed novel association of variants-rs6913677 in BAI3 gene (p = 1.08 x 10(-8)) and rs2078267 in SLC22A11 gene (p = 4.62 x 10(-8)) at GWAS significance, and of rs8100011 in ZNF45 gene (p = 1.04 x 10(-7)) with near GWAS significance. As genetic loci may dictate the phenotype through modulation of epigenetic processes, we overlapped genetic data of identified signals with their DNA methylation patterns in 236 Indian individuals and performed methylation quantitative trait loci (meth-QTL) analysis. Further, functional roles of discovered variants and underlying genes were speculated using publicly available gene regulatory databases (ENCODE, JASPAR, GeneHancer, GTEx). The identified variants in BAI3 and SLC22A11 genes were found to dictate methylation patterns at unique CpGs harboring critical cis-regulatory elements. Further, BAI3, SLC22A11 and ZNF45 variants were located in repressive chromatin, active enhancer, and active chromatin regions, respectively, in human subcutaneous adipose tissue in ENCODE database. Additionally, these genomic regions represented potential binding sites for key transcription factors implicated in obesity and/or metabolic disorders. Interestingly, GTEx portal identify rs8100011 as a robust cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (p = 1.6 x 10(-7)), and ZNF45 gene expression in skeletal muscle of Indian subjects showed an inverse correlation with BMI indicating its possible role in obesity. In conclusion, our study discovered 3 novel population-specific functional genetic variants (rs6913677, rs2078267, rs8100011) in 2 novel (SLC22A11 and ZNF45) and 1 earlier reported gene (BAI3) for BMI in Indians. Our study decodes key genomic loci underlying obesity phenotype in Indians that may serve as prospective drug targets in future.

AB  - Objective: To observe changes in cystometric parameters in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) with neurogenic bladder practicing clean intermittent self-catheterization (CIC) and incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in such patients. Design: Prospective, observational study. Setting: Tertiary Urban Rehabilitation Hospital. Participants: Persons with neurogenic bladder caused by traumatic SCI and practicing CIC. Interventions: Clinical evaluation, complete urine analysis, urine culture and sensitivity, ultrasonography of the abdomen and urodynamic study were evaluated at baseline and at follow-up (6 months to 1 year). Outcome Measures: Detrusor pattern, cystometric capacity, detrusor compliance, detrusor leak point pressure, residual urine, incidence of UTI. Results: Thirty-one participants were included in the study. The baseline cystometric study showed that 15 had overactive detrusor and 16 had detrusor areflexia. The mean cystometric capacity decreased significantly between baseline and follow-up in both the groups but remained within the normal threshold limit, decline being more marked in the overactive detrusor group, who also had more marked decrease in compliance. Mean detrusor leak point pressure was below 40 cm H2O in all participants in both groups at baseline and follow-up. Mean residual urine improved at follow-up in both groups. Incidence of UTI was 2.29 episodes per patient per year, and more frequent in the overactive detrusor group. Escherichia coli was the causative agent in 45%. Conclusion: The cystometric capacity and compliance decreased significantly though patients were doing regular CIC and managed on antimuscarinics for detrusor overactivity (DO). UTI is more common in individuals with SCI with DO and E. coli is the most common cause of UTI.

AB  - Objectives: To find out the outcome of fetal ventriculomegaly (VM) in terms of survival at birth and after two years and to evaluate the antenatal factors which influence the postnatal outcome. Method: We performed a 10-year prospective, observational study (2008-2018) including all prenatally detected fetal VM. Two years follow up of all live born was done to observe their survival, physical morbidity, and developmental delay. Results: Fetal VM was seen in 263/648 (40.6%) cases with central nervous system malformation. VM was severe in 85.9% and was associated with other anomalies in 56.3% of the cases. Total 40.3% cases with VM were live born. The outcome at birth and was poorest with severe VM (40.7%) and when VM was associated with multiple defects (30%). Only 23.6% survived beyond two years of age. There was developmental delay in 24.2% cases. Logistic regression showed that, the presence of associated defect and severe VM were significant poor prognostic factors for survival at birth (p = .001) and after two years of age (p = .002). Conclusions: In a low resource setup the problems associated with fetal VM were compounded by late referral. The knowledge of the outcome in existing setup provides data for realistic counselling to the couple.

AB  - The molecular pathogenesis of poorly differentiated sinonasal carcinoma received significant attention in recent years. As a consequence, several unclassified carcinomas in the morphologic spectrum of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma have been reclassified as distinctive genetically defined variants or entities. Among the latter are NUT-rearranged carcinoma and SMARCB1-deficient carcinomas. In this study, we further characterize a rare variant of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma-like tumors characterized by inactivation of the SWItch/Sucrose Nonfermentable chromatin remodeler SMARCA4 (BRG1) detectable by immunohistochemistry. Patients were 7 males and 3 females aged 20 to 67 years (median, 44). Tumors originated in the nasal cavity (6), nose and sinuses (2), or at unspecified site (2). Six tumors were initially misdiagnosed as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) or large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC). Histologically, the tumors were composed of small basaloid (3 cases) or large epithelioid (7) cells disposed into nests and solid sheets with extensive areas of necrosis. No glands or other differentiating features were noted. Abortive rosettes were seen in 1 case. Immunohistochemistry showed consistent expression of pankeratin and absence of CK5, p63, p16, and NUT in all tumors tested. Other tested markers were variably positive: CK7 (2/6), synaptophysin (9/10; mostly focal and weak), chromogranin-A (4/10; focal), and CD56 (3/5; focal). All tumors showed total loss of SMARCA4 and retained expression of SMARCB1/INI1. Co-loss of SMARCA2 was seen in 1 of 8 cases. Limited data were available on treatment and follow-up. Two patients received surgery (1 also radiotherapy) and 3 received chemotherapy. Metastases (cervical nodes, liver, bone, and lung/mediastinal) were detected in 3 patients; 2 were alive under palliative chemotherapy at 8 and 9 months while 1 died of progressive lung disease at 7 months. Three patients (1 with brain invasion) died soon after diagnosis (1 to 3 mo). In total, 4 of 6 patients (66%) with follow-up died of disease (median, 3 mo). This series characterizes SMARCA4-deficient sinonasal carcinoma as a genetically distinct aggressive entity in the spectrum of undifferentiated sinonasal carcinomas. These variants add to the spectrum of SWItch/Sucrose Nonfermentable-deficient sinonasal carcinomas, at the same time expanding the topographic distribution of SMARCA4-related malignancies.

AB  - Background: Recent respiratory infection including SARS-CoV-2 is an independent risk factor for acute cerebrovascular disease. Purpose: There have been reports linking haemorrhagic strokes to SARS-CoV-2 infection during this pandemic, which lead us to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 infection could be associated with increased risk of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods: A retrospective observational study evaluating all stroke cases admitted in our centre in the past one month. Results: More than half (56%) had ICH, compared to 22% last year. Two patients with ICH were SARS-CoV-2 positive and they had no or mild respiratory symptoms and had higher occurrence of renal dysfunction. Conclusion: There could be possible association between ICH and SARS-CoV-2 infections. However, a prospective study with larger sample size is needed to elucidate the pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: CTCF encodes 11-zinc finger protein which is implicated in multiple tumors including the carcinoma of the breast. The Present study investigates the association of CTCF mutations and their expression in breast cancer cases.
   Methods: A total of 155 breast cancer and an equal number of adjacent normal tissue samples from 155 breast cancer patients were examined for CTCF mutation(s) by PCR-SSCP and automated DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) method was used to analyze CTCF expression. Molecular findings were statistically analyzed with various clinicopathological features to identify associations of clinical relevance.
   Results: Of the total, 16.1% (25/155) cases exhibited mutation in the CTCF gene. Missense mutations Gln > His (G > T) in exon 1 and silent mutations Ser > Ser (C > T) in exon 4 of CTCF gene were analyzed. A significant association was observed between CTCF mutations and some clinicopathological parameters namely menopausal status (p = 0.02) tumor stage (p = 0.03) nodal status (p = 0.03) and ER expression (p = 0.04). Protein expression analysis showed 42.58% samples having low or no expression (+), 38.0% with moderate (++) expression and 19.35% having high (+++) expression for CTCF. A significant association was found between CTCF protein expression and clinicopathological parameters include histological grade (p = 0.04), tumor stage (p = 0.04), nodal status (p = 0.03) and ER status (p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: The data suggest that CTCF mutations leading to its inactivation significantly contribute to the progression of breast cancer. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

However, studies pertaining to circadian genes and effect of lithium treatment on clock genes are scant. Thus, we wanted to determine the effects of REM sleep deprivation on expression of core clock genes and determine whether epigenetics is involved. Next, we wanted to explore ultrastructural abnormalities in the hippocampus. Moreover, we were interested to determine oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in the central and peripheral systems.
   Methods Rats were sleep deprived by the flower pot method and were then analyzed for various behaviors and biochemical tests. Lithium was supplemented in diet.
   Results We found that REM sleep deprivation resulted in hyperactivity, reduction in anxiety-like behavior, and abnormal dyadic social interaction. Some of these behaviors were sensitive to lithium. REM sleep deprivation also altered circadian gene expression and caused significant imbalance between histone acetyl transferase/histone deacetylase (HAT/HDAC) activity. Ultrastructural analysis revealed various cellular abnormalities. Lipid peroxidation and increased TNF-alpha levels suggested oxidative stress and ongoing inflammation. Circadian clock genes were differentially modulated with lithium treatment and HAT/HDAC imbalance was partially prevented. Moreover, lithium treatment prevented myelin fragmentation, disrupted vasculature, necrosis, inflammation, and lipid peroxidation, and partially prevented mitochondrial damage and apoptosis.
   Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest plethora of abnormalities in the brain following REM sleep deprivation, many of these changes in the brain may be target of lithium's mechanism of action.

AB  - Cervical cancer is still one of the most common female cancers in Asia and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in low- and middle-income countries. Nowadays, national screening programs for cervical cancer are widely provided in Asian countries. We reviewed the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) in China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and Thailand. The NCSP were established at varying times, from 1962 in Japan to 2014 in Indonesia. The primary screening method is based on cytology in all countries except for India and Indonesia. In India and Indonesia, visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA) is mainly used as a primary screening method, and a "see and treat" strategy is applied to women with a positive VIA result. The starting age of NCSP ranges from 18 years in China to 30 years in Thailand. The screening interval is 2 years in all countries except for China and Indonesia, in which it is 3 years. Uptake rates of NCSP vary from 5.0%-59.7%. Many women in low- and middle-income countries still do not participate in NCSP. To improve uptake rates and thereby prevent more cases of cervical cancer, Asian countries should continue to promote NCSP to the public using various approaches.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive neurosurgical approaches reduce patient morbidity by providing the surgeon with better visualization and access to complex lesions, with minimal disruption to normal anatomy. The use of rigid or flexible neuroendoscopes, supplemented with a conventional stereoscopic operating microscope, has been integral to the adoption of these techniques. Neurosurgeons commonly use neuroendoscopes to perform the ventricular and endonasal approaches. It is challenging to learn neuroendoscopy skills from the existing apprenticeship model of surgical education. The training methods, which use simulation-based systems, have achieved wide acceptance. Physical simulators provide anatomic orientation and hands-on experience with repeatability. Our aim is to review the existing physical simulators on the basis of the skills training of neuroendoscopic procedures.
   METHODS: We searched Scopus, Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and dblp. We used the following keywords "neuroendoscopy," "training," " simulators," "physical," and "skills evaluation." A total of 351 articles were screened based on development methods, evaluation criteria, and validation studies on physical simulators for skills training in neuroendoscopy.
   RESULTS: The screening of the articles resulted in classifying the physical training methods developed for neuroendoscopy surgical skills into synthetic simulators and box trainers. The existing simulators were compared based on their design, fidelity, trainee evaluation methods, and validation studies.
   CONCLUSIONS: The state of simulation systems demands collaborative initiatives among translational research institutes. They need improved fidelity and validation studies for inclusion in the surgical educational curriculum. Learning should be imparted in stages with standardization of performance metrics for skills evaluation.

AB  - MurE ligase is known to play a significant role in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. It catalyzes the addition of meso-diaminopimelic acid to nucleotide precursor. The protein can adopt different conformations for its proper functioning. Different environmental conditions can alter the stability and function of enzyme due to their ability to disrupt interactions between different domains. We have explored the pH and temperature dependent conformational changes in MurE ligase from Salmonella Typhi and estimated the protein stability. The study enabled us to decipher the effect of different milieu condition in the enzyme activity. At acidic pH 3.0, StMurE ligase forms molten globule (MG) state and at alkaline pH it is in unfolded state. The different states of StMurE ligase were characterized using various spectroscopic techniques. These techniques including near-UV CD, far-UV CD, ANS fluorescence, differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescence spectroscopy helped to determine the secondary structural changes and detect local conformational modifications. The structural analysis using StMurE ligase homology model revealed the variations in ionization states of catalytic amino acid residues involved in substrate binding. This study provides an insight into the dynamics states of StMurE ligase at different environmental conditions during bacterial pathogenesis. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Stroke is a serious neurological comorbidity observed during the ongoing COVID-19 (coronavirus associated disease 2019) pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome, corona virus 2) and includes ischemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage and cerebral venous thrombosis. We reviewed factors that could potentially contribute to the occurrence of stroke among patients with COVID-19. There could be an interaction between the conventional risk factors of stroke, infection, systemic inflammatory response and plaque destabilisation. Inflammatory markers, D-dimer elevation and increased cytokine activity have been observed in patients with COVID-19. Other probable contributing factors include cardiac injury leading to embolism, a prothrombotic state and a possibility of direct neuroinvasive potential causing vasculopathy. Data from stroke patients gathered in large multicentric cohorts could help shed more light on the occurrence, behaviour, aetiology, pathophysiology, biomarkers and outcomes of stroke occurring during the ongoing pandemic.

AB  - Cytology-based cervical screening had unequivocal success in reducing the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in the last century. The recognition of the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a necessary cause of cervical cancer led to the development of HPV testing. Gradually, there has been a shift from reflex HPV testing for mild cytological abnormalities, to co-testing with cytology and HPV, and lately to primary HPV screening, based on evidence from well-designed large randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Advantages of primary HPV screening include higher sensitivity to detect pre-neoplastic lesions, better reassurance with a negative test, and safe prolongation of screening intervals. However, clinicians and policy makers must ensure the availability of clinically validated HPV assays and triage protocols of screen positive cases prior to implementation of primary HPV screening. This is likely to reduce potential harm from over-treatment as well as extra burden on the health care system. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: By virtue of its role in oxidized low-density lipoprotein uptake and foam cell transformation, monocyte CD36 (mCD36) is a potential non-invasive tool to detect atherosclerosis (ATH) in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).
   Methods: Flowcytometric expression of mCD36 was evaluated with reference to ankle brachial index (ABI) in 70 patients of type 2 DM [40 with and 30 without coronary artery disease (CAD) respectively] and 30 age and gender matched normoglycemic controls (NGCs).
   Results: DM patients had significantly higher mCD36 indices than NGCs (p < 0.001). The mCD36 expression was significantly higher in DM persons with CAD and those with poor glycemia control (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c >= 7%) than their respective counterparts (p < 0.001 for both). Thirty subjects had compromised ABI (<= 0.9); all were DM persons with CAD. ABI compromised subjects had consistently higher mCD36 indices than all other sub-groups (p < 0.001 for all comparisons). Notably, within the ABI-uncompromised group, mCD36 indices differed significantly and showed progressive increase from NGCs to diabetics without and with CAD respectively.
   Conclusions: mCD36 plays an important role in atherogenesis. With reference to ABI, mCD36 performed robustly as a marker of ATH. Furthermore, it could stratify subjects within the `ABI-uncompromised group' commensurate with their conventional clinicopathological ATH risk predisposition. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects nearly 20-50% patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). It may be the prodromal stage of dementia and impacts quality of life of the patient and caregiver. Characterizing PD cognition at the stage of MCI may help in understanding of cognitive pathophysiology. This study assessed and compared cognition in patients with PD and mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n = 32, age = 61.09 +/- 5.97 years), PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC, n = 32, age = 58.81 +/- 6.15 years) and healthy controls (HC, n = 38, age = 57.39 +/- 7.14 years). Montreal Cognitive Assessment Test (MoCA) was used for categorization of subjects. Cognitive assessment of five domains: executive function, attention, visuospatial function, memory and language (using two tests in each domain) were performed. The effect of PD clinical scores on cognition and cognitive domain specificity in diagnosing PD-MCI were assessed by correlation and receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses, respectively. All the analyses followed removal of potential confounds (age, education and clinical scores). Attention, memory, executive and visuospatial functions were impaired in PD-MCI on comparison with HC and PD-NC groups. Performance in digit span forward and trail making tests for attention and memory (immediate recall) were comparable in both the PD groups. Both the PD groups revealed impairment in attention, memory and language with respect to HC, suggesting the fronto-striatal and posterior cortical syndrome in PD. Highly significant Visual-N-back correlation with UPDRS-III may implicate the shared motor-visuospatial neural pathways. Visual-N-back/PGI delayed recall domains are promising in characterizing PD-MCI stage. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: Timely and reliable diagnostic test for tuberculosis (TB) is immediately required. Attempts were made to improve the technology and diagnostic potential of real-time immuno-PCR (RT-I-PCR). Methods: We designed gold nanoparticle (GNP)-based RT-I-PCR (GNP-RT-I-PCR) assay for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis CFP-10 (Rv3874) protein in clinical samples of TB patients. Results: A wide quantitative detection range of CFP-10 was found to be 0.5-5 x 10(4) pg/ml in bodily fluids of TB patients, which can evaluate the progression of disease. Moreover, sensitivities of 83.7 and 76.2% were observed in pulmonary (n = 49) and extrapulmonary TB (n = 42) patients, respectively, with specificities of 93.5-93.8% (n = 63). Conclusion: Conjugation of detection antibodies and oligonucleotides to functionalized GNPs of GNP-RT-I-PCR is relatively easier, compared with streptavidin-biotin/succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate system employed in RT-I-PCR. Our assay also showed better diagnostic performance than RT-I-PCR, which may provide a viable platform for the development of an efficient TB diagnostic test.

AB  - Background: The management of hypothalamic hamartomas (HH) rests upon the type of presentation. These are rare congenital benign lesions presenting either with central precocious puberty (CPP), drug refractory epilepsy (DRE) or combination of both. We present here our experience in the management of these lesions from a neurosurgeon's perspective and review the pertinent literature.
   Objective: To present a series of HH presenting with CPP and DRE managed in the neurosurgery department at our center with an emphasis on the associated endocrine abnormalities.
   Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study over a period of five years included 16 patients of HH. All patients were evaluated with 3 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) brain, complete hormonal workup including gonadotrophins, testosterone (males) and estradiol (females), and video-electroencephalography (VEEG) as a part of epilepsy workup. All these patients were evaluated with postoperative hormonal workup and repeat MRI brain if repeat surgery was contemplated.
   Results: Among the 16 patients of HH, there were 11 male and 6 female children. All the patients presented with DRE with four of these had associated CPP. All the patients underwent robotic-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), with 75% seizure freedom following 1st RFA surgery. Three of the four patients with CPP achieved both clinical and biochemical normalization. One patient had just a marginal reduction in the serum gonadotrophins. One patient was reoperated twice and three underwent RFA thrice.
   Conclusion: The management of HH should be individualized with DRE taking the precedence requiring early surgery. A multidisciplinary approach is therefore recommended for a successful outcome.

TI  - Anti-interleukin-6 therapies for Covid-19: A systematic review, critical appraisal and meta-analysis
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
KW  - TOCILIZUMAB
AB  - Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has emerged as a pandemic by end-January 2020. Of the infected patients, 10%-15% may develop severe or critical illness. So far, no definite treatment is available for Covid-19. Cytokine release syndrome may underlie the pathogenesis of severe and critical disease. Anti-interleukin (IL)-6 therapies are being tried to improve clinical outcomes.
   Methods. We did a systematic review to identify the available literature on anti-IL-6 therapies in the treatment of Covid-19 and used the GRADE method to assess the quality of evidence.
   Results. Four case series and 10 case reports were identified. On critical assessment, we found that these studies reported some beneficial effect of anti-IL-6 therapy, but all the studies had a high risk of bias. The pooled estimate showed that 42% of patients improved but with a very wide confidence interval (CI) (95% CI 1%-91%) and substantial heterogeneity (I-2 = 95%). The overall quality of evidence was graded as 'very low'.
   Conclusions. Although promising, anti-IL-6 therapy for Covid-19 needs to be tested in randomized controlled trials to provide robust evidence.

AB  - This cross-sectional analysis reports the retinoblastoma stage at diagnosis across the world during a single year, investigates associations between clinical variables and national income level, and investigates risk factors for advanced disease at diagnosis.
   Key PointsQuestionIs the income level of a country of residence associated with the clinical stage of presentation of patients with retinoblastoma? FindingsIn this cross-sectional analysis that included 4351 patients with newly diagnosed retinoblastoma, approximately half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017, 49.1% of patients from low-income countries had extraocular tumor at time of diagnosis compared with 1.5% of patients from high-income countries. MeaningThe clinical stage of presentation of retinoblastoma, which has a major influence on survival, significantly differs among patients from low-income and high-income countries, which may warrant intervention on national and international levels.
   ImportanceEarly diagnosis of retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular cancer, can save both a child's life and vision. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that many children across the world are diagnosed late. To our knowledge, the clinical presentation of retinoblastoma has never been assessed on a global scale. ObjectivesTo report the retinoblastoma stage at diagnosis in patients across the world during a single year, to investigate associations between clinical variables and national income level, and to investigate risk factors for advanced disease at diagnosis. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsA total of 278 retinoblastoma treatment centers were recruited from June 2017 through December 2018 to participate in a cross-sectional analysis of treatment-naive patients with retinoblastoma who were diagnosed in 2017. Main Outcomes and MeasuresAge at presentation, proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, and tumor stage and metastasis. ResultsThe cohort included 4351 new patients from 153 countries; the median age at diagnosis was 30.5 (interquartile range, 18.3-45.9) months, and 1976 patients (45.4%) were female. Most patients (n=3685 [84.7%]) were from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Globally, the most common indication for referral was leukocoria (n=2638 [62.8%]), followed by strabismus (n=429 [10.2%]) and proptosis (n=309 [7.4%]). Patients from high-income countries (HICs) were diagnosed at a median age of 14.1 months, with 656 of 666 (98.5%) patients having intraocular retinoblastoma and 2 (0.3%) having metastasis. Patients from low-income countries were diagnosed at a median age of 30.5 months, with 256 of 521 (49.1%) having extraocular retinoblastoma and 94 of 498 (18.9%) having metastasis. Lower national income level was associated with older presentation age, higher proportion of locally advanced disease and distant metastasis, and smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma. Advanced disease at diagnosis was more common in LMICs even after adjusting for age (odds ratio for low-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 17.92 [95% CI, 12.94-24.80], and for lower-middle-income countries vs upper-middle-income countries and HICs, 5.74 [95% CI, 4.30-7.68]). Conclusions and RelevanceThis study is estimated to have included more than half of all new retinoblastoma cases worldwide in 2017. Children from LMICs, where the main global retinoblastoma burden lies, presented at an older age with more advanced disease and demonstrated a smaller proportion of familial history of retinoblastoma, likely because many do not reach a childbearing age. Given that retinoblastoma is curable, these data are concerning and mandate intervention at national and international levels. Further studies are needed to investigate factors, other than age at presentation, that may be associated with advanced disease in LMICs.

AB  - Background. The pattern of dyslipidaemia in South Asia is believed to be different from that in other parts of the world. Nonetheless, limited population-based data are available from the region. We assessed the prevalence, types of, and factors associated with dyslipidaemia among South Asians.
   Methods. We used baseline data (2010-11) of the Center for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) cohort of 16 287 representative urban adults aged >= 20 years from Chennai and Delhi in India and Karachi in Pakistan. Total cholesterol (TC) was measured by the enzymatic-cholesterol oxidase peroxidase method, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) by the direct homogeneous method and triglycerides (TG) by enzymatic methods. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated using Friedewald's formula. We defined high TC >= 200 mg/dl or on medication; hypertriglyceridaemia >= 150 mg/dl, high LDL-C >= 130 mg/dl or on medication and low HDL-C <40 mg/dl for males, <50 mg/dl for females. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out to assess the factors associated with dyslipidaemia.
   Results. The prevalence of any dyslipidaemia was 76.4%, 64.3% and 68.5% among males and 89.3%, 74.4% and 79.4% among females in Chennai, Delhi and Karachi, respectively. The prevalence of elevated TC was higher in Chennai compared to Delhi and Karachi (31.3%, 28.8% and 22.9%, respectively); males had a significantly greater prevalence of high TG, whereas females had a greater prevalence of low HDL-C in all the three cities. The most common lipid abnormality in all three cities was low HDL-C, which was seen in 67.1%, 49.7% and 61.3% in Chennai, Delhi and Karachi, respectively. Only 2% of the participants were on lipid-lowering drugs. Adjusted for other factors, dyslipidaemia was positively associated with age, female sex, obesity, hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use.
   Discussion. Overall, almost seven in ten adults in urban South Asia have some form of dyslipidaemia, and the predominant subtypes were low HDL-C and high TG.

AB  - Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) has been recently recognized by the World Health Organization classification of prostatic tumors as a distinct entity, most often occurring concurrently with invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa). Whether documented admixed with PCa or in its rare pure form, numerous studies associate this entity with clinical aggressiveness. Despite increasing clinical experience and requirement of IDC-P documentation in protocols for synoptic reporting, the specifics of its potential contribution to assessment of grade group (GG) and cancer quantitation of PCa in both needle biopsies (NBx) and radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens remain unclear. Moreover, there are no standard guidelines for incorporating basal cell marker immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the diagnosis of IDC-P, either alone or as part of a cocktail with AMACR/racemase. An online survey containing 26 questions regarding diagnosis, reporting practices, and IHC resource utilization, focusing on IDC-P, was undertaken by 42 genitourinary subspecialists from 9 countries. The degree of agreement or disagreement regarding approaches to individual questions was classified as significant majority (>75%), majority (51% to 75%), minority (26% to 50%) and significant minority (<= 25%). IDC-P with or without invasive cancer is considered a contraindication for active surveillance by the significant majority (95%) of respondents, although a majority (66%) also agreed that the clinical significance/behavior of IDC-P on NBx or RP with PCa required further study. The majority do not upgrade PCa based on comedonecrosis seen only in the intraductal component in NBx (62%) or RP (69%) specimens. Similarly, recognizable IDC-P with GG1 PCa was not a factor in upgrading in NBx (78%) or RP (71%) specimens. The majority (60%) of respondents include readily recognizable IDC-P in assessment of linear extent of PCa at NBx. A significant majority (78%) would use IHC to confirm or exclude intraductal carcinoma if other biopsies showed no PCa, while 60% would use it to confirm IDC-P with invasive PCa in NBx if it would change the overall GG assignment. Nearly half (48%, a minority) would use IHC to confirm IDC-P for accurate Gleason pattern 4 quantitation. A majority (57%) report the percentage of IDC-P when present, in RP specimens. When obvious Gleason pattern 4 or 5 PCa is present in RP or NBx, IHC is rarely to almost never used to confirm the presence of IDC-P by the significant majority (88% and 90%, respectively). Most genitourinary pathologists consider IDC-P to be an adverse prognostic feature independent of the PCa grade, although recommendations for standardization are needed to guide reporting of IDC-P vis a vis tumor quantitation and final GG assessment. The use of IHC varies widely and is performed for a multitude of indications, although it is used most frequently in scenarios where confirmation of IDC-P would impact the GG assigned. Further study and best practices recommendations are needed to provide guidance with regards to the most appropriate indications for IHC use in scenarios regarding IDC-P.

AB  - Background Autonomic dysfunction forms the diagnostic cornerstone in MSA. Data are limited on autonomic dysfunction differences between the two subtypes, MSA-C and MSA-P.
   Objectives To assess autonomic dysfunction in MSA subtypes and Parkinson's disease (PD) and compare it to healthy controls.
   Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study. A validated questionnaire (Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic Dysfunction; SCOPA-AUT) was used for symptom screening. Cardiovascular autonomic testing included deep breathing (change in heart rate, E: I ratio), Valsalva ratio, diastolic blood pressure (BP) rise (hand grip, cold pressor), and postural (tilt, 30:15 ratio) tests. Disease severity was assessed by the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS), H & Y stage, and International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating scale part III.
   Results MSA-P (48 subjects; age, 63.6 +/- 9.7 years; UMSARS, 45.0 +/- 16.5), MSA-C (52 subjects; age, 58.0 +/- 8.1 years; UMSARS, 44.0 +/- 12.8), PD (50 subjects; age, 57.6 +/- 6.7 years), and healthy controls (50 subjects; age, 58.0 +/- 8.0 years) were enrolled. MSA patients had higher SCOPA-AUT scores in gastrointestinal, urinary, cardiovascular, and sexual domains than controls and in gastrointestinal, urinary, and cardiovascular domains compared to PD. The two MSA subtypes did not differ in autonomic dysfunction. Heart-rate change on tilt and deep breathing, and diastolic BP rise on cold pressor test, differed significantly between MSA and PD patients.
   Conclusions Autonomic dysfunction symptomatology and cardiovascular autonomic tests were similar between MSA-P and MSA-C patients. Autonomic symptoms were more prominent in MSA than PD. Emphasis on these domains may improve likelihood of accurate clinical diagnosis of MSA at earlier stages.

TI  - Role of Stereotactic Radiosurgery in Pituitary Adenomas
T2  - NEUROLOGY INDIA
KW  - Pituitary adenoma
KW  - Stereotactic radiosurgery
KW  - Gamma Knife
AB  - Pituitary adenomas are one of the common indications for gamma knife radiosurgery. Gamma knife enables one to deliver a very high radiation dose to the target in a single fraction. Due to steep radiation fall out of Gamma Knife, the adjacent visual apparatus gets minimal radiation. The aim of stereotactic radiosurgery for pituitary adenomas is to stop tumor growth, normalize hormonal hypersecretion, preserve pituitary function, and protect important surrounding structures. Surgery is the treatment modality of choice in the management of pituitary adenomas and gamma knife radiosurgery is restricted for residual or recurrent lesions only. The acceptable marginal dose for non-functional adenomas is 12 Gy. Control rates varies from 76-87% at 10 years are described in non-functional pituitary adenomas. In functional adenomas, to achieve hormonal remission a higher marginal dose up to 25 Gy is needed. However, primary gamma knife radiosurgery is needed in some situations - for instance, when the patient is unfit for surgery due to various reasons or surgical difficulties like the presence of kissing carotids.

AB  - Objective To quantify the prediagnostic loss to follow-up (PDLFU) in an active case finding tuberculosis (TB) programme and identify the barriers and enablers in undergoing diagnostic evaluation.
   Design Explanatory mixed-methods design.
   Setting A rural population of 1.02 million in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India.
   Participants Based on their knowledge of health status of families, community health workers or CHWs (called accredited social health activist or locally) and informal providers referred people to the programme. The field coordinators (FCs) in the programme screened the referrals for TB symptoms to identify presumptive TB cases. CHWs accompanied the presumptive TB patients to free diagnostic evaluation, and a transport allowance was given to the patients. Thereafter, CHWs initiated and supported the treatment of confirmed cases. We included 13 395 community referrals received between January and December 2018. To understand the reasons of the PDLFU, we conducted in-depth interviews with patients who were evaluated (n=3), patients who were not evaluated (n=4) and focus group discussions with the CHWs (n=2) and FCs (n=1).
   Outcome measures Proportion and characteristics of PDLFU and association of demographic and symptom characteristics with diagnostic evaluation.
   Results A total of 11 146 presumptive TB cases were identified between January and December 2018, out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent diagnostic evaluation. In addition to the free TB services in the public sector, the key enablers were CHW accompaniment and support. The major barriers identified were misinformation and stigma, deficient family and health provider support, transport challenges and poor services in the public health system.
   Conclusion Finding the missing cases will require patient-centric diagnostic services and urgent reform in the health system. A community-oriented intervention focusing on stigma, misinformation and patient support will be critical to its success.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to discuss the problem of interpretability of artificial intelligence (AI) and highlight the need for continuing scientific discovery using AI algorithms to deal with medical big data.
   CONCLUSION. A plethora of AI algorithms are currently being used in medical research, but the opacity of these algorithms makes their clinical implementation a dilemma. Clinical decision making cannot be assigned to something that we do not understand. Therefore, AI research should not be limited to reporting accuracy and sensitivity but, rather, should try to explain the underlying reasons for the predictions, in an attempt to enrich biologic understanding and knowledge.

AB  - Corona virus disease (COVID-19) emerged as an epidemic from China, with quick spread globally. The disease can lead to serious problems, like pneumonia or even death especially among vulnerable people with existing health conditions. Its treatment and management require huge efforts from medical professionals often at the cost of their own health and life. Nutrition is the epicenter for the management of such diseases which works synergistically with the medical treatment for quick and better recovery. It has been associated with great human and economic toll and it is still not contained. Currently over two million people are affected and over 300,000 deaths globally. However, due to its newness and unfamiliarity, the understanding of this novel virus is still evolving. This viral infection poses numerous metabolic challenges to those severely affected and addressing them is a key to better outcomes. Medical nutritional therapy is thus among the mainstay of core components of comprehensive treatment measures for patients with COVID-19. This manuscript therefore aims to highlight the role of nutritional management and support in covid-19 disease.

AB  - Background To inform actions at the district level under the National Nutrition Mission (NNM), we assessed the prevalence trends of child growth failure (CGF) indicators for all districts in India and inequality between districts within the states.
   Methods We assessed the trends of CGF indicators (stunting, wasting and underweight) from 2000 to 2017 across the districts of India, aggregated from 5 x 5 km grid estimates, using all accessible data from various surveys with subnational geographical information. The states were categorised into three groups using their Socio-demographic Index (SDI) levels calculated as part of the Global Burden of Disease Study based on per capita income, mean education and fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. Inequality between districts within the states was assessed using coefficient of variation (CV). We projected the prevalence of CGF indicators for the districts up to 2030 based on the trends from 2000 to 2017 to compare with the NNM 2022 targets for stunting and underweight, and the WHO/UNICEF 2030 targets for stunting and wasting. We assessed Pearson correlation coefficient between two major national surveys for district-level estimates of CGF indicators in the states.
   Findings The prevalence of stunting ranged 3.8-fold from 16.4% (95% UI 15.2-17.8) to 62.8% (95% UI 61.5-64.0) among the 723 districts of India in 2017, wasting ranged 5.4-fold from 5.5% (95% UI 5.1-6.1) to 30.0% (95% UI 28.2-31.8), and underweight ranged 4.6-fold from 11.0% (95% UI 10.5-11.9) to 51.0% (95% UI 49.9-52.1). 36.1% of the districts in India had stunting prevalence 40% or more, with 67.0% districts in the low SDI states group and only 1.1% districts in the high SDI states with this level of stunting. The prevalence of stunting declined significantly from 2010 to 2017 in 98.5% of the districts with a maximum decline of 41.2% (95% UI 40.3-42.5), wasting in 61.3% with a maximum decline of 44.0% (95% UI 42.3-46.7), and underweight in 95.0% with a maximum decline of 53.9% (95% UI 52.8-55.4). The CV varied 7.4-fold for stunting, 12.2-fold for wasting, and 8.6-fold for underweight between the states in 2017; the CV increased for stunting in 28 out of 31 states, for wasting in 16 states, and for underweight in 20 states from 2000 to 2017. In order to reach the NNM 2022 targets for stunting and underweight individually, 82.6% and 98.5% of the districts in India would need a rate of improvement higher than they had up to 2017, respectively. To achieve the WHO/UNICEF 2030 target for wasting, all districts in India would need a rate of improvement higher than they had up to 2017. The correlation between the two national surveys for district-level estimates was poor, with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.7 only in Odisha and four small north-eastern states out of the 27 states covered by these surveys.
   Interpretation CGF indicators have improved in India, but there are substantial variations between the districts in their magnitude and rate of decline, and the inequality between districts has increased in a large proportion of the states. The poor correlation between the national surveys for CGF estimates highlights the need to standardise collection of anthropometric data in India. The district-level trends in this report provide a useful reference for targeting the efforts under NNM to reduce CGF across India and meet the Indian and global targets.

AB  - Prolonged therapy, drug toxicity, noncompliance, immune suppression, and alarming emergence of drug resistance necessitate the search for therapeutic vaccine strategies for tuberculosis (TB). Such strategies ought to elicit not only IFN-gamma, but polyfunctional response including TNF-alpha, which is essential for protective granuloma formation. Here, we investigated the impact of PD-1 inhibition in facilitating protective polyfunctional T cells (PFTs), bacillary clearance, and disease resolution. We have observed PD-1 inhibition preferentially rescued the suppressed PFTs in active tuberculosis patients. In addition, polyfunctional cytokine milieu favored apoptosis of infected MDMs over necrosis with markedly reduced bacillary growth (MUCH LESS-THANCFU) in our in vitro monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) infection model. Furthermore, the animal study revealed a significant decline in the bacterial burden in the lungs and spleen of infected mice after in vivo administration of alpha-PD-1 along with antitubercular treatment. Our findings suggest that rescuing polyfunctional immune response by PD-1 inhibition works synergistically with antituberculosis chemotherapy to confer improved control over bacillary growth and dissemination. In summary, our data strongly indicate the therapeutic potential of alpha-PD-1 as adjunct immunotherapy that can rejuvenate suppressed host immunity and enhance the efficacy of candidate therapeutic vaccine(s).

AB  - Manipur, one of the northeastern states of India, lies on the ancient silk route and serves as a meeting point between Southeast Asia and South Asia. The origin and migration histories of Naga and Kuki tribal populations are not clearly understood. Moreover, Kukis have been traced to two different ancestries, which has created confusion among the people. The present study examined genomic affinities and differentiation of the Naga and Kuki tribal populations of Manipur, Northeast India. Twenty autosomal markers (8 Alu insertion-deletions, 12 restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms) were analyzed. Findings show genetic differences between Naga and Kuki tribal populations with respect to the allele distribution pattern, which was substantiated by genetic differentiation (G(ST) = 5.2%) and molecular variance (AMOVA), where the highest percentage of among-group variances was observed between Naga and Kuki tribal groups (7.09%). However, genetic similarities with respect to allele distribution patterns in most of the loci were seen among their respective groups (Rongmei and Inpui, Thadou and Vaiphei). Rongmei and Inpui tribal populations (Naga group) belong to the Naga-Bodo linguistic group, and Thadou and Vaiphei (Kuki group) belong to the Northern Kuki-Chin linguistic group, suggesting that genetic similarities may not be independent of linguistic affinities. Despite differential genetic affinities, both Naga and Kuki tribal populations in Manipur show more proximity with Southeast Asian populations and Northeast Indian populations than with other Indian populations and global populations taken for comparison.

AB  - Zinc supplementation in cell culture has been shown to inhibit various viruses, like herpes simplex virus, rotavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). However, whether zinc plays a direct antiviral role in viral infections and whether viruses have adopted strategies to modulate zinc homeostasis have not been investigated. Results from clinical trials of zinc supplementation in infections indicate that zinc supplementation may be beneficial in a pathogen- or disease-specific manner, further underscoring the importance of understanding the interaction between zinc homeostasis and virus infections at the molecular level. We investigated the effect of RSV infection on zinc homeostasis and show that RSV infection in lung epithelial cells leads to modulation of zinc homeostasis. The intracellular labile zinc pool increases upon RSV infection in a multiplicity of infection (MOI)-dependent fashion. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitous zinc uptake transporter ZIP1 suggests that labile zinc levels are increased due to the increased uptake by RSV-infected cells as an antiviral response. Adding zinc to culture medium after RSV infection led to significant inhibition of RSV titers, whereas depletion of zinc by a zinc chelator, N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN) led to an increase in RSV titers. The inhibitory effect of zinc was specific, as other divalent cations had no effect on RSV titers. Both RSV infection and zinc chelation by TPEN led to reactive oxygen species (ROS) induction, whereas addition of zinc blocked ROS induction. These results suggest a molecular link between RSV infection, zinc homeostasis, and oxidative-stress pathways and provide new insights for developing strategies to counter RSV infection.
   IMPORTANCE Zinc deficiency rates in developing countries range from 20 to 30%, and zinc supplementation trials have been shown to correct clinical manifestations attributed to zinc deficiency, but the outcomes in the case of respiratory infections have been inconsistent. We aimed at understanding the role of zinc homeostasis in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Infection of lung epithelial cell lines or primary small-airway epithelial cells led to an increase in labile zinc pools, which was due to increased uptake of zinc. Zinc supplementation inhibited RSV replication, whereas zinc chelation had an opposing effect, leading to increases in RSV titers. Increases in labile zinc in RSV-infected cells coincided with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Both zinc depletion and addition of exogenous ROS led to enhanced RSV infection, whereas addition of the antioxidant inhibited RSV, suggesting that zinc is part of an interplay between RSV-induced oxidative stress and the host response to maintain redox balance.

AB  - Purpose: To study the effect of choice of anesthesia on the refractive outcomes of intraoperative aberrometry (IA) for intraocular lens power calculation in cataract surgeries. Methods: This prospective, interventional nonrandomized cohort study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital between March and August 2018. A total of 178 patients with age-related cataract were allocated into two groups. Group 1 received peribulbar anesthesia using a mixture of xylocaine 2% + adrenaline 0.125 mg/ml + hyaluronidase 15 IU/ml with a 23G, 32 mm needle, while Group 2 received topical anesthesia with proparacaine hydrochloride 0.05% drops. Intraoperative aphakic measurements and IOL power calculations were obtained in all patients with the optiwave refractive analysis (ORA) system. Analysis was performed to compare the baseline parameters and postoperative manifest refraction at month 1. Results: A total of 89 patients were included in group 1 and 89 in group 2. At baseline, the axial lengths (P = 0.66) and mean keratometry (P = 0.91) were comparable. The quality measure of captured wavefront data was comparable (0.25) between the groups. Also, the postoperative mean refractive spherical equivalents were comparable between the two groups (P = 0.98) at one month. Conclusion: IA can be utilized well for cataract surgeries performed under local anesthesia with good quality of captured wavefront, provided the eye can be aligned in centre with the fixation light of ORA.

AB  - Background: Establishing an association between postoperative outcomes and the spectrum of renal function would allow for more informed decisions to manage surgical risks and improved patient-specific care. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) can be calculated from standard prescreening measurements to gauge renal function. This work investigates the effect of eGFR, as a continuous and categorical variable, on mortality and major and minor complications in patients undergoing revision total knee and hip arthroplasty.
   Methods: 25,056 patients having undergone revision total hip and knee arthroplasty from 2013 to 2016 were identified using the National Quality Improvement Program database. The investigated outcomes included 30-day mortality, major complications, and minor complications. Multivariate regression models were created to evaluate the effect of eGFR on the outcomes of interest. Multivariate spline regressions were generated to assess for nonlinear relationships between eGFR as a continuous variable and the outcomes.
   Results: Our study revealed that as eGFR decreased <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), mortality (P = .0001), any major complication (P < .001), and any minor complication (P < .001) increased. Patients with eGFR 15-30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) had increased risk for mortality (P = .033). There was an increased risk for any major complication at an eGFR 30-60 and <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2), (P < .05). There was an increased risk of minor complications for those with hyperfiltration and <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).
   Conclusion: Patients with lower preoperative eGFR generally display an increased risk for complications after revision total hip and knee arthroplasty. Proper consideration should be given to this patient population before surgical intervention to allow for preventative measures to be taken to improve patient outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Conducting population-based serosurveillance for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) will estimate and monitor the trend of infection in the adult general population, determine the socio-demographic risk factors and delineate the geographical spread of the infection. For this purpose, a serial cross-sectional survey would be conducted with a sample size of 24,000 distributed equally across four strata of districts categorized on the basis of the incidence of reported cases of COVID-19. Sixty districts will be included in the survey. Simultaneously, the survey will be done in 10 high-burden hotspot cities. ELISA-based antibody tests would be used. Data collection will be done using a mobile-based application. Prevalence from the group of districts in each of the four strata will be pooled to estimate the population prevalence of COVID-19 infection, and similarly for the hotspot cities, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and antibody test performance. The total number of reported cases in the districts and hotspot cities will be adjusted using this seroprevalence to estimate the expected number of infected individuals in the area. Such serosurveys repeated at regular intervals can also guide containment measures in respective areas. State-specific context of disease burden, priorities and resources should guide the use of multifarious surveillance options for the current COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - Background: Research has implicated hypofrontality in the pathogenesis of Negative symptoms of schizophrenia.These symptoms are often resistant to treatment. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been shown to reverse this hypofrontality. Higher frequency rTMS has shown better promise, but so far there has been very little research in this area.
   Objective: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of high-frequency (20 Hz) unilateral rTMS over the left Dorso-Lateral Pre-frontal Cortex (DLPFC) in the improvement of Negative symptoms in Schizophrenia.
   Methods:100 patients of schizophrenia with predominantly negative symptoms, were enrolled for this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind trial.Each participant received 20 sessions of rTMS at 20 Hz frequency and 100% motor threshold, via either the active or the sham coil, over 4 weeks. A total of 2000 pulses were imparted in 10 trains per session. Negative symptoms were assessed with the SANS and PANSS. CDSS was used to rule out depressive symptoms. Assessments were carried out at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month, 2-months, 3-months and 4-months follow ups.
   Results: The improvement in the negative symptoms (Anhedonia, Alogia, Avolition, Attention impairment) in active group was statistically significant at 0.01 and 0.05 (p-value) as compared to sham group.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that high-frequency rTMS may lead to improvement in negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It may be worth considering its use as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment of negative symptoms. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study aimed to verify whether there is whole-body (WB) count loss due to dead time of gamma camera when high amount of I-131 is administered to patients. Planar views of a phantom containing 5751 MBq of I-131 were acquired at 24-h intervals for 68 d. Eighty-two patients <= 21 y old were given diagnostic activity (74MBq) followed by therapeutic activity (1110-5772 MBq). WB scans of patients were acquired at 2 h after diagnostic and therapeutic activity administration. Count loss in patients and phantom were compared. In phantom, there was no count loss up to 139 MBq. At maximum activity of 5751 MBq I-131, the loss was 46%. In patients, the average WB count loss was insignificant after the administration of therapeutic activity. Count loss due to dead time in phantom differed significantly from patient results that can probably be explained by the distribution of activity over a large area in vivo.

AB  - Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy frequently accompanied with skeletal co-morbidity. Vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) is an important mediator of skeletal homeostasis that mediates its effect by binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR), a steroid family receptor and modulates various downstream pathways. Multiple polymorphisms have been determined in VDR gene that witnessed significant association with cancer development and progression. Therefore, in this maiden study, we recruited 75 newly diagnosed MM patients and 75 control subjects. 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were measured in all recruited study subjects. Further, PCR-RFLP was performed in DNA samples of recruited study subjects. Results demonstrated significantly decreased 25(OH)D levels in MM patients compared to controls. Additionally, decreased 25(OH)D levels in MM patients inversely associated with disease severity. Further, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of VDR gene showed significantly higher risk of MM disease development in Ff+ ff, Aa+ aa, and Bb+ bb genotypes. Additionally, FokI f, ApaI a and BsmI b alleles were significantly associated with MM occurrence. In conclusion, this study provided initial evidences of association between 25(OH)D insufficiency, VDR gene polymorphism and MM development. Thus, we suggest that a study involving assessment of 25(OH)D levels and VDR gene polymorphism in large patients' cohort might substantiate their role in MM development which would further provide impetus to give 25(OH)D supplementation along with conventional chemotherapeutic agents for myeloma treatment in future.

AB  - The DevR-DevS/DosR-DosS two-component system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, that comprises of DevS sensor kinase and DevR response regulator, is essential for bacterial adaptation to hypoxia by inducing dormancy regulon expression. The dominant phosphatase activity of DevS under aerobic conditions enables tight negative control, whereas its kinase function activates DevR under hypoxia to induce the dormancy regulon. A net balance in these opposing kinase and phosphatase activities of DevS calibrates the response output of DevR. To gain mechanistic insights into the kinase-phosphatase balance of DevS, we generated alanine substitution mutants of five residues located in DHp alpha 1 helix of DevS, namely Phe-403, Gly-406, Leu-407, Gly-411 and His-415. For the first time, we have identified kinase positive phosphatase negative (K+P-) mutants in DevS by a single-site mutation in either Gly-406 or Leu-407. M. tuberculosis Gly-406A and Leu-407A mutant strains constitutively expressed the DevR regulon under aerobic conditions despite the presence of negative signal, oxygen. These mutant proteins exhibited similar to 2-fold interaction defect with DevR. We conclude that Gly-406 and Leu-407 residues are individually essential for the phosphatase function of DevS. Our study provides new insights into the negative control mechanism of DevS by demonstrating the importance of an optimal interaction between DevR and DevS, and local changes associated with individual residues, Gly-406 and Leu-407, which mimic ligand-free DevS. These K+P- mutant strains are expected to facilitate the rapid aerobic screening of DevR antagonists in M. tuberculosis, thereby eliminating the requirement for hypoxic culture conditions.

AB  - Objectives Pediatric myelofibrosis is a rare entity with the largest reported series of 19 cases. We describe here the clinicopathological spectrum and outcomes of 15 cases of pediatric myelofibrosis.
   Methods Case files of myelofibrosis of patients less than 18 years were retrieved from January 2016 to January 2019, and patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis after exhaustive work-up were studied. Their clinicopathological profiles were studied and then followed up for resolution and malignant transformation.
   Results Of the 15 cases of idiopathic myelofibrosis, transfusion-dependent anemia (14/15) was most common presentation. Only one patient showed leukoerythroblastosis with dacryocytes. Myeloid hyperplasia was seen in 13 of 15 patients and megakaryocytic hyperplasia in 10 patients. Dysmegakaryopoiesis was seen in 8 of 15 patients, and only three had small loose megakaryocytic clustering. None showed hyperchromatic megakaryocytes, intrasinusoidal hematopoiesis, or osteosclerosis. One patient with trisomy 8 tested positive for JAK2V617F. Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular in 13, and 8 had world health organization (WHO) MF-3 fibrosis. None of the patients developed malignancy, one had spontaneous resolution, and one patient required allogenic stem cell transplant.
   Conclusions Pediatric myelofibrosis is a distinct entity from primary myelofibrosis in adults and merits mention in the WHO manual as a distinct entity.

KW  - DECIDUOUS TEETH
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of different interproximal contact areas of primary molars, as described in the OXIS classification, in a group of three- to four-year-old caries-free children. Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out with a representative sample of 4,476 contact areas of 1,119 caries-free school children. A single calibrated examiner performed a type III examination to assess the type of contact area between primary molars, as seen from the occlusal view. The contacts were scored as O (open contact), X (point contact), I (straight contact), and S (curved contact) using OXIS classification. The prevalence of the types was expressed in the form of numbers and percentages. The findings were subjected to chi-square and McNemar's tests. Results: The most common contact type was I (75.5 percent), followed by S (153 percent), O (5.8 percent), and X (3.3 percent). Significant differences were obtained (P<0.001) when the interarch comparison was performed for all except the X type of contact. Further, 401 (35.8 percent) children had more than one type of contact in different quadrants. Conclusions: The present study highlights the existence of four different types of interproximal contact areas, O, X, I, and S. in caries-free three- to four-year-olds.

TI  - A Novel Anterior Bladder Tube for Traumatic Bladder Neck Contracture in Females: Initial Results
T2  - UROLOGY
KW  - URETHRAL RECONSTRUCTION
AB  - OBJECTIVE To describe a novel tubularized bladder flap technique for repair of post-traumatic obliterate bladder neck and urethral stricture in women. Traumatic genitourinary injury in females is rare, and generally associated with pelvic fracture. Obliterate bladder neck is frequent in such cases. The options for obliterate strictures are limited with Tanagho's repair as one option. Limitations of Tanagho's repair include bladder neck being shifted anterosuperiorly posing voiding issues, posteriorly directed suture-line risking fistula formation with vagina and rotational tug of bladder putting tension at suture line. Here we present our initial results with our novel technique.
   METHODS The young females with bladder neck obliteration with or without associated urogenital fistula were operated. A novel U-shaped anterior bladder wall flap was used to fashion a urethral tube and bladder neck. Native bladder neck fibres remained at bladder neck itself after reconstruction without limitation of length of urethral tube and continence outcome. Urogenital fistula was also repaired with omental interposition.
   RESULTS Three tubes 3.5, 3, and 3.5 cm tubes were fashioned in the 3 cases, respectively. No perioperative complications were reported. Catheter was removed at 3 weeks. All cases had normal voiding and continence at follow-up of 15, 7, and 3 months, respectively.
   CONCLUSION Our novel flap technique has provided good early results and aims to overcome the limitations of Tanagho's repair. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction
   The aim of the study was to restore I-131 whole body image using Wiener filter.
   Material and methods
   A set of 50 I-131 whole body images acquired using Symbia E dual head gamma camera with high energy general purpose collimator was used. The Gaussian point-spread function (PSF) characterised by the size (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 pixels) and corresponding standard deviation (0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 1.75, and 2 pixels) and noise-to-signal power ratios (NSR: 0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) were used as parameters for Wiener filter. Using the combinations of PSF and NSR, a total of 2450 images (50 x 49 = 2450 images, where 49 images include 1 input and 48 restored images for each input image) were generated and inspected by two nuclear medicine physicians. They selected one best image (the image which had less noise and better contrast between the lesion and background in comparison with the input image). Their results were analyzed.
   Results
   Compared to input image, the metastatic uptake in restored images was very easily perceived. The restored image obtained with PSF (size = 13, sigma = 2) and NSR = 0.3 had better signal-to-noise ratio in comparison to restored image obtained with PSF (size = 11, sigma = 1.75) and NSR = 0.2.
   Conclusion
   The restored images with PSF (size = 13, sigma = 2) and NSR = 0.3 were found to have superior image quality in comparison with its input image.

KW  - iPhone ocular imaging
AB  - In this report, the authors highlight 2 effective and simple techniques of video documentation of the anterior chamber angle using the newer generation iPhone, iPhone 11 Pro Max. In these techniques, we also used a commercially available macro lens with the phone. The patient positions his/her chin on a slit-lamp biomicroscope as done during a routine slit-lamp examination. The first observer places the gonioscope over the patient's eye and projects a thin slit beam of light of the slit-lamp biomicroscope along the superior or inferior Gonio mirror. A second observer records the anterior chamber angle findings using the macro lens clipped smartphone after bringing it closer to the eye of the patient. In the phone, the video mode is selected after opening the phone's camera application. In the subcategory of video mode, 1x or the wide-angle mode is chosen. Under 1x mode, the magnification is further increased to 3x to document high-quality imaging findings of angle. Similarly, in the second technique, the slit (streak) light beam of the direct ophthalmoscope was used that completely circumvented the need for a slit lamp as a source of light.

AB  - Purpose: Integration of genetic information into our understanding of oral diseases has fostered the hope to intervene the disease process among genetically susceptible individuals. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) (mainly in the Southeast Asia region) and tobacco smoking are two of the major public health problems the world is facing today. With more and more diseases being associated with alleles of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA), the objective of the study was to explore any genetic association of OSF and smoking behaviour with specific HLA Class II DQB1*0503 and HLA DRB1*0301 alleles.
   Materials and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from saliva of 64 patients divided into an OSF group, a tobacco smokers group and a control group. This was followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific primer of HLA-DQB1*0503 and HLA DRB1*0301 allele, visualised under 2% agarose gel.
   Results: A statistically significant difference was observed between the OSF group and controls in presence of HLA-DQB1*0503 allele, with 84% of the patients showing the presence. Frequency of HLA DRB1*0301 allele was also found to be significantly higher (72%) among OSF patients (p<0.001). Similar results were shown in tobacco smokers with 28% cases showing presence of HLA DRB1*0301 allele and 13 (52%) of them having DQB1*0503 allele (p<0.001).
   Conclusion: HLA-DRB1* 0301 and HLA-DQB1*0503 are statistically significantly associated with susceptibility to OSF and smoking behaviour.

AB  - Introduction: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is commonly performed to treat chronic painful conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and postherpetic neuralgia. However, whether it is effective in reducing anesthesia and analgesia requirement during surgery (acute pain) is not known.
   Materials and Methods: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II patients with CRPS type II undergoing surgery for repair of brachial plexus injury were randomized (1:1) to receive SGB with either 10 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine (Group B) or a matching placebo (Group S) before induction of anesthesia.
   Results: There was a significant reduction in the requirement of total intraoperative propofol (1659.7 +/- 787.5 vs. 2500.7 +/- 740.9 mg, P = 0.0003) and fentanyl (190.0 +/- 82.5 vs. 327.3 +/- 139.3, P = 0.0001) in Group B compared with Group S. Similarly, in Group B, the time to first analgesic was much longer (328 +/- 219 vs. 64 +/- 116 min, P = 0.000) and postoperative fentanyl requirement for 24 h was lesser compared to Group S (0.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 1.3 mu g/kg, P = 0.000).
   Conclusion: SGB is effective in reducing the requirement of intraoperative propofol and fentanyl as well as decreasing opioid requirement in the postoperative period in patients with CRPS type II undergoing surgery.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has taken tragic proportions and has disrupted lives globally. In the wake of governmental lockdowns, ophthalmologists need practical and actionable guidelines based on advisories from national health departments on how to conduct their duties during nationwide lockdowns and after these are lifted. In this paper, we present a preferred practice pattern (PPP) based on consensus discussions between leading ophthalmologists and health care professionals in India including representatives from major governmental and private institutions as well as the All India Ophthalmological Society leadership. In this document, the expert panel clearly defines the range of activities for Indian ophthalmologists during the ongoing lockdown phase and precautions to be taken once the lockdown is lifted. Guidelines for triage, governmental guidelines for use of personal protective equipment from ophthalmologists' point of view, precautions to be taken in the OPD and operating room as well as care of various ophthalmic equipment have been described in detail. These guidelines will be applicable to all practice settings including tertiary institutions, corporate and group practices and individual eye clinics and should help Indian ophthalmologists in performing their professional responsibilities without being foci of disease transmission.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), an RNA virus which has caused pandemic in the whole world. It has put an unprecedented burden on healthcare system globally, and neither obstetricians nor labour rooms are spared as deliveries and caesarean sections cannot be postponed. There is a threat of collapse of healthcare system in maternity wards and labour rooms due to risk for transmission to healthy patients, obstetricians, midwives and other staff. It is not possible to screen all pregnant women especially in developing countries but due to asymptomatic cases, risk of infection looms large. Many countries including India have declared lockdown to stop the transmission but delivery services have to continue. Proper planning and division of the healthcare system into COVID-positive and negative areas with separate staff can help minimise the spread and preserve precious resources. Hospital staff must protect themselves by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) in COVID-positive and suspected cases.

AB  - Objective
   The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the correlation between semi-quantitative F-18 FDG PET parameters and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) grade and its role in predicting the histopathological grade in RCC. The secondary objective was to evaluate the role of forced diuresis in improving the diagnostic accuracy of F-18 FDG for RCC.
   Methods
   Thirty-three patients with radiologically proven RCC were included in the study. All patients underwent PET/CT on a dedicated PET/CT scanner (Biograph mCT; Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) 45-60 min post-injection F-18-FDG. Patients were then injected 1 mg/kg body weight furosemide (upto 40 mg) and regional PET/CT images of abdomen were acquired after 2 h. For both baseline and post-diuretic F-18-FDG PET/CT scans, maximum standardized uptake value for tumor (SUVmax), mean SUV for tumor, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), tumor-to-liver (T/L) and tumor-to-kidney ratio (T/K) were calculated. Histopathology findings were considered as the reference standard. To assess the incremental value of diuresis in scan interpretation, visual analysis of scans was done.
   Results
   Of 33 patients, histopathology grading was available for comparison with metabolic tumor markers in all except four. Of 29 patients (mean age = 51.89 +/- 13.54 years), 20 patients had clear cell (cc) type while rest had non-cc RCC. Difference between the mean values among the categories was insignificant for all parameters except T/K. Fuhrman grading was obtained in 25 patients (17 low and eight high). SUVmax, MTV and T/L were found to be significantly different between low and high grade patients. Significantly strong positive correlation was observed between Furhman grades and tumor metabolism (r >= 0.5). No significant difference was observed between baseline and post-diuretic scan in any of the patients.
   Conclusion
   Semi-quantitative F-18 FDG PET parameters (SUVmax, MTV and T/L) were found to be significantly correlated with Fuhrman grade in patients with RCC and are important markers for differentiation between low- and high-grade tumors. Furthermore, forced diuresis had no incremental value in characterization of primary RCC lesions.

AB  - Temperature rise in surgical bone drilling is an important factor that leads to death of the bone cells, known as Osteonecrosis, and results into poor osteosynthesis i.e. implant failure. The present work aims to study the temperature rise during bone drilling by a recently developed operation theatre (OT) compatible machine. The temperature during the drilling process was recorded from K-type thermocouple devices, which were embedded in the human tibial bone at four different positions (at 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, and 2.0 mm) from the drilling site. Comparative study revealed that rotary ultrasonic bone drilling (RUED) technique produced lesser temperature (40 - 50%) than conventional drilling on human tibia. Statistical model was developed to predict the temperature rise in RUED process using response surface methodology (RSM), and the optimum parameters were determined using Genetic Algorithm. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out at a confidence interval of 95 percent (alpha = 0.05) to determine the influence of various drilling parameters such as rotational speed, feed rate, drill diameter and abrasive particle size on temperature rise. It was observed that the rotational speed was responsible for the maximum temperature rise (51.8%) followed by drill diameter (18.8%), and abrasive particle size (14.3%); whereas, the feed rate contributed minimal (4%) temperature rise.

AB  - Descemet membrane detachment (DMD) is a potential vision-threatening complication that occurs most commonly after cataract surgery. DMD has also been reported to occur in various other surgeries such as keratoplasty, iridectomy, vitrectomy, trabeculectomy, holmium laser sclerostomy, alkali burn, and viscocanalostomy. Major risk factors include advanced age, preexisting endothelial diseases like Fuchs dystrophy or abnormality in the Descemet membrane and stromal interface, hard cataract, prolonged surgical time, ragged clear corneal incisions, and inadvertent trauma with blunt instruments or phacoemulsification probe. Most DMDs are peripheral and resolve spontaneously. Large, central DMDs if not managed appropriately may lead to corneal decompensation and opacification. Several authors have classified DMD depending on its configuration, height, extent, length, and position with respect to pupil. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography has been used to confirm and classify DMD and can also aid in deciding the management plan. Spontaneous reattachment of the DM with conservative management may occur in cases with small, peripheral, planar DMD with nonscrolled edges. Cases with nonplanar, central DMD, scrolled edges, and length >2 mm, however, have to be managed surgically. Descemetopexy is the gold standard for the management of DMD. Other management options include mechanical tamponade, suture fixation, descemetotomy, interface drainage, and keratoplasty. Prompt diagnosis and timely management often leads to a good visual outcome. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Steroidogenic factor 1 (NR5A1/SF1) is a key transcription factor that is known to regulate the development of adrenal glands and gonads and is also involved in steroidogenesis. Several pathogenic NR5A1 variants have been reported to cause 46,XY disorders of sex development (DSD), with varying clinical phenotypes ranging from hypospadias to complete gonadal dysgenesis. Most often, the primary cause of DSD is due to variants in gene(s) related to gonadal development or the steroidogenic pathway. In the present study, we have analyzed 64 cases of 46,XY DSD for pathogenic NR5A1 variants. We report a total of 3 pathogenic variants of which 2 were novel (p.Gly22Ser and p.Ser143Asn) and 1 was already known (p.Ser32Asn). Functional studies have revealed that the 2 mutations p.Gly22Ser and p.Ser32Asn could significantly affect DNA binding and transactivation abilities. Further, these mutant proteins showed nuclear localization with aggregate formation. The third mutation, p.Ser143Asn, showed unspeckled nuclear localization and normal DNA binding, but the ability of transcriptional activation was significantly reduced. In conclusion, we recommend screening for NR5A1 pathogenic variants in individuals with features of 46,XY DSD for better diagnosis and management.

AB  - Background: Spontaneous regression is well documented in several chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis, alopecia areata, and atopic dermatitis. However, information on vitiligo is scarce.
   Aims: We studied the frequency, extent, and factors affecting spontaneous repigmentation in vitiligo.
   Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken in 167 patients with vitiligo with an emphasis on history of spontaneous repigmentation. Where available, photographs documenting spontaneous repigmentation were also obtained. Repigmentation was defined as spontaneous if it occurred when the patient was off treatment for at least 3 consecutive months.
   Results: Spontaneous repigmentation occurred in 36 (21.5%) patients with complete repigmentation in 6 (3.6%) patients. The extent varied from 0.5% to 100% (mean, 35.4 +/- 37.9%) of vitiliginous skin. It occurred after 3 months to 47 years (mean, 8.7 +/- 9.5 years) of onset of vitiligo and persisted for 2 months to 27 years (mean, 4.4 +/- 6.2 years). Diffuse repigmentation was the most common pattern observed in 20 (55.6%) patients and there was a good color match in 26 (72.2%) patients. Likelihood of spontaneous repigmentation was 3.5 times greater in patients with more than 3 years of stable disease (P = 0.001).
   Limitations: The chief limitation was the dependence on patient recall for the data, except when documented by images.
   Conclusion: Spontaneous repigmentation occurs in one-fifth of patients with vitiligo. In some patients, the repigmentation is clinically significant and long-lasting. Considering its frequency and extent, spontaneous repigmentation should be taken into account both when evaluating novel interventions and counselling patients about the course of the disease.

AB  - Background & objectives: A cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among Italian tourists visiting India. We report here the epidemiological, clinical, radiological and laboratory findings of the first cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection among the tourists.
   Methods: Information was collected on demographic details, travel and exposure history, comorbidities, timelines of events, date of symptom onset and duration of hospitalization from the 16 Italian tourists and an Indian with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical, laboratory, radiologic and treatment data was abstracted from their medical records and all tourists were followed up till their recovery or discharge or death. Throat and deep nasal swab specimens were collected on days 3, 8, 15, 18, 23 and 25 to evaluate viral clearance.
   Results: A group of 23 Italian tourists reached New Delhi, India, on February 21, 2020 and along with three Indians visited several tourist places in Rajasthan. By March 3, 2020, 17 of the 26 (attack rate: 65.4%) had become positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of these 17 patients, nine were symptomatic, while eight did not show any symptoms. Of the nine who developed symptoms, six were mild, one was severe and two were critically ill. The median duration between the day of confirmation for COVID-19 and RT-PCR negativity was 18 days (range: 12-23 days). Two patients died with a case fatality of 11.8 per cent.
   Interpretation & conclusions: This study reconfirms higher rates of transmission among close contacts and therefore, public health measures such as physical distancing, personal hygiene and infection control measures are necessary to prevent transmission.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Cap-lenticular adhesion
KW  - refractive lenticule extraction
KW  - small incision lenticule extraction
AB  - We describe a modified technique of lenticule extraction for the management of cap-lenticular adhesions (CLAs). In cases where the lenticule edge could not be delineated, a Sinskey hook was introduced through the cap side-cut with the hook facing up (toward the cap), advanced to the periphery of lenticule at 3'o clock (for right-handed surgeons) and used to nudge the underside of the cap in the region of lenticule side-cut. The diagnosis of CLA was confirmed on observing a crescentic gap between the lenticule-side cut and the rolled lenticule edge. The gap was enlarged to create a crescentic area of separation spanning 2-3 clock hours. A similar crescentic area of separation was created on the opposite side (9'o clock). A microforceps was used to segmentally separate the lenticule from both edges toward the midline followed by lenticule extraction. Our technique was successfully applied in 11 cases of CLA with no complications.

AB  - Currently, there is no established guidance on how to process and evaluate resected lung cancer specimens after neoadjuvant therapy in the setting of clinical trials and clinical practice. There is also a lack of precise definitions on the degree of pathologic response, including major pathologic response or complete pathologic response. For other cancers such as osteosarcoma and colorectal, breast, and esophageal carcinomas, there have been multiple studies investigating pathologic assessment of the effects of neoadjuvant therapy, including some detailed recommendations on how to handle these specimens. A comprehensive mapping approach to gross and histologic processing of osteosarcomas after induction therapy has been used for over 40 years.
   The purpose of this article is to outline detailed recommendations on how to process lung cancer resection specimens and to define pathologic response, including major pathologic response or complete pathologic response after neoadjuvant therapy. A standardized approach is recommended to assess the percentages of (1) viable tumor, (2) necrosis, and (3) stroma (including inflammation and fibrosis) with a total adding up to 100%. This is recommended for all systemic therapies, including chemotherapy, chemoradiation, molecular-targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or any future novel therapies yet to be discovered, whether administered alone or in combination. Specific issues may differ for certain therapies such as immunotherapy, but the grossing process should be similar, and the histologic evaluation should contain these basic elements. Standard pathologic response assessment should allow for comparisons between different therapies and correlations with disease-free survival and overall survival in ongoing and future trials. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer has an effort to collect such data from existing and future clinical trials. These recommendations are intended as guidance for clinical trials, although it is hoped they can be viewed as suggestion for good clinical practice outside of clinical trials, to improve consistency of pathologic assessment of treatment response.

AB  - Background:
   Peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains the most widely used modality for chronic dialysis in children, particularly in younger children and in lower and middle income countries (LMICs). We present guidelines for dialysis initiation, modality selection, small solute clearance, and fluid removal in children on PD. A review of the literature and key studies that support these statements are presented.
   Methods:
   An extensive Medline search for all publications on PD in children was performed using predefined search criteria.
   Results:
   High-quality randomized trials in children are scarce and current clinical practice largely relies on data extrapolated from adult studies or drawn from observational cohort studies in children. The evidence and strength of the recommendation is GRADE-ed, but in the absence of high-quality evidence, the opinion of the authors is provided and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate. We discuss the timing of dialysis initiation, factors to be considered when selecting a dialysis modality, the assessment and management of volume status on PD, achieving optimal small solute clearance, and the importance of preserving residual kidney function. While optimal dialysis must remain the goal for every patient, a careful discussion with fully informed patients and caregivers is important to understand the patient and family's expectations of dialysis and reasonable adjustments to the dialysis program may be considered in accordance with a philosophy of shared decision-making.
   Conclusions:
   There continues to be very poor evidence in the field of chronic PD in children and these recommendations can at best serve to guide clinical decision-making. In LMICs, every effort should be made to conform to the framework of these statements, taking into account resource limitations.

AB  - Background: Various risk-stratification scores have been developed to identify low-risk febrile neutropenia (FN). The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) score is a commonly used validated scoring system, although its performance varies due to its subjectivity. Biomarkers like procalcitonin (PCT) are being used in patients with FN to detect bacteremia and additional complications. Objective: Our objective was to compare the performance of MASCC score with PCT in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with FN. Methods: This was a prospective observational study that included chemotherapy-induced FN in hematologic or solid malignancy. The MASCC score, PCT levels, and blood cultures were taken at the first point of contact, and patient treatment was managed according to routine institutional protocol. The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Results: A total of 100 patients were recruited, of which 92 had hematologic malignancy and 8 had solid malignancy. Forty-six patients were classified as low risk by MASCC score (>= 21). The PCT threshold, 1.42 ng/mL, was taken as a cutoff value, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.664 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.55 to 0.77) for predicting mortality. AUROC for MASCC was 0.586 (95% CI 0.462 to 0.711). Conclusions: PCT is a useful marker with better prognostic efficacy than MASCC score in patients with FN and can be used as an adjunct to the score in risk-stratifying patients with FN.

AB  - Klippel-Trenaunay and Parkes-Weber syndromes are two differentials of congenital limb overgrowth syndromes. The clinical presentation of both the syndromes is similar in the form of limb overgrowth, pain, edema, or ulcers on the leg. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome consists of capillary, venous, and lymphatic malformations, whereas Parkes-Weber syndrome has arteriovenous fistulas in addition to similar malformations. We present case reports of two patients with a non-healing ulcer on the leg, however, with different underlying etiologies.

AB  - Light insult causes photoreceptor death. Few studies reported that continuous exposure to light affects horizontal, Muller and ganglion cells. We aimed to see the effect of constant light exposure on bipolar and amacrine cells. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 300 or 3000 lux for 7 days in 12-h light: 12-h dark cycles (12L:12D). The latter group was then exposed to 24L:0D for 48 h to induce significant damage. The same animals were reverted to 300 lux and reared for 15 days in 12L:12D cycles. They were sacrificed on different days to find the degree of retinal recovery, if any, from light injury. Besides photoreceptor death, continuous light for 48 h resulted in downregulation of parvalbumin in amacrine cells and recoverin in cone bipolar cells (CBC). Rod bipolar cells (RBC) maintained an unaltered pattern of PKC-alpha expression. Upon reversal, there were increased expressions of parvalbumin in amacrine cells and recoverin in CBC, while RBC showed an increasing trend of PKC-alpha expression. The data show that damage in bipolar and amacrine cells after exposure to intense, continuous light can be ameliorated upon reversal to normal LD cycles to which the animals were initially acclimated to.

KW  - paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
AB  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder that manifests with bone marrow failure, thrombosis and hemolysis. We present a 28-year-old male who presented with weakness, jaundice and transfusion dependence. On initial investigation, he was found to have anemia with jaundice with hemoglobin (Hb) capillary zone electrophoresis suggestive of Hb E (HBB: c.79G>A) trait. The same anomaly was also found in his mother. However, transfusion requirement was an unusual feature in the patient. As his corrected reticulocyte count was raised along with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which was suggestive of a hemolytic process, he was worked-up for the same. However, the direct Coombs test was negative. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy was done to rule out hypersplenism but it revealed erythroid hyperplasia with reduced iron stores despite normal ferritin and iron studies. This was unusual as the patient had anemia requiring transfusions. He had no history of hemoglobinuria but a PNH by flowcytomety revealed a large clone of 81.2% in granulocytes and 88.5% in monocytes. The patient was started on Danazol and steroids for anemia which improved. He was counseled for matched sibling stem cell transplant. He had a full match with his brother. At the time of this study he awaits his transplant.

AB  - The emerging field of theranostics for advanced healthcare has raised the demand for effective and safe delivery systems consisting of therapeutics and diagnostics agents in a single monarchy. This requires the development of multi-functional bio-polymeric systems for efficient image-guided therapeutics. This study reports the development of size-controlled (micro-to-nano) auto-fluorescent biopolymeric hydrogel particles of chitosan and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) synthesized using water-in-oil emulsion polymerization technique. Sustainable resource linseed oil-based polyol is introduced as an element of hydrophobicity with an aim to facilitate their ability to traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB). These nanogels are demonstrated to have salient features such as biocompatibility, stability, high cellular uptake by a variety of host cells, and ability to transmigrate across an in vitro BBB model. Interestingly, these unique nanogel particles exhibited auto-fluorescence at a wide range of wavelengths 450-780 nm on excitation at 405 nm whereas excitation at 710 nm gives emission at 810 nm. In conclusion, this study proposes the developed bio-polymeric fluorescent micro- and nano- gels as a potential theranostic tool for central nervous system (CNS) drug delivery and image-guided therapy.

AB  - The diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has undergone radical change after the development of serological techniques. The in vitro demonstration of lupus erythematosus (LE) cell has less significance for the diagnosis of SLE in the present scenario. Although over the years, the spontaneous in vivo occurrence of LE cell in numerous body fluids as an initial presentation of SLE has been documented. The report of the presence of the LE cell can not only aid in the further workup of the patient but also suggest the involvement of a particular organ or body cavities by SLE. The morphology and mimickers of the LE cell should be cogitated and meticulous search of such cells should play an important role in the evaluation of body fluids. In our case, the patient presented at emergency with pericardial tamponade and cytological evaluation of the pericardial fluid demonstrated in vivo presence of LE cells. The serological work-up then confirmed the case to be SLE. This report and review of literature wish to highlight the fact that this cell still plays a significant role even in the era of immunoassays.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a major public health crisis threatening humanity at this point in time. Transmission of the infection occurs by inhalation of infected droplets or direct contact with soiled surfaces and fomites. It should be suspected in all symptomatic children who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 d, all hospitalized children with severe acute respiratory illness, and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case. Clinical symptoms are similar to any acute respiratory viral infection with less pronounced nasal symptoms. Disease seems to be milder in children, but situation appears to be changing. Infants and young children had relatively more severe illness than older children. The case fatality rate is low in children. Diagnosis can be confirmed by Reverse transcriptase - Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on respiratory specimen (commonly nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab). Rapid progress is being made to develop rapid diagnostic tests, which will help ramp up the capacity to test and also reduce the time to getting test results. Management is mainly supportive care. In severe pneumonia and critically ill children, trial of hydroxychloroquine or lopinavir/ritonavir should be considered. As per current policy, children with mild disease also need to be hospitalized; if this is not feasible, these children may be managed on ambulatory basis with strict home isolation. Pneumonia, severe disease and critical illness require admission and aggressive management for acute lung injury and shock and/or multiorgan dysfunction, if present. An early intubation is preferred over non-invasive ventilation or heated, humidified, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, as these may generate aerosols increasing the risk of infection in health care personnel. To prevent post discharge dissemination of infection, home isolation for 1-2 wk may be advised. As of now, no vaccine or specific chemotherapeutic agents are approved for children.

AB  - BackgroundOral cancer is the most common cancer among Indian men, and has strong tendency of metastatic spread to neck lymph node which strongly influences prognosis especially 5 year survival-rate and also guides the related managements more effectively. Therefore, a reliable and accurate means of preoperative evaluation of extent of nodal involvement becomes crucial. However, earlier researchers have preferred to address mainly its dichotomous form (involved/not-involved) instead of ordinal form while dealing with epidemiology of nodal involvement. As a matter of fact, consideration of ordinal form appropriately may increase not only the efficiency of the developed model but also accuracy in the results and related implications. Hence, to develop a model describing factors associated with ordinal form of nodal involvement was major focus of this study.MethodsThe data for model building were taken from the Department of Surgical Oncology, Dr.BRA-IRCH, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. All the OSCC patients (duly operated including neck dissection) and confirmed histopathologically from 1995 to 2013 were included. Further, another data of 204 patients collected prospectively from 2014 to 2015 was considered for the validation of the developed model. To assess the factors associated with extent of nodal involvement, as a first attempt in the field of OSCC, stepwise multivariable regression procedure was used and results are presented as odds-ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). For appropriate accounting of ordinal form, the ordinal models were assessed and compared. Also, performance of the developed model was validated on a prospectively collected another data.ResultsUnder multivariable proportional odds model, pain at the time of presentation, sub mucous fibrosis, palpable neck node, oral site and degree of differentiation were found to be significantly associated factors with extent of nodal involvement. In addition, tumor size also emerged to be significant under partial-proportional odds model.ConclusionsThe analytical results under the present study reveal that in case of ordinal form of the outcome, appropriate ordinal regression may be a preferred choice. Present data suggest that, pain, sub mucous fibrosis, palpable neck node, oral site, degree of differentiation and tumor size are the most probable associated factors with extent of nodal involvement.

AB  - Intercostal chest tube (ICD) management has been mostly determined by personal experience of surgeons and prevailing local practices rather than a scientifically validated protocol. This study was done to evaluate the impact of protocol-based management of chest tubes in patients undergoing elective thoracic surgeries. This was a prospective observational study conducted from June 2016 to March 2018 at a tertiary care hospital to study the impact of algorithmic management of chest tubes in patients undergoing non-pneumonectomy elective thoracic surgery. A preformed algorithm was followed in all the patients. Chest tube was removed if all the criteria for chest tube removal were met, i.e., stable patient, no air leak, drainage < 250 ml, and no (or small non-expanding) pneumothorax. Out of 122 patients recruited in study, 45.08% patients underwent operations for inflammatory lung and pleural conditions. ICD protocol could be followed in 101 patients, and 84 patients were discharged according to the protocol. Chest tube dwelling time and post-operative hospital stay were significantly less in patient in whom protocol was followed vis-a-vis those in whom it could not be followed. Reinsertions were significantly higher in patients in whom protocol could not be followed. No difference in readmissions and mortality was noted. Comparison with data before starting of the study revealed an early ICD removal, and discharge was possible in prospective patients. Protocol-based management in patients undergoing elective thoracic surgeries decreases the chest tube dwelling time and post-operative hospital stay without increasing morbidity and mortality.

TI  - Temporal transcriptome analysis of neuronal commitment reveals the preeminent role of the divergent lncRNA biotype and a critical candidate gene during differentiation
T2  - CELL DEATH DISCOVERY
KW  - LONG NONCODING RNAS
KW  - EXPRESSION
KW  - PLURIPOTENCY
AB  - lncRNA genes can be genic or "intergenic". "Genic" RNAs can be further divided into six biotypes. Through genome-wide analysis of a publicly available data set on corticogenesis, we found that the divergent lncRNA (XH) biotype, comprising the lncRNA and the coding gene being in opposite directions in a head-to-head manner, was most prominent during neural commitment. Within this biotype, a coding gene/divergent RNA pair of the BASP1 gene and the uncharacterized RNA loc285696 (hitherto referred as BASP1-AS1) formed a major HUB gene during neuronal differentiation. Experimental validation during the in vitro differentiation of human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) showed that BASP1-AS1 regulates the expression of its adjacent coding gene, BASP1. Both transcripts increased sharply on the first day of neuronal differentiation of hNPCs, to fall steadily thereafter, reaching very low levels in differentiated neurons. BASP1-AS1 RNA and the BASP1 gene formed a molecular complex that also included the transcription factor TCF12. TCF12 is coded by the DYX1 locus, associated with inherited dyslexia and neurodevelopmental defects. Knockdown of BASP1-AS1, BASP1, or TCF12 impaired the neuronal differentiation of hNPCs, as seen by reduction in DCX and TUJ1-positive cells and by reduced neurite length. There was also increased cell proliferation. A common set of critical genes was affected by the three molecules in the complex. Our study thus identified the role of the XH biotype and a novel mediator of neuronal differentiation-the complex of BASP1-AS1, BASP1, and TCF12. It also linked a neuronal differentiation pathway to inherited dyslexia.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting the joints and surrounding tissue. Identification of novel proteins associated with the progression of a disease is a prerequisite for understanding the pathogenesis of RA. The present study was undertaken to identify the potential biomarkers from a less explored biological sample such as synovial fluid (SF) cells which is specific for RA and to analyze their functional aspects using proteomic approach. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed using synovial fluid cells of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and 7 differentially expressed proteins were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS/MS). Alpha lpha-Taxilin (alpha-Taxilin) has been found as one of the novel, significantly up regulated protein in RA. It has been validated in the synovium, synovial fluid (SF), SF cells, and plasma samples by Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and real-time PCR. The identification of autoantibody against alpha-Taxilin and in silico studies has further helped us to understand its involvement in disease mechanism. The present study will therefore provide knowledge towards the etiology of RA that pave the way for suitable prognostic marker identification along with other clinical parameters.

AB  - cIMPACT-NOW (the Consortium to Inform Molecular and Practical Approaches to CNS Tumor Taxonomy) was established to evaluate and make practical recommendations on recent advances in the field of CNS tumor classification, particularly in light of the rapid progress in molecular insights into these neoplasms. For Round 2 of its deliberations, cIMPACT-NOW Working Committee 3 was reconstituted and convened in Utrecht, The Netherlands, for a meeting designed to review putative new CNS tumor types in advance of any future World Health Organization meeting on CNS tumor classification. In preparatory activities for the meeting and at the actual meeting, a list of possible entities was assembled and each type and subtype debated. Working Committee 3 recommended that a substantial number of newly recognized types and subtypes should be considered for inclusion in future CNS tumor classifications. In addition, the group endorsed a number of principles-relating to classification categories, approaches to classification, nomenclature, and grading-that the group hopes will also inform the future classification of CNS neoplasms.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate and compare structural and functional changes in macula and optic nerve in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients and healthy subjects. Methods: Both eyes of 20 AD patients and 40 age-matched healthy controls were evaluated. All subjects were evaluated by cognitive testing and comprehensive ophthalmological examination, including visual acuity, visual fields, color vision, contrast sensitivity, anterior, and posterior segment examination, optical coherence tomography, multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), and pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (pVEP). Results: AD patients showed significantly reduced contrast sensitivity, thinner nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell layer andmacular volume. Multifocal ERG wave amplitudes were significantly reduced with delayed implicit times, which correlated significantly with the inner retinal layer thinning and poorer disease severity scores. The correlation with structural changes and disease severity was highest for pVEP, which showed significant derangement in AD patients. Conclusion: Subclinical visual dysfunction may be present in AD patients, which may be detected as inner retinal thinning. A probable photoreceptor abnormality may also form a part of the AD disease process.

AB  - Vitriolage (acid attack) involves an intentional act of violence in which any corrosive is thrown onto the face and body of a person with the intention of disfiguring them. The most common type of corrosive used in these attacks is sulfuric acid (oil of vitriol) hence the name "vitriolage". Sulfuric acid is a strong acid/corrosive and has a toxic nature that is capable of causing bodily injuries leading to damage to mucous membranes, tissues and skin with blindness, burning, and scars often leading to significant disfigurement with temporary or permanent disability. The main reasons for acid attacks are marriage refusal, rejection of love proposals, dowry issues and male aggression. Acid attacks have horrendous physical, social, psychological and economic effects on victims. This review will delineate the various legal provisions relating to acid attacks with special reference to the recent Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act of 2013 which addressed the issue of these attacks specifically by making it a separate offence in the Indian Penal Code under sections 326 A and B. The Bangladesh Acid Offences Prevention Act 2002 and Acid Crime Control Act, 2002, and legislation and policies combating acid attacks in Cambodia, Nepal and Pakistan will also be mentioned. Additionally, the paper will discuss the role of the judiciary in South Asia by focusing on other landmark judgments and decisions and throw light on the campaign in India namely "Stop Sale Acid" aimed at stopping the unrestricted sale of acid. Finally, further suggestions are proposed to assist in combating this heinous crime.

AB  - Importance Among the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the neonatal mortality rate to 12 per 1000 live births by 2030. Identifying high-risk pregnancies can help achieve this target in low-resource countries, such as India, which accounts for one-fourth of global neonatal deaths. Objective To analyze the association of maternal history of neonatal death with subsequent neonatal mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included a nationally representative sample of singleton live births from multiparous women. Data were obtained from the 2016 National Family Health Survey in India. Data were analyzed from November 2018 to January 2020. Exposures Maternal history of neonatal death and a comprehensive set of covariates, including socioeconomic environment, maternal anthropometry, and pregnancy care. Main Outcomes and Measures Subsequent neonatal mortality. Population-attributable risk associated with history of neonatal death was calculated, and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results The overall study population consisted of 127 singleton live births from multiparous women aged 15 to 49 (mean [SD] age, 28.8 [5.2] years) years when the survey was undertaken. In our analytic sample, 11& (8.7%) mothers had a history of neonatal death, and 506 of 2224 total neonatal deaths (22.8%) were attributed to women with history of neonatal death. The prevalence of history of neonatal death differed by selected covariates and across states or union territories. Maternal history of neonatal death was associated with significantly higher odds of neonatal mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.96-2.55), and this remained consistent across different subgroups. The population-attributable risk associated with maternal history of neonatal death was 11.8%. Stronger associations were found for maternal history of multiple neonatal deaths (adjusted odds ratio, 3.50; 95% CI, 2.78-4.41) and in respect to the risk of mortality in early neonatal period (ie, 0-2 completed days) (adjusted odds ratio, 2.45; 95% CI, 2.09-2.86). Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that maternal history of neonatal death is a potentially useful risk factor to identify women and neonates who may need extended and enhanced pregnancy care.

AB  - Background Raine syndrome (RS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by biallelic loss-of-function mutations of FAM20C. The most common clinical features are microcephaly, exophthalmos, hypoplastic nose and severe midface hypoplasia, leading to choanal atresia. The radiological findings include generalized osteosclerosis and brain calcifications. RS is usually lethal during the neonatal period due to severe respiratory distress. However, there exists a non-lethal RS form, the phenotype of which is extremely heterogeneous. There is paucity of data about clinical course and life expectancy of these patients. Results This is the first description of follow-up features of non-lethal RS patients. Moreover, we present three unpublished cases. There are five Asian and two Arab patients. All were born to consanguineous parents. The most common neonatal comorbidity was respiratory distress secondary to choanal atresia. A variable degree of neurodevelopmental delay was seen in the majority of our cases and seizures and hearing or vision involvement were also frequent. Neurological and orthopedic issues were the most frequent complications seen at follow-up in our group. Persistent hypophosphatemic rickets was the most striking endocrinological manifestation, which was scarcely responsive to therapy with phosphate salts and alfacalcidol. Life expectancy of our patients goes beyond childhood, with the oldest of those described being 18 years old at present. Conclusions Manifestations of RS in those surviving the neonatal period are being increasingly recognized. Our study supports previous findings and provides clinical and biochemical observations and data from longer follow up. Finally, we propose multidisciplinary follow up for patients with non-lethal RS.

AB  - The high cost of the powered prosthetic leg is one of the challenges for the lower-limb amputees in developing countries. This Letter presents a robust design and simplified control strategy for a cost-effective magnetorheological-damper-based prosthetic leg for transfemoral amputees. Herein, a simple sensing technique having an accelerometer and two force-sensing resistors is incorporated to obtain the gait events. Based on gait phase detection, a simplified if-else rule-based control strategy is implemented. A comparison between angles of prosthetic and intact knee is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.

AB  - Purpose The primary objective of the study was to assess the frequency and severity of visual field defects (VFD) in primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). The secondary objective was to ascertain any associated risk factors.
   Methods An ambispective review of patients with PCG on follow-up with a 'target' intraocular pressure (IOP) of <= 15 mmHg. Age, sex, laterality, duration of follow-up, baseline IOP, baseline cup-disc ratio (CDR), central corneal thickness (CCT), age during filtering surgery, second surgery if any, yearly IOP, glaucoma medications and best corrected visual acuity from2013 (year 1) to the final review and final CDR were noted down. Children >= 5 years of age with best corrected visual acuity >= 6/60 were subjected to manual kinetic Goldmann perimetry, and visual field defects (VFD) were identified.
   Results Seventy-one of 90 eyes completed a reliable kinetic perimetry. The mean age of children was 12.34 +/- 4.86 years, and the mean follow-up duration was 10.77 +/- 4.69 years. Baseline IOP and CDR were 29.07 +/- 8.83mmHg and 0.66 +/- 0.22, respectively. 86.67% of eyes underwent a trabeculotomy + trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C. Thirty-one eyes (34.44%) required a second surgery, 25 of which were bleb revisions and 3 trabeculectomies. Mean IOP and CDR during last visit were 10.23 +/- 2.76 mmHg and 0.52 +/- 0.25, p < 0.001 as compared with baseline. On Goldmann perimetry, 19 eyes, 26.76%, had defects, arcuate scotoma being most frequent. On the Fisher exact test, a baseline/final CDR > 0.8, undergoing just a trabeculectomy with MMC, needing = 2 glaucoma medications on review or a repeat trabeculectomy was associated with greater severity of VFD. On univariate logistic regression, eyes that needed a bleb revision [OR, 95% CI 9.75 (2.66-35.67), p = 0.001], a repeat trabeculectomy with mitomycin-C [OR (CI) 18 (1.31-245.58), p = 0.03] and final CDR of > 0.8 [OR (CI) 23.1 (3.7-144.21), p = 0.001] were associated with VFD. On multivariable regression analysis, female sex [OR (CI) 18 (2.01-161.04), p = 0.01] was identified as the single most important risk factor for development of a VFD.
   Conclusion At a 'target' IOP of <= 15mmHg, 26.76% of PCG eyesmanifested a VFD over 10 years. Baseline and/or final CDR > 0.8, necessity for >= 2medications or a repeat glaucoma surgery, and female sex were identified as risk factors for development and greater severity of glaucomatous VFD.

AB  - Background Recent studies emphasize the importance of HDL function over HDL cholesterol measurement, as an important risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We compared the HDL function of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and healthy controls. Methods We measured cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL using THP-1 macrophages labelled with fluorescently tagged (BODIPY) cholesterol. PON1 activities toward paraoxon and phenyl acetate were assessed by spectrophotometric methods. Results We recruited 150 ACS patients and 110 controls. The HDL function of all patients during acute phase and at six month follow-up was measured. The mean age of the patients and controls was 51.7 and 43.6 years respectively. The mean HDL cholesterol/apolipoprotein A-I levels (ratio) of patients during acute phase, follow-up and of controls were 40.2 mg/dl/ 112.5 mg/dl (ratio = 0.36), 38.3 mg/dl/ 127.2 mg/dl (ratio = 0.30) and 45.4 mg/dl/ 142.1 mg/dl (ratio = 0.32) respectively. The cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of HDL was positively correlated with apolipoprotein A-I levels during acute phase (r = 0.19, p = 0.019), follow-up (r = 0.26, p = 0.007) and of controls (r = 0.3, p = 0.0012) but not with HDL-C levels (acute phase: r = 0.07, p = 0.47; follow-up: r = 0.1, p = 0.2; control: r = 0.02, p = 0.82). Higher levels of cholesterol efflux capacity, PON1 activity and apolipoprotein A-I were associated with lower odds of development of ACS. We also observed that low CEC is associated with higher odds of having ACS if PON1 activity of HDL is also low and vice versa. Conclusion ACS is associated with reduced HDL functions which improves at follow-up. The predicted probability of ACS depends upon individual HDL functions and the interactions between them.

AB  - Cardiac imaging provides invaluable guidance at all stages of the management of congenital heart disease. Advances in the field of cardiac imaging have contributed immensely to improved outcomes of these patients. Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging modality. Non-invasive cross-sectional imaging using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging supplements morphologic and physiologic evaluation and are being increasingly used for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with a malformed heart. Cardiac catheterization, being invasive, is mostly reserved for accurate assessment of hemodynamic status and percutaneous interventions. Simultaneous improvement in visualization techniques has amplified the information obtained from various imaging modalities. This review provides an overview of cardiac imaging and visualization techniques commonly used in the diagnosis and management of patients with congenital heart disease.

   Methods We randomly assigned 5179 patients with moderate or severe ischemia to an initial invasive strategy (angiography and revascularization when feasible) and medical therapy or to an initial conservative strategy of medical therapy alone and angiography if medical therapy failed. The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or resuscitated cardiac arrest. A key secondary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction.
   Results Over a median of 3.2 years, 318 primary outcome events occurred in the invasive-strategy group and 352 occurred in the conservative-strategy group. At 6 months, the cumulative event rate was 5.3% in the invasive-strategy group and 3.4% in the conservative-strategy group (difference, 1.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8 to 3.0); at 5 years, the cumulative event rate was 16.4% and 18.2%, respectively (difference, -1.8 percentage points; 95% CI, -4.7 to 1.0). Results were similar with respect to the key secondary outcome. The incidence of the primary outcome was sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction; a secondary analysis yielded more procedural myocardial infarctions of uncertain clinical importance. There were 145 deaths in the invasive-strategy group and 144 deaths in the conservative-strategy group (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.32).
   Conclusions Among patients with stable coronary disease and moderate or severe ischemia, we did not find evidence that an initial invasive strategy, as compared with an initial conservative strategy, reduced the risk of ischemic cardiovascular events or death from any cause over a median of 3.2 years. The trial findings were sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction that was used. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and others; ISCHEMIA ClinicalTrials.gov number, .)
   Patients with stable coronary disease were randomly assigned to an initial invasive strategy with angiography and revascularization if appropriate or to medical therapy alone. At 3.2 years, there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to the estimated rate of ischemic events. The findings were sensitive to the definition of myocardial infarction.

AB  - Expression of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), an important proto-oncogene, regulates cell differentiation, proliferation, cell migration and survival in most of the cancer types. EGFR expression has been reported in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), however, many other reports nullified EGFR expression in AML. These contradictory data prompted us to reevaluate the expression of EGFR in AML and carry out a comparative survival analysis between EGFR expressing and non-expressing AML patients (Children and Acute Promyelocytic Leukaemia patients excluded). Bone marrow and/or peripheral blood samples were collected from 60 adult patients with AML with written informed consent. PCR, Real-Time Taqman gene expression assays were used for the detection of genetic alterations. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software (IBM SPSS 20). In our study, EGFR expression was detected in 21 out of 60, in 35% (95% C.I. 23.45-48.48) AML patients. Overall survival was significantly shorter in patients with EGFR (p =\ 0.01), with an average survival of 18.57 months (95% C.I. 12.42-24.73 months) compared with 31.27 months (95% C.I. 28.19-34.33 months) in patients without EGFR. EGFR expression was significantly higher in female patients compared to male (p = 0.037).This study confirms the presence of EGFR in AML and indicates that EGFR expression confers poor prognosis in AML. However, the underlying cause of this adverse prognostic effect has not been identified. Further clinical studies are warranted to determine the exact mechanism through which EGFR activity might contribute to AML progression and identify the potential therapeutic target for the reversal of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics.

AB  - Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection causes acute febrile illness in humans, and some of these individuals develop a debilitating chronic arthritis that can persist for months to years for reasons that remain poorly understood. In this study from India, we characterized antibody response patterns in febrile chikungunya patients and further assessed the association of these initial febrile-phase antibody response patterns with protection versus progression to developing chronic arthritis. We found 5 distinct patterns of the antibody responses in the febrile phase: no CHIKV binding or neutralizing (NT) antibodies but PCR positive, IgM alone with no NT activity, IgM alone with NT activity, IgM and IgG without NT activity, and IgM and IgG with NT activity. A 20-month follow-up showed that appearance of NT activity regardless of antibody isotype or appearance of IgG regardless of NT activity during the initial febrile phase was associated with a robust protection against developing chronic arthritis in the future. These findings, while providing potentially novel insights on correlates of protective immunity against chikungunya-induced chronic arthritis, suggest that qualitative differences in the antibody response patterns that have evolved during the febrile phase can serve as biomarkers that allow prediction of protection or progression to chronic arthritis in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND Given the shortage of cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs in India and poor uptake worldwide, there is an urgent need to find alternative models of CR that are inexpensive and may offer choice to subgroups with poor uptake (e.g., women and elderly).
   OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the effects of yoga-based CR (Yoga-CaRe) on major cardiovascular events and self-rated health in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
   METHODS The trial was conducted in 24 medical centers across India. This study recruited 3,959 patients with acute myocardial infarction with a median and minimum follow-up of 22 and 6 months. Patients were individually randomized to receive either a Yoga-CaRe program (n = 1,970) or enhanced standard care involving educational advice (n = 1,989). The co-primary outcomes were: 1) first occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, or emergency cardiovascular hospitalization); and 2) self-rated health on the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions-5 Level visual analogue scale at 12 weeks.
   RESULTS MACE occurred in 131 (6.7%) patients in the Yoga-CaRe group and 146 (7.4%) patients in the enhanced standard care group (hazard ratio with Yoga-CaRe: 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.15; p = 0.41). Self-rated health was 77 in Yoga-CaRe and 75.7 in the enhanced standard care group (baseline-adjusted mean difference in favor of Yoga-CaRe: 1.5; 95% CI: 0.5 to 2.5; p = 0.002). The Yoga-CaRe group had greater return to pre-infarct activities, but there was no difference in tobacco cessation or medication adherence between the treatment groups (secondary outcomes).
   CONCLUSIONS Yoga-CaRe improved self-rated health and return to pre-infarct activities after acute myocardial infarction, but the trial lacked statistical power to show a difference in MACE. Yoga-CaRe may be an option when conventional CR is unavailable or unacceptable to individuals.

AB  - Lymphatic filariasis is a major public health problem in the developing countries. In India, around 90% of the cases are attributed to Wuchereria bancrofti species morphologically identified as sheathed parasites with tail tip free of nuclei. Microfilariae have been described in urine specimens from patients with chylous and achylous hematuria as well as in a spectrum of other body fluids. Case reports describe their presence in aspirates from numerous neoplasms. However, their association with urothelial carcinoma in urine sediment has been rather rare with only three cases described previously. We report three cases of filariasis in urine cytology, one of which was associated with atypical urothelial cells. Our aim is to stress on the possibility of concomitant filariasis in body fluids and aspirates with other significant findings, especially in endemic areas. Identification of the same renders complete diagnosis and proper treatment to the patient.

AB  - Background The cardiovascular complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus could be attributed to changes in myocardial mitochondrial metabolism. Though it is a known fact that permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers and isolated mitochondria are metabolically compromised in the Caucasian population, studies of Asian Indian myocardial mitochondrial function are lacking. Thus, the objective of the present study is to analyze if there is altered cardiac mitochondrial substrate utilization in diabetic Asian Indians.
   Methods Mitochondrial substrate utilization was measured using high-resolution respirometry in isolated mitochondria prepared from right atrial appendage tissues of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Western blotting and densitometric analysis were also done to compare the levels of proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and regulation.
   Results The mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate for fatty acid substrate was shown to be decreased in diabetic subjects compared to nondiabetic subjects along with an unvaried mitochondrial DNA copy number and uniform levels of electron transport chain complex proteins and proteins involved in fatty acid metabolism and regulation. Decreased glutamate but unchanged pyruvate-mediated state 3 respiration were also observed in diabetic subjects.
   Conclusion The current study reports deranged cardiac mitochondrial fatty acid-mediated complex I respiration in type 2 diabetic Asian Indians with comparable levels of regulators of fatty acid oxidation to that of nondiabetic myocardium. Altered glutamate-mediated mitochondrial respiration also points toward possible alterations in mitochondrial complex I activity. When compared with previous reports on other ethnic populations, the current study suggests that Asian Indian population too have altered cardiac mitochondrial substrate utilization.
   Highlights Diabetic myocardium in Asian Indians showed
   decreased cardiac mitochondrial complex I respiration
   unaltered mitochondrial DNA copy number
   unaffected regulation of fatty acid metabolism
   similar levels of sirtuins and acetylated acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
   lack of increased oxidative stress

AB  - Management of extremity sarcoma has shifted from amputation to limb salvage surgery with improvements in surgical techniques and multimodality treatment protocols. For tumors involving major neurovascular bundles, it has not been accepted as a routine practice uniformly due to fear of oncological outcomes, postoperative morbidity, and lack of expertise in microvascular surgery. We analyzed our experience of limb salvage surgery with vascular reconstruction for extremity sarcomas. Retrospective analysis of patients with extremity sarcomas undergoing limb salvage surgery through vascular reconstruction was done. The feasibility, surgical, oncological, and functional outcomes of these patients was studied. Out of 176 patients undergoing limb preserving surgery for extremity sarcoma, limb salvage using vascular resection and reconstruction was done in 14 patients. Mean age of these 14 patients was 35.4 years (19-49). Arterial reconstruction was done in 7 patients, venous in 5, and in 2 patients both arterial and venous reconstructions were performed. All the 14 patients had tumor-free margins, and none had immediate post-operative graft failure requiring amputation. Post radiation graft exposure occurred in one patient. Involvement of major vascular bundle in extremity sarcomas should not always be considered a contraindication for limb preservation. Optimal oncological outcome with preserved limb function can be achieved by arteriovenous reconstructive procedures. In places with limited resources, autologous grafts are preferred because of constraints of availability and cost.

AB  - An international, expert led consensus initiative was set up by the Collaborative Ocular Tuberculosis Study (COTS) group to develop systematic, evidence, and experience-based recommendations for the treatment of ocular TB using a modified Delphi technique process. In the first round of Delphi, the group identified clinical scenarios pertinent to ocular TB based on five clinical phenotypes (anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, and panuveitis). Using an interactive online questionnaires, guided by background knowledge from published literature, 486 consensus statements for initiating ATT were generated and deliberated amongst 81 global uveitis experts. The median score of five was considered reaching consensus for initiating ATT. The median score of four was tabled for deliberation through Delphi round 2 in a face-to-face meeting. This report describes the methodology adopted and followed through the consensus process, which help elucidate the guidelines for initiating ATT in patients with choroidal TB.

AB  - Malaria, an important parasitic disease worldwide, still has diagnostic challenges in the laboratory. Many studies have been conducted on the detection ability of haematology analysers for malaria. We evaluated the Sysmex XN-series analyser as a tool for detection of malaria by analysing the leukocyte cell population data (LCPD), scattergrams and associated Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) data from both the WNR (white cell nucleated) and WDF (white cell differential) channels. 1281 clinically suspected cases of malaria were screened for malaria by peripheral blood smear examination and were run in the Sysmex XN-1000 for analysis of haematological parameter data, LCPD, all the scattergrams and FCS data. 1281 clinically suspected cases of malaria were screened for malaria by peripheral blood smear examination and were run in the Sysmex XN-1000 for analysis of haematological parameter data, LCPD, all the scattergrams and FCS data. 48 cases had malarial parasite on microscopy; of which, 41 cases were of Plasmodium vivax, 6 cases of Plasmodium falciparum and 1 case of mixed infection. 46 malaria-positive samples showed certain patterns of clusters in the scattergrams of both WDF and WNR channels. A case with only a few ring forms of P. vivax and another with very low parasite load having only gametocyte of P. falciparum didn't show the distinctive cluster. The most distinctive clusters for all other cases were seen in WNR (SFL-SSC) and WNR (SSC-FSC) scattergrams. FCS data for the same were analysed to gate for those events. The gated events correlated (Spearman rho = 0.77, p < 0.01) with the parasite load of the patients. By observing the scattergrams and different parameters in the Sysmex XN-series analyser, malaria can be detected from the analyser itself.

AB  - Background: The natural course of chronic pancreatitis(CP) and its complications has been inadequately explored. We aimed to describe the natural history and factors affecting the progression of alcoholic(ACP), idiopathic juvenile(IJCP) and idiopathic senile(ISCP) variants of CP.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective analysis from a prospectively maintained database of patients with CP following up at a tertiary care centre from 1998 to 2019. Cumulative rates of pain resolution, diabetes, steatorrhea, pseudocysts and pancreatic cancer were computed using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and the factors affecting their incidence were identified on multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional-hazards model.
   Results: A total of 1415 patients were included, with 540(38.1%) ACP, 668(47.2%) IJCP and 207(14.6%) ISCP with a median follow-up of 3.5 years(Inter-quartile range: 1.5-7.5 years). Diabetes occurred at 11.5, 28 and 5.8 years(p < 0.001) while steatorrhea occurred at 16, 24 and 18 years(p = 0.004) after onset for ACP, IJCP and ISCP respectively. Local complications including pseudocysts occurred predominantly in ACP(p < 0.001). Ten-year risk of pancreatic cancer was 0.9%, 0.2% and 5.2% in ACP, IJCP and ISCP, respectively(p < 0.001). Pain resolution occurred more frequently in patients with older age of onset [Multivariate Hazard Ratio(HR):1.7(95%CI:1.4-2.0; p < 0.001)], non-smokers[HR:0.51(95%CI:0.34-0.78); p = 0.002] and in non-calcific CP[HR:0.81(0.66-1.0); p = 0.047]. Occurrence of steatorrhea[HR:1.3(1.03 -1.7); p = 0.028] and diabetes[HR:2.7(2.2-3.4); p < 0.001] depended primarily on age at onset. Occurrence of pancreatic cancer depended on age at onset[HR:12.1(4.7-31.2); p < 0.001], smoking-history[HR:6.5(2.2-19.0); p < 0.001] and non-alcoholic etiology[HR:0.14(0.05-0.4); p < 0.001].
   Conclusion: ACP, IJCP and ISCP represent distinct entities with different natural course. Age at onset of CP plays a major prognostic role in all manifestations, with alcohol predominantly causing local inflammatory complications. (C) 2020 IAP and EPC. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Biallelic loss of SMARCB1/INI1 is associated with highly aggressive malignancies, namely renal and extra-renal malignant rhab doi d tumors, and atypical teratoid/ rhab doi d tumor. Increasing availability of molecular testing and immunohistochemical stains acting as surrogate tools to genetic analysis has led to an increasing recognition of SMARCB1 loss in a variety of neoplasms. Interestingly, many of these lack the typical rhab doi d features ascribed to this group of tumors, making their identification difficult.
   Case presentation: We describe the cytological, histological, immunohistochemical and molecular features of the first case of primary SMARCB1 (INI1)-deficient carcinoma of the thyroid gland in literature. The tumor was unique in various aspects; apart from never having been documented at this location, it showed extensive glandular differentiation, mimicking metastatic adenocarcinoma.
   Conclusion: Awareness of this novel entity is essential to avoid misdiagnosis, and for appropriate management, especially in an era of increased feasibility of targeted therapy.

AB  - Mini-gastric bypass/one anastomosis gastric bypass (MGB/OAGB) is an emerging weight loss surgical procedure. There are serious concerns not only regarding the symptomatic biliary reflux into the stomach and the oesophagus but also the increased risk of malignancy after MGB/OAGB. A 54-year-old male, with a body mass index (BMI) of 46.1 kg/m2, underwent Robotic MGB at another centre on 22nd June 2016. His pre-operative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was not done. He lost 58 kg within 18 months after the surgery and attained a BMI of 25.1 kg/m2. However, 2-year post-MGB, the patient had rapid weight loss of 19 kg with a decrease in BMI to 18.3 kg/m2 within a span of 2 months. He also developed progressive dysphagia and had recurrent episodes of non-bilious vomiting. His endoscopy showed eccentric ulcerated growth in lower oesophagus extending up to the gastro-oesophageal junction and biopsy reported adenocarcinoma of oesophagus. MGB/OAGB has a potential for bile reflux with increased chances of malignancy. Surveillance by endoscopy at regular intervals for all patients who have undergone MGB/OAGB might help in early detection of Barrett's oesophagus or carcinoma of oesophagus or stomach.

AB  - Intracranial parenchymal calcification has both benign and malignant etiologies. Calcifications by malignant etiologies are comparatively rare. Malignant calcification has numerous causes. Calcified brain metastasis from osteosarcoma is one such cause. We present histopathologically confirmed intracranial calcified metastasis in a 10 year old girl. This girl had received treatment for primary osteosarcoma of the left femur with pulmonary metastases. Radiological imaging with Positron emission tomography-computed tomography revealed an intracranial calcified lesion in the frontal lobe and she was successfully operated for the same. The malignant causes of intracranial calcifications are reviewed and radiological differential diagnoses of malignant intracranial calcifications are discussed in this case report. Prior history, strong clinical suspicion, and radiological imaging are needed to arrive at the diagnosis of intracranial calcified metastasis from primary osteosarcoma of the appendicular skeleton.

AB  - Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and its sequelae, Rheumatic heart disease (RHD), contribute significantly to the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Generally considered a disease of poverty and poor socio-economic conditions, RHD affects the population at the most productive phase of their life. The diagnostic criteria for ARF have been constantly updated to improve the sensitivity. The diagnosis of ARF was entirely clinical however, recently echocardiographic evidence has been added as a major criterion. The disease seems to be on the decline in India, but recent studies using echocardiography have shown high prevalence of RHD among school children. The focus of management has been on prompt recognition and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis and preventing recurrences of ARF with long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. However, emphasis should be placed on the appropriate management of patients with established RHD, in order to limit the RHD related mortality.

AB  - The issue of operability in patients with shunt lesions and raised pulmonary vascular resistance is contentious. Several reports suggest that patients traditionally considered inoperable may be operated after treatment with targeted drug therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. We reviewed all the published literature of "treat and repair" approach to gain more insights into the utility of this approach. A critical appraisal of the published literature suggests that this approach is less established for patients with post tricuspid shunts, and for patients with pre-tricuspid shunts with modestly elevated indexed pulmonary vascular resistance (possibly greater than 11 WU.m(2)). Targeted drug therapy may be able to extend the therapeutic window in carefully selected patients, but its use as a routine in this setting seems unwarranted.

AB  - Initiation of an advanced laparoscopic surgery program requires skill and proper training. Despite description of multiple surgical training modules, an ideal method for training of surgeons for advanced laparoscopic procedures is lacking. We propose an abbreviated self-imposed proctored preceptorship training model as the optimum training method for training skilled laparoscopic surgeons in advanced laparoscopic procedures like laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. The laparoscopic donor nephrectomy program was started at the Institute using preceptorship-proctorship model. One hundred left laparoscopic donor nephrectomies were performed over the course of 2 years. Outcomes in terms of performance related (Surgeon) outcomes in the form of learning curve and patient outcomes in terms of donor outcomes and recipient results and were studied. Learning curve was calculated using the moving average method and calculation of mean operative time of every five consecutive cases. Mean operative time for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy was 108.1 +/- 26.5 min, the warm ischemia time averaged at 3.5 +/- 1.3 min and the mean blood loss was 130.1 +/- 54.9 ml. Moving average analysis revealed that approximately 20 LDN cases were needed to complete the learning phase. According to the mean operative time of every five consecutive cases, learning phase of LDN was completed between 26 and 30 cases. We believe that the abbreviated self-imposed proctored preceptorship model of training is an optimum model for starting a new advanced laparoscopic surgery program and can help surgeons to overcome the initial learning curve.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is widely practised by healthcare professionals to revive heart beat and breathing in a patient suffering from cardiac/respiratory arrest. It is increasingly being recognized that in some patients with specific medical conditions, CPR does not alter the overall outcome of illness, and is likely to increase suffering and further deteriorate the quality of life. Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) as an option has been practised in many countries for such cases to avoid futile CPR and maintain dignity of the patient. The decision of DNAR should be taken by the treating physician who is well versed with the patient's medical condition, with information to the patient or her/his surrogate. While ordering DNAR on the patient's medical case record, every effort should be made to treat the underlying disease and continue optimal medical care with compassion. This policy document describes the principles for DNAR, offers an algorithm and format for its implementation, and guidance on frequently asked questions.

AB  - Background: Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) is a rare and aggressive tumor with a dismal prognosis. It commonly arises in the brain (65%), soft tissues (26%), and the kidney (9%). Primary orbital involvement is extremely rare. Although it has been mostly described in children below 2 years old, presentation at birth is sparsely reported. Observation: We have described a case of congenital orbital MRT, who presented with rapidly progressive right-sided proptosis and was initially treated with subtotal resection and postoperative chemotherapy with ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, Etoposide) regimen. On local progression the child was treated with palliative radiotherapy (20 Gy) to the right orbit and second-line chemotherapy with VAC (Vincristine, Adriamycin, Cyclophosphamide) regimen. Unfortunately he died due to progressive disease 4 months after the initial diagnosis. Conclusions: This report highlights the importance of awareness of orbital MRT as a differential diagnosis of rapidly progressing proptosis in the neonatal period. This tumor is often refractory to conventional multimodality treatment and more intensive and innovative treatment approaches are clearly needed in future.

AB  - Objective Through international collaboration, we evaluated the phenotypic aspects of a multiethnic cohort of KCNT1-related epilepsy and explored genotype-phenotype correlations associated with frequently encountered variants.
   Methods A cross-sectional analysis of children harboring pathogenic or likely pathogenic KCNT1 variants was completed. Children with one of the two more common recurrent KCNT1 variants were compared with the rest of the cohort for the presence of particular characteristics.
   Results Twenty-seven children (15 males, mean age = 40.8 months) were included. Seizure onset ranged from 1 day to 6 months, and half (48.1%) exhibited developmental plateauing upon onset. Two-thirds had epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS), and focal tonic seizures were common (48.1%). The most frequent recurrent KCNT1 variants were c.2800G>A; p.Ala934Thr (n = 5) and c.862G>A; p.Gly288Ser (n = 4). De novo variants were found in 96% of tested parents (23/24). Sixty percent had abnormal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings. Delayed myelination, thin corpus callosum, and brain atrophy were the most common. One child had gray-white matter interface indistinctness, suggesting a malformation of cortical development. Several antiepileptic drugs (mean = 7.4/patient) were tried, with no consistent response to any one agent. Eleven tried quinidine; 45% had marked (>50% seizure reduction) or some improvement (25%-50% seizure reduction). Seven used cannabidiol; 71% experienced marked or some improvement. Fourteen tried diet therapies; 57% had marked or some improvement. When comparing the recurrent variants to the rest of the cohort with respect to developmental trajectory, presence of EIMFS, >500 seizures/mo, abnormal MRI, and treatment response, there were no statistically significant differences. Four patients died (15%), none of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
   Significance Our cohort reinforces common aspects of this highly pleiotropic entity. EIMFS manifesting with refractory tonic seizures was the most common. Cannabidiol, diet therapy, and quinidine seem to offer the best chances of seizure reduction, although evidence-based practice is still unavailable.

AB  - Background & objectives: There is limited data on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) among Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and there are no data on the utility of fibroscan in its assessment. The objective of this study was thus to investigate the frequency of hepatic steatosis in young women with PCOS and evaluate the utility of transient elastography (TE) in its assessment.
   Methods: Seventy women diagnosed with PCOS and 60 apparently healthy women (controls) were enrolled in this pilot study. These women were evaluated for clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters, transabdominal ultrasonography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and fibroscan assessing liver stiffness measure (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Other indices such as liver fat score (LFS), lipid accumulation product (LAP), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, hepatic steatosis index (HIS) scores were also calculated. The main outcome measures were the presence of NAFLD in women with PCOS and its correlation with CAP and LSM on TE.
   Results: Women with PCOS had higher frequency (38.57 vs. 6.67%) of hepatic steatosis than control women as determined by abdominal sonography. The aminotransferases were higher in PCOS group (14.28 vs. 1.7%, P=0.03) even after adjusting for body mass index implying higher non-alcoholic steatohepatitis among young PCOS patients. PCOS women had significantly higher CAP on TE compared to controls (210 vs. 196). CAP had a significant correlation with LFS, LAP and HIS.
   Interpretation & conclusions: NAFLD is common in young women with PCOS, and fibroscan using TE may be considered as a promising non-invasive diagnostic modality in its early detection.

AB  - Neurotransmitters maintain physiological condition and behaviour of the brain and body. Studies on transmitting mechanisms and change in concentration of particular neurotransmitters provide knowledge about how these substances enhance our ability to interpret complex neural pathophysiology and thus advancing us towards developing new therapeutic and diagnostic intervention. Since the role of neurotransmitters in the cognitive processes are much complex, therefore their detection-based analysis leads to expand our understanding on their functions and early disease detection. One of the most crucial aspects of neuroscience is developing profound understanding of neurotransmitter release kinetics. As compared to other techniques, employing nanobiosensors for studying neurotransmission and dynamic changes in neurons exhibit relatively fast, accurate and significant results where other techniques generally fail. Using advanced techniques, high sensitivity and specificity also furnish precise information of neurotransmitter transport at the cellular level. Over the past few years, the advanced nanomaterials in combination of various biomolecules and distinct polymers are widely used in development of biosensing platforms for in-vivo and in-vitro point of care neurotransmitters detection. The review article is focused upon summarizing present status of nanobiosensors based neurotransmitter detection for clinical samples. This firstly describes the importance of neurotransmitters, conventional methods for neurotransmitters detection; need of developing advanced sensing methods and importance of nanomaterials to develop these sensing platforms. Secondly, current status of developed electrochemical and optical nanosensors for different neurotransmitters detection is elaborated in detail. The reported work extensively explains the importance of nano based sensing platforms for understating of neurotransmitters detection. Last section of the review summarized the future perspectives of nanosensors in clinical set-up for neurotransmitter detection.

AB  - We evaluated aortic tissue specimens from patients undergoing tetralogy of Fallot repair, to determine whether histologic abnormalities affect postsurgical aortic remodeling and other patient-related variables.
   Using light microscopy, we studied full-thickness aortic wall tissue operatively excised from 118 consecutive patients undergoing intracardiac repair of tetralogy of Fallot. We performed multiple linear regression analysis to identify independent predictors of change in aortic root dimensions, which we measured with echocardiography after repair and every 3 months thereafter.
   Thirty histologically normal specimens were used as controls. Elastic fiber fragmentation was found in 74.6% of the abnormal specimens, mucoid extracellular matrix accumulation in 49.2%, smooth muscle cell nuclei loss in 39%, smooth muscle cell disorganization in 28.8%, and medial fibrosis in 52.5%. At a mean follow-up time of 83.55 +/- 42.08 months, mean aortic sinotubular diameter decreased from 28.79 +/- 9.15 to 27.16 +/- 8.52 mm/m(2) (r= -0.43; P <0.001). Aortic sinotubular diameter decreased by 0.6 mm/m(2) among females (beta=0.6, SE=0.31; P=0.05) and by 0.88 mm/m(2) in patients who had elastic fiber fragmentation or loss (beta=0.88, SE=0.38; P=0.02). In bivariate and multiple linear regression analysis, duration of follow-up emerged as an independent predictor of aortic remodeling.
   The aortic histopathologic changes in our patients had an independent negative impact on the degree of aortic remodeling after surgery. We observed the most improved aortic sinotubular diameter in patients who had either histologically normal aortas or aortas with elastic fragmentation.

AB  - Globally, rare cancers as a group are commoner than any single common cancer. They represent an unmet medical need, and this issue gets further amplified in India due to various reasons, including the limited accessibility of healthcare system to the population at large. The scarce available data yet only represents the tip of the iceberg, due to poor registration and incomplete medical cover. Rare cancers, as a consequence, are driven further away from attention of the policy.makers and financial authorities. Poor research prospectives and lesser administrative support restrict the research in this field. There is an urgent need for initiating studies exclusively on rare cancers in India, considering their prevalence and deprived management, as many countries are already pursuing work in this field. All such inadequacies ultimately affect the patient outcomes. In this review, after discussing these aspects, we suggest a stepwise approach to improve the care of rare cancers in India.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the role of amide proton transfer-weighted (APT-w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differentiating neoplastic and infective mass lesions using different contrast normalizations, region of interest (ROI) selection, and histogram analysis. Procedures Retrospective study included 32 treatment-naive patients having intracranial mass lesions (ICMLs): low-grade glioma (LGG) = 14, high-grade glioma (HGG) = 10, and infective mass lesions = 8. APT-w MRI images were acquired along with conventional MRI images at 3 T. APT-w contrast, corrected for B-0-field inhomogeneity, was computed and optimized with respect to different types of normalizations. Different ROIs on lesion region were selected followed by ROI analysis and histogram analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Shapiro-Wilk's test, t tests, ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, and receiver operation characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results ICMLs showed significantly (p < 0.01) higher APT-w contrast in lesion compared with contralateral side. There was a substantial overlap between mean APT-w contrast of neoplastic and infective mass lesions as well as among different groups of ICMLs irrespective of ROI selection and normalizations. APT-w contrast (using type 4 normalization: normalized with reference signal at negative offset frequency and APT-w contrast in normal-appearing white matter) reduced variability of APT-w contrast across different subjects, and overlap was less compared with other types of normalizations. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between neoplastic and infective mass lesions using t test for different histogram parameters of type 4 normalized APT-w contrast. ANOVA with post hoc showed significant difference (p < 0.05) for different histogram parameters of APT-w contrast (Type 4 normalization) between LGG and HGG, LGG, and infective mass lesion. Histogram parameters such as standard deviation, mean of top percentiles, and median provided improved differentiation between neoplastic and infective mass lesions compared with mean APT-w contrast. A greater number of histogram parameters of type 4 normalized APT-w contrast corresponding to active lesion region can significantly differentiate between ICMLs than other types of normalizations and ROIs. Conclusions APT-w contrast using type 4 normalization and active lesion region (ROI-2) should be used for studying APT. APT-MRI should be combined with other MRI techniques to further improve the differential diagnosis of ICMLs.

AB  - Background: Exposure to arsenic has been reported to affect the nervous system in a number of ways. Various epidemiological studies suggest cognitive impairment in subjects following exposure to environmental arsenic. The goal of the present study was to determine if supplementation of exogenous alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) could ameliorate sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) induced adverse effects on learning and memory and synaptic connectivity in rat hippocampus.
   Methods: Accordingly, NaAsO2 alone (1.5/2.0 mg/kg bw) or NaAsO2 along with ALA (70 mg/kg bw) was administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) route from postnatal day (PND) 4-17 to Wistar rat pups (experimental groups) and the Control groups received either distilled water or no treatment at all. After carrying out Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, the fresh brain tissues were collected on PND 18 and processed for Golgi Cox staining.
   Results: Observations of MWM test revealed impaired learning and memory in iAs alone treated animals as against those co-exposed to iAs and ALA. In Golgi stained hippocampal sections of iAs alone treated animals, decreased dendritic arborization and reduced number of spines in pyramidal neurons (CA1) and granule cells (DG) was observed whereas neuronal morphology was preserved in the controls and ALA supplemented groups
   Conclusions: These observations are suggestive of beneficial effects of ALA on iAs induced effects on learning and memory as well as on hippocampal neuronal morphology.

AB  - Background Consistency of results between different readers is an important issue in medical imaging, as it affects portability of results between institutions and may affect patient care. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in pursuing its mission of fostering peaceful applications of nuclear technologies has supported several training activities in the field of nuclear cardiology (NC) and SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in particular. The aim of this study was to verify the outcome of those activities through an international clinical audit on MPI where participants were requested to report on studies distributed from a core lab. Methods The study was run in two phases: in phase 1, SPECT MPI studies were distributed as raw data and full processing was requested as per local practice. In phase 2, images from studies pre-processed at the core lab were distributed. Data to be reported included summed stress score (SSS); summed rest score (SRS); summed difference score (SDS); left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) and end- diastolic volume (EDV). Qualitative appraisals included the assessment of perfusion and presence of ischemia, scar or mixed patterns, presence of transient ischemic dilation (TID), and risk for cardiac events (CE). Twenty-four previous trainees from low- and middle-income countries participated (core participants group) and their results were assessed for inter-observer variability in each of the two phases, and for changes between phases. The same evaluations were performed for a group of eleven international experts (experts group). Results were also compared between the groups. Results Expert readers showed an excellent level of agreement for all parameters in both phase 1 and 2. For core participants, the concordance of all parameters in phase 1 was rated as good to excellent. Two parameters which were re-evaluated in phase 2, namely SSS and SRS, showed an increased level of concordance, up to excellent in both cases. Reporting of categorical variables by expert readers remained almost unchanged between the two phases, while core participants showed an increase in phase 2. Finally, pooled LVEF values did not show a significant difference between core participants and experts. However, significant differences were found between LVEF values obtained using different software packages for cardiac analysis. Conclusions In this study, inter-observer agreement was moderate-to-good for core group readers and good-to-excellent for expert readers. The quality of reporting is affected by the quality of processing. These results confirm the important role of the IAEA training activities in improving imaging in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - Although aplastic anemia has been extensively investigated, little is known about their circulating cytokine pattern. The present study was done to evaluate the severity of the disease with the 3 major anti-hematopoietic cytokines interleukin-2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). This study is ethically cleared. A total of 102 bone marrow plasma and peripheral blood plasma paired samples were collected from the confirmed acquired aplastic anemia (AAA) patients and 10 control cases after taking written consent and analyzed by the quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical analysis. Considerably increased levels of IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were found in the peripheral blood plasma and bone marrow plasma of AAA patients as compared with controls, that is, 45.76 +/- 20.61 versus 1.99 +/- 1.25, P<0.00001; 26.51 +/- 15.62 versus 11.7 +/- 3.67, P=0.00188; 17.04 +/- 11.64 versus 5.27 +/- 1.92, P=0.00034 and 70.54 +/- 37.57 versus 3.12 +/- 1.82, P<0.00001; 251.82 +/- 243.80 versus 15.66 +/- 6.35, P<0.00001; 39.35 +/- 22.58 versus 11.12 +/- 2.41, P=0.00012, respectively. The IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma levels were observed to be extraordinarily elevated in AAA, but were very low in the control cases. The results confirm that IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma may have an imperative association with the disaster in the bone marrow compartment of AAA patients. The levels and ranges of the observed cytokines can also be predicted by the severity basis of this study.

AB  - Background: Nephron-sparing surgery (NSS) is the standard of care for small renal masses whenever feasible. This study aims to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of NSS performed by open (open partial nephrectomy [OPN]) or laparoscopic (laparoscopic PN [LPN]) or robotic (robotic PN [RPN]) approach over the past 6 years and to study the correlation of histopathological grade of renal cell carcinoma with the RENAL score. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of all patients who underwent NSS was done. Results: A total of 135 patients underwent NSS. The mean tumour size was 4.4 cm. About 61 patients underwent OPN, 24 had LPN and 50 had RPN. Although tumour size was larger in OPN group (P = 0.01), tumour complexity based on the RENAL score was similar in OPN and RPN groups (P = 0.15). The OPN group had shorter operative time (P = 0.008) but more blood loss (P = 0.001) and length of hospital stay (P = 0.049) as compared to LPN or RPN group. Maximum radiological diameter of tumour (P = 0.017) appeared to be a significant predictor of operative time, while the open surgical approach (P = 0.003) and tumour stage (P = 0.044) were found to be significant predictors of blood loss. Hilar clamping time was similar in OPN and RPN groups (P = 0.054) but higher in LPN group (P = 0.01). However, post-operative decline in renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) (P = 0.08) and margin status were comparable among the three groups. The most common histopathology was clear cell carcinoma (70%), and RENAL score was identified as a significant predictor of histopathological grade of tumour (P = 0.008). Conclusion: Open, laparoscopic and robotic approaches to PN provide similar patient outcomes. OPN was usually preferred for larger tumours. The post-operative decline in renal functions and complications were comparable among the three approaches. RENAL score correlated significantly with histopathological grade and hence could help in predicting tumour behaviour pre-operatively.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a pervasive pediatric white blood cell cancer across the globe. With the popularity of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence, these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However, the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AtaNet(theta) is a 2-module framework that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level variability. A weighted Fl score of 94.8% is obtained that is best so far on this challenging dataset. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study demonstrates the epigenetic mechanisms underlying the effect of Bacoside rich extract of Bacopa monniera-a nootropic herb, on scopolamine treated amnesic mice conferred via chromatin modifying enzymes. The focus of the work was to elucidate the modulation of the chromatin modifying enzymes: DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, HDAC2, HDAC5 and CPB in scopolamine induced amnesic mice after treatment with bacoside rich extract of Bacopa monniera (BA) and BA encapsulated in lactoferrin conjugated PEG-PLA-PCL-OH based polymersomes (BAN). We observed remarkable difference between the results obtained after the treatment with BA and BAN. Interestingly BAN was found to be more efficient in downregulating DNA methylation and histone chain deacetylation. Scopolamine treatment showed up-regulation of DNMT1 expression in qRT-PCR by 3.14-fold as compared to the control, which was considerably decreased by 1.5-fold after treatment with BA and remarkably decreased 0.11-fold by BAN treatment. Scopolamine treatment up-regulated the expression of DNMT3a by 1.6-fold while for DNMT3b by 3.13-fold. In DNMT3a and DNMT3b the fold change decreased to 0.64 and 0.76 after BA treatment, whereas the BAN treatment further down-regulated to 0.32- and 0.63-fold, respectively. Similarly scopolamine up-regulated HDAC2 and HDAC5 by 3.12 fold and 3.64-fold, respectively. BA treatment reversed the changes by reducing HDAC2 mRNA to 0.89-fold and HDAC5 mRNA 0.83-fold. BAN further reduced expression of HDAC2 further to 0.39-fold and HDAC5 to 0.31-fold. On the other hand scopolamine down-regulated CBP mRNA expression by 0.28-fold and increased by 1.09 after BA treatment. BAN significantly increased the CPB expression by 1.65-fold as compared to BA treatment. These findings were consolidated by DNMT and HDAC enzyme activity assay, methylation in the promoter region of the memory related genes: ARC and BDNF and Dot blot assay for DNA methylation. The percent activity increase of DNMT and HDAC after scopolamine administration was 375.74 and 240.90 respectively. After treatment with BA the downfall in percent activity was observed as 167.99 in DMNT and 130.57 in HDAC. BAN treatment further decreased the percent enzyme activity of DNMT and HDAC significantly by 30.0 and 61.81 respectively. The potency of BAN in reversing the epigenetic changes of scopolamine induced amnesic mouse brain, can be attributed to the brain specific delivery of BA through polymersomes which are able to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) via receptor mediated endocytosis.

AB  - Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is an extremely fatal complication arising in transplant recipients as a side effect of immunosuppression. PTLDs are seen after both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants though the incidence is much higher in the former. Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection or reactivation due to a state of immune dysregulation along with intensity of immunosuppression used are of paramount importance in pathogenesis of PTLD. EBV associated PTLDs occur early in the post transplant period whereas late onset lymphomas are usually EBV negative. The uncontrolled B cell proliferation can create a spectrum of histological patterns from nondestructive lesions to destructive polymorphic or more aggressive monomorphic PTLDs. Early detection of seropositivity by serial monitoring in the recipient can prevent PTLD development by starting pre-emptive therapy. The mainstay treatment in established cases remains reduction of immunosuppression. Chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory agents are added sequentially based on the type of PTLD and based on its response to initial therapy. Despite various treatment options available, the morbidity remains high and achieving state of disease remission without causing graft rejection can be quite challenging. Hence, a better understanding in pathobiology of EBV+ versus EBV- PTLDS may help prevent lymphomagenesis in transplant recipients.

AB  - Purpose of review It is only over the last few decades that the impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) in very young South Asian population has been recognized. There has been a tremendous interest in elucidating the causes behind this phenomenon and these efforts have uncovered several mechanisms that might explain the early onset of CAD in this population. The complete risk profile of very young South Asians being affected by premature CAD still remains unknown. Recent findings The existing data fail to completely explain the burden of premature occurrence of CAD in South Asians especially in very young individuals. Results from some studies identified nine risk factors, including low consumption of fruits and vegetables, smoking, alcohol, diabetes, psychosocial factors, sedentary lifestyle, abdominal obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia as the cause of myocardial infarction in 90% of the patients in this population. Recent large genome-wide association studies have discovered the association of several novel genetic loci with CAD in South Asians. Nonetheless, continued scientific efforts are required to further our understanding of the causal risk factors of CAD in South Asians to address the rising burden of CVD in this vulnerable population. In this review, we discuss established and emerging risk factors of CAD in this population.

AB  - Multiple Myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy after non-Hodgkin lymphoma and is manifested by uncontrolled proliferation and accumulation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). The incidence along with deaths associated with MM is on rise due to lack of an effective diagnosis at an early stage. The identification of MM decades ago marks the adoption of certain conventional markers such as plasma cell percentage in BM, serum protein electrophoresis for M-band and urinary Bence-Jones protein. This was then followed by utilization of beta 2 microglobulin and serum albumin for determining the staging of MM. The need for a better diagnostic or prognostic marker prompts researchers and hence, certain novel markers have been tested which includes extracellular matrix proteins, angiogenic factors, telomeres and telomerase along with the immune markers. Nowadays, proteomic and genomic studies are being performed to identify novel diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for MM. Followed by this, comes the emerging concept of liquid biopsy which allows easy and non-invasive detection of the disease. The liquid biopsy comprises of circulatory tumor cells along with the nucleic acids (microRNAs and cell-free DNA) released from the tumor cells in peripheral circulation which could be a true representation of BM. This review, hence, summarizes the emerging biomarkers involved in the diagnosis and prognosis of MM.

Objective: The study aimed to explore whether inclusion of informed consent is associated with HIV seropositivity rates among MSM population in select four states of Central India. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted in four states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand that were supervised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We did analysis of data collected during 2017 HSS, supplemented with additional program data from targeted intervention (TI) sites. All nine MSM sites in four states were included. Participants were defined as all those MSM who participated in HSS 2017 irrespective of whether they were mentioned in the random list or were selected by the TI partner. The MSM in the random list who either refused to participate or could not be contacted even after three attempts were classified as "nonparticipants." Seropositivity of both groups was compared. Descriptive statistics were derived. Results: Overall nonparticipation rate was 14.7%, the highest being in Jharkhand (26%) and lowest in Uttarakhand (6.8%). Overall HIV positivity rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in nonparticipants (4.2%) when compared to participants (1.42%). Conclusion: The change in sampling strategy and introduction of written informed consent for recruitment of high-risk groups in HSS 2017 round could have led to an underestimation of HIV seropositivity rate among MSM in the states in Central Zone.

AB  - Background: Chest pain is a common presenting symptom in the emergency department (ED). The HEART (history, electroencephalogram [ ECG], age, risk factors, and troponin I) score, with addition of troponin at 3 h, helps to determine appropriate risk stratification of the patients. Objective: This study evaluated the utility of the HEART pathway as a decision aid designed for risk stratification of patients with acuteonset chest pain for early and safe disposition. Methods: This was a prospective observational study done in a tertiary care center. Focused history, 12-lead ECG, and baseline troponin I level on arrival and at hour 3 were recorded. Subjects were classified as low risk (HEART score 0- 3) or high risk (HEART score >= 4). Patients with a HEART score of 0-3 with negative troponin I at 3 h were discharged and were followed up for major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) within 30 days of ED presentation. Results: A total of 250 patients were screened for the study, of which 151 were included for the final analysis. One hundred and two patients (68%) were male and 54% of patients were younger than 45 years. HEART scores of 0 (n = 16), 1 (n = 43), 2 (n = 44), and 3 (n = 48) were observed. There was only 1 MACE (0.7%) in 30 days after ED discharge in the study population. The mean length of ED stay in the low- risk group was 4.5 h. Conclusions: Low-risk patients, as per the HEART pathway, can be discharged safely from the ED, which reduces ED stay and health care resource use. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare acquired clonal stem cell disorder. Eculizumab and bone marrow transplantation are disease-modifying treatments for PNH but may not be readily available in resource-constrained settings. Of 52 pediatric patients with PNH, 20 had classical PNH and 32 had PNH/aplastic anemia (PNH/AA). Median time to diagnosis was 30 months in classical PNH patients. Renal failure was present in four patients (20%). Six (30%) achieved complete response, 10 (50%) achieved partial response with androgens in classical PNH. Two underwent allogenic stem cell transplantation. In the PNH/AA group, 16 (50%) were in CR and seven (21%) were in PR with anti-thymocyte globulin +/- cyclosporine.

AB  - Lead is a well-known environmental pollutant due to its widespread industrial uses and persistent nature. Studies have underlined the toxicities caused due to occupational exposure to lead and have also reported the association of blood lead levels (BLL) with Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) gene polymorphism; however, such data is scarce from India. This maiden attempt aims to investigate the association of different VDR polymorphic variants on BLL in the north-Indian lead-exposed population. We recruited 100 occupationally lead-exposed battery workers (LEBW) and 100 non-lead exposed controls (NLEC). BLL, serum Vitamin D, calcium and phosphorous levels were measured. Further, VDR polymorphisms namely, FokI, TaqI, ApaI, and BsmI polymorphic variants were studied. Results demonstrated that BLL was significantly increased in LEBW as compared to NLEC. Chi-square test results show that frequencies of Ff FokI VDR genotype and bb BsmI VDR genotype were significantly more in LEBW as compared to NLEC (P =0.02 and 0.03, respectively). Furthermore, FF, as and bb genotype showed the highest BLL in LEBW indicating higher lead levels in some VDR polymorphisms.

AB  - Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease with nonspecific clinical manifestations that commonly affects the pulmonary system and other organs including the eyes, skin, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis usually presents with persistent dry cough, eye and skin manifestations, weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, and erythema nodosum. Sarcoidosis is not influenced by sex or age, although it is more common in adults (< 50 years) of African-American or Scandinavians decent. Diagnosis can be difficult because of nonspecific symptoms and can only be verified following histopathological examination. Various factors, including infection, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors, are involved in the pathology of sarcoidosis. Exposures to insecticides, herbicides, bioaerosols, and agricultural employment are also associated with an increased risk for sarcoidosis. Due to its unknown etiology, early diagnosis and detection are difficult; however, the advent of advanced technologies, such as endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy, high-resolution computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography has improved our ability to reliably diagnose this condition and accurately forecast its prognosis. This review discusses the causes and clinical features of sarcoidosis, and the improvements made in its prognosis, therapeutic management, and the recent discovery of potential biomarkers associated with the diagnostic assay used for sarcoidosis confirmation.

AB  - Amyloidosis is heterogeneous group of disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of misfolded insoluble proteinaceous material with cross beta pleated sheet structure leading to organ dysfunction. This disease is rare and indeed heterogeneous, as it may be hereditary (familial amyloidosis), secondary to spectrum of inflammatory conditions (AA amyloidosis) or member of plasma cell neoplasm family (AL amyloidosis). AL amyloidosis is the most common type of amyloid, however, is rarely accompanied by multiple myeloma or other lymphoproliferative disorder. This disparity in its origin and presentation needs to be addressed by exhaustive battery of investigation tools, to arrive at right diagnosis with correct typing. This is of utmost importance in guiding the treating physicians to choose appropriate therapeutic options. This review deals with diagnostic approach to amyloidosis and its various subtypes.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
KW  - HIV sentinel surveillance
KW  - site preparedness
KW  - supportive supervision
AB  - Background: Quality of HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) depends on preparedness of the site and adherence to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for HSS. A designated sentinel site is considered prepared for the round of sentinel surveillance based on the availability of infrastructure, human resource, and consumables. Objectives: The study objectives were to describe the site level preparedness and adherence to SOP of antenatal care clinic (ANC) sites during the 16th round of HSS in India. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on the findings of the supervisory visits conducted by public health specialists in ANC sites during the 16th round of HSS from January to March 2019. Semi-structured checklists were used to assess site-preparedness and adherence to the SOP for HSS. All supervisors were expected to upload the filled pro forma to the HSS management information system (MIS). We present here a descriptive analysis of the uploaded visit reports. Results: Of 870 HSS sites, 783 (90%) were visited, and 479 (61.2%) reports were uploaded to MIS. Preround HSS training was not attended by one-fifth (22.6%) of the site in-charges; 35.8% of them had never received any HSS training. SOP was followed at most (94%) of the sites. The most frequently reported problem at the sites was inadequate or delayed availability of consumables. Conclusion: The overall quality of site-level preparedness at antenatal clinic sites in India was good. Attention needs to be given to timely and adequate availability of consumables at sentinel sites along with proper administrative support and preround training of site in-charges.

AB  - Background: Postpartum anemia is associated with postpartum anxiety, depression, poor cognitive interaction, and delayed infant development. Oral iron is the currently recommended therapy but is associated with gastrointestinal complaints and poor compliance. Parenteral iron dextran may cause serious side effects, whereas iron sucrose requires repeated visits. Intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) is given as an infusion in a single setting, which is logistically convenient both to patients and health system. It can be particularly beneficial for postpartum women who arc usually discharged from health facility 48 h after delivery. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to estimate the change in mean hemoglobin (Hb) level 6 weeks after administration of intravenous FCM and to document any adverse events following administration among postpartum women. Methods: A prospective, interventional follow-up study was conducted from August to December 2018. One hundred eligible postpartum women with Hb level of 5-9.9 g/dl were administered a calculated dose of intravenous FCM based on Ganzoni's formula with Hb target of 12 g/dl. Hb and serum ferritin were measured at baseline and at 6 weeks after FCM infusion and compared for mean increase. Results: There was a significant increase in Hb and serum ferritin levels after administration of FCM. The mean (95% confidence interval) increase in the Hb and serum ferritin after 6 weeks was 4.2 (3.9-4.5) g/dl and 137.3 (113.6-161.0) ng/ml, respectively. No major adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Administration of FCM was safe and effective in the treatment of moderate-to-severe anemia among postpartum women.

AB  - Lower limb crush injury is a major source of mortality and morbidity in trauma patients. Complications, especially surgical site infections (SSIs) are a major source of financial burden to the institute and to the patient as it delays rehabilitation. As such, every possible attempt should be made to reduce any complications. We, thus, aimed to compare the outcomes in early vs delayed closure of lower extremity stumps in cases of lower limb crush injury requiring amputation, so as to achieve best possible outcome. A randomised controlled study was conducted in the Division of Trauma Surgery & Critical Care at Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi from 1 September 2018 to 30 June 2019 and included patients undergoing lower limb amputation below hip joint. Patients were randomised in two groups, in one group amputation stump was closed primarily, while in the second group delayed primary closure of stump was performed. We compared rate of SSI, length of hospital stay, and number of surgeries in both the groups. Fifty-six patients with 63 amputation stumps were recruited in the study. Mean age of patients in the study was 34 years, of which about 95% patients were males. The most common mechanism of injury was road traffic injury in 66% of patients. Mean injury severity score was 12.28 and four patients had diabetes preoperatively. Total 63 extremities were randomised with 30 cases in group I and 33 cases in group II as per computer-generated random number. Above knee amputations was commonest (57.14%) followed by below knee amputations (33.3%). Two patients died in the current study. In group I, In-hospital infection was detected in 7 cases (23.3%) and in group II 9 cases (27.3%) had SSI during hospital admission (P > .05). Mean hospital stay in group I was 10.32 +/- 7.68 days and in group II was 11 +/- 8.17 days (P > .05). Road traffic injuries and train-associated injuries are a major cause of lower limb crush injuries, leading to limb loss. Delayed primary closure of such wounds requires extra number of surgical interventions than primary closure. There is no difference in extra number of surgical interventions required in both the groups. Thus, primary closure can be safely performed in patients undergoing lower limb amputations following trauma, provided that a good lavage and wound debridement is performed.

AB  - Objective: Regional analgesia continues to evolve with the introduction of ultrasound-guided fascial plane blocks. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel technique gaining recent acceptability as a perioperative modality of analgesia in various thoracic and abdominal surgeries. However, literature on the use of ESPB in pediatric cardiac surgery is limited.
   Design: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, comparative study.
   Setting: Single-institution tertiary referral cardiac center.
   Participants: Eighty children with acyanotic congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery through midline sternotomy.
   Interventions: The subjects were allocated randomly into 2 groups: ESPB (group B, n =40) received ultrasound-guided bilateral ESPB at the level of T-3 transverse process and control (group C, n = 40) receiving no block.
   Measurements and Main Results: The postoperative pain was assessed using Modified Objective Pain Scores (MOPS) which were evaluated at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after extubation. Group B demonstrated significantly reduced MOPS as compared with group C until the 10th postoperative hour (p < 0.0001), with comparable MOPS at the 12th hour. The consumption of postoperative rescue fentanyl was also significantly less in group B in comparison to group C (p < 0.0001) with a longer duration to first rescue dose requirement in group B. In addition, the group B showed lower postoperative sedation scores and intensive care unit stay in contrast to group C.
   Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided bilateral ESPB presents a simple, innovative, reliable, and effective postoperative analgesic modality for pediatric cardiac surgeries contemplated through a midline sternotomy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Angina is a type of chest pain, experienced by patients with ischemic heart diseases. Cardiac autonomic modulation as assessed by heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity is found reduced in ischemic heart disease patients. Marked reduction in heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity in ischemic heart disease patients is found associated with sudden cardiac death. We report a case of a 35-year-old man who presented with angina for the last few months. Thorough investigations showed no evidence of any cardiac or other systemic diseases. However, his cardiovascular autonomic modulation (as assessed by heart rate variability) and spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity were markedly reduced. The patient had sudden death within 6 months of follow-up. Reportedly, no other specific abnormalities were found before death. This case report suggests that patients presenting with typical chest pain as angina may have severe dysautonomia and risk of sudden death even in the absence of cardiovascular or any other known end-organ diseases.

AB  - As part of the MD/MS thesis, a postgraduate resident plans, conducts, analyses, and reports a research study under the guidance of the faculty members of the department. At the end of this process, the resident is expected to know the principles of conducting scientific research. Such an integral component of the resident's training program bears close examination. The thesis does help a resident plan a research study, collect and analyze data, and compile the results. However, lack of dedicated time for thesis-work (especially in patient-care disciplines), the absence of intermediate timelines, and variation in the research ability and interest of faculty guides limit its usefulness. Addressing these issues, ensuring availability and the optimal use of resources, as well as regular monitoring and evaluation at the departmental level, shall go a long way in meeting the goals of a thesis.

AB  - Primary cardiac neoplasms are extremely rare and are far outnumbered by metastases. These are difficult to diagnose and differentiate clinically due to lack of specific clinical manifestations. Technological advances have revolutionised cardiac imaging, with the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) showing promising results in the non-invasive evaluation of cardiac masses. Further, CMRI may envisage the malignant potential of a lesion based on its location, morphology, and signal characteristics, in addition to determining its impact on cardiac function. With the ever-increasing application of CMRI in the evaluation of neoplasms, comprehensive knowledge of their imaging characteristics becomes crucial. (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists.

AB  - Introduction: Newer antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are preferred over conventional AEDs with the perception of better safety profile and efficacy though there is a lack of confirmatory evidence. The present study assessed the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) profile of AEDs prescribed in persons with epilepsy (PWE) as per the System Organ Class (SOC) and compared them on the basis of demographics and treatment pattern.
   Material and methods: This prospective, cross-sectional, and observational study was conducted in PWE attending Neurology Outpatient-Department from February 2016 to April 2019 who were presented with any ADR. World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) scale was used for the causality assessment of suspected ADRs.
   Results: Among the 1011 PWE on AEDs, male:female ratio was 622:389, adult:pediatric ratio 736:275, and conventional:newer AEDs ratio 624:387. Among monotherapy PWE (47.1%), commonly used AEDs were levetiracetam (34.4%), valproic acid (22.9%), carbamazepine (18.3%), phenytoin (11.9%), and other AEDs (12.5%). A total of 1990 ADRs (1.96 ADRs per PWE) were reported as per SOC; among them, newer vs. conventional AEDs did not reveal any significant difference; however monotherapy vs. polytherapy showed differences in nervous system disorders ( p =0.01) and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (p - 0.005). Causality assessment revealed 0.3% certain, 273% probable, 613% possible, and 11.1% unlikely association of ADRs with AEDs. Depending on the ADRs, there was either withdrawal of AED (0.9%), reduction in dose (48.4%), or continuation in the same dose as before (50.7%).
   Conclusion: The ADR analysis showed that newer AEDs were associated with a similar trend of ADRs as that of conventional AEDs. Thus, the choice among newer and conventional AEDs should preferably focus on the experience of better efficacy in addition to safety data. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has led to promising advances in the treatment of patients with NSCLC and SCLC with advanced or metastatic disease. Most ICIs target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis with the aim of restoring antitumor immunity. Multiple clinical trials for ICIs have evaluated a predictive value of PD-L1 protein expression in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) by immunohistochemistry (IHC), for which different assays with specific IHC platforms were applied. Of those, some PD-L1 IHC assays have been validated for the prescription of the corresponding agent for first- or second-line treatment. However, not all laboratories are equipped with the dedicated platforms, and many laboratories have set up in-house or laboratory-developed tests that are more affordable than the generally expensive clinical trial-validated assays. Although PD-L1 IHC test is now deployed in most pathology laboratories, its appropriate implementation and interpretation are critical as a predictive biomarker and can be challenging owing to the multiple antibody clones and platforms or assays available and given the typically small size of samples provided. Because many articles have been published since the issue of the IASLC Atlas of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry Testing in Lung Cancer, this review by the IASLC Pathology Committee provides updates on the indications of ICIs for lung cancer in 2019 and discusses important considerations on preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical aspects of PD-L1 IHC testing, including specimen type, validation of assays, external quality assurance, and training.

AB  - Background and Purpose-Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are often subject to rapid deterioration due to hematoma expansion. Current prognostic scores are largely based on the assessment of baseline radiographic characteristics and do not account for subsequent changes. We propose that calculation of prognostic scores using delayed imaging will have better predictive values for long-term mortality compared with baseline assessments.
   Methods-We analyzed prospectively collected data from the multicenter PREDICT study (Prediction of Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using the CT-Angiography Spot Sign). We calculated the ICH Score, Functional Outcome in Patients With Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage (FUNC) Score, and modified ICH Score using imaging data at initial presentation and at 24 hours. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves for all 3 scores, both at baseline and at 24 hours, and assessed predictive accuracy for 90-day mortality with their respective area under the curve. Competing curves were assessed with nonparametric methods.
   Results-The analysis included 280 patients, with a 90-day mortality rate of 25.4%. All 3 prognostic scores calculated using 24-hour imaging were more predictive of mortality as compared with baseline: the area under the curve was 0.82 at 24 hours (95% CI, 0.76-0.87) compared with 0.78 at baseline (95% CI, 0.72-0.84) for ICH Score, 0.84 at 24 hours (95% CI, 0.79-0.89) compared with 0.76 at baseline (95% CI, 0.70-0.83) for FUNC, and 0.82 at 24 hours (95% CI, 0.76-0.88) compared with 0.74 at baseline (95% CI, 0.67-0.81) for modified ICH Score.
   Conclusions-Calculation of the ICH Score, FUNC Score, and modified ICH Score using 24-hour imaging demonstrated better prognostic value in predicting 90-day mortality compared with those calculated at presentation.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the clinical profile and outcome of neonates with non-immune hydrops (NIH). Methods Data of all the NIH cases admitted to neonatal intensive care unit at our center, New Delhi from January, 2010 to October, 2017 were extracted from hospital records, which included clinical profile and outcomes. Results Of the 17,299 total births, 27 neonates were identified to have NIH. Antenatal interventions were undertaken in five (18.5%) cases. The most common etiology of NIH was cardiac (n=5; 18.5%). Two babies with chylothorax were successfully managed with octreotide infusions. Overall survival rate of NIH was 70.3% (n=19). All neonates with a suspected genetic syndrome died. Conclusion Multidisciplinary team including obstetricians, pediatric surgeons, geneticists and neonatologists can improve outcome in neonates with NIH.

AB  - Background: Helicobacter pylori infection has been associated with insulin resistance and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This study was done to evaluate the effect of H. pylori-eradication therapy (HPET) in patients with NAFLD compared to standard management therapy (SMT).
   Methods: Eighty NAFLD patients with H. pylori co-infection were randomized into SMT (diet and exercise, n = 36) and HPET (SMT plus amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and pantoprazole, n =44) groups. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP), anthropometric parameters, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glycemic parameters including homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured and compared between two groups at the baseline and 24 weeks.
   Results: Sixty-four participants (SMT group [n = 28] and HPET group [n = 36]) were included in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. Both the SMT group and the HPET group had a significant reduction in CAP scores at 24weeks (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively), but the change between the groups was insignificant (P = 0.213). Successful eradication of H. pylori occurred in 68% of the HPET group and led to greater improvement in HOMA-IR at 24 weeks compared to SMT or non-responder patients (P = 0.007). The liver enzymes reduced significantly at 24 weeks in both groups, but the changes between the groups were similar. The lipid parameters remained unchanged within the groups and between the groups at 24 weeks. A significant increase in the levels of reduced glutathione was noted in the HPET group, but the change between the two groups was not statistically different.
   Conclusions: HPET was found to be comparable to SMT alone in reducing hepatic steatosis and liver enzymes at 24 weeks in NAFLD patients. However, successful eradication of H. pylori led to greater improvement in HOMA-IR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study is to determine the degree of the relationship between perfusion CT (PCT) parameters and iodine concentration metrics derived from triplebolus dual-energy CT (DECT) and to compare the radiation dose delivered.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS. This single-center prospective study was conducted from October 2015 to September 2017. Twenty-three consenting adults (15 men and eight women; mean [+/- SD] age, 56 +/- 13 years [range, 25-78 years]) with renal cell carcinomas underwent consecutive PCT and triple-bolus DECT examinations. Triple-bolus DECT consisted of synchronous corticomedullary, nephrographic, and delayed phase scans acquired using a dual-source DECT scanner. Two readers independently analyzed blood flow, blood volume, and permeability, as measured by PCT, and iodine density and iodine ratio, as measured by triple-bolus DEM'. Size-specific dose estimates were calculated for both groups.
   RESULTS. Interreader agreement was good for permeability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] =.812) and blood flow (ICC = 0.849) and excellent for blood volume (ICC = 0.956), iodine density (ICC = 0.961), and iodine ratio (ICC = 0.956). Very strong positive correlations were found between blood volume and iodine density (p < 0.001) and between bkxxi volume and iodine ratio (p < 0.001). Strong positive correlations were found between blood flow and iodine density (p < 0.001) and between blood flow and iodine ratio (p < 0.001). The correlations between permeability and iodine density (p = 0.01) and between permeability and iodine ratio (p = 0.02) were moderate. The mean size-specific dose estimate of triple-bolus DECT was approximately 15 times lower than that of PCT (p < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION. Quantitative iodine metrics derived from triple-bolus DECT showed significant correlation with (1 parameters in renal cell carcinoma, with a significantly lower radiation dose.

AB  - Background: Clinical or biochemical markers that have good correlation with magnetic resonance proton density fat fraction (MR PDFF) can be used as simple tools for the screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and in determining the degree of fatty infiltration of the liver. The objective of this study was to determine the degree of relationship between MR PDFF and ultrasonography (USG) grades of fatty liver, and clinical and biochemical parameters of adolescents and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of USG for diagnosis of NAFLD.
   Methods: This prospective study included 34 overweight adolescents (mean age, 12.1 +/- 1.5 years; range, 10-15.1 years; 10 girls and 24 boys) who underwent both USG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Correlation analysis was performed between MR fat fraction and USG grades of fatty liver, and clinical and biochemical parameters of fatty liver disease.
   Results: MR fat fraction had a moderate positive correlation with serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) (rho = 0.634, p < 0.001, rho = 0.516, p = 0.002, respectively) and had a negligible or weak correlation with body mass index (BMI), BMI standard deviation score (SDS), waist circumference (WC), fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), serum triglyceride, low- density lipoprotein (LDL), high- density lipoprotein (HDL) and total cholesterol levels. The sensitivity and specificity of USG in the diagnosis of NAFLD were 81% (95% confidence interval 54%-95%) and 50% (27%-73%), respectively. The MR fat fraction had a moderate positive correlation with ultrasound grades of fatty liver (rho = 0.487, p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: Serum ALT and AST are potential biochemical markers to assess the degree of hepatic steatosis in NAFLD, which needs validation in further studies. USG can be used as a screening tool for NAFLD, but the diagnosis should be confirmed by estimating the MR fat fraction.

AB  - Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is the only preventable cardiovascular disease which causes significant morbidity and mortality particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Early clinical diagnosis is key, the updated Jones criteria increases the likelihood of diagnosis in endemic settings, including the echo diagnosis of sub-clinical carditis, polyarthralgia and monoarthritis as well as amended thresholds of minor criteria. The mainstay of rheumatic heart valve disease (RHVD) is a thorough clinical and echocardiographic investigation while severe disease is managed with medical, interventional and surgical treatment. In this report we detail some of the more recent epidemiological findings and focus on the diagnostic and interventional elements of the specific valve lesions. Finally, we discuss some of the recent efforts to improve medical and surgical management for this disease. As we are already more than a year from the historic 2018 World Heart Organization Resolution against Rheumatic Fever and Rheumatic Heart Disease, we advocate strongly for renewed efforts to prioritize this disease across the endemic regions of the world.

AB  - Background: Dyslexia is a type of specific learning disability (SLD) which has neurobiological origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. The impaired reading in dyslexia is associated with inability to process the sensory input that enters the nervous system. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a potential source in understanding the neurobiology and to identify the brain basis of sensory stimuli processed in dyslexic patients.
   Methodology: The present study was conducted to assess the difference in neural changes using fMRI in children and adolescents with SLD compared with normal children and also the correlation of clinical parameters with BOLD - fMRI changes. Sixteen children and adolescents diagnosed as dyslexia were assessed with All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) SLD Battery, Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI KID) and Aggregated Neurobehavioral Student Health and Educational Review (ANSER) system and compared with 15 controls matched with age and sex. Participants of both groups were asked to perform 3 tasks during the fMRI acquisition (phonological, picture-naming and semantic tasks).
   Result: As compared to control group, the participants with dyslexia show phonological decoding problem. During picture task, the participants with dyslexia use more areas of brain involve in recalling the memory events while during semantic tasks processing the occipito-temporal (fusiform) gyrus was less activated when in contrast to control.
   Conclusion: This study shows that participants with dyslexia fail to use normal brain regions specialized in language processing, but rather use different areas.

KW  - DERMOID CYSTS
AB  - Objective: To report one of the largest case series on periorbital and orbital dermoid/epidermoid cyst and to highlight some important and unusual findings.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of 280 cases with orbital or periorbital dermoid/epidermoid cyst that presented over a period of 14 years.
   Results: Periorbital cyst was more than twice as common as orbital cyst. Majority of patients had bony changes with some unusual findings seen in cases with orbital cysts, that is, presence of fluid-fluid level, calcification in the wall, and coexistent double cysts in 19 (6.8%), 5 (1.8%), and 4 (1.5%) cases, respectively. Dumbbell dermoid cyst with connection in temporal fossa was seen in 16 (5.7%) cases. Subperiosteal location of orbital dermoid cyst was most destructive because of extensive bony invasion. Most of the periorbital cysts were removed in toto, whereas orbital cysts required decompression before removal. The histopathological diagnosis was dermoid cyst in 250 (89%) cases and epidermoid cyst in 30 (11%) cases. In 69 (25%) cases, there was a chronic inflammatory response.
   Conclusions: We recommend imaging in all patients with orbital dermoid to rule out dumbbell or subperiosteal extension. Also, we advocate early removal of all dermoid cysts in view of bone changes seen in majority of our cases and presence of inflammatory cells in 25% of cases.

AB  - Sestrin2 (Sesn2) appears to mediate neuroprotection against Parkinson's disease (PD)-associated pathophysiology, however, the mechanism is unknown. This pilot study examines serum Sesn2 level in PD patients and older adult control and also interrogates the rescue effect of Syzygium aromaticum extract on the neurotoxicity by paraquat in neuroblastoma cells. The blood sample was collected from 36 PD patients and 54 older adult control and concentration of serum Sesn2 was measured by surface plasmon resonance and western blot. A significantly elevated level of Sesn2 (p < .0001) was observed in sera of PD group (15.96 +/- 2.428 ng/mu L) than the control (13.65 +/- 2.125 ng/mu L) which was further confirmed by western blotting. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.76) determined the threshold value of >= 14.58 ng/mu L for differentiating PD from control. The S aromaticum extract exhibited the rescue effect from paraquat induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. Further, these cells showed dose-dependent downregulation of p53, Sesn2, and phosphorylated-AMPK with concomitant increase in phosphorylated-p70S6K level than paraquat-treated cells. The differential level of Sesn2 in study subjects proposes its utility as one of the potential serum markers in PD. The ethanolic extract of S aromaticum may serve as a novel platform for management of PD-associated neurotoxicity.

AB  - Background: In 2017, the sampling procedure for HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) among all high-risk groups was changed from the consecutive sampling to random sampling along with the introduction of linked anonymous testing strategy with informed written consent. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether the inclusion of informed consent affects the HIV positivity rate among the participants and nonparticipants injecting drug users (IDU) in HSS 2017 in four states of Central Zone of India. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study. All sentinel sites from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand located at targeted intervention facilities in 2017 were included in the study. Information about the participation and nonparticipation of each high-risk individual at the sentinel site was gathered from the master list, respective registers, and website portal of the National AIDS Control Organization. A total of 8639 individuals were included in the analysis. Results: Overall, 16 sites in four states were included in the study. Overall, the nonparticipation rate of IDUs was 14.3%; highest being for Delhi (17.2%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (14.6%), Uttarakhand (10.9%), and Jharkhand (4.4%). Overall, the HIV-positivity rate among nonparticipants (9.6%) was significantly higher (P = 0.009) compared to the participants (6.7%). Conclusion: Change in methodology and seeking written informed consent might have an effect on the nonparticipation in all four states. This, in turn, could have led to the underestimation of HIV-positivity rates among IDU in the states.

AB  - First reported in China, the 2019 novel coronavirus has been spreading across the globe. Till 26 March, 2020, 416,686 cases have been diagnosed and 18,589 have died the world over. The coronavirus disease mainly starts with a respiratory illness and about 5-16% require intensive care management for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction. Children account for about 1-2% of the total cases, and 6% of these fall under severe or critical category requiring pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) care. Diagnosis involves a combination of clinical and epidemiological features with laboratory confirmation. Preparedness strategies for managing this pandemic are the need of the hour, and involve setting up cohort ICUs with isolation rooms. Re-allocation of resources in managing this crisis involves careful planning, halting elective surgeries and training of healthcare workers. Strict adherence to infection control like personal protective equipment and disinfection is the key to contain the disease transmission. Although many therapies have been tried in various regions, there is a lack of strong evidence to recommend anti-virals or immunomodulatory drugs.

AB  - Context: There are concerns about the long-term safety of conventional therapy on renal health in patients with hypoparathyroidism. Careful audit of these would help comparisons with upcoming parathyroid hormone therapy.
   Objective: We investigated nephrocalcinosis, renal dysfunction, and calculi, their predictors and progression over long-term follow-up in patients with primary hypoparathyroidism (PH).
   Design and Setting: An observational study at a tertiary care center was conducted.
   Participants and Methods: A total of 165 PH patients receiving conventional therapy were evaluated by radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography. Their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured by Tc-99m-diethylenetriamine penta-acetic acid clearance. Clinical characteristics, serum total calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, hypercalciuria, and fractional excretion of phosphorus (FEPh) at presentation and during follow-up were analyzed as possible predictors of renal complications. Controls were 165 apparently healthy individuals.
   Results: Nephrocalcinosis was present in 6.7% of PH patients but not in controls. Patients younger than 15 years at presentation and with higher serum calcium-phosphorus product were at higher risk. Nephrocalcinosis showed no significant association with cataract and intracranial calcification. Prevalence of renal calculi was comparable between hypoparathyroid patients and controls (5% vs 3.6%, P = .58). Fourteen percent of patients had a GFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Increased FEPh during follow-up was the significant predictor of low GFR. Nephrocalcinosis developed in 9% of patients over 10 years of conventional therapy.
   Conclusion: A total of 6.7% of PH patients had nephrocalcinosis, and 14% showed renal dysfunction. Prevalence of renal calculi was similar in patients and controls. Nine percent of patients developed nephrocalcinosis over 10 years of conventional therapy.

AB  - Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is presently the preferred modality for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes. There is an unmet need for standardization of processing and reporting of cytology specimens obtained by EBUS-TBNA. The manuscript is a state-of-the-art review on the technical aspects of processing and reporting of EBUS-TBNA specimens. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database, and the available evidence was discussed among the authors. The evidence suggests that at least one air-dried and one alcohol-fixed slide should be prepared from each lymph node pass. The remaining material should be utilized for microbiological analysis (in saline) and cell block preparation (10% formalin or other solutions). Wherever available, rapid-onsite evaluation should be performed to assess the adequacy of the sample and guide the need for additional material. The lymph node aspirate should also be collected in Roswell Park Memorial Institute solution in cases where lymphoma is under consideration. The use of liquid-based cytology provides good quality specimens that are free from blood and air-drying artifacts and can be used wherever available. Sample adequacy and the diagnostic category should be furnished separately in the cytology report.

AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative disease of developing retinal vessels that affects premature infants and can lead to severe and irreversible visual loss if left untreated. India and some other Asian countries are in the middle of a 'third ROP epidemic'. Blindness due to ROP is largely preventable if appropriate, adequate and accessible screening programmes are available. Screening of the premature babies is the first step in ROP management. With the increase in use of tele-screening techniques, more premature babies have been brought under the screening network both from urban and rural regions. Laser photocoagulation to the avascular retina using indirect ophthalmoscopy delivery system is the gold standard for ROP treatment and is usually done under topical anaesthesia in the Asian region in contrast to the western world. Use of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) although controversial in management of ROP has been found to be effective in various Asian studies as well. ROP surgery in India and other middle-income Asian countries is largely performed only in few tertiary eye care centres. Poor visual prognosis, late presentation with advanced retinal detachments, lack of adequate number of trained paediatric retinal surgeons and paediatric anaesthetists also contribute to this problem. This current paper summarizes the Asian experience of ROP management.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the hypoglycemic effect of nanoparticle based drug delivery system of liraglutide loaded in Poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) upon oral delivery in experimentally induced type 2 diabetes mellitus in Wistar rats. NPs were synthesized using double emulsion solvent evaporation method. Physiochemical characterization of NPs revealed small particle size of 159.25 +/- 24.46 nm with 75 +/- 7.8% liraglutide encapsulation efficiency and 7 +/- 1% as liraglutide loading efficiency. The NPs were also studied for in vitro release study and stability studies in various gastrointestinal fluid pH conditions which demonstrated the stability of NPs under these conditions. In-vivo model in wistar rats induced by high fat diet (HFD) along with Streptozotocin (STZ) were treated with liraglutide NPs for 8 weeks at two doses (75 and 150 mu g/kg, orally). The rats were monitored for various biochemical and physiological parameters at regular intervals i.e. baseline before initiation of the experiment, at the 1st, 5th, and 9th week of STZ administration. Further in vivo study showed alleviation of HFD-STZ induced diabetes mellitus as evident from the reduction in biochemical parameters like blood glucose (both fasting and post prandial blood glucose), HbA1c, fructosamine levels, serum triglycerides, serum total cholesterol. Physiological parameters such as body weight and food intake were also in support of the data. Moreover, liraglutide NPs demonstrated hypoglycemic activity by significantly increasing the insulin secretion in diabetic rats. To the best of our knowledge, we for the first time proposing the orally deliverable NPs of liraglutide that ameliorates HFD-STZ induced diabetes mellitus effectively as compared to conventional liraglutide.

AB  - Hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72 is defined as a major causative factor for familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The mutation frequency varies dramatically among populations of different ethnicity; however, in most cases, C9orf72 mutant has been described on a common founder haplotype. We assessed its frequency in a study cohort involving 593 clinically and electrophysiologically defined ALS cases. We also investigated the presence of reported Finnish haplotype among the mutation carriers. The identified common haplotype region was further screened in 192 (carrying 2-6 G4C2 repeats) and 96 (>= 7 repeats) control chromosomes. The G4C2 expansion was observed in 3.2% (19/593) of total cases where 9/19 (47.4%) positive cases belonged to the eastern region of India. Haplotype analysis revealed 11 G4C2-Ex carriers shared the common haplotype (haplo-A) background spanning a region of similar to 90 kbp (rs895021-rs11789520) including rs3849942 (a well-known global at-risk loci with T allele for G4C2 expansion). The other 3 G4C2-Ex cases had a different haplotype (haplo-B) with core difference from haplo-A at G4C2-Ex flanking 31 kbp region between rs3849942 and rs11789520 SNPs (allele 'C' of rs3849942 which is a nonrisk allele). Out of other five G4C2-cases, four carried the risk allele T of rs3849942 while one harbored the non-risk allele. This study establishes the prevalence of C9orf72 expansion in Indian ALS cases providing further evidence for geographical predilection. The global core risk haplotype predominated C9orf72 expansion-positive ALS cases, yet the existence of a different haplotype suggests a second lineage (haplo B), which may have been derived from the Finnish core haplotype or may imply a unique haplotype among Asians. The association of risk haplotype with normal intermediate C9orf72 alleles reinforced its role in conferring instability to the C9orf72-G4C2 region. We thus present an effective support to interpret future burden of ALS cases in India. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laminoplasty causes destruction of the posterior musculoligamentous complex, which may result in cervical kyphosis, or more commonly loss of cervical lordosis (LOCL). In this study, we evaluated the role of various preoperative radiologic parameters in predicting not only the LOCL/kyphosis but also the functional outcomes in the form of change in Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score following laminoplasty.
   METHODS: Patients were evaluated both clinically and radiologically with dynamic cervical spine radiograph, noncontrast-enhanced computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine preoperatively as well as at 1 year follow-up.
   RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients who underwent laminoplasty for cervical spondylotic myelopathy/ossified posterior longitudinal ligament from 2011 to 2018 at our center were included in final analysis. In multivariate analysis, preoperative Cobb angle (P = 0.001), T1 slope (TIS; P = 0.001), and dynamic extension reserve (P < 0.001) were found to have an independent effect on LOCL. The receiver operating characteristic curve using the regression model significantly predicted LOCL >10 degrees with an area under the curve of 88.3% (P < 0.001). Similarly, preoperative T1S (P = 0.036) and SVA (P < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of significant improvement in ODI after laminoplasty. The receiver operating characteristic curve using the regression model significantly predicted change in ODI with an area under the curve of 83.7% (P < 0.001). Based on these findings, classification and scoring systems with good accuracy have been proposed for prediction of LOCL and improvement in ODI.
   CONCLUSIONS: We have found that the chances of significant LOCL is determined by an interplay of preoperative Cobb angle, T1S, and dynamic extension reserve.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To establish a new surgically relevant classification system of the anatomic variations of the temporal bone tegmen plate as well as to perform a comparative analysis, with respect to the pneumatization patterns in the cadaveric temporal bones.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Microdissection of the human cadaveric temporal bones was performed after obtaining ethical approval from the Institutional Ethical Committee (F.8-522/A-522/2017/RS). The pneumatization pattern of the temporal bones was noted as "under-pneumatized" or "well-pneumatized"The tegmen mastoid (TM) was classified into two grades as per the position of the tegmen plate and the visibility of the superior semicircular canal (SSCC) and the aditus. The latter two structures were well visualized in Grade A and poorly visualized in Grade B. The data were analyzed using Stata 14.0 (Stata Corp, 4905, Lakway drive, College Station, Texas, USA).
   RESULTS: Ninety-three temporal bones were dissected under microscope. Fifty-eight bones were well-pneumatized and 35 were under-pneumatized. The tegmen plates were classified as Grade-A in 49 bones (well-pneumatized -37 and under-pneumatized -12), and as Grade-B in 44 bones (well-pneumatized-21, poorly-pneumatized-23). Grade-A classification was significantly more common in well-pneumatized temporal bones, while Grade-B was more common in under-pneumatized bones (p=0.0057).
   CONCLUSION: We propose a surgically relevant classification for TM positioning. A well-pneumatized temporal bone is associated with a significantly higher position of the tegmen plate (Grade-ATM).

AB  - Castleman's disease (CD), also known as angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia, a rare, non-malignant chronic lymphoproliferative disease characterized by, uni or multicentric lymphadenopathy. There is limited information about the clinicopathological variations and associations of this entity. A total of 50 cases of CD were retrieved from the archives, between the years 2005-2017. The cases were divided into pediatric (0-18 years), young adult (age <= 40 years) and older adult groups (age > 40 years respectively). Detailed clinicopathological correlation was done. The age range was 6-74 years. There was a male predominance (M: F-1.6:1). The majority (72%; 36/50) of the patients were adults; 46% young adult and 28% older adult, while only 28% (14/50) were of pediatric. Majority (78%) showed features of unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) while rest 22% presented with multi centric Castleman disease (MCD). Systemic symptoms were more frequent in MCD as compared to UCD cases (p = 0.06). The majority of the cases (40/50; 80%) were of the hyaline vascular type. Two of the cases showed mixed histological feature. Out of 50 patients 29 patient's treatment details are available. Majority unicentric cases were cases surgically excised 14/17 (82.3%). Three patients 3/17 (17.6%) were treated with chemotherapy. In multicentric Castleman's disease group, six of the 12 cases with MCD were managed by chemotherapy. One patient died of progressive disease. Castleman disease has varied clinical presentation and is often associated with other diseases. A high degree of suspicion and careful histological examination is required in order not to miss this entity.

AB  - Laparoscopic repair of recurrent diaphragmatic hernia is infrequently reported. We report successful laparoscopic management of such a case in a 23-year-old male who presented with recurrent vomiting and hiccoughs. He had suffered a gun-shot injury to the chest 2 years ago, following which a primary diaphragmatic repair was done by laparotomy and thoracotomy. The patient developed recurrent left diaphragmatic hernia, which was repaired using polypropylene mesh using a laparoscopic approach. At 6 months of follow-up, the patient is doing well, and his symptoms have resolved. Laparoscopic repair of recurrent diaphragmatic hernia is feasible.

AB  - Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a very aggressive cancer. There are various sub-cellular events (both genetic and epigenetic) that get dysregulated leading to tumorigenesis. Methylation in promoters of tumor suppressor genes is one of these epigenetic phenomena contributing to the pathogenesis of cancer. Genes analyzed for promoter methylation status in this study namely SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine, UCHL1 (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1), NPTX2 (neuronal pentraxin 2), PENK (proenkephalin) had been studied in pancreatic cancer, but there is a need to check methylation in these genes as circulatory non-invasive markers. This study analyzed the absolute quantification of methylation levels of SPARC, UCHL1, PENK, and NPTX2 genes promoters in PDAC patients as well as in chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients and healthy subjects (HC) and evaluated its clinical significance in PDAC. Materials and methods The study included 65 PDAC patients, 25 CP patients, and 25 healthy controls. DNA was extracted from their plasma samples and subsequently given bisulfite treatment. Absolute quantization of methylated and unmethylated copies of gene promoters of all the four genes was performed using real-time PCR (SYBR green) by the standard curve method. Methylation levels were expressed as methylation index (MI) for each gene in each patient. MI was calculated from absolute copy numbers as follows: MI-methylated copy number/methylated copy number + unmethylated copy number). These indices were used to compare gene methylation levels within different groups and to correlate with clinicopathological features and survival of pancreatic cancer patients. An appropriate statistical analysis was applied. Results Methylation indices for all the four genes in PDAC cases were found to be significantly higher as compared to that in healthy individuals. SPARC MI values were found to differentiate early-stage PDAC patients from CP patients. PDAC patients with the metastasized disease and stage IV disease were found to have high MI for the SPARC gene as well as for the NPTX2 gene, while a higher UCHL1 methylation index was found to correlate with an advanced stage of the disease. Higher MI values for SPARC and NPTX2 genes were found to associate with poor survival in patients with PDAC. Conclusion Methylation load in the form of MI for each of the four genes assessed in plasma may emerge as a non-invasive biomarker to differentiate pancreatic cancer from healthy individuals. But only SPARC and NPTX2 hypermethylation were able to distinguish pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. Association of aberrant methylation in SPARC and NPTX2 gene with metastasis and poor survival of patients suggest the role of methylation in these genes as prognostic markers.

AB  - The prevalence of unipolar depression among adolescents in India is high. Cognitive behavior therapies (CBTs) are considered the current gold standard treatment for depression in adolescents; however, their access is limited in India. Given the ubiquity of technology including smartphones and computers, technology can be leveraged to improve access of CBT treatment in India. Our team developed smartteen- a computer application designed to augment in-person CBT for treatment of depression in adolescents. This paper will present results of the pilot evaluation of smartteen (a cCBT) for its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms. Twenty-one adolescents with unipolar depression seeking treatment at a tertiary care hospital were randomly assigned to smartteen (n = 11) and TAU (n = 10). Both groups received twelve weeks of treatment and were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment (6 weeks) and post-treatment (12 weeks) using four clinical measures including BDI-II, CDRS-R, CGI-S and CGAS. smartteen was shown to be feasible and acceptable treatment to adolescents. At 6 weeks, both treatments were effective in reducing depression. At 12 weeks, smartteen was significantly more effective than TAU in reducing depression symptoms and improving functioning on CGAS. Treatment compliance was better in smartteen group. smartten was shown to reduce the time spent by therapist to deliver 12 sessions of CBT treatment for depression. Results indicate that smartteen may be subjected to more rigorous evaluations with larger samples and considered for wider implementation if found effective.

AB  - The 2019-novel coronavirus predominantly affects the respiratory system with manifestations ranging from upper respiratory symptoms to full blown acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is important to recognize the risk factors, categorize severity and provide early treatment. Use of high flow devices and non-invasive ventilation has been discouraged due to high chances of aerosol generation. Early intubation and mechanical ventilation areessential to prevent complications and worsening, especially in resource-limited settings with very few centers having expertise to manage critical cases. Hydrophobic viral filter in the ventilator circuit minimizes chances of transmission of virus. Strategies to manage ARDS in COVID-19 include low tidal volume ventilation with liberal sedation-analgesia. At the same time, prevention of transmission of the virus to healthcare workers is extremely important in the intensive care setting dealing with severe cases and requiring procedures generating aerosol. We, herein, provide guidance on non-invasive respiratory support, intubation and management of ARDS in a child with COVID-19.

AB  - Background: The use of minimally invasive surgical approaches for the repair of retrocaval ureter (RCU) has been increased in time. However, the results of the robotic approach have not yet been compared with those of open or laparoscopic approaches. We aimed to compare the results of laparoscopic and robotic transperitoneal repair of RCU from two centres. Patients and Methods: Initially, we performed a systemic literature search using MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar about the RCU. Finally, a comparison of the efficacy and outcomes of the laparoscopic and robotic transperitoneal approaches for RCU repair was performed with the results of two centers. Results: The mean age was 27.5 +/- 3.6 years. The mean operative time was 147 +/- 63.6 min. The median estimated blood loss was 100 (20-423.9) ml. The median drain removing time and hospital stay were 2 (2-3) and 3 (2-4) days, respectively. The mean follow-up period was 17.85 +/- 14.6 months. All of the parameters were similar between the laparoscopic and robotic repair groups except for the mean operative time. It was significantly shorter in robotic repair group than those of laparoscopic repair group (P = 0.02). Furthermore, a ureteral stricture of the anastomotic segment was detected in a patient treated with laparoscopy during the follow-up. Conclusions: Robotic transperitoneal approach may shorten the operative time enabling a greater comfort in repair of RCU.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed in the endothelial cells of tumor-associated neovasculature of various nonprostatic benign and malignant neoplasms including juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). Positive uptake on PET/CT imaging with Ga-68-labeled PSMA is noted in a patient with residual disease after initial surgery without any abnormal uptake in postoperative fibrosis, in contrast to contrast-enhanced MRI, which was confirmed by biopsy. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT may be a useful tool clinically for identifying early biochemical recurrences and in specifically differentiating recurrences from surgical site reparative tissue.

   Results: Four types of white cataract were identified based on iOCT-type I (9 eyes), type II (3 eyes), type III (24 eyes), and type IV (14 eyes). Type I had regularly arranged lamellar cortical fibers, type II had continuous hyperreflective bands of cortical fibers with intralenticular clefts, type III had intralenticular clefts combined with areas of homogenous ground-glass appearance, and type IV had homogenous ground-glass appearance of the anterior lens cortex. Capsulorhexis in type I cataract was uneventful. In type II cataract, cortical bulge was observed in the anterior chamber on creating the initial nick, indicating raised intralenticular pressure (ILP) with an imminent risk of rhexis extension. A bimanual irrigation/aspiration was performed until lowering of ILP was observed on iOCT. In types III and IV, fluid release was observed on initiation of rhexis leading to partial (type III) or complete (type IV) lowering of ILP, with a mild-moderate risk of capsulorhexis extension. A continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis was achieved in all cases, with no case of posterior capsular tear or vitreous loss.
   Conclusions: Intraoperative OCT helped elucidate intraoperative dynamics of the spectrum of white cataracts and facilitates completion of capsulorhexis. Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Wolters Kluwer on behalf of ASCRS and ESCRS

AB  - Introduction Morphometric variations of the anterior column of the acetabulum have been described in the literature for its complex structure, which can influence the safe containment of intramedullary screw for fixation of its fractures. The purpose of this CT-based study is to present a preliminary report on the morphometric variations and safety of intramedullary screw fixation of the anterior column of the acetabulum in the Indian population. Methods CT-based data from 102 uninjured pelves were retrospectively analyzed in iPlan? BrainLab AG, Feldkirchen, Germany. Narrowest zones around acetabulum and superior pubic ramus were measured. We calculated the axis of the anterior column of the acetabulum by joining the centres of these narrowest zones. Standard screws trajectories were directed along this axis. Screw length up to the first cortical perforation, the distance of the exit point from the pubic symphysis, and the length of the anterior column up to the pubic tubercle were measured. Results The osseous corridor of the anterior column of acetabulum had variable cross-section along its length with two constriction zones, first in the acetabular region and second in the superior pubic ramus. Only 54% of our cases allowed safe applicability of 6.5-mm-diameter screw trajectories with safety margin of 2 mm on either side of the screw. Significant morphometric and screw applicability-related differences were observed among male and female cases with males having a wider osseous corridor in general. Elimination of safety margin results in a significant increase in the screw applicability. Conclusion The osseous corridor of the anterior column varies in its dimensions from individual to individual. Standard screws of 6.5-mm and 7.3-mm diameters may not be safe for intramedullary screw fixation in every patient and carry a risk of cortical violation when a 2 mm of width around the screw is considered as a safety margin. However, with a precise screw placement within the extents of the cortices of the anterior column, 6.5-mm screws can be applied in most of the female cases and 7.3-mm screws can be applied in most of the male cases for anterior column fixation.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the frequency and the association of Thrombospondin 1 (11-IBS1) gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Asian Indian patients with optical full thickness corneal grafting surgery. Methods: Prospective case control analysis of optical penetrating keratoplasty patients with and without immune rejection and controls for genotyping of 3 TI IBS1 gene SNPs (rs1478604 A>G; rs2228261 C>T; rs2228262 A>G) by Amplification Refractory Mutation System-Poly merase Chain Reaction (ARMS PCR). Results: Among 58 patients [45 with immune allograft rejection (DNA isolation was possible in 38 samples) and 13 without immune corneal allograft rejection] and 65 controls, allele frequencies observed for rs1478604 (A>G) are A: 69.7% and 72.60/0, G: 30.2% and 27.3%; for rs2228261 (C>T) are T: 70.2% and 62.3%, C: 29.7% and 37.6%; and for rs2228262 (A>G) A: 97.4% and 98.4%; G 2.5% and 1.5% respectively. Genotype frequencies were rs1478604 (A>G) AA: 57.8% and 59.30/0, AG 23.6% and 26.5%; GC 18.4% and 14%; for rs2228261 (C>T) TT: 40.5 and 33.8%, TC: 59% and 56.9%, CC: 0% and 9.2%; for rs2228262 (A>G) AA: 94.8% and 96.8'A,, AG: 5.1% and 3.1% in rejection and controls respectively. The allele and genotype frequency for the 3 described T1 ISB1 SNPs did not show any difference between the corneal graft immune rejection patients and controls. Conclusion: Asian Indian population evaluated for TI IBS1 gene SNPs by ARMS PCR genotyping in Asian Indian population did not show any genetic association to immune rejection occurrence in our study.

AB  - Background Seasonal influenza virus is a common cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children. In 2008, we estimated that 20 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI and 1 million influenza-virus-associated severe ALRI occurred in children under 5 years globally. Despite this substantial burden, only a few low-income and middle-income countries have adopted routine influenza vaccination policies for children and, where present, these have achieved only low or unknown levels of vaccine uptake. Moreover, the influenza burden might have changed due to the emergence and circulation of influenza A/H1N1pdm09. We aimed to incorporate new data to update estimates of the global number of cases, hospital admissions, and mortality from influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years in 2018.
   Methods We estimated the regional and global burden of influenza-associated respiratory infections in children under 5 years from a systematic review of 100 studies published between Jan 1, 1995, and Dec 31, 2018, and a further 57 high-quality unpublished studies. We adapted the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the risk of bias. We estimated incidence and hospitalisation rates of influenza-virus-associated respiratory infections by severity, case ascertainment, region, and age. We estimated in-hospital deaths from influenza virus ALRI by combining hospital admissions and in-hospital case-fatality ratios of influenza virus ALRI. We estimated the upper bound of influenza virus-associated ALRI deaths based on the number of in-hospital deaths, US paediatric influenza-associated death data, and population-based childhood all-cause pneumonia mortality data in six sites in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.
   Findings In 2018, among children under 5 years globally, there were an estimated 109.5 million influenza virus episodes (uncertainty range [UR] 63.1-190.6), 10.1 million influenza-virus-associated ALRI cases (6.8-15.1); 870 000 influenza-virus-associated ALRI hospital admissions (543 000-1 415 000), 15 300 in-hospital deaths (5800-43 800), and up to 34 800 (13 200-97 200) overall influenza-virus-associated ALRI deaths. Influenza virus accounted for 7% of ALRI cases, 5% of ALRI hospital admissions, and 4% of ALRI deaths in children under 5 years. About 23% of the hospital admissions and 36% of the in-hospital deaths were in infants under 6 months. About 82% of the in-hospital deaths occurred in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.
   Interpretation A large proportion of the influenza-associated burden occurs among young infants and in low-income and lower middle-income countries. Our findings provide new and important evidence for maternal and paediatric influenza immunisation, and should inform future immunisation policy particularly in low-income and middle-income countries.

AB  - The genetically engineered Chimeric Antigen Receptor bearing T-cell (CAR T cell) therapy has been emerged as the new paradigm of cancer immunotherapy. However, recent studies have reported an increase in the number of relapsed haematological malignancies. This review provides newer insights into how the efficacy of CAR T cells might be increased by the application of new genome editing technologies, monitoring the complexity of tumor types and T cells sub-types. Next, tumor mutation burden along with tumormicroenvironment and epigenetic mechanisms of CAR T cell as well as tumor cell may play a vital role to tackle the cancer resistance mechanisms. These studies highlight the need to consider traditional cancer therapy in conjunction with CAR T cell therapy for relapsed or cases unresponsive to treatment. Of note, this therapy is highly expensive and requires multi-skill for successful implementation, which results in reduction of its accessibility/affordability to the patients. Here, we also propose a model for cost minimization of CAR T cell therapy by a collaboration of academia, hospitals and industry.

AB  - Background and Purpose-Definitions of significant hematoma expansion traditionally focus on changes in intraparenchymal volume. The presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a predictor of poor outcome, but current definitions of hematoma expansion do not include IVH expansion. We evaluated whether including IVH expansion to current definitions of hematoma expansion improves the ability to predict 90-day outcome.
   Methods-Using data from the PREDICT-ICH study (Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT), we compared a standard definition of hematoma expansion (>= 6 mL or >= 33%) to revised definitions that includes new IVH development or expansion (>= 6 mL or >= 33% or any IVH; >= 6 mL or >= 33% or IVH expansion >= 1 mL). The primary outcome was poor clinical outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 4-6) at 90 days. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for each definition, and C statistics for each definition were compared using nonparametric methods.
   Results-Of the 256 patients eligible for primary analysis, 127 (49.6%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6. Sensitivity and specificity for the standard definition (n=80) were 45.7% (95% CI, 36.8-54.7) and 82.9% (95% CI, 75.3-88.9), respectively. The revised definition, >= 6 mL or >= 33% or any IVH (n=113), possessed a sensitivity of 63.8% (95% CI, 54.8-72.1) and specificity of 75.2% (95% CI, 66.8-82.4). Overall accuracy was significantly improved with the revised definition (P=0.013) and after adjusting for relevant covariates, was associated with a 2.55-fold increased odds (95% CI, 1.31-4.94) of poor outcome at 90 days. A second revised definition, >= 6 mL or >= 33% or IVH expansion >= 1 mL, performed similarly (sensitivity, 56.7% [95% CI, 47.6-65.5]; specificity, 78.3% [95% CI, 40.2-85.1]; aOR, 2.40 [95% CI, 1.23-4.69]).
   Conclusions-In patients with mild-to-moderate ICH, including IVH expansion to the definition of hematoma expansion improves sensitivity with only minimal decreases to specificity and improves overall prediction of 90-day outcome.

AB  - Background Postacne scars have significant psychosocial distress among patients. Subcision is a well-known treatment modality specially for rolling type of acne scars, but is a crude mechanical process, which carries a risk of hematoma formation.
   Aims To compare the efficacy and safety of radiofrequency-assisted subcision (rSubcision) with conventional subcision in postacne scars.
   Methods In this randomized, split-face study, adult patients with postacne scars were randomized to receive either conventional subcision or rSubcision in 2 sessions, 4 weeks apart and followed up for 2 months. Outcome was measured using Goodman and Baron score (GBS), investigator global assessment (IGA) by two blinded dermatologists, and patient global assessment (PGA).
   Results Seventeen out of 21 patients completed the treatment. Statistical analysis of the results was performed using SPSS 15.0 statistical software (SPSS). Patients in both the groups had significant improvement from baseline according to quantitative scoring (P = .0001), number of scars (P = .0001), IGA, and PGA. The improvement was comparable in both the groups according to GBS and IGA but better on rSubcision side in terms of PGA. Two patients developed small entry point burn during rSubcision which healed in one month and one developed persistent hematoma with conventional subcision.
   Conclusions Both modalities were comparable in terms of assessment scores and investigator assessment, but patients found improvement better on rSubcision side.

AB  - Introduction: Urinary tract infection (UTI) in children leads to renal scarring in 10-15% of patients. Urinary tract anomalies and bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) are documented risk factors for recurrent UTIs. Estimates of baseline prevalence of BBD in children with UTI will help the clinician in the management strategy. Hence, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of BBD.
   Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) databases were searched for articles related to UTI, primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), and BBD. We included studies that provided prevalence of BBD in toilet-trained patients aged 1-18 years with UTI and/or VUR. BBD was defined based on clinical history or questionnaire or urodynamic studies. Two authors independently reviewed, assessed, and abstracted data from studies. Pooled prevalence was calculated based on a random effects model.
   Results: Forty-three studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were selected from a total of 1,731 studies. Among patients presenting with UTI without primary VUR, pooled prevalence of BBD was 41% (95% CI: 26-55; nine studies, 920 patients, I-2 = 96.0%), whereas its prevalence in patients with primary VUR was 49% (43-56; 30 studies, 5,060 patients, I-2 = 96.0%). Weighting by the study design and quality did not affect the prevalence. In patients with primary VUR, prevalence of BBD was higher in females (53%; 42-65) than in males (44%; 15-73). In studies where urodynamic study was used for the diagnosis of BBD, prevalence was 63%. The presence of BBD in patients with primary VUR increased risk of recurrent UTIs [relative risk (RR): 2.1; 1.7-2.5]. In five studies that reported separate data on constipation, pooled prevalence of constipation was 27% (16-37).
   Conclusion: Almost half of the patients with primary VUR have BBD, and its presence increases the risk of recurrent UTIs. Trends of high BBD prevalence were also observed in patients presenting with UTI without VUR. These prevalence estimates suggest that all toilet-trained children presenting with UTI with or without VUR should be assessed for BBD, which will help in their further management.

AB  - The assessment of capsular invasion is an essential but challenging step in the diagnosis of encapsulated follicular thyroid neoplasms. Therefore, interobserver agreement in the assessment of capsular invasion in these tumors was investigated among 11 thyroid pathologists by using virtual slides of 20 cases in which the original diagnosis considered the differential diagnosis of definite capsular invasion versus questionable capsular invasion. The assessment of capsular invasion was divided into three categories: (1) non-invasive, (2) questionable invasive, and (3) clear-cut invasive. The interobserver agreements for clear-cut invasive and non-invasive categories were fair (Kappa value = 0.578 and 0.404, respectively), whereas agreement for the questionable invasion was poor (Kappa value = 0.186). Disagreements in the assessment of invasion resulted in variable final pathological diagnoses. For example, the agreement for a diagnosis of malignancy was only fair (Kappa value = 0.545). Moreover, pathologists did not have a uniform approach for rendering a final diagnosis in cases with questionable capsular invasion, though nine of 11 pathologists did use the follicular tumor of uncertain malignant potential diagnosis as proposed by the World Health Organization classification of endocrine organs published in 2017. In conclusion, this study revealed considerable interobserver variation in the evaluation of capsular invasion, especially in follicular neoplasms with questionable invasion.

AB  - Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the most common glomerulopathy in childhood characterised by heavy proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and edema. Most of the patients have mild and transient edema but those with difficult to treat nephrotic syndrome can develop severe edema which may have serious consequences such as immobility, cellulitis and peritonitis. Understanding of the pathophysiology of edema is still evolving with recent research elucidating newer mechanism of sodium retention through plasmin mediated epithelial sodium channel activation in collecting duct. Patients with mild edema do not require specific diuretic therapy as it improves with steroid induced diuresis. In this review, the authors describe the current perspective in management of moderate to severe edema in childhood nephrotic syndrome including various parameters to assess intravascular volume status which is important for planning overall treatment strategy. Then they briefly discuss about various classes of diuretics, aquaretics and evidence based use of furosemide albumin combination therapy for treatment of edema. Management strategy for a small proportion of patients, who are unresponsive to furosemide therapy, includes diuretic synergism, intravenous furosemide albumin combination therapy and continuous intravenous furosemide infusion.

AB  - Atrial myxomas are the most common primary benign cardiac tumors. The embolization of tumor particles is not infrequent, and in nearly half of them, the cerebral arteries are affected, usually leading to embolic ischemic stroke. Formation of intracranial aneurysms, development of parenchymal brain metastasis, and intracerebral hemorrhage due to ruptured aneurysms are rarer. Diagnosis of such lesions in a previously undiagnosed case of myxoma may be challenging for a pathologist. Herein, we present two patients of cardiac myxoma with varied neurological manifestations and their pathological findings.

AB  - Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of glycogen degradation pathway due to deficiency or reduced activity of glycogen debranching enzyme (GDE) that results in accumulation of abnormal glycogen in the liver, muscle, and heart. The cardinal hallmarks are hepatomegaly, fasting hypoglycemia, seizures, growth retardation, progressive skeletal myopathy, and cardiomyopathy in few. To date, 258 mutations in amyloglucosidase (AGL) gene have been identified worldwide. However, the mutation spectrum in the Asian Indian region is yet to be well characterized. We investigated 24 patients of Asian origin from 21 unrelated families with a provisional diagnosis of GSD III based on clinical and biochemical criteria. Molecular diagnosis was assessed by bidirectional sequencing and the impact of novel missense variants on the tertiary (three-dimensional) structure of GDE was evaluated by molecular modeling approach. Eighteen different pathogenic variants were identified, out of which 78% were novel. Novel variants included five nonsense, three small duplications and two small deletions, a splice site variant, and three missense variants. Variations in Exons 4, 14, 19, 24, 27, and 33 accounted for 61% of the total pathogenic variants identified and Allele p.Gly798Alafs*3 showed a high allele frequency of 11%. Molecular modeling study of novel pathogenic missense variants indicated the probable underlying molecular mechanism of adverse impact of variations on the structure and catalytic function of human GDE. Our study is the first large study on GSD III from the Asian subcontinent, which further expands the mutation spectrum of AGL.

AB  - Global deregulation in miRNA expression is a hallmark of cancer cell. An estimated 2300 mature miRNAs are encoded by human genome; role of many of which in carcinogenesis and as cancer biomarkers remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the utility of miR-3692-3p, miR-3195, and miR-1249-3p as biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For this prospective study, 115 subjects, including 75 NSCLC patients and 40 controls, were recruited. The expression of miR-3692-3p, miR-3195, and miR-1249-3p was checked using qRT-PCR. The miRNA expression was correlated with survival outcome and therapeutic response. There were no significant differences in the mean age of NSCLC patients and controls (56.2 and 55.3 years, respectively; p = 0.3242). Majority of NSCLC patients (67%) were smokers. We observed a significant upregulation of miR-3692-3p expression (p < 0.0001), while the expression of miR-3195 (p = 0.0017) and miR-1249-3p was significantly downregulated (p < 0.0001) in the serum of NSCLC patients as compared to controls. The expression of miR-1249-3p was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma versus lung squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.0178). Interestingly, patients who responded to chemotherapy had higher expression of miR-1249-3p than non-responders (p = 0.0107). Moreover, patients with higher expression of miR-3195 had significantly longer overall survival (p = 0.0298). In multivariate analysis, miR-3195 emerged as independent prognostic factor for overall survival. We conclude that the miR-3195 may have prognostic significance, while miR-1249-3p may predict therapeutic response in NSCLC. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the role of these miRNAs in lung carcinogenesis and their utility as candidate cancer biomarkers.

AB  - Aim To evaluate the burden and association of cardiometabolic risk factors in the spouses of women with and without hyperglycaemia in pregnancy.
   Methods Women with (n = 204) and without (n = 197) hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, along with their spouses, participated in this cross-sectional study. The hyperglycaemia in pregnancy group included women with gestational diabetes and diabetes in pregnancy. A detailed questionnaire was completed for all participants (men and women), documenting relevant personal and medical history, along with biochemical investigations (men).
   Results A total of 401 couples were evaluated at the time point during the pregnancy of 24.7 +/- 5.2 gestational weeks (mean +/- sd). Dysglycaemia (prediabetes or diabetes), overweight/obesity (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) and metabolic syndrome were detected in 120 (58.9%), 123 (60.3%) and 98 spouses (48.3%) of women with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy, respectively. In the fully adjusted model, an increased risk of dysglycaemia [odds ratio 1.43 (95% CI 0.95-2.17); P = 0.088], overweight/obesity [odds ratio 1.49 (95% CI 0.98-2.27); P = 0.064] and metabolic syndrome [odds ratio 2.00 (95% CI 1.30-3.07); P = 0.001] was seen in the spouses of women with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. The prevalence of these metabolic conditions was higher in spouses of women with diabetes in pregnancy compared to spouses of women with gestational diabetes mellitus.
   Conclusions A high burden of cardiometabolic risk factors was observed in the spouses of women with hyperglycaemia in pregnancy. The opportunity provided by pregnancy could be used by the healthcare system not only to improve the health of the woman and her offspring, but also her spouse.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the role of ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in retinoblastoma (RB). Methods: Children with advanced unilateral RB were included. UBM was performed to look for tumour invasion into the anterior segment (AS) and for evaluation of quantitative parameters. Enucleation was done and UBM findings were correlated with histopathology. The main outcome measures were sensitivity and specificity of UBM for detecting AS invasion and comparison of quantitative parameters between the tumour affected and fellow eyes. Results: Fifty patients were evaluated. The mean age was 2.76 +/- 1.63 years. Enucleation was performed in 50 eyes. The sensitivity and specificity of UBM for AS invasion were 80% (95% CI, 44-97%) and 95% (95% CI, 83-99%), respectively. UBM showed a sensitivity and specificity of 100% (95% CI, 59-100%) and 95% (95% CI, 84-99%), respectively, for iris invasion, 88% (95% CI, 47-100%) and 100% (95% CI, 92-100%), respectively, for ciliary body invasion, and 63% (95% CI, 24-91%) and 100% (95% CI, 92-100%), respectively, for anterior chamber (AC) angle invasion. Quantitative parameters were studied in 100 eyes. As compared to the fellow eyes, the AC angle was narrow (p < 0.05), posterior chamber was shallow (p = 0.004) and zonular length was increased (p = 0.001) in RB eyes. Conclusion: This clinicopathological study provides valuable insights into the role of UBM for evaluation of anterior extension of RB and for assessment of architectural changes in the AS due to the tumour.

AB  - Background: Exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D deficiency.
   Objective: To find out proportion of exclusively breastfed infants having serum 25(OH)D concentration Methods: Randomized placebo-controlled study included 132 mothers and infants divided into two groups. Mothers received either vitamin D-3 60,000 IU between 24 and 48 hours postpartum and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks amounting to 240,000 IU of vitamin D-3 or placebo. Serum 25(OH)D concentration in the mothers was measured at recruitment and that of infants, at birth and 6 months. Infants were evaluated for rickets at 6 months.
   Findings: Total 114 mother-infant dyads followed. Subjects in both groups were comparable in basic characteristics. At 6 months of age, serum 25(OH)D concentration in infants was 18.93 (5.12) ng/mL in the intervention group and 6.43 (3.76) ng/mL in the control group (mean difference = 12.5; 95% CI = 10.80-14.17; p < 0.001) and vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency was corrected in 93.1% and 38% infants, respectively, in the intervention group. There was no change in the vitamin D status of infants in the control group. In 60.3% infants (RR = 0.519; 95% CI = -0.485 to 0.735) of the intervention group 25(OH)D concentration was Conclusion: Serum 25(OH)D concentration of exclusively breastfed infants rise significantly when mothers are orally supplemented with 240,000 IU of vitamin D-3 during lactation in comparison with the infants of unsupplemented mothers with 94.6% and 48.1% reduction in the risk of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency, respectively, at 6 months of age.

AB  - Aims: The current article provides a detailed account of the current understanding of molecular and clinico-pathological aspects of Human papilloma virus (HPV) driven head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
   Materials and methods: The literature review included most of the landmark trials and clinical studies related to the HPV driven HNSCC.
   Key findings: HPV positive HNSCC differ distinctly from HPV negative tobacco-related HNSCC, especially in oropharyngeal region. Therefore, the American joint committee on cancers latest manual for classification and staging of cancer suggests a separate staging system for HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers. Despite the younger patients being affected and the high propensity for cervical metastasis, the HPV positive oropharyngeal cancers respond much better to the treatment. The association with wild type TP53 and low EGFR expression confers the favorable prognosis in HPV driven HNSCC. Since the association is not universal, we suggest checking for p53 and EGFR expression status before considering de-intensification of therapy. In addition, the presence of matted lymph nodes and five or more nodes could mean relatively poorer prognosis, and are not suitable for de-intensification of therapy. The same is also true probably with higher T stage and co-existing tobacco use. The methods for the detection of p16, HPV DNA, HPV E6/E7 mRNA, anti-E6/E7 antibodies, in tissue, in serum and in saliva of patients, along with their clinical implications are also discussed.
   Significance: This article provides latest developments on the HPV driven HNSCC. 'Diagnosis of transcriptionally active HPV infection,' Modalities for surveillance,' Implication of de-escalation of therapy' are some of the critical issues that could serve the medical, the research as well as the patient communities.

AB  - A conventionally grown organic nonlinear optical crystal bisguanidinium isophthalate monohydrate was structurally investigated using single crystal X-ray diffraction study. The lattice constants, supramolecular arrangements and the hydrogen bond formation of the title compound confirm the formation of novel organic crystalline material. The various functional groups present in the crystalline material were resoluted by employing FT-IR spectral analysis. The wide-range optical transparency of the compound in the entire visible region ensures the optical quality with a lower cut-off wavelength at 298 nm was analysed experimentally using UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The support of DFT was scrutinized to report the optimized structure, electronic state properties, hyper-conjugative interactions and frontier molecular energy gap of the bisguanidinium isophthalate compound. The charge transfer mechanism of bisguanidinium isophthalate compound from isophthalic acid to guanidine compound was also interpreted using theoretical DFT. The computational evaluation of charge stabilities as a result of charge delocalization was construed with the ratification of natural bonding orbital (NBO). The assessed thermal stability of bisguanidinium isophthalate crystal is 120 degrees C which was analysed by thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses. To determine the third-order nonlinear optical property with quantitative results of nonlinear refractive index, nonlinear absorption coefficient and optical susceptibility was ascertained using Z-scan technique.

AB  - Animal-studies associate age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) with decreasing number of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in Rosenthal's canal (RC) of cochlea. The excitatory neurotransmitter for SGNs is glutamate (through its receptor NMDAR 2B), which can be neurotoxic through Ca2+ overload. Neurotoxicity is balanced by calcium-binding proteins (CBPs) like Parvalbumin (PV), which is the predominant CBP of the SGNs. To estimate the volume of the RC and total number of SGNs that are immunoreactive to PV and NMDAR 2B, we used unbiased stereology in 35 human cochleae derived from cadavers of persons from 2nd to 8th decade of life (subsequently statistically divided into two groups) and compared them to the total number of cresyl violet (CV) stained SGNs. We also estimated the volume of individual neurons and their nuclei. Regression analysis was made on estimated parameters against age. Hierarchical-cluster analysis was done on the neuronal against neuronal nuclear volumes. The average volume of the RC did not change with increasing age (p = 0.4115). The total number of SGNs (CV-stained and those separately expressing PV and NMDAR 2B) significantly decreased with age (p < 0.001). We identified three distinct populations of neurons on the basis of their volumes among SGNs. Thus, there is significant age-related decline in the total number of SGNs, which starts early in life. It may be due to ambient noise and inadequate neutralisation of excitotoxicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is an important step in the management of node-positive operable breast cancer. It is associated with large amount of axillary drainage and increased risk of wound-related infection. Tranexamic acid (TA) has antifibrinolytic property and is being extensively used in controlling blood loss. However, its role in reducing axillary drainage after ALND is still not well-established. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of TA in reducing the axillary drainage, early removal of the drain, and decreasing the wound-related infection in breast cancer patients undergoing ALND. This is a prospective nonrandomized double-armed cohort study. Total of 47 patients were included in the TA group and 46 in the nontranexamic (NTA) group. All the patients in TA group received a single dose of intravenous (IV) TA at the time of induction followed by oral TA for five days after surgery. Both TA and NTA groups had similar proportions of locally advanced breast cancers (57.4% vs 56.5%, P = .90). Majority of them underwent modified radical mastectomy (MRM) (70.2% vs 67.4%, P = .76). Patients in TA group had significantly lower axillary drainage (440 ml vs 715.5 ml, P = .003) with earlier removal of the drain (8 vs 11 days, P = .046). Seroma formation (19.1% vs 32.6%, P = .13) and wound-related infection (4.3% vs 8.7%, P = .43) were nonsignificantly lower in the TA group. Tranexamic acid reduces axillary drainage and facilitates early removal of the drain after axillary lymph node dissection.

AB  - Introduction: MOG antibody associated disease is a relatively new disorder for which the full clinical spectrum is being described and the literature is evolving. The current study outlines the observations on a cohort of patients diagnosed with this clinical entity.
   Methods: This is a retrospective review of prospectively followed up patients with MOG antibody positive neurological illness. Case records of patients following up in neuroimmunology clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences(AIIMS), New Delhi from January 2007 to July 2019 were reviewed for MOG antibody positivity and those patients with positive antibody result were included in this study.
   Findings: A total of 20 patients were tested positive for MOG-IgG antibody. 75% were females. Median (Range) age was 30.5 years (8-58). Median disease duration was 22 months (1-139). Most common symptom at presentation was decrease in vision (unilateral or bilateral) (80%). Most common syndrome at onset was unilateral optic neuritis (ON) (40%) followed by bilateral ON (35%), transverse myelitis (TM)(15%), ON plus TM (5%) and cerebral syndrome (5%). Median number of demyelinating episodes per person was 2.5. Out of 29 affected eyes, 26 had good outcome. Out of 7 patients with motor disability, 5 patients had good outcome.
   Conclusion: MOG antibody associated disease presents predominantly as recurrent ON, but may also present as an opticospinal, cerebral or brainstem syndrome and recurrent myelitis. Many of the patients had relapses, but had good outcomes with treatment.

AB  - Mucosal malignant melanoma of the head and neck (HN) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm which constitutes only 1% of all melanomas. Neuroendocrine differentiation is an extremely unusual phenomenon in mucosal melanomas, of which five cases have been reported. We report a rare case of a 63-year-old female who developed sinonasal amelanotic melanoma with immunohistochemical expression of neuroendocrine markers, presenting a diagnostic dilemma. Ultrastructural evidence of melanosomes and neurosecretory granules aided in arriving at the diagnosis. Aberrant immunoexpression of neuroendocrine markers, particularly in an amelanotic melanoma, has critical diagnostic implications, as various malignancies with undifferentiated histomorphology occur at this site, many of which stain positively with neuroendocrine markers. We discuss the differential diagnoses and recommend a high index of suspicion so as not to miss the diagnosis of mucosal melanoma at this location.

AB  - Serine racemase (SR) converts the free form of L-serine into D-serine (DS) in the mammalian brain. The DS functions as a co-agonist of N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The over- activation of NMDA receptor leads to many neurological disorders like stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and an effective inhibitor of SR could be a corrective method for the receptor over-activation. We report for the first time here a rapid way of purifying and identifying an inhibitor from medicinal plants known to have the neuro-protective effect. We have purified SR inhibitor from the methanolic extract of Centella asiatica by affinity method. High resolution mass spectrometry and infrared spectroscopy were used to identify the ligand to be madecassoside. We have shown the madecassoside binding in silico and its inhibition of recombinant human serine racemase in vitro and ex vivo.

AB  - Early-stage detection of leukemia is a critical determinant for successful treatment of the disease and can increase the survival rate of leukemia patients. The factors limiting the current screening approaches to leukemia include low sensitivity and specificity, high costs, and a low participation rate. An approach based on novel and innovative biomarkers with high accuracy from peripheral blood offers a comfortable and appealing alternative to patients, potentially leading to a higher participation rate. Recently, non-coding RNAs due to their involvement in vital oncogenic processes such as differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis have attracted much attention as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in leukemia. Emerging lines of evidence have shown that the mutational spectrum and dysregulated expression of non-coding RNA genes are closely associated with the development and progression of various cancers, including leukemia. In this review, we highlight the expression and functional roles of different types of non-coding RNAs in leukemia and discuss their potential clinical applications as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of caesarean section in South and South-East Asian women
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background
   Caesarean section is considered a relatively preferable and safe method of delivery as compared to normal delivery. Since the last decade, its prevalence has increased in both developed and developing countries. In the context of developing countries viz., South Asia (the highest populated region) and South-East Asia (the third-highest populated region), where a significant proportion of home deliveries were reported,however, the preference for, caesarean delivery and its associated factors are not well understood.
   Objective
   To study the caesarean delivery in the South and South-East Asian countries and to determine the factors associated with the preference for caesarean delivery.
   Methodology
   Demographic and Health Survey Data on from ever-married women of nine developing countries of South and South-East Asia viz., Vietnam, India, Maldives, Timor-Leste, Nepal, Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Cambodia have been considered. Both bivariate and binary logistic regression models were used to estimate the propensity of a woman undergoing for caesarean delivery and to assess the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery.
   Results
   Obtained results have shown an inclination of caesarean delivery among urban than rural women and are quite conspicuous, but is found to be underestimated mostly among rural women. Caesarean delivery in general is mostly predisposed among women whose baby sizes are either very large or smaller than average, have a higher level of education and place of delivery is private medical institutions. The logistic regression also revealed the influence of maternal socioeconomic characteristics towards the preference for caesarean delivery. Based on nine South and South-East Asian countries an overall C-section prevalence of 13%, but based on institutional births its increase to 19%. The forest plot demonstrated that a significant inclination of C-section among urban than rural regions. In MetaAnalysis, very high and significant heterogeneity among countries is observed, but confirms that in terms of prevalence of C-section all of the countries follow independent pattern.
   Conclusion
   Study of seven urban and four rural regions of nine South and South-East Asian countries showed, a significant inclination towards the caesarean delivery above the more recent outdated WHO recommended an optimal range of 10-15%and are associated maternal socioeconomic characteristics. In order to control unwanted caesarean delivery, the government needs to develop better healthcare infrastructure and along with more antenatal care related schemes to reduce the risks associated with increased caesarean delivery.

AB  - Background Variation in the shape of the femur and tibia has been shown to influence hip-kneeankle-axis angle (HKAA) and bears a role in reconstructive surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, data on the axial alignment of the lower extremity specific to sex largely remains unavailable. Thus, we conducted a study with an aim to measure alignment and calculate differences in both the sexes in Indian population. Materials and Methods The following radiological parameters were measured from weight-bearing long leg radiographs of 966 limbs of Indian subjects via a morphometric software (Matlab R2009a) (1) Hip-Knee-Ankle angle (HKAA), (2) femoral bowing, (3) tibial bowing, (4) condylar plateau angle (CPA). The knees were classified according to the Kellegren and Lawrence grading and the differences between both the sexes were calculated with appropriate statistical tests. Results 56.04% of the subjects were female. An increase in the mean age was observed for both the genders with an increase in the severity of OA. Height did not show any significant association with the alignment of the limb. The mean HKAA observed was - 5.88 degrees +/- 0.35 degrees in females and - 4.99 degrees +/- 0.41 degrees in males. The overall mean femoral bow and tibial bow was - 1.26 degrees +/- 0.24 degrees, - 1.60 degrees +/- 0.18 degrees in females and - 1.09 +/- 0.28, - 1.47 degrees +/- 0.21 degrees in males. The mean condylar plateau angle was higher in females - 2.67 +/- 0.34 as compared to males - 2.35 degrees +/- 0.39 degrees. A greater lateral bow was seen in males at higher grades of OA for femur and at lower grades of OA for tibia. Conclusion This study provides gender-based differences in the various axial radio-graphic parameters in a long leg radio-graphs in Indian population which might help in a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of osteoarthritis and also help planning and execution of reconstructive surgeries such as TKA.

AB  - The eye is said to be the window into the brain. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glaucoma both being diseases of the elderly, have several epidemiological and histological overlaps in pathogenesis. Both these diseases are neurodegenerative conditions. Over the years, a consensus has developed that both may be two ends of a singular spectrum of diseases. Epidemiological studies have shown that more Alzheimer's patients may be suffering from glaucoma than general healthy population. Retinal ganglion cell damage is a characteristic of both diseases, along with discovery of amyloid-beta and tau protein deposition in the retina and aqueous humor of eye. The latter two proteins are known to be pathognomonic of AD. Other pathways such as the insulin receptor pathway also seem to be affected in both diseases similarly. In spite of these overlaps, there are few missing links which still need more evidence, namely, intraocular pressure mechanisms, cerebrospinal fluid pressure and trans-lamina cribrosa pressure gradients, vascular autoregulation factors, etc. Several factors point towards a common pathogenesis at some level for both diseases and prospective studies are necessary to study the natural course of both diseases.

AB  - Abdominal pain is one of the most frequent and worrisome complaints that brings a patient to the hospital. Patients with undiagnosed abdominal pain usually undergo a battery of investigations, while remaining dissatisfied. Since glucose metabolic imaging with FDG PET has been shown to detect infection, inflammation and malignancies earlier than structural imaging, we planned a pilot study to assess the causes of undiagnosed pain abdomen. The study was carried out at our tertiary care academic institution, from December 2016 to July 2018. A total of 30 patients with no aetiology found on clinical evaluation, laboratory investigations, ultrasound and computerized tomography scan underwent FDG PET CT. PET findings were correlated with clinical parameters to reach a final diagnosis. The results were analysed prospectively to find the utility of PET scan. The mean age was 33.33 years, and 66.67% were females. The number of patients in whom a final diagnosis (relating to pain abdomen) was made with the help of FDG PET was 6; therefore, the yield was calculated as 6/30 = 20.0%. A positive correlation was seen between duration and intensity of pain, raised ESR/positive or borderline Mantoux and presence of findings on PET. The negative predictive value of PET was 100%. Three patients were diagnosed to have tuberculosis, one had aorto-arteritis, one patient had infective foci in lung and one patient had subacute appendicitis. FDG PET scan might be indicated in undiagnosed pain abdomen, especially in patients with chronic pain with raised ESR or positive Mantoux.

AB  - Genotype MTBDRs/Version 1 (V1.0) was recommended as an initial test for rapid detection of pre-extensively drug resistant (pre-XDR) and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). However, in recent years a number of novel mutations are identified that confer resistance. Thus, Genotype MTBDRs/V2.0 was endorsed by WHO. Though, Genotype MTBDRs/V2.0 has been rolled out in national TB programme in 2018, there is dearth of data from India on its performance for second line drug susceptibility testing (DST). For this, performance of new version was evaluated on 113 MDR-TB isolates. The results showed that 39 (34.5%) of these isolates were resistant to FQ and 7 (6.2%) were XDR by Genotype MTBDRs/V2.0. Amongst the FQ resistant isolates most prevalent mutation was Delta WT3-D94G (17; 38.6%) and N538D (12; 85.7%). Among the AG/CP and KAN resistant isolates most common mutation in the rrs region was Delta WT1-A1401G (5; 71.4%) and C-14T (2; 28.5%) in eis gene. Second line Bactec MGIT-960 detected 40 (35.4%) isolates as resistant to FQ and 6 (5.3%) as XDR isolates, whereas Genotype MTBDRsl V1.0 also detected 39 (34.5%) as resistant to FQ but missed 2 isolates in correctly identifying as XDR (5; 4.4%). Thus, concordance of second line Bactec MGIT-960 with Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 was similar (100%) for FQ detection but it has improvised the diagnostic sensitivity for correctly identifying XDR isolates. Nevertheless, the cost of Genotype MTBDRsl V2.0 remains an issue for screening of second line drug (SLDs) resistance from countries with high burden of MDR-TB.

AB  - Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma is one of the highest mortality factors in the world due to the lack of potential biomarker for early detection of disease. There is an urgent need for molecular marker involved in disease progression which remains suppressed normally, required for specificity. HLA-G is highly expressed in cancers and creates immune-suppressive microenvironment. Cancerous cells secrete inflammatory cytokines like IL-10, IFN-gamma which increase expression of immunosuppressive molecules, such as HLA-G. We evaluated sHLA-G protein level in serum of 120 HNSCC patients at diagnosis and after therapy and compared with 99 individuals by SPR, ELISA and determined its mRNA level by qRT-PCR. sHLA-G was correlated with serum IL-10 and IFN-gamma of the patients. Significant elevated levels of sHLA-G were observed in patients (8.25 +/- 1.74 ng/mu l) than control (6.45 +/- 1.31 ng/mu l). Levels were declined in (8.09 +/- 1.79 ng/mu l to 6.64 +/- 1.33 ng/mu l) patients in response to therapy. sHLA-G levels with tumor burden (8.16 +/- 1.91 to 6.63 +/- 1.32 ng/mu l), node (8.62 +/- 1.45 to 6.66 +/- 1.26 ng/mu l), PDSCC (8.14 +/- 0.62 to 5.65 +/- 0.27 ng/mu l) and oropharynx (7.90 +/- 1.24 to 6.10 +/- 1.33 ng/mu l) showed a positive and significant response to therapy. Findings indicate that sHLA-G can be a potential diagnostic serum protein marker for HNSCC due to its suppressive function and over expression in diseased condition with the influence of cytokines.

Effects of the environment can alter the sperm epigenome thereby impacting male reproductive health. Epigenetic mechanisms are crucial to understanding health and disease, and methylome alterations are now known to have far-reaching clinical implications. Here, we report the results from our pilot study, a first of its kind analysis of the effect of the traditional practice of yoga on human sperm quality. We find marked improvement in sperm characteristics in patients of idiopathic male infertility following a supervised 21-day yoga regimen. Furthermore, next-generation sequencing-based methylome analysis reveals alterations in the sperm epigenome of these patients. We find that the practice of yoga is associated with DNA methylation changes at nearly 400 genes, 147 of which were hypermethylated while 229 were hypomethylated. These included promoters of several genes linked to maintenance of fertility and genomic integrity. This novel piece of work draws a direct link between positive lifestyle practices and male reproductive health.

AB  - Background The role of DNA damage response (DDR) proteins is poorly understood in uveal melanoma. ATR belongs to one of those proteins that induce DDR by arresting the cell cycle which leads to DNA repair. ATR is localized at position 23 on the same chromosome 3 where BAP1 is located at position 21.1 which is a known poor prognostic marker of UM. The aim of our study is to detect the expression of ATR at the protein and RNA levels and determine its prognostic significance. Methods Expression of nuclear ATR was investigated on sixty-nine UM patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded choroidal melanoma samples were taken to evaluate the expression of ATR. Fifty samples were also validated by real-time PCR. Results of both protein and mRNA were then correlated with clinicopathological parameters. To determine the prognostic significance, Kaplan-Meier and multivariate analyses were performed. Results Loss of ATR protein was seen in 72% cases which was statistically significant with epithelioid cell type (p = 0.005), tumor thickness (p = 0.016), mitotic figures (p = 0.001) and BAP1 loss (p < 0.001). At the transcriptional level loss of ATR was seen in 76% cases which were statistically significant with metastasis (p = 0.046), staging (0.044) and loss of BAP1 (p = 0.022). On multivariate analysis loss of ATR and tumor staging came out to be independent prognostic parameters. Conclusion Our data suggest that ATR might serve as a potential prognostic marker in UM patients and could serve as a potential therapeutic target.

AB  - The focus for International Women's Day 2020 is gender equity:'We can actively choose to challenge stereotypes, fight bias, broaden perceptions, improve situations and celebrate women's achievements. Collectively, each one of us can help create a gender equal world.' We have come together as an international group of women holding senior positions within CF to raise awareness. There is growing recognition of gender imbalance within our sector in senior leadership, grant and publication success. Several institutions, such as National Institutes of Health, have missions to tackle this. The issues raised by our panellists were wide-ranging: decisions around starting a family, impact on career progression; experiences of bias in appointments or promotions; self-belief. We hope that raising these issues will encourage future leaders in CF to step up, to build teams based on fairness, equity and diversity, and to catalyse steps towards this goal in their institutions and society more widely.

AB  - Vietnam has been using a levofloxacin-based shorter treatment regimen (STR) for rifampicin resistant/multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (RR/MDR-TB) patients since 2016 on a pilot basis. This regimen lasts for 9-11 months and is provided to RR/MDR-TB patients without second-line drug resistance. We report the treatment outcomes and factors associated with unsuccessful outcomes. We conducted a cohort study involving secondary analysis of data extracted from electronic patient records maintained by the national TB program (NTP). Of the 302 patients enrolled from April 2016 to June 2018, 259 (85.8%) patients were successfully treated (246 cured and 13 'treatment completed'). Unsuccessful outcomes included: treatment failure (16, 5.3%), loss to follow-up (14, 4.6%) and death (13, 4.3%). HIV-positive TB patients, those aged >= 65 years and patients culture-positive at baseline had a higher risk of unsuccessful outcomes. In a sub-group of patients enrolled in 2016 (n = 99) and assessed at 12 months after treatment completion, no cases of relapse were identified. These findings vindicate the decision of the Vietnam NTP to use a levofloxacin-based STR in RR/MDR-TB patients without second-line drug resistance. This regimen may be considered for nationwide scale-up after a detailed assessment of adverse drug events.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a progressive and chronic bone disorder characterized by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of skeletal tissues. Osteoporosis leads to alteration in bone mineral content resulting in decreased bone strength with elevated fracture risks frequently associated with greater morbidity. The latest research in the area of photomedicine had sparked interest in harnessing the active components from plants in both disease control and management across the globe. We in the present review have taken a comprehensive approach to identify forty known plants and their phytoconstituents, which encompasses (i) the genetic diversity of various plants, (ii) their active components and (iii) their osteoprotective role in osteoporosis. Thus, the present review is an attempt for the first time to collectively document the therapeutic properties of valuable medicinal plants in preventing and treating bone loss in osteoporosis.

AB  - Introduction: Craniosynostosis (CS) syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition (ADC) classically combining with CS and nonsyndromic CS (NSCS) including digital anomalies of the hands and feet. The majority of cases caused by a heterozygous mutation (HM) in the third immunoglobulin-like domain (IgIII) of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 mutations outside this region of the protein.
   Material and Methods: We tried to find out the spectrum of genes involved in CS syndrome caused by the heterozygous missense mutation, the IgII and IgIII of FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, TWIST, and MSXgenes were performed and verified through the Indian population with CS children.
   Results: We find out that at conserved linker region (LR), the changes occurred among the larger families. Independent genetic origins, but phenotypic similarities add to the evidence supporting the theory of selfish spermatogonial selective advantage for this rare gain-of-function FGFR2 mutation. Polygenic novel mutation in both syndromic and nonsyndromic cases of CS promotes the translational research and holds a great promise to reproduce the molecular-based therapy and treatment as well. In this article, we summarized that genes involved in CS as evidence-based approach for characterization. identification, gene expression, and tissue engineering. We also described other related genes and proteins for the CS involvement and improvement of the diseases progression.
   Conclusion: HM again repeated the old story for both groups of syndromic CS and NSCS of Asian Indian children. Here, for the first time. we clearly reported that IgIII of FGFR2 mutations outside this region of the protein and tyrosine kinase (TK1 and TK2) responsible for both in molecular and cellular level for CS. It adds an evidence for future molecular targeting therapy to repair CS.

AB  - Objective To describe experience with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in children with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) transitioned from conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) due to refractory hypoxemia and to assess factors associated with survival and also compare outcomes of patients who were managed with early HFOV (within 24 h of intubation) vs. late HFOV. Methods This retrospective, observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital's pediatric intensive care unit. Thirty-four children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) managed with HFOV were included. Results Of 34 children with PARDS managed with HFOV after failure of conventional ventilation to improve oxygenation, 8 survived. Improvement in the Oxygenation Index (OI) at 48 h of initiation of HFOV along with percent increase in PaO2/FiO(2) (P/F ratio) at 24 h of HFOV were predictors of survival. The response to HFOV, based on OI and P/F ratio, between 24 and 48 h of ventilation identified potential survivors. Also, lower positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on CMV and shorter duration of CMV before initiation of HFOV were associated with survival. Conclusions Survival in pediatric ARDS patients treated with HFOV could be predicted by using trends of OI - with survivors showing a more rapid decline in OI between 24 and 48 h of initiation compared to non-survivors.

AB  - Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is most aggressive subtype of breast cancers with high probability of metastasis as well as lack of specific targets and targeted therapeutics. TNBC is characterized with unique tumor microenvironment (TME), which differs from other subtypes. TME is associated with induction of proliferation, angiogenesis, inhibition of apoptosis and immune system suppression, and drug resistance. Exosomes are promising nanovesicles, which orchestrate the TME by communicating with different cells within TME. The components of TME including transformed ECM, soluble factors, immune suppressive cells, epigenetic modifications and re-programmed fibroblasts together hamper antitumor response and helps progression and metastasis of TNBCs. Therefore, TME could be a therapeutic target of TNBC. The current review presents latest updates on the role of exosomes in modulation of TME, approaches for targeting TME and combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and target chemotherapeutics. Finally, we also discussed various phytochemicals that alter genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of THE along with current challenges and future implications. Thus, as TME is associated with the hallmarks of TNBC, the understanding of the impact of different components can improve the clinical benefits of TNBC patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The evolution of the neurosurgical specialty in lower-middle-income countries is uniformly a narrative of continuous struggle for recognition and resource allocation. Therefore, it is not surprising that neurosurgical education and residency training in these countries is relatively nascent. Dr. Harvey Cushing in 1901 declared that he would specialize in neurosurgery and gave his greatest contribution to the advancement of neurosurgical education by laying the foundations of a structured residency training program. Similar efforts in lower-middle-income countries have been impeded by economic instability and the lack of well-established medical education paradigms. The authors sought to evaluate the residency programs in these nations by conducting a survey among the biggest stakeholders in these educational programs: the neurosurgical residents.
   METHODS A questionnaire addressing various aspects of the residency program from a resident's perspective was prepared with Google Forms and circulated among neurosurgery residents through social media and email groups. Where applicable, a 5-point Likert scale was used to grade the responses to the questions. Responses were collected from May to October 2019 and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Complete anonymity of the respondents was ensured to keep the responses unbiased.
   RESULTS A total of 195 responses were received, with 189 of them from lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). The majority of these were from India (75%), followed by Brazil and Pakistan. An abiding concern among residents was lack of work hour regulations, inadequate exposure to emerging subspecialties, and the need for better hands-on training (> 60% each). Of the training institutions represented, 89% were offering more than 500 major neurosurgical surgeries per year, and 40% of the respondents never got exposure to any subspecialty. The popularity of electronic learning resources was discernible and most residents seemed to be satisfied with the existent system of evaluation. Significant differences (p < 0.05) among responses from India compared with those from other countries were found in terms of work hour regulations and subspecialty exposure.
   CONCLUSIONS It is prudent that concerned authorities in LMICs recognize and address the deficiencies perceived by neurosurgery residents in their training programs. A determined effort in this direction would be endorsed and assisted by a host of international neurosurgical societies when it is felt that domestic resources may not be adequate. Quality control and close scrutiny of training programs should ensure that the interests of neurosurgical trainees are best served.

AB  - Background and Aims: DNA methylation and demethylation play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression, though their interplay during pathogenesis of hippocampal scelerosis (HS) remains elusive. The present study was designed to investigate the DNA methylation regulated changes in expression of HS patients.
   Methods: We performed integrative analysis of genome-wide CpG-DNA methylation profiling and RNA sequencing to profile global changes in promoter methylation and gene expression in HS patients. Real time PCR was performed to validate the findings of methylation and RNA sequencing.
   Results: A total of 16040 sites showed altered DNA methylation in all the CpG islands. Of these, 3185 sites were in the promoter regions, of which 66 genes showed an inverse correlation between methylation and expression. These genes are largely related to pathways predicted to participate in axon guidance by semaphorins, MAPK, ionotropic glutamate receptor pathway, notch signaling, regulatory activities related to TFAP2A and immune response, with the most distinct ones included TFAP2A, NRP1, SEMA3B, CACNG2, MAP3K11, and ADAM17.
   Conclusion: We performed integrated analysis of genomic methylation signature and differential gene expression patterns of hippocampal tissues resected from patients with HS for the first time. Collectively, our findings implicate DNA methylation as a critical regulator of the pathogenic mechanisms of epileptogenesis associated with HS.

KW  - SURGERY
AB  - The posterior quadratic epilepsy (POE) is a form of a multilobar epilepsy, involving the temporal-parietal and occipital lobes. Basically. epilepsies with localized networks to the posterior temporal, posterior parietal, and occipital lobes can benefit from this type of surgery. Gliosis due to perinatal insult and cortical dysplasis and angiomas in Sturge Weber syndrome involving the PQ have often been cited in the literature as the etiology for PQE. However, before considering surgery, it is important to localize the epileptogenic focus through a complete pre operative work up involving; EEG (Electro-Encephalo-Graphy), video EEG, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and magneto encephalography (MEG). Historically, these pathologies were dealt with multi-lobar resections, which were associated with high morbidity and mortality, owing to blood loss, especially in young children, hydrocephalus, and hemosiderosis. Based on the theory of networks involved in epileptogenesis, the concept of disconnection in epilepsy surgery was introduced. Delalande and colleagues, described the technique of hemispheric disconnection (functional hemispherectomy) for pathologies like: hemimegalencephaly, rasmussens encephalitis involving the entire hemisphere. The technique has evolved with time. moving towards minimally invasive endoscopic vertical hemispherotomy, described by Chandra and colleagues,([1,2]) The posterior quadrant disconnection (POD) evolved as a tailored disconnection on similar lines as hemispherotomy, for managing refractory epilepsy arising from the posterior quadrant.([3]) The technique and principles involved in the PQD surgery are similar to the those of peri-insular hemispherotomy and has been described in the literature by few authors([3-6]) The technique of performing PQD will be described here in a step-wise fashion with illustrations supplemented by a surgical video.

AB  - Background Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) may develop following acute pancreatitis (AP). Endoscopic and laparoscopic internal drainage are accepted modalities for drainage of PFCs but have not been compared in a randomized trial. Our objective was to compare endoscopic and laparoscopic internal drainage of pseudocyst/walled-off necrosis following AP. Patients and methods Patients with symptomatic pseudocysts or walled-off necrosis suitable for laparoscopic and endoscopic transmural internal drainage were randomized to either modality in a randomized controlled trial. Endoscopic drainage comprised of per-oral transluminal cystogastrostomy. Additionally, endoscopic lavage and necrosectomy were done following a step-up approach for infected collections. Surgical laparoscopic cystogastrostomy was done for drainage, lavage, and necrosectomy. Primary outcome was resolution of PFCs by the intended modality and secondary outcome was complications. Results Sixty patients were randomized, 30 each to laparoscopic and endoscopic drainage. Both groups were comparable for baseline characteristics. The initial success rate was 83.3% in the laparoscopic and 76.6% in the endoscopic group (p = 0.7) after the index intervention. The overall success rate of 93.3% (28/30) and 90% (27/30) in the laparoscopic and endoscopic groups respectively was also similar (p = 1.0). Two patients in the laparoscopic group required endoscopic cystogastrostomy for persistent collections. Similarly, two patients in the endoscopic group required laparoscopic drainage. Postoperative complications were comparable between the groups except for higher post-procedure infection in the endoscopic group (19 vs. 9; p = 0.01) requiring endoscopic re-intervention. Conclusions Endoscopic and laparoscopic techniques have similar efficacy for internal drainage of suitable pancreatic fluid collections with < 30% debris. The choice of procedure should depend on available expertise and patient preference.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the outcome of microscope integrated optical coherence tomography (MiOCT) guided removal of lenticulo-corneal adhesion and intralenticular lens aspiration (ILLA) in cases with anterior dislocation of the crystalline lens and corneal edema. Methods: MiOCT-guided ILLA was performed in three eyes of two cases of homocystinuria with spontaneous anterior dislocation of lens and corneal edema. Lenticulo-corneal adhesion was noted intraoperatively, which was not apparent pre-operatively. The lenticulo-corneal adhesion could be successfully peeled using intravitreal forceps and viscodissection with visco-dispersive viscoelastic under the guidance of MiOCT. Results: In all cases, the lenticulo-corneal adhesion could be successfully removed without any complication such as Descemet tear or worsening in corneal edema. Improvement in visual acuity was noted in all cases with resolution in corneal edema by 1 week. Conclusion: MiOCT-guided ILLA can be extremely useful in cases of lenticulo-corneal adhesion especially in cases with corneal edema.

AB  - In this work, pre-impregnation techniques including Dr. Ernst Fehrer (DREF) spinning and electrostatic powder coating were used to negate the poor impregnation of highly viscous thermoplastics. The DREF spun hybrid yarns and electrostatic spray coated towpregs were woven into 2D and 3D fabrics and subsequently consolidated to yield two variations of 2D and four variations of 3D composites including 3D angle inter-lock and 3D orthogonal weave. The 2D composites possessed higher tensile and flexural strength than the 3D composites. However, better notch impact properties were observed for 3D orthogonal weave. The closer wrapping in 3D orthogonal slightly improves the shock absorption capability of the composite than the angle interlock composite. Composites made from powder coated towpregs performed better than composites made from DREF spun hybrid yarns, minimizing the effect of the weave pattern. Porosity was a common feature of composites manufactured from DREF spun yarns as observed from micro-CT images.

AB  - Background: The current study was planned at a tertiary centre in northern India to develop and validate a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5 (DSM-5)-based diagnostic tool and design a severity score for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children aged 6-18 years. An existing DSM-IV-based tool, INDT (International Clinical Epidemiology Network [INCLEN] diagnostic tool) for ADHD has been modified and named All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)-modified INDT ADHD tool.
   Method: The first phase was development of the tool and the second phase was validation of the same against the gold standard of diagnosis by the DSM-5. A severity score was developed for ADHD in concordance with the Conners rating scale.
   Results: The tool was validated in 66 children with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively. A cut-off score of 12 was decided for labelling severity of ADHD, which corresponded to 63 in the Conners rating scale.
   Conclusion: This diagnostic tool for ADHD based on DSM-5 has acceptable psychometric properties. The severity score will be useful for prognostication, monitoring treatment response, and designing intervention trials.

AB  - Background
   Compared to primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), the right ventricular (RV) contractile function is preserved for a long time in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome and is likely the most important determinant of relatively higher survival. The differences in myocardial perfusion have been purported to explain this discrepancy. The exact prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in Eisenmenger syndrome is not known. We sought to examine the prevalence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.
   Methods
   In this prospective study, 20 consecutive adult patients with Eisenmenger syndrome were subjected to clinical assessment, six-minute walk test and echocardiography. Myocardial perfusion was assessed using one day stress-rest Gated Technetium-99 m Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography.
   Results
   Nineteen (95%) patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II. All patients had RV hypertrophy. Five (25%) patients had RV systolic dysfunction. Left ventricular systolic function was normal in all except in three patients. Two (10%) patients had perfusion defects in the RV and 4 (20%) patients had perfusion defects in the left ventricle (LV).
   Conclusion
   Myocardial perfusion defects, both in RV and LV, occur even in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with Eisenmenger syndrome.

T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the presence of vascular naevi, varicose veins and soft tissue or bone hypertrophy affecting one or more extremities. Due to the rarity of the syndrome, there is limited literature regarding the current practice in the management of pregnancy complicated with KTS. Successful management of pregnancy with KTS is a challenge for clinicians as pregnancy exacerbates the already increased risk of thrombosis and haemorrhage associated with this syndrome. We report a patient with KTS with previous poor obstetric history managed with favourable maternal and foetal outcomes.

AB  - THOC6 is a newly described causal gene for an autosomal recessive intellectual disability (ID) - Beaulieu Boycott Innes syndrome (BBIS) (OMIM # 613680). It is characterized by ID with dysmorphic facies, genitourinary, cardiac anomalies, and dentition problems. Here, we report the first two siblings of BBIS from the Indian subcontinent with previously unreported skeletal anomalies such as Sprengel shoulder, calcaneo valgus deformity, radioulnar dysostosis, and overlapping toes. Whole exome sequencing (WES) identified previously reported three missense variants (p.Trp100Arg, p.Val234Leu, p.Gly275Asp) in THOC6. THOC6 is a subunit of TRanscription and EXport (TREX) complex involved in mRNA transcription, processing, and nuclear export of spliced mRNAs and has a potential role in neurodevelopment. Till date, only 12 patients with BBIS have been reported. This report reviews the phenotypic and genetic data of known BBIS cases in addition to the new phenotypic features, thereby expanding the phenotype of this rare syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVI D-19 infection outbreak has aroused increasing attention and affected thousands of people nationwide. The long incubation period, high infectious rate, varied manifestation, and absence of effective treatment make it difficult to manage the disease transmission.
   OBJECTIVE: The intended goals are to encourage efficient management of neurological and neurosurgical patients, resource utilization, and protecting the healthcare provider during the COVID-19 epidemic. Herein, we present a consensus statement from various centers in India
   METHODOLOGY: In addition to the literature review, recommendations were included from neurologists and neurosurgeons from various centers in India.
   RESULTS: Every patient presenting for treatment should be treated as a potential asymptomatic infected case. Patients should be categorized based upon the priority as acute (require immediate treatment/surgery within 24 h), sub-acute (requiring treatment within a maximum of 7-10 days), or chronic (requiring treatment within a month). Non-essential elective surgeries and outpatient clinics should be avoided after informing the patient(s). There is a high risk of aerosol dispersion during intubation and certain neurosurgical procedures particularly those involving drills and endoscopes. These procedures should be performed wearing full personal protective equipment. The workflow of the operating rooms should also be modified significantly. Minor modifications in personal and professional lifestyles and routine training to use the PPE will ensure efficient management of resources.
   CONCLUSION: These recommendations could be used to mitigate the risks and reduce exposure to other patients, public, and healthcare staff.

AB  - Background: Pattern of drinking has a strong bearing on alcohol-related negative consequences. Very few studies from India have assessed this relationship using any standardized instrument. Aim: The current study aims to assess the relationship between pattern of alcohol use and negative consequences among problem alcohol users using a standardized instrument.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional, observational study using snowball sampling technique was conducted among 75 participants in an urban slum of a metropolitan city of India. Screening of the participants was done by the World Health Organization Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (WHO-ASSIST). Alcohol use details and alcohol-related adverse consequences were obtained by a semi-structured questionnaire and Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC) inventory, respectively. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, and logistic regression test were used to analyze the data.
   Results: There was a significant association between high total DrInC score and >= 3 subscale scores with employment status, percentage of total family income spent on alcohol, source of income to procure alcohol, amount of alcohol, morning drinking, alcohol use for relaxation, and drinking throughout the day (Chi-square test). Age <= 35 years, current unemployment/part-time employment state, spending >= 25% of total family income on alcohol, family history, and drinking throughout the day were more likely to have high total DrInC score and >= 2 subscale scores (logistic regression analysis).
   Conclusion: A large proportion of the participants were suffering significantly from alcohol-related consequences but still were not receiving any treatment. It emphasizes the need for more epidemiological studies in this area for its treatment and policy-level implication.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate association between total IgE levels and wheezing in preschool children from India. Methods Data were collected in a prospective birth cohort study related to wheezing till three years of age. Total IgE was measured at enrolment, at one year and two years of age and correlated with wheezing episodes. Results A total of 310 (167 boys) children were enrolled. Total IgE levels increased with age (P<0.001). Overall, 101 (32.6%) children had 182 episodes of wheezing. The median (IQR) total IgE levels in children with wheezing and without wheezing were similar at one year [42.1 (12.7, 93.5) vs 41.9 (17.1, 96.7) kU/L; P=0.39] and two years of age [62.8 (32.4, 212.0) vs 75 (25.8, 173.0) kU/L, P=0.92). Conclusion Total IgE levels increased with age and were not different in preschool children with and without wheezing.

AB  - It is estimated that the global prevalence of dementia will rise as high as 24 million and predicted to be double in every 20 years which is attributed to the fact that the ageing population is increasing and so more individuals are at risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Many scientists favored glycation of proteins such as tau, amyloid beta (A beta) etc. as one of the important risk factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since, d-ribose shows highest glycation ability among other sugars hence, produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) rapidly. However, there are several other mechanisms suggested by researchers through which d-ribose may cause cognitive impairments. There is a concern related to diabetic patients since they also suffer from d-ribose metabolism, may be more prone to AD risk. Thus, it is imperative that the pathogenesis and the pathways involved in AD progression are explored in the light of ribosylation and AGEs formation for identifying suitable diagnostics marker for early diagnosis or finding promising therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infliximab (IFX) or adalimumab (ADA) use in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) leads to increased risk of tuberculosis (TB). This meta-analysis evaluated the factors which determine this risk, with special focus on local TB incidence. METHODS: All studies until January 31, 2019, which reported the development of TB in patients with IBD on IFX/ADA, were included after searching PubMed and Embase. Data regarding disease type, number of patients on IFX/ADA, number of patients who developed TB, mean age at IFX/ADA initiation, median duration of development of TB, and latent TB (LTB) were extracted. The details on local TB incidence were obtained from the World Health Organization database, and the studies were stratified into low (<10/100,000), intermediate (10-40/100,000), and high TB burden countries (>40/100,000). Random effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall pooled prevalence and prevalence based on local TB burden. RESULTS: Of 130,114 patients (128 studies), 373 developed TB (pooled prevalence: 0.08% [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.05%-0.10%]). The risk increased with increasing TB burden, pooled prevalence being 0.02% (95% CI: 0.02%-0.03%), 0.21% (95% CI: -0.02% to 0.43%), and 1.59% (95% CI: 1.19%-2.00%) for low, intermediate, and high TB burden countries, respectively. Seventy-three percent of patients who developed TB had no evidence of LTB on screening, the proportion being independent of TB burden. There was no effect of disease or treatment type, study type, gender, age at IFX/ADA initiation, and follow-up duration on TB prevalence. DISCUSSION: TB risk in patients with IBD on IFX/ADA depends on the local TB burden and is independent of disease/treatment type.

AB  - Heart and brain interactions mediate human cognition. This investigation identifies heart-brain interactions during internally operative attention (A(I)) and externally operative attention (A(E)). A(I) attention involves short term memory, whereas At attention deals with automatic and transient response to objects in the external world. A modified Posner's spatial orienting task used to differentiate A(I) and A(E) attention. Heart and brain rhythms recorded in fourteen healthy participants. Functional coupling from heart-to-brain (C-heart -> brain) and brain-to-heart (C-brain -> heart) time series derived using an information domain approach based on conditional entropy. The experimental results showed that low-frequency power of heart rate variability (HRV-LF) and sympathovagal balance (LF/HF ratio) during At significantly increased compared with that for A(I). Furthermore, the information flow from heart-to-brain increased and decreased form brain-to-heart during A(E) as compared to A(I). Also, opposite trend in relationship noted between coupling index (C-i -> j) and HRV-LF during A(I) and A(E) attention. The conditional entropy technique enabled simultaneous analysis of heart-brain rhythms to identify heart-brain interactions during A(I) and A(E) attention. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) in infancy may have a long-term impact on the developing respiratory system. We planned a prospective cohort study to determine the impact of ARI during infancy on the pulmonary function test indices at 3 years of age.
   Methods A cohort of normal, full-term newborns were followed up 6 monthly and during ARI episodes. Infant pulmonary function tests (IPFTs) were performed at baseline and each follow-up visit using tidal breathing flow-volume loop, rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC) and raised volume RTC manoeuvres. During each ARI episode, nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for respiratory pathogens by real-time PCR.
   Results We screened 3421 neonates; 310 were enrolled; IPFT was performed in 225 (boys: 125 (55.6%)) at 3 years. During infancy, 470 ARI episodes were documented in 173 infants. At 3 years, children with history of any ARI episode during infancy had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1.0), forced expiratory volume in 0.75 s (FEV0.75), forced expiratory volume in 0.5 s (FEV0.5), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC (FEF25-75), and maximal expiratory flow at 25% of FVC (MEF25) as compared with those without any ARI episode during infancy. The ratio of tidal expiratory flow (TEF) at 25% or 50% of tidal expiratory volume to peak TEF (TEF50 or TEF25/peak TEF) at 3 years was significantly increased in children who had ARI in infancy.
   Conclusions ARI during infancy is associated with impaired pulmonary function indices such as increased resistance and decreased forced expiratory flow and volume at 3 years of age.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death in developing countries, generally originating as coronary artery disease (CAD) or hypertension. In later stages, many CAD patients develop left ventricle dysfunction (LVD). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the most prevalent prognostic factor in CAD patients. LVD is a complex multifactorial condition in which the left ventricle of the heart becomes functionally impaired. Various genetic studies have correlated LVD with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In recent years, enormous progress has been made in identifying the genetic causes of cardiac diseases, which has further led to a greater understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying each disease. This progress has increased the probability of establishing a specific genetic diagnosis, and thus providing new opportunities for practitioners, patients, and families to utilize this genetic information. A large number of mutations in sarcomeric genes have been discovered in cardiomyopathies. In this review, we will explore the role of the sarcomeric genes in LVD in CAD patients, which is a major cause of cardiac failure and results in heart failure.

AB  - Purpose: To compare intraocular pressure, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and ultrasound biomicroscopy parameters over 3 months after panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) for proliferative diabetic retinopathy after 1 of 2 sittings by conventional laser (half PRP) and a single sitting of Pattern Scan Laser (PASCAL) PRP. Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, interventional study. All tests were performed at baseline, and at 1, 6, and 24 hours, and 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks after PRP. Results: The intraocular pressure at 1 hour and 6 hours after PRP was significantly raised in both groups. Mean intraocular pressure was 21.17 +/- 4.01 mmHg after PASCAL and 17.48 +/- 3 mmHg after conventional laser at 1 hour, P < 0.001. On anterior segment optical coherence tomography, conventional laser PRP caused a more significant narrowing of angle-opening distance (AOD750) and trabecular-iris space area (TISA 500), P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively, on Day 1. Ultrasound biomicroscopy showed a significantly narrow angle in both groups on Day 1. A significant increase in ciliary body thickness was observed in both groups, with 57.1% of PASCAL and 100% of conventionally treated eyes showing ciliary effusion on Day 1 that decreased but persisted for the next 3 months. Conclusion: Performing PRP in sittings, prescribing previous glaucoma medications in patients at risk, and recording intraocular pressure an hour after the PRP could decrease complications.

AB  - Becker's nevus, also known as pigmented hairy epidermal nevus, is characteristically described as a unilateral, hairy, light to dark brown macule with sharply outlined but irregular border. The etiopathogenesis of Becker's nevus is still not clearly understood. Perifollicular pigmentation has been described earlier by some authors. But, Becker's nevus presenting exclusively with follicular lesions has not been described. We are reporting a series of patients of Becker's nevus with follicular lesions. The diagnosis in all the patients was made after clinicopathological correlation. Follicular epithelium may hold a significant role in the etiopathogenesis of Becker's nevus.

TI  - ICMR Consensus Guidelines on 'Do Not Attempt Resuscitation'
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is widely practised by healthcare professionals to revive heart beat and breathing in a patient suffering from cardiac/respiratory arrest. It is increasingly being recognized that in some patients with specific medical conditions, CPR does not alter the overall outcome of illness, and is likely to increase suffering and further deteriorate the quality of life. Do not attempt resuscitation (DNAR) as an option has been practised in many countries for such cases to avoid futile CPR and maintain dignity of the patient. The decision of DNAR should be taken by the treating physician who is well versed with the patient's medical condition, with information to the patient or her/his surrogate. While ordering DNAR on the patient's medical case record, every effort should be made to treat the underlying disease and continue optimal medical care with compassion. This policy document describes the principles for DNAR, offers an algorithm and format for its implementation, and guidance on frequently asked questions.

AB  - Malignant melanoma is an aggressive malignancy with high recurrence rates after curative surgery and in advanced stages is characterized by resistance to conventional chemotherapy. With better understanding of the genomic landscape and mutational signature of these tumours over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in management of melanoma using immunotherapy (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies) and targeted drugs against BRAF and MEK. These drugs have shown survival benefits in both adjuvant and metastatic setting with patients being eligible for immunotherapy irrespective of any biomarker. However, these drugs have varying toxicity profiles and there are no studies comparing these two classes of drugs in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting leaving the question of sequencing open to clinical judgement. Moreover, availability and cost are issues that need to be considered before use of these drugs in the Indian setting.

AB  - Introduction: Laryngeal lesions are usually evaluated by microlaryngoscopy/direct laryngoscopy under anaesthesia for disease mapping and tissue diagnosis. However patients with anticipated airway compromise due to laryngeal mass may require either a protective tracheotomy or emergency tracheotomy to secure the airway. To minimise risk of unplanned tracheotomy and expedite the diagnosis we performed ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology.
   Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and performance of ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology of suspicious/recurrent laryngo-hypopharyngeal masses.
   Methods: Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed under ultrasound guidance. Twenty-four patients were recruited, of which 17 had a pure laryngeal lesion; 6 patients had laryngopharyngeal, and one patient had a base tongue lesion with supra-glottis extension.
   Results: Out of 24 patients, 21 had positive cytology for squamous cell carcinoma, 2 patients had non-diagnostic cytology (atypical cells) and the other had inadequate tissue for definitive diagnosis. Patients with negative and inconclusive cytology underwent direct laryngoscopy biopsy, which was positive for squamous malignancy. All patients tolerated the procedure well and no adverse events were noted.
   Conclusion: Although direct laryngoscopy remains the standard of care in evaluation of laryngohypopharyngeal lesions, this pilot study has shown that ultrasound-guided transcutaneous fine needle aspiration cytology was feasible as an out-patient procedure, employing safe and sensitive technique enabling rapid diagnosis and avoiding the need for direct laryngoscopy under GA for tissue diagnosis.

AB  - Intradural spinal epidermoid cysts are rare, benign lesions either acquired from trauma, surgery, lumbar puncture or arise as congenital lesions, particularly associated with spinal dysraphism. Epidermoid cyst arising from the spine with expansile destruction of vertebrae has not been reported yet in the literature. We report a case of 36-years male presented with history of fall 8 years back with progressive symptoms of lower back pain, weakness of left lower limb and bladder/bowel incontinence. Computed tomography revealed large lytic expansile, midline sacral vertebral lesion with soft tissue component and multiple calcific foci. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated large non-enhancing heterogeneous mass showing restricted diffusion on diffusion weighted images. The patient underwent biopsy confirming the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst. The possibility of an epidermoid tumor should be kept in the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with post-traumatic sacral mass.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate age-related changes in macular vessels and their perfusion densities using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). Methods: A total of 108 eyes of 54 healthy subjects between the age group of 11 to 60 years having unaided visual acuity of 20/20 were studied on spectral domain OCTS using 3 * 3 mm macula protocol. These subjects were divided into 5 groups; Group 1: 11-20 years, Group 2: 21-30 years, Group 3: 31-40 years, Group 4: 41-50 years, and Group 5: 51-60 years. An early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid overlay at the macula was used to calculate changes in different quadrants of the superficial retinal plexus. Results: A total of 98 eyes of 49 patients were considered for the final analysis. The vessel density values decreased from the second to the sixth decade in all four quadrants (except the third decade, where a slight increase was noted). The total vessel density decreased from 168 +/- 78 mm(-1) (group 1) to 131.47 +/- 18.32 mm(-1) (group 5). A similar reduction pattern in perfusion density was seen in each quadrant from the second to the sixth decade. The total perfusion density reduced from 309 +/- 15.63% (group 1) to 283.05 +/- 45.23% (group 5). The foveal avascular zone area was 0.18 +/- 0.09 mm(2) in group 1, 0.33 +/- 0.13 mm(2) in group 2, 0.30 +/- 0.10 mm(2) in group 3, 0.38 +/- 0.05 mm(2) in group 4, and 0.46 +/- 0.06 mm(2) in group 5. Conclusion: In our population, macular vessel density appears to decrease noticeably from the fourth decade onwards but a statistically significant decrease was observed only from the fifth decade onwards. However, it was not uniform along with all the quadrants. Similarly, the percentage of perfusion density dropped from the fourth decade but these values also varied among the different quadrants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are strikingly high in India compared to Western countries and are increasing. Moreover, ASCVD events occur at a younger age with only modest hypercholesterolemia, most commonly with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The course of ASCVD also appears to be more fulminant with higher mortality.
   OBJECTIVE: In light of these issues, the Lipid Association of India (LAI) endeavored to develop revised guidelines with more aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals in secondary prevention and for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia compared to guidelines in the United States and other countries.
   METHODS: Owing to the paucity of clinical outcomes data in India, it was necessary to place major emphasis on expert opinion as a complement to randomized placebo-controlled data generated mostly in non-Indian cohorts. To facilitate this process, the LAI conducted a series of 19 meetings among 162 lipid specialists in 13 cities throughout India over a period of 11 months before formulating this expert consensus statement.
   RESULTS: The LAI recommends an LDL-C goal <50 mg/dL in all patients in secondary prevention or very high-risk primary prevention but proposes an optional goal <= 30 mg/dL in category A extreme-risk patients (eg, coronary artery disease + familial hypercholesterolemia) and a recommended goal <= 30 mg/dL in category B extreme-risk patients [coronary artery disease + (1) diabetes and polyvascular disease/>3 major ASCVD risk factors/end organ damage, or (2) recurrent acute coronary syndrome within 12 months despite LDL-C <50 mg/dL, or (3) homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia].
   CONCLUSIONS: More aggressive LDL-C goals are needed for prevention of ASCVD in India, as described in this expert consensus statement. Use of statins and ezetimibe needs to increase in India in combination with improved control of other ASCVD risk factors. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 inhibitors can improve LDL-C goal achievement in patients with refractory hypercholesterolemia.

KW  - MEDICAL-EDUCATION
AB  - Medical education in India is expected to undergo a significant reform after the introduction of the National Medical Commission Act. Single, nationwide National Exit Test (NEXT) is an essential provision under this act, which will be implemented during the next three years. It aims to bring about uniformity in the minimum standard of final MBBS examination, quality control in the licentiate examination and elimination of multiple entrance examinations for admission in postgraduate courses. Since the NEXT has multiple and varied objectives, we suggest a three-step scheme for the conduct of NEXT. Step I (Part A and B) will be equivalent to present-day first and second professional MBBS examinations and step II will act as the final professional MBBS and licentiate examination. Step III will form the basis for admission to the different PG courses. The written exam of Step I and II will consist of structured long, short and multiple choice type questions, whereas practical or clinical examination will consist of structured instruments with lesser inter-rater variability (viz., OSCE, OSPE, OSLER, etc.). This opinion piece is a result of in-depth discussions among major stakeholders such as MBBS students, resident doctors, and faculty of AIIMS, New Delhi. The suggested three-step plan is probably the most feasible way to ensure that the three modalities (final year MBBS, licentiate examination, and PG entrance competitive) are assessed in a valid, reliable, and acceptable manner. Due consideration is given to the fact that an assessment process has a significant impact on learning and teaching. The government may consider these suggestions while formulating the regulations of the NMC Act.

AB  - Introduction: Exposure to alcohol in popular movies during adolescence is associated with higher rates of alcohol use. We aimed to assess the extent and pattern of depiction of alcohol in Bollywood movies, and to analyze the trends in portrayal of alcohol over three decades selected for the study.
   Materials and Methods: We selected the top five grossing movies for each year of the three decades selected (1961-1970; 1981-1990; and 2001-2010). Content analysis was conducted for each scene depicting alcohol in the movie. We compared quantitative variables across the three decades to assess for any changes in the portrayal of alcohol and performed qualitative content analysis for the text description of the context, in which alcohol was depicted in each movie.
   Results: Of the total 150 movies analyzed, 135 (90%) movies contained at least one scene depicting alcohol. Alcohol scenes comprised 7% of the total movie time. Majority of the scenes (92.2%, n = 976) showed the substance (alcohol) itself. Spirits were the most common alcohol beverages depicted (75.1%, n = 733). Only 7.9% of scenes (n = 84) depicted alcohol brands. About 67% (n = 709) of scenes showed characters consuming alcohol or appeared intoxicated. Most scenes portrayed hero (n = 253, 35.7%) consuming alcohol. Female characters were depicted in 7.5% (n = 53) alcohol scenes. The third decade (2001-2010) had the least proportion of scenes depicting Spirits and the highest proportion of scenes depicting beer and wine. Decade three also had the most proportion of scenes set in clubs, bars, discotheques or restaurants, scenes with characters of "positive" shade depicting alcohol use, and the scenes portraying heroine with alcohol use.
   Conclusion: There is an increasing trend toward alcohol depiction by positive characters for fun and relaxation, and toward depiction of low-concentration alcohol such as beer in recent decades. The impact of changing trend of alcohol depiction on the Indian viewers, especially young audience, needs further study.

   Results: 168 studies were eligible, which included 51 case reports, 15 prospective studies, 102 retrospective studies. A total of 1977 patients (out of 6371) with HS were identified with age range between < 1year-94years. The most common diagnosis in the immunosuppressed, mixed, immunocompetent and not specified groups were IFI (86.9 %, n = 1194), Cryptococcosis (51.6 %, n = 124), Cryptococcosis (40 %, n = 20) and lung neoplasms (81.8 %, n = 36) respectively. 14 studies (11 retrospective, 3 prospective) were included in quantitative analysis. The pooled sensitivity(sn), specificity(sp) and odd's ratio (OR) of HS for diagnosing IFI were 50.4 %, 91 % and 6.61 respectively. Also, HS could not reliably differentiate IPA from mucormycosis in the pooled analysis.
   Conclusions: HS can be seen in a large number of diverse conditions both in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent population. In immunosuppressed patients HS is specific for IFI but cannot rule it out. Additionally, it cannot reliably distinguish between IPA and mucormycosis.

AB  - Goals: The aim of this study was to assess the use of thromboelastography (TEG)-directed blood product transfusion in cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding compared with conventional transfusion for correction of coagulopathy. Background: Coagulopathy is common in patients with cirrhosis. Recommendations for correction of conventional parameters of coagulation-platelets and the international normalized ratio before endoscopy in patients with acute variceal bleeding-need more validation. Study: In this randomized controlled trial, cirrhotic patients with severe coagulopathy and acute variceal bleeding were randomized to either TEG-guided blood product transfusion or conventional transfusion from March 2017 to December 2017. The primary outcome was the difference in the amount of fresh frozen plasma and platelet units transfused between the groups. Secondary outcomes were rebleeding at 5 days and 42 days, and 6-week mortality. Results: Of the 60 recruited patients, 30 each were randomized to the TEG and conventional transfusion groups. There were no differences in baseline characteristic and endoscopic findings between the 2 groups. Four subjects in the TEG group received blood product transfusions versus all in the conventional transfusion group (13.3% vs. 100%; P<0.001). The control of bleeding on initial endoscopy was similar in the 2 groups. Rebleeding in the TEG and conventional transfusion groups at 5 days was similar [1 (3.3%) vs. 4 (13.3%), P=0.167], whereas it was significantly less in the TEG group at 42 days [3 (10%) vs. 11 (36.7%), P=0.012]. Mortality at 6 weeks was seen in 4 (13.3%) in the TEG group and in 8 (26.7%) patients in the conventional transfusion group (P=0.176). Conclusions: TEG-guided strategy was associated with reduced blood product transfusion to correct coagulopathy without compromising hemostasis in cirrhotic patients (Clinical trial ID: CTRI/2017/02/007864).

AB  - Purpose
   Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and is exploited for imaging and treatment of patients with prostate cancer. Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression is also demonstrated in the tumor-associated neovasculature endothelium. Juvenile nasal angiofibroma (JNA), being a similar highly vascular tumor, may also demonstrate significant PSMA expression, which may be utilized for its imaging and treatment.
   Methods
   In this prospective study, 25 clinicoradiologically diagnosed primary JNA patients underwent PSMA PET/CT scan. The scan was performed after 45 to 60 minutes of intravenous injection of 2 to 3 mCi (74-111 MBq) of Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC on a dedicated PET/CT scanner. Low-dose CT scan was acquired from vertex to sternoclavicular joint (100 mA, 20 kVp, 3-mm slice thickness, 0.8 pitch). Images were reconstructed with iterative reconstruction technique (4 iterations, 24 subsets). The objective was to assess the intensity and pattern of PSMA uptake in primary JNA patients.
   Results
   All cases (n = 25) of primary JNA showed PSMA expression in the tumor (100%). The median PSMA SUVmax ratio of tumor to background was 4.57 (range, 2.08-7.27). Intracranial extension in 14 of 25 patients was prominently visualized because of absence of background uptake in the brain. Advanced stage tumors demonstrated greater uptake than early tumors (P = 0.011). A statistically nonsignificant trend was noted for decreasing uptake with increasing age after normalizing for stage (Spearman correlation coefficient r = -0.08).
   Conclusions
   Assessment of PSMA expression in JNA by PSMA PET/CT opens up a new window of opportunity with respect to its radiological staging, vascularity assessment, and molecular characterization. A potential role in identification of the difficult residual-recurrent disease is anticipated and perhaps also in radioligand therapy for residual/recurrent JNA.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance - Ocimum sanctum L. commonly known as tulsi (synonym of Ocimum tenuiflorum L.) is widely used in Ayurveda medicine and is having multitude neuromodulatory effect including the anticonvulsant effect in acute seizure models as per previous studies. In India, it is used for the treatment of epilepsy as traditional medicine. However, its role in chronic seizure model and interaction with newer antiepileptic drugs has not been investigated, which will enhance its translational value.
   Aim of the study: Current study investigated the effect of Ocimum on chronic seizure model and its interaction with levetiracetam (LEV), a newer antiepileptic drug.
   Materials and methods: The adjuvant role of Ocimum sanctum hydroalcoholic extracts (OSHE) 1000 mg/kg along with LEV 300 mg/kg was studied in adult male Wistar rats with mean weight of 227.84 +/- 21.68 g using pentylenetetrazole (30 mg/kg, i.p.) kindling (K) (with maximum 24 injections on alternate days and challenge on 7th-day). Along with seizure score, neurobehavioral, brain tissue oxidative stress and histopathology status were assessed. Pharmacokinetic interaction was assessed between LEV and OSHE after 14 days of drug treatment.
   Results: K-LEV + OSHE had least seizure score during kindling and on the pentylenetetrazole-challenge test (p = 0.031) than other kindling groups. Seizure protection was more in K-LEV + OSHE (85.72%) than others (K-LEV-42.86%, K-OSHE-42.86%, and K-Control-28.58%). Ocimum treated groups had better memory retention potential as evident from Morris water maze (MWM), passive avoidance test but not in an elevated plus maze test. Oxidative-stress was lower in Ocimum treated groups than K-Control group. As per histopathology, KLEV + OSHE group had the least neuronal degeneration among kindling groups. There was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between LEV and OSHE, except increased T-max in LEV + OSHE group than LEV alone (p =0.009).
   Conclusions: Ocimum per se and combination with levetiracetam treatment exerted better seizure control, memory retention, oxidative stress reduction, and neuronal structure preservation than kindling control group. There was a very minimal drug interaction between Ocimum and LEV. So, Ocimum as an adjuvant to LEV may be shelpful in enhancing the antiepileptic effect and also in minimizing the adverse effects.

AB  - Background and Aims: Although cannabis is the most common illicit substance of use in India, it is often not the presenting complaint of patients with substance use disorders. The present study aimed to understand the profile of cannabis use disorders among patients at a substance abuse treatment facility in an Indian tertiary care center.
   Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional interview-based study which assessed adult patients with substance use disorders who had a history of cannabis use in the recent past. Participants were evaluated for cannabis use disorder as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) and cannabis dependence as per the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). They were assessed for cannabis withdrawal, and treatment-seeking behavior about cannabis use was explored.
   Results: Among the 100 male participants in the study, the use of smoked form (charas, ganja, sulfa) was more common than oral form (bhang). Fifty-eight patients fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria of dependence, whereas 74 patients fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria of cannabis use disorder. Tolerance, craving, and withdrawal were the most common clinical features. Only 7 patients ever sought help for quitting cannabis, whereas 28 patients thought that generally treatment is required for quitting cannabis.
   Conclusion: More cannabis users seem to fulfill a diagnosis of cannabis use disorder as per DSM5 than cannabis dependence as per ICD-10. Treatment seeking for cannabis use disorders seems to be low among the substance using patients. Clinicians need to focus on cannabis use as well when they treat patients with substance use disorders.

AB  - Background: Qualitative studies on students' perspectives about stress in medical education are sparse but nonetheless potentially relevant.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to assess the proportion of students who considered medical education to be excessively stressful and to elicit students' perspectives about ways to reduce stress in medical education.
   Materials and Methods: All medical undergraduate students of the college were asked about various aspects of stress in medical training using a self-rated questionnaire. Qualitative answers about the ways of reducing stress were also obtained using the questionnaire.
   Results: Medical education was considered to be excessively stressful by 265 (55.1%) students. The most common themes expressed for reducing the stress of medical education included those of "less frequent exams," "more spare time," and "slowing the pace of study or reducing syllabuses."
   Conclusion: Majority of students considered medical training to be stressful and curricular overload is an important reason for the same.

AB  - Background and Objective: The main aim of this work is to present an optimal and robust controller design in order to improve the drug infusion to the automatic control of mean arterial blood pressure in conditions like critically-ill or post-operative or anaesthesia administration. The physiological systems also have uncertainty issues such as parameter variations with time or external disturbances and noise. Therefore, a controlled drug administration is necessary to regulate the mean arterial blood pressure of a person during surgery/observation. Over the years, the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is the most commonly used controller in industries due to its easy structure and simplicity. However, this controller does not meet the desired performance with the complex and uncertain plants. Therefore, a robust controller is required to regulate the physiological variables that are uncertain in nature and can affect the human life.
   Methods: In this work, a hybrid control scheme consisting of an interval type-2-fuzzy logic controller which acts as pre-compensator to the traditional PID controller is presented, to regulate the mean arterial blood pressure of a patient by administering the drug sodium nitroprusside in a controlled manner. An effective and well-established nature-inspired optimization technique namely cuckoo search algorithm is employed for obtaining the optimal parameters for the presented scheme.
   Results: Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness and robustness of proposed interval type-2-fuzzy logic controller based PID controller scheme, for maintaining the mean arterial pressure to 100 mmHg within considerable limit through SNP infusion. The results are further compared with other two controllers namely type-1 fuzzy logic based PID and traditional PID controllers for the parameter variations and external noise.
   Conclusion: In this study, the proposed interval type-2-fuzzy logic controller pre-compensator based PID controller provides an effective control than traditional type-1 fuzzy logic based control scheme and PID controller in terms of overshoot, settling-time and error which are the prime performance objectives of the closed-loop controlled drug delivery of human blood pressure. The presented study provides a firm base for initial design considerations for development of a low-cost closed-loop drug delivery system for blood pressure regulation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Antioxidants (AO) supplementation in chronic pancreatitis (CP) has been evaluated for pain. But it is not clear whether AO in CP have an effect on pancreatic functions and other clinical outcomes. We evaluated effect of AO on endocrine function in CP. Materials and Methods: Double-blind placebo (PL)-controlled randomized pilot study on 107 patients with CP assigned to receive daily combined AO or PL for 6 months. Primary outcome was: improvement in endocrine function (Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance). Secondary outcome measures were: improvement in C-peptide, Qualitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index, exocrine pancreatic function (fecal elastase), surrogate markers of fibrosis (platelet-derived growth factor BB, transforming growth factor-beta 1, alpha-smooth muscle actin), quality of life (QOL), pain, nutritional status, markers of oxidative stress (OS), AO status, and inflammation. Results: There was an increase in levels of serum selenium (107.2 +/- 26.9 to 109.7 +/- 26.9 vs. 104.1 +/- 28.6 to 124.0 +/- 33.6 mu g/L, P=0.022) and serum vitamin E [0.58 (range, 0.27-3.22) to 0.66 (range, 0.34-1.98) vs. 0.63 (range, 0.28-1.73) to 1.09 (range, 0.25-2.91) mg/dL, P=0.001] in the AO than the PL group. However, no significant differences were observed between groups in any of the primary or secondary outcome measures. Conclusions: Supplementation with AO to patients with CP causes a sustained increase in blood levels of AO; however, it has no addition benefit over PL on endocrine and exocrine functions, markers of fibrosis, OS and inflammation, nutritional status, pain and QOL. Further larger studies with adequate sample size are required.

AB  - Background: Spinal hemangiopericytoma is very rare tumors with only a few case reports and one case series. We have treated ten patients between 2004 and 2017 and, thus, present a retrospective review of our patients with a focus on clinical presentation, radiological features, management, pathology, and outcome.
   Materials and Methods: Histopathological data were reviewed in all the cases and clinical and follow-up details were collected from data available in our department.
   Results: There were five males and five females, including one pediatric patient. The mean age of the patients was 34.7 years (Range 12-52 years). Dorsal, cervical. and lumbar spine involvement were found in five, four, and one patient, respectively. Intradural extramedullary tumor was the most common tumor and all patients presented motor weaknesses. Gross total resection of the tumor was done in seven patients and six patients received postoperative radiotherapy. Histopathology showed anaplastic tumor in two cases with high MIB-1 labelling index. Most patients were positive for CD34, vimentin, mic-2, and bcl-2. While the seven patients who underwent gross total resection improved significantly and were self -ambulatory in the follow-up period, two patients who underwent subtotal resection expired due to tumor metastasis.
   Conclusion: Spinal hemangiopericytoma is a very rare tumor. We present a series of cases treated at our institute for the same. Gross total resection is the goal and radiotherapy should be given in case of residual tumor or high-grade tumors. Prognosis is good after gross total excision and functional recovery can be expected in most patients.

AB  - Imaging of the coronary sinus and its tributaries has gained increasing significance consequent to the development of an array of electrophysiological and interventional procedures using the cardiac venous system, including ablation for arrhythmias, left ventricular pacing, and in the administration of retrograde cardioplegia. Knowledge of the normal anatomy and the possible anomalies and their clinical significance is imperative to circumvent possible complications. A number of coronary sinus (CS) anomalies, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, have been observed with the widespread use of noninvasive cross-sectional imaging for the imaging of the heart. However, it should be kept in mind that even clinically occult lesions of the CS can cause disastrous complications in specific interventions. Hence, a thorough knowledge of the expected anatomy and the possible anomalies involving the CS along with their clinical significance is imperative for the reporting radiologists and the concerned physicians. In this review, we briefly describe the relevant anatomy and embryology and describe the gamut of anomalies pertaining to the CS and its draining veins on multidetector computed tomography angiography along with their clinical importance.

AB  - Legionnaires' disease (LD) is an established cause of pneumonia, and the disease remains largely underdiagnosed. Even though LD has been reported from many parts of the world, only sporadic cases have been reported in India. During February 2015-January 2020, we enrolled 597 patients with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and tested respiratory secretions for Legionella spp. by using real-time PCR, and culture. A commercial urinary antigen test (UAT) was also used to detect the Legionella pneumophila (Lp) serogroup 1 antigen in urine. An LD case was defined as a patient with pneumonia and positive results for Legionella spp. infections determined by real-time PCR (from any respiratory specimen) or culture or UAT. Demographic data, risk factors, clinical, radiological, and outcome data of Lppositive and Lp-negative patients were compared using logistic regression. Over the study period, 14 (2.3%) patients were positive for Legionella spp. infections by real-time PCR and UAT; eight (57%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and four (28.6%) in-hospital deaths occurred. Bivariate analysis showed that renal disease, neurological conditions, confusion, leukocytosis, and requirement of oxygen support were more common in the Lp-positive group than in the Lpnegative group. However, multivariate analysis failed to confirm most of these differences; renal disease was the only independent variable remaining significant. All test methods have intrinsic limitations in identifying Legionella; therefore, more than one testing method should be used. Application of molecular assays including real-time PCR has great value because of its high sensitivity, specificity, and rapid diagnostic potency. Increased awareness and improved diagnostic testing could facilitate early detection of cases, pathogen-directed therapy, and improved outcomes for patients.

AB  - Purpose The quantitative analysis of weight-bearing articular cartilage superficial to subchondral abnormality is important in osteoarthritis (OA) progression studies. The current study aimed to address the challenges of a semi-automatic segmentation of tibiofemoral cartilage in MR images of OA patient with and without subchondral bone abnormalities (SBA). Methods In this study, knee MRI data [fat-suppressed proton density-weighted, multi-echo T2-weighted (CartiGram) images] of 29 OA patients, acquired at 3.0T MR scanner, were retrospectively collected. Out of 29 data, 9 had SBA in femur bone. Initially, a semi-automatic femur cartilage segmentation based on radial intensity search approach by Akhtar et al. was implemented in-house. This algorithm was considered as the radial-search method for further comparison. In this current study, the reported radial-search (RS)-based semi-automatic cartilage segmentation method was modified using thresholding, connected component labelling, convex-hull operation and spline-based curve fitting for the improved segmentation of tibiofemoral cartilage. Cartilage was manually segmented by two experienced radiologists, and inter-reader variability was estimated using coefficient of variation (CV). The segmentation results were validated using dice coefficient (DC), Jaccard coefficient (JC) and sensitivity index measurements. Results DC values for segmented femur cartilage in patients with SBA were 64.6 +/- 7.8% and 81.4 +/- 2.8% using reported RS method and modified radial-search method, respectively. DC values for segmented femur cartilage in patients without SBA were 82.5 +/- 4.5% and 84.8 +/- 2.0% using RS method and modified radial method, respectively. Similarly, DC values for tibial cartilage in all OA patients were 80.4 +/- 1.6% and 81.9 +/- 2.4% using RS method and modified radial method, respectively. Similar segmentation results were also obtained from the T2-weighted images. Inter-reader variability result based on CV in femur cartilage was 3.40 +/- 2.12% (without SBA) and 4.18 +/- 3.18% (with SBA). Conclusion In the current study, a semi-automated segmentation of tibiofemoral cartilage was presented. Modified radial-search approach can successfully segment tibiofemoral cartilage, and the results were tested and validated on knee MRI data of OA patients with and without SBA.

AB  - To improve tuberculosis (TB) care among individuals attending a private tertiary care hospital in Vietnam, an innovative private sector engagement model was implemented from June to December 2018. This included: (i) Active facility-based screening of all adults for TB symptoms (and chest x-ray (CXR) for those with symptoms) by trained and incentivized providers, with on-site diagnostic testing or transport of sputum samples, (ii) a mobile application to reduce dropout in the care cascade and (iii) enhanced follow-up care by community health workers. We conducted a cohort study using project and routine surveillance data for evaluation. Among 52,078 attendees, 368 (0.7%) had symptoms suggestive of TB and abnormalities on CXR. Among them, 299 (81%) were tested and 103 (34.4%) were diagnosed with TB. In addition, 195 individuals with normal CXR were indicated for TB testing by attending clinicians, of whom, seven were diagnosed with TB. Of the 110 TB patients diagnosed, 104 (95%) were initiated on treatment and 97 (93%) had a successful treatment outcome. Given the success of this model, the National TB Programme is considering to scale it up nationwide after undertaking a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the rates of sleep disturbances in male patients with opioid dependence maintained on buprenorphine and to assess the factors associated with sleep disturbances in this population. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional study. Male patients with opioid dependence aged 18 years and older, and started on buprenorphine at least 6 months before were screened. Those with history of comorbid psychiatric illnesses (except sleep disorders), on any other substance in high-risk category (based on WHO-Alcohol Smoking Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST)), or on any other psychotropic medications (in addition to OAT with buprenorphine) were excluded. Sleep was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Sleep-50, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Each participant was interviewed in a single session lasting 60 minutes. Results: One hundred six participants were included. Their mean age was 41.1 (SD 14.3) years. The participants had been on OAT with buprenorphine for a median duration of 60 months (IQR 17-120), with excellent adherence rate in past 1 month. The mean current dose of buprenorphine was 10.2 (SD 3.8) mg per day. The mean subjective total sleep time was 403.5 minutes (SD 94.8) and the median sleep latency was 35 minutes (IQR 18.8-62.5). The mean PSQI score was 6.6 (SD 3.4). Nearly 63% (n = 67) participants had PSQI scores more than 5 (PSQI > 5) suggesting sleep problems. Sociodemographic, substance use, and treatment variables were compared between participants who scored more than 5 and those who scored less than 5 on PSQI. No significant difference was found between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Substantial proportion of male patients with opioid dependence maintained on buprenorphine have sleep problems. The sleep problems in buprenorphine-maintained patients seem to be independent of substance use and treatment-related attributes.

AB  - Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved process and is important for rest and recovery of various biological functions. Sleep and alertness alterations, function as contributing/modulatory factors in initiating and maintaining drug and alcohol abuse and as factors that increase the risk for relapse. Opioid dependent individuals frequently complain of sleep problems during withdrawal and abstinence. Sleep disturbances are seen even among patients on opioid substitution therapy (OST). The aim of this review is to present an overview of sleep problems in opioid dependent patients and to delineate factors associated with sleep disturbance. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a relatively common comorbidity that has been shown to adversely affect outcomes in total hip arthroplasty (THA), as well as to increase the procedure's total costs. However, the effect of different stages of kidney disease and the association of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) with perioperative THA complications are less understood. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate the relationships between eGFR, both as a categorical and continuous variable and 30-day outcomes and complications.
   Methods: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify 101,925 primary THAs between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2016. The following outcomes were assessed: 30-day mortality, 30-day major complications, 30-day minor complications, specific complications, and discharge disposition. To evaluate the effect of eGFR status on outcomes and complication, multivariate regression models were created to adjust for differences in patient demographics and comorbidities. In addition, multivariate spline regressions were developed to assess the nonlinear relationships between eGFR as a continuous variable and the outcomes of interest.
   Results: Our study revealed that as eGFR decreases to <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), there is an increased risk for mortality and nonhome discharge (P < .05). There was an increased risk for any major complication and any minor complication as well as several specific medical complications such as transfusion and myocardial infarction (P < .05) for an eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Patients' eGFR had a nonlinear relationship with mortality (P = .0001), any major complication (P < .001), and any minor complication (P < .001), as well as a number of other specific medical complications. Once the eGFR, <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) the increase was exponential for mortality, major complications, and minor complications. For example, mortality increased of 900% for <15 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or on dialysis, 600% for 15 to 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2) and 50% for 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). Similarly, nonlinear relationships were discovered between eGFR and nonhome discharge (P < .001).
   Conclusion: Patients with lower eGFR, and in particular those with <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), are more likely to sustain medical complications and have 6 to 9 times higher mortality than patients with normal eGFR. THA patients with CKD should be appropriately counseled and advised on the risk of postoperative complications by using eGFR as a screening tool. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Health system planning requires careful assessment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) epidemiology, but data for morbidity and mortality of this disease are scarce or non-existent in many countries. We estimated the global, regional, and national burden of CKD, as well as the burden of cardiovascular disease and gout attributable to impaired kidney function, for the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017. We use the term CKD to refer to the morbidity and mortality that can be directly attributed to all stages of CKD, and we use the term impaired kidney function to refer to the additional risk of CKD from cardiovascular disease and gout.
   Methods The main data sources we used were published literature, vital registration systems, end-stage kidney disease registries, and household surveys. Estimates of CKD burden were produced using a Cause of Death Ensemble model and a Bayesian meta-regression analytical tool, and induded incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability, mortality, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). A comparative risk assessment approach was used to estimate the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and gout burden attributable to impaired kidney function.
   Findings Globally, in 2017,1.2 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1.2 to 1.3) people died from CKD. The global all-age mortality rate from CKD increased 41.5% (95% UI 35.2 to 46.5) between 1990 and 2017, although there was no significant change in the age-standardised mortality rate (2.8%, -1.5 to 6.3). In 2017,697.5 million (95% UI 649.2 to 752.0) cases of all-stage CKD were recorded, for a global prevalence of 9.1% (8.5 to 9.8). The global all-age prevalence of CKD increased 29.3% (95% UI 26.4 to 32.6) since 1990, whereas the age-standardised prevalence remained stable (1.2%, -1.1 to 3.5). CKD resulted in 35.8 million (95% UI 33.7 to 38.0) DALYs in 2017, with diabetic nephropathy accounting for almost a third of DALYs. Most of the burden of CKD was concentrated in the three lowest quintiles of Socio-demographic Index (SDI). In several regions, particularly Oceania, sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America, the burden of CKD was much higher than expected for the level of development, whereas the disease burden in western, eastern, and central sub-Saharan Africa, east Asia, south Asia, central and eastern Europe, Australasia, and western Europe was lower than expected. 1.4 million (95% UI 1.2 to 1.6) cardiovascular disease-related deaths and 25.3 million (22.2 to 28.9) cardiovascular disease DALYs were attributable to impaired kidney function.
   Interpretation Kidney disease has a major effect on global health, both as a direct cause of global morbidity and mortality and as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. CKD is largely preventable and treatable and deserves greater attention in global health policy decision making, particularly in locations with low and middle SDI. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The human gut microbiota comprises of a complex and diverse array of microorganisms, and over the years the interaction between human diseases and the gut microbiota has become a subject of growing interest. Disturbed microbial milieu in the gastrointestinal tract is central to the pathogenesis of several diseases including antibiotic-associated diarrhea and Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Manipulation of this microbial milieu to restore balance by microbial replacement therapies has proven to be a safe and effective treatment for recurrent CDI. There is considerable heterogeneity in various aspects of stool processing and administration for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) across different centers globally, and standardized microbioal replacement therapies offer an attractive alternative. The adverse effects associated with FMT are usually mild. However, there is paucity of data on long term safety of FMT and there is a need for further studies in this regard. With our increasing understanding of the host-microbiome interaction, there is immense potential for microbial replacement therapies to emerge as a treatment option for several diseases. The role of microbioal replacement therapies in diseases other than CDI is being extensively studied in ongoing clinical trials and it may be a potential treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, multidrug resistant infections, and neuropsychiatric illnesses. Fecal microbiota transplantation for non-CDI disease states should currently be limited only to research settings.

AB  - Purpose Infectious diseases that often follow geographical distribution patterns are increasingly crossing such boundaries, aided by human travel and commerce. These pose a new challenge to physicians who are required to diagnose previously unseen conditions and address drug-resistant organisms. We review some such common infections. Methods A literature review was performed for six common urological infections and a narrative review based on recent publications on these infections was compiled. Results In Urology, some infections that are now crossing geographical boundaries include Brucellosis, Schistosomiasis, Tuberculosis, Filariasis, Hydatidosis and emphysematous pyelonephritis. Brucellosis, a zoonotic infection, is common in the Mediterranean areas, Asia, South America and Africa. Infection can involve all parts of the genitourinary tract. Schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, is particularly common in Sub-Saharan Africa and may have bacterial superinfection. Voiding symptoms are common and bladder carcinoma may develop. Tuberculosis affects almost every organ in the body and in the male genital system, often presents with abscesses, nodules, ulcers and infertility that is difficult to manage. Filariasis is caused by two species of worms and is transmitted through a bite from a mosquito carrying larvae of the worm. It causes lymphatic obstruction leading to scrotal edema, hydrocoele to elephantiasis of scrotum. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is a life-threatening suppurative necrotizing infection of the renal parenchyma. While not being geographically limited, it is more common in developing areas with poor health care access. Genitourinary hydatidosis is a rare disease that is associated mainly with renal involvement in the genitourinary tract. Large cysts with destruction of renal parenchyma may be found. Conclusions Although uncommon, these urological infections are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and awareness in all healthcare settings is now an essential requirement.

TI  - Urethral Instillation of Povidone-Iodine Reduces Post-Cystoscopy Urinary Tract Infection in Males: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
KW  - BACTERIOLOGY
KW  - BLADDER
AB  - Office cystoscopy may be associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in up to 10-20% of patients. Current practice of surgical part preparation in males with povidone-iodine excludes distal urethra in males, leaving a possibility for resident intra-urethral flora to cause post-procedural UTI. We designed this randomized study to assess whether additional cleaning of distal urethra with povidone-iodine solution can help reduce post-procedural incidence of UTIs in this setting. Additionally, urethral swab culture was done in the entire cohort to identify the prevalent microflora in the distal male urethra and to evaluate its role in causation of post-procedural UTI. Using a specialized urethral swab culture methodology, 85% males demonstrated some bacteria and 16% showed common uro-pathogens. 28 (14.5%) cases had post-procedure culture positive UTI. The incidence of UTI in control group (22%) was significantly more than the intervention group (7%) (p value <0.007). This result strongly supports inclusion of distal urethral irrigation with povidone-iodine in males before office cystoscopy, even when pre-procedure mid-stream urine culture is sterile.

AB  - To the Editor: Kopetz et al. (Oct. 24 issue)(1) found an overall survival benefit of triplet therapy (encorafenib, binimetinib, and cetuximab) as compared with control therapy (cetuximab with either irinotecan or FOLFIRI [folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan]) among patients with BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer. The trial also included a third group that received doublet therapy (encorafenib and cetuximab). Although the trial was not powered to compare the triplet-therapy group with the doublet-therapy group, a number of observations favor the doublet-therapy group. First, among more than 200 patients in each group, the median progression-free survival was similar in the doublet-therapy group and . . .

AB  - Purpose The goal of this study is to identify the pathological findings and expression of immune checkpoint marker (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) in the tumor microenvironment of both primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma and correlate them with clinicopathological parameters and patient outcome. Methods Total of 262 prospective cases was included prospectively in which 144 cases underwent primary enucleation and 118 cases received chemotherapy/radiotherapy before enucleation (chemoreduced retinoblastoma). Immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to evaluate the expression pattern of immune checkpoint markers in primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma. Results Tumor microenvironment were different for both primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma. Expression of PD-1 was found in 29/144 (20.13%) and 48/118 (40.67%) in primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma, respectively, whereas PD-L1 was expressed in 46/144 (31.94%) and 22/118 (18.64%) in cases of primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma, respectively. Expression pattern of CTLA-4 protein was similar in both groups of retinoblastoma. On multivariate analysis, massive choroidal invasion, bilaterality and PD-L1 expression (p = 0.034) were found to be statistically significant factors in primary retinoblastoma, whereas PD-1 expression (p = 0.015) and foamy macrophages were significant factors in chemoreduced retinoblastoma. Overall survival was reduced in cases of PD-L1 (80.76%) expressed primary retinoblastoma, and PD-1 (63.28%) expressed chemoreduced retinoblastoma. Conclusions This is the first of its kind study predicting a relevant role of the immune checkpoint markers in both groups of primary and chemoreduced retinoblastoma with prognostic significance. Differential expression of these markers in both group of retinoblastoma is a novel finding and might be an interesting and beneficial target for chemoresistant tumors.

Background To study the impact of bariatric surgery in women with PCOS in terms of clinical, hormonal, and radiological aspects of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Methods A prospective observational study of 50 women who underwent bariatric surgery at our tertiary care center. Evaluation of anthropometric data and menstrual cyclicity as well as markers of hyperandrogenism was done preoperatively and at 3- and 6-month and 1-year follow-up. Results Eighteen (36%) women were diagnosed to have PCOS. % EWL at 3-months (n = 14), 6-month (n = 14), and 1-year (n = 11) follow-up was 31%, 49%, and 63% respectively among women with PCOS. All females regained their normal menstrual cycle at 3 months of follow-up. Hirsutism resolved completely among 44% (5/11) with a decline in median hirsutism score from 11 to 9 at 1-year follow-up. Mean serum testosterone decreased from 0.83 +/- 0.38 ng/ml preoperatively to 0.421 +/- 0.25 ng/ml at 1-year follow-up (p < 0.01), whereas changes in levels of serum LH and FSH were not significant. Seventy-seven percent of females (14/18) had polycystic ovaries preoperatively on USG; out of which, 55% (i.e., 4/7) showed complete resolution at 1-year follow-up. Metabolic syndrome resolved completely at 1-year follow-up in both PCOS and non PCOS group. Conclusions Bariatric surgery results in an effective and sustained weight loss with improvement in clinical, hormonal, and radiological parameters associated with PCOS.

AB  - Objective Histopathological examination (HPE) is the current gold standard for assessing chemotherapy response to tumor, but it is possible only after surgery. The purpose of the study was to develop a noninvasive, imaging-based robust method to delineate, visualize, and quantify the proportions of necrosis and viable tissue present within the tumor along with peritumoral edema before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and to evaluate treatment response with correlation to HPE necrosis after surgery. Methods The MRI dataset of 30 patients (N = 30; male:female = 24:6; age = 17.6 +/- 2.7 years) with osteosarcoma was acquired using 1.5 T Philips Achieva MRI scanner before (baseline) and after 3 cycles of NACT (follow-up). After NACT, all patients underwent surgical resection followed by HPE. Simple linear iterative clustering supervoxels and Otsu multithresholding were combined to develop the proposed method-SLICs+MTh-to subsegment and quantify viable and nonviable regions within tumor using multiparametric MRI. Manually drawn ground-truth ROIs and SLICs+MTh-based segmentation of tumor, edema, and necrosis were compared using Jacquard index (JI), Dice coefficient (DC), precision (P), and recall (R). Postcontrast T1W images (PC-T1W) were used to validate the SLICs+MTh-based necrosis. SLICs+MTh-based necrosis volume at follow-up was compared with HPE necrosis using paired t test (p <= 0.05). Results Active tumor, necrosis, and edema were segmented with moderate to satisfactory accuracy (JI = 62-78%; DC = 72-87%; P = 67-87%; R = 63-88%). Qualitatively and quantitatively (DC = 74 +/- 9%), the SLICs+MTh-based necrosis area correlated well with the hypointense necrosis areas in PC-T1W. No significant difference (paired t test, p = 0.26; Bland-Altman plot, bias = 2.47) between SLICs+MTh-based necrosis at follow-up and HPE necrosis was observed. Conclusion The proposed multiparametric MRI-based SLICs+MTh method performs noninvasive assessment of NACT response in osteosarcoma that may improve cancer treatment monitoring, planning, and overall prognosis.

AB  - The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is one of the effector pathways for circadian variation of many physiological parameters. Autonomic tone and airways caliber have been reported to exhibit circadian variation in separate studies. A simultaneous investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) and airway caliber might ascertain how airway caliber is modulated by autonomic tone. This study was planned to identify the variations in airway caliber and autonomic function tone during a 24-hour span. A total of 56 healthy male subjects with almost similar daily routines were studied. Time domain, frequency domain and nonlinear analysis of R-R interval from 5 min electrocardiogram (ECG) was done seven times during the daytime wake span at 3-hour intervals starting at 05:00 h in the morning until 23:00 h in the night. Simultaneously peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was determined using a mini Wright's peak flow meter. Rhythmometric analysis was done for PEFR and HRV parameters. Significant circadian variation in low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) variance was identified in this group of healthy subjects. The circadian rhythm of LF variance was characterized by a gradual increase and corresponding reciprocal change in HF variance from morning until night. The LF/HF ratio and SD2/SD1 ratio reflecting sympatho-vagal balance showed low to high values from morning to evening. The acrophase of the PEFR temporal pattern is similar to that of LF power and almost opposite in phase to that of HF power. PEFR is positively correlated with LF power. The circadian rhythm of airway caliber co-varies with cardiac autonomic tone. It appears that the temporal pattern of cardiac autonomic tone precedes in time that of airways caliber, thereby suggesting the latter operates under the modulatory effect of the 24-hour pattern in sympatho-vagal balance.

AB  - Objective To quantify and compare palatal volume of operated unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) and bilateral cleft lip and palate (BCLP) subjects.
   Setting and sample population This cross-sectional study was conducted on 85 study models comprising of 40 operated UCLP subjects (UG; mean age 10.33 +/- 1.76 years), 25 operated BCLP subjects (BG; mean age 10.44 +/- 1.92 years) and 20 non-cleft controls (C; mean age 12.90 +/- 1.68 years).
   Materials and method The study models were scanned using 3D scanner and palatal volume assessment done using 3-matic software. Kruskal-Wallis test for palatal volume and one-way ANOVA for intercanine (IC), interpremolar (IPM) and intermolar (IM) width comparison were used. Pearson correlation was done between IM, IPM, and IC width, and palatal volume for three groups. The control group sample was evaluated by two observers to evaluate the interobserver reliability.
   Results The median palatal volume of C, UG and BG groups was 5814.31 mm(3), 2452.34 mm(3) and 1688.39 mm(3), respectively. Significantly smaller palatal volume was found in UG and BG compared to control. Significant difference was seen in IC width between three groups. The IM, IPM and IC width with palatal volume in UG and IM width with palatal volume in BG group showed significant correlation. The ICC showed excellent agreement (>0.9) between observers.
   Conclusion Palatal volume of UG and BG groups was smaller by 57.82% and 71.1%, respectively, compared to controls. Improving IPM width in UG and IM width in BG seems to have more impact in correction of palatal volume.

AB  - Genome wide association study for type 2 diabetes discovered TMEM163 as a risk locus. Perturbations in TMEM163 expression was reported to be associated with impaired intracellular zinc homeostasis. Physiological concentration of zinc is instrumental to maintain insulin storage and functionality in pancreatic beta cells. We found abundant TMEM163 expression in human pancreas, both at transcriptional and translational levels. Knockdown of endogenous Tmem163 in MIN6 cells resulted in increased intracellular zinc and total insulin content, coupled with compromised insulin secretion at high glucose stimuli. Furthermore, Tmem163 knockdown led to enhanced cellular glucose uptake. Upon next generation sequencing, one-third of the studied T2D patients were found to have a novel missense variant in TMEM163 gene. Study participants harboring this missense variant displayed a trend of higher glycemic indices. This is the first report on exploring the biological role of TMEM163 in relation to T2D pathophysiology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cranioplasty is a common neurosurgical procedure which makes use of autologous bone or alloplastic material for cranial defect reconstruction. Alloplastic reconstruction is routinely done in cases where viable autologous bone is not available due to various reasons. Hydroxyapatite implants, patient-specific titanium and PEEK are widely employed materials due to their biocompatibility, durability, and high adaptation accuracy. However, their high cost and limited availability make them a less viable option for the common man. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is one of the commonly used alloplastic material for cranioplasty. This note presents a novel, economic, patient-specific, 3D printing-assisted and heat polymerized PMMA cranioplast fabrication technique with an accuracy comparable to that of patient-specific titanium and PEEK cranioplast.

AB  - Introduction Recently, prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapies (PIRRT) have emerged as cost-effective alternatives to conventional CRRT and their use in the pediatric population has started to become more prominent. However, there is a lack of consensus guidelines on the use of PIRRT in pediatric patients in an intensive care setting.
   Methods A literature search was performed on PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Google Scholar in conjunction with medical librarians from both India and the Cleveland Clinic hospital system to find relevant articles. The Pediatric Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy workgroup analyzed all articles for relevancy, proposed recommendations, and graded each recommendation for their strength of evidence.
   Results Of the 60 studies eligible for review, the workgroup considered data from 37 studies to formulate guidelines for the use of PIRRT in children. The guidelines focused on the definition, indications, machines, and prescription of PIRRT.
   Conclusion Although the literature on the use of PIRRT in children is limited, the current studies give credence to their benefits and these expert recommendations are a valuable first step in the continued study of PIRRT in the pediatric population.

AB  - Objectives To highlight different patterns of clinical presentation, share authors' experience in the management of children following button battery ingestion and their outcomes. Methods This is a single center descriptive cohort study with a total duration of 5 y (January 2014 through December 2018). Battery removal was performed by urgent rigid esophagoscopy following department protocols. Outcomes and complications were observed in the post-operative period in all children. Contrast esophagogram was performed at 4-6 wk post battery removal for assessing esophageal emptying and detecting sequelae (stricture). Results Fifty-two children (M:F = 31:21) with a mean age (+SD) at presentation of 47 (+27) mo were managed at authors' center during the study period. Most common source of button battery was electronic appliance remote (50%) and common symptoms at presentation were vomiting after feeds, dysphagia, chest pain etc. During endoscopic retrieval, majority (60%) of the batteries were lodged in the upper esophagus and predominant impaction was noticed at anterior wall (81%) of esophagus. Upon injury assessment, grade 3 followed by grade 2 were detected in 59% and 41% cases respectively. Five children developed complications. Two deaths due to catastrophic hemorrhage (aorto-esophageal fistula) and refractory sepsis (tracheoesophageal fistula) occurred in present cohort. While contrast esophagogram was normal in all survivors, self-limiting symptoms like mild chest pain during swallowing and cough were observed during the follow-up. Median (IQR) duration of hospital stay and follow-up were 2 d (1-2.75) and 14.5 mo (8.5-17.5) respectively. Conclusions Accidental button battery ingestion can be life-threatening. Diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific clinical presentation and unwitnessed ingestions. Esophagoscopic retrieval is the treatment modality of choice. Despite having significant esophageal injury at the time of removal, no long-term sequelae (clinical or radiological) were observed in present study.

AB  - We performed an independent comparison of neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibody (ab) levels seven months after initiation of three-dose, six-month vaccination schedules with the bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in adolescent Finnish and Indian females, respectively. We used a semi-automated Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay and observed significantly higher HPV16/18 peak ab-levels in bivalent as compared to quadrivalent vaccine recipients. Bivalent vaccine induced cross-neutralizing HPV31/33/45/52/58 antibodies significantly more frequently and to higher levels than the quadrivalent vaccine. The correlation of bivalent vaccine-induced HPV45 ab-levels with HPV16/18 ab-levels was stronger than that of corresponding quadrivalent vaccine-induced ab-levels, suggesting a qualitatively different cross-reactive response. Our findings on the comparison of the immunogenicity of two HPV vaccine tested in two different populations indicate that further head-to-head studies are warranted.

AB  - Objective To evaluate mortality and short-term morbidities in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (<1000 g) in a birth cohort in North India. Methods In-hospital data of 231 ELBW infants (Jan 2013 to Sept 2018) were collected from a prospectively maintained electronic database by using standard definitions. Results The mean (SD) gestation and birth weight were 27.9 (2.2) weeks and 783 (133) g, respectively. Major morbidities included respiratory distress syndrome (n = 132, 57%), moderate-to-severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (n = 62, 26.8%), hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (n = 65, 28%), intracranial hemorrhage >= grade II (n = 38, 16%), and culture-positive sepsis (n = 44, 19%). Median (IQR) duration of hospital stay (survivors) was 50 (17-79) days. The overall survival was 62%. On logistic regression, severe birth asphyxia, gestation <= 26 weeks, and respiratory distress syndrome were major predictors of mortality. Conclusion In the current ELBW cohort, nearly two-thirds survived until discharge, who had considerable morbidities needing prolonged hospital stay. This study can be utilized for counseling and planning of care of ELBW infants in similar settings.

AB  - Schizophrenia, a serious psychological disorder, causes auditory and visual hallucinations, and delusions in a person. Several studies have shown that schizophrenia imposes structural changes in human brain. Relative changes in the grey matter volume of the schizophrenia patients in comparison to healthy controls have been well explored. However, identification of relevant brain regions that exhibit grey matter atrophy and also aid in the classification of schizophrenic patients and healthy controls has not been extensively investigated. In this study, a novel application of the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm has been developed to select a set of relevant features (voxels) that show grey matter changes in the brain regions attributable to schizophrenia. This study uses MRI data of 32 healthy controls and 28 schizophrenia patients. The results show notable shrink in the gray matter volume in the brain of the schizophrenia patients, mostly in inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus, and insula. The proposed approach yields a mean classification accuracy close to 90% with a feature set having around 70 voxels. This study may open a means of investigation of underlying neurobiology of schizophrenic brain for effective clinical intervention.

AB  - Antiepileptic drug therapy has significant inter-patient variability in response towards it. The current study aims to understand this variability at the molecular level using microarray-based analysis of peripheral blood gene expression profiles of patients receiving valproate (VA) monotherapy. Only 10 unique genes were found to be differentially expressed in VA responders (n = 15) and 6 genes in the non-responders (n = 8) (fold-change >2, p < 0.05). PTGS2 which encodes cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2, showed downregulation in the responders compared to the non-responders. PTGS2/COX-2 mRNA profiles in the two groups corresponded to their plasma profiles of the COX-2 product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)). Since COX-2 is believed to regulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a multidrug efflux transporter over-expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in drug-resistant epilepsy, the pathway connecting COX-2 and P-gp was further explored in vitro. Investigation of the effect of VA upon the brain endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) in hyperexcitatory conditions confirmed suppression of COX-2-dependent P-gp upregulation by VA. Our findings suggest that COX-2 downregulation by VA may suppress seizure-mediated P-gp upregulation at the BBB leading to enhanced drug delivery to the brain in the responders. Our work provides insight into the association of peripheral PTGS2/COX-2 expression with VA efficacy and the role of COX-2 as a potential therapeutic target for developing efficacious antiepileptic treatment.

AB  - Importance High levels of antimicrobial resistance in neonatal bloodstream isolates are being reported globally, including in Asia. Local hospital antibiogram data may include too few isolates to meaningfully examine the expected coverage of antibiotic regimens. Objective To assess the coverage offered by 3 antibiotic regimens for empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis in Asian countries. Design, Setting, and Participants A decision analytical model was used to estimate coverage of 3 prespecified antibiotic regimens according to a weighted-incidence syndromic combination antibiogram. Relevant data to parameterize the models were identified from a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE and Embase. Data from Asian countries published from 2014 onward were of interest. Only data on blood culture isolates from neonates with sepsis, bloodstream infection, or bacteremia reported from the relevant setting were included. Data analysis was performed from April 2019 to July 2019. Exposures The prespecified regimens of interest were aminopenicillin-gentamicin, third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), and meropenem. The relative incidence of different bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility to antibiotics relevant for determining expected concordance with these regimens were extracted. Main Outcomes and Measures Coverage was calculated on the basis of a decision-tree model incorporating relative bacterial incidence and antimicrobial susceptibility of relevant isolates. Data on 7 bacteria most commonly reported in the included studies were used for estimating coverage, which was reported at the country level. Results Data from 48 studies reporting on 10 countries and 8376 isolates were used. Individual countries reported 51 (Vietnam) to 6284 (India) isolates. Coverage varied considerably between countries. Meropenem was generally estimated to provide the highest coverage, ranging from 64.0% (95% credible interval [CrI], 62.6%-65.4%) in India to 90.6% (95% CrI, 86.2%-94.4%) in Cambodia, followed by aminopenicillin-gentamicin (from 35.9% [95% CrI, 27.7%-44.0%] in Indonesia to 81.0% [95% CrI, 71.1%-89.7%] in Laos) and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone (from 17.9% [95% CrI, 11.7%-24.7%] in Indonesia to 75.0% [95% CrI, 64.8%-84.1%] in Laos). Aminopenicillin-gentamicin coverage was lower than that of meropenem in all countries except Laos (81.0%; 95% CrI, 71.1%-89.7%) and Nepal (74.3%; 95% CrI, 70.3%-78.2%), where 95% CrIs for aminopenicillin-gentamicin and meropenem were overlapping. Third-generation cephalosporin coverage was lowest of the 3 regimens in all countries. The coverage difference between aminopenicillin-gentamicin and meropenem for countries with nonoverlapping 95% CrIs ranged from -15.9% in China to -52.9% in Indonesia. Conclusions and Relevance This study's findings suggest that noncarbapenem antibiotic regimens may provide limited coverage for empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis in many Asian countries. Alternative regimens must be studied to limit carbapenem consumption.
   Question What is the antibiotic coverage offered by empirical neonatal sepsis treatment with aminopenicillin-gentamicin, third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone), and meropenem in Asian countries? Findings In this decision analytical model based on a decision tree, 8376 isolates from 10 countries were used to estimate coverage. Meropenem generally had the highest coverage (from 64.0% in India to 90.6% in Cambodia) followed by aminopenicillin-gentamicin (from 35.9% in Indonesia to 81.0% in Laos) and cefotaxime or ceftriaxone (from 17.9% in Indonesia to 75.0% in Laos); in all countries except Laos and Nepal, meropenem coverage was higher than that of the other 2 regimens. Meaning The findings suggest that noncarbapenems may provide limited empirical neonatal sepsis coverage in many Asian countries.
   This decision analytical model assesses the coverage offered by 3 antibiotic regimens for empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis in 10 Asian countries.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells possessing regenerative potential. Symphytum officinale (SO) is a medicinal plant and in homoeopathic literature, believed to accelerate bone healing.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to determine if homoeopathic doses of SO could augment osteogenesis in MSCs as they differentiate into osteoblasts in vitro.
   Materials and methods: Bone marrow samples were obtained from patients who underwent bone grafting procedures (n = 15). MSCs were isolated, expanded and characterized by flow cytometry (CD90, CD105). Cytotoxicity of SO was evaluated by MTT assay. Osteogenic differentiation was induced in MSCs with. beta-glycerophosphate, ascorbic acid and dexamethasone over 2 weeks. Different homoeopathic doses of SO (MT, 3C, 6C, 12C and 30C) were added to the basic differentiation medium (BDM) and efficiency of MSCs differentiating into osteoblasts were measured by evaluating expression of Osteocalcin using flow cytometry, and alkaline phosphatase activity using ELISA. Gene expression analyses for osteoblast markers (Runx-2, Osteopontin and Osteocalcin) were evaluated in differentiated osteoblasts using qPCR.
   Results: Flow cytometry (CD90, CD105) detected MSCs isolated from bone marrow (93-98%). MTT assay showed that the selected doses of SO did not induce any cytotoxicity in MSCs (24 hours). The efficiency of osteogenic differentiation (2 weeks) for different doses of Symphytum officinale was determined by flow cytometry (n = 10) for osteoblast marker, Osteocalcin, and most doses of Symphytum officinale enhanced osteogenesis. Interestingly, gene expression analysis for Runx-2 (n = 10), Osteopontin (n = 10), Osteocalcin (n = 10) and alkaline phosphatase activity (n = 8) also showed increased osteogenesis with the addition of Symphytum officinale to BDM, specially mother tincture.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that homoeopathic dose (specially mother tincture) of Symphytum officinale has the potential to enhance osteogenesis.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is associated with acute hepatitis disease, which may lead to chronic disease in immunocompromised individuals. The disease is particularly severe among pregnant women (20-30% mortality). The only licensed vaccine against HEV, which is available in China, is the Escherichia coli purified recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) encompassing the 368-660 amino acids (aa) of the viral ORF2 protein. The viral capsid is formed by the ORF2 protein, which harbors three glycosylation sites. Baculo virus expression system has been employed to generate a glycosylated VLP, which encompasses 112-608aa of the ORF2 protein. Here, we sought to produce a recombinant VLP containing 112-608aa of the ORF2 protein in Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) expression system. The cDNA sequence encoding 112-608aa of the ORF2 protein was fused with the alpha-mating factor secretion signal coding sequence (for release of the fusion protein to the culture medium) and cloned into the yeast vector pPICZ alpha. Optimum expression of recombinant protein was obtained at 72 h induction in 1.5% methanol using inoculum density (A(600)) of 80 and at pH-3.0 of the culture medium. Identity of the purified protein was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. Further studies revealed the glycosylation pattern and VLP nature of the purified protein. Immunization of BALB/c mice with these VLPs induced potent immune response as evidenced by the high ORF2 specific IgG titer and augmented splenocyte proliferation in a dose dependent manner. 112-608aa ORF2 VLPs produced in P. pastoris appears to be a suitable candidate for development of diagnostic and prophylactic reagents against the hepatitis E.

AB  - Antithrombin (AT) deficiency is a rare but strong risk factor for the thrombosis development. Mutations in gene encoding AT (SERPINC1) have provided a detailed understanding of AT deficiency and subsequent development of thrombotic complications. In the present study, we describe a case of thrombotic patient with reduced AT activity and normal AT antigen levels. AT deficiency in the patient was explained by the presence of heterozygous mutation g.13397A>G (Ala427Thr) in exon 6 of SERPINC1. Reduced APTT and TT with normal PT were observed. The mutation was found to be absent in healthy controls (n = 62). In vitro purification and characterization of variant AT showed significant decrease in fluorescence emission intensity, decreased bis-ANS fluorescence emission, changes in secondary structure and presence of polymerized AT in patient's plasma as assessed by fluorescence, circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy respectively. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulation studies showed altered conformation due to Ala427Thr substitution. Our study shows that genetic screening should be carried out in AT deficient patients in addition to the routinely used functional assays to understand the molecular basis of disease development.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major infectious disease worldwide. TB treatment displays a biphasic bacterial clearance, in which the majority of bacteria clear within the first month of treatment, but residual bacteria remain nonresponsive to treatment and eventually may become resistant. Here, we have shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis was taken up by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), where it established dormancy and became highly nonresponsive to isoniazid, a major constituent of directly observed treatment short course (DOTS). Dormant M. tuberculosis induced quiescence in MSCs and promoted their long-term survival. Unlike macrophages, where M. tuberculosis resides in early-phagosomal compartments, in MSCs the majority of bacilli were found in the cytosol, where they promoted rapid lipid synthesis, hiding within lipid droplets. Inhibition of lipid synthesis prevented dormancy and sensitized the organisms to isoniazid. Thus, we have established that M. tuberculosis gains dormancy in MSCs, which serve as a long-term natural reservoir of dormant M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, in the murine model of TB, induction of autophagy eliminated M. tuberculosis from MSCs, and consequently, the addition of rapamycin to an isoniazid treatment regimen successfully attained sterile clearance and prevented disease reactivation.

AB  - Background and aim
   Controversy exists regarding cardiovascular risk in relation to sleep duration. We determined sleep duration and major recurrent cardiovascular event associations in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea and established cardiovascular disease.
   Methods
   Secondary analyses of the international, multicenter, Sleep Apnea Cardiovascular Endpoints trial. Sleep duration was estimated from overnight home oximetry (ApneaLink monitor) used for obstructive sleep apnoea diagnosis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine associations of categorized sleep duration (<6 h, 6-8 h (reference), and >8 h) and major cardiovascular outcomes: primary composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and any hospitalization for unstable angina, heart failure, or transient ischemic attack; secondary composite of cardiac and cerebral (stroke/transient ischemic attack) events.
   Results
   Oximetry-derived sleep duration estimates were available in 2687 participants (mean 61.2 years, 80.9% males) who experienced a total of 436 cardiovascular events over a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. Compared to the reference category, sleep duration was not associated with risk of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.33, and HR 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.98-1.52, for sleep duration 8 h, respectively). However, long sleep was associated with increased cerebral events (HR 1.67, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.39; P = 0.005) and stroke alone (HR 1.79, 95% confidence interval 1.22-2.63; P = 0.003).
   Conclusions
   Long sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of stroke but not cardiac events in obstructive sleep apnoea patients with existing cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Introduction: Most Indians are vegetarian or eat very little meat, which could imply high potassium intake. Because a high-potassium diet could counterbalance the adverse health effects of high-sodium intake, this study aimed to describe potassium relative to sodium intake and investigate the relationship between blood pressure and potassium intake relative to sodium intake in rural and urban India.
   Methods: Investigators collected 24-hour urines from 1,445 participants in a subset of 2 population-based surveys in North India in 2012-2013. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information on demography, behaviors (tobacco, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and diet [food frequency and 24-hour recall]), and medical history. After evaluating expected versus measured creatinine excretion, the authors calculated median urine potassium excretion and sodium/potassium ratio, according to sex and urban or rural residence, and estimated least square means for the urine measures by participant demographics and comorbidities, after accounting for caloric intake. Two-year blood pressure follow-up data were available in the urban study, and ANCOVA regression was used to determine the association with urine measures. All the statistical analyses of the data were done in January 2019.
   Results: Acceptable 24-hour urine collections were available in 1,397 participants (rural, n=730). Median urine potassium excretions were 1,492 (IQR=1,012-2,063) and 975 (615-1,497) mg/day; sodium/potassium ratios met the recommended target of <1 in 2.9% rural and 6.6% urban participants. Rural participants did not have higher potassium or lower (better) sodium/potassium ratios when diagnosed with hypertension or other cardiovascular conditions. Higher potassium excretion was associated with lower blood pressure during follow-up among the urban participants (mean systolic blood pressure, 129 vs 133 mm Hg in highest vs lowest potassium excretion tertiles; p=0.029).
   Conclusions: Low potassium intake in India warrants dietary policies promoting intake of potassium-rich foods to improve heart health. This approach may be more acceptable than programs focused on sodium reduction alone. (C) 2019 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives The emergence of MDR Gram-negative pathogens and increasing prevalence of chronic infections presents an unmet need for the discovery of novel antibacterial agents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biological properties of a small molecule, IITR06144, identified in a phenotypic screen against the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli.
   Methods A small-molecule library of 10956 compounds was screened for growth inhibition against E. coli ATCC 25922 at concentration 50 mu M. MICs of lead compounds were determined by the broth microdilution method. Time-kill kinetics, anti-persister activity, spontaneous frequency of resistance, biofilm inhibition and disruption were assessed by standard protocols. Resistant mutants were generated by serial passaging followed by WGS. In vitro toxicity studies were carried out via the MTT assay. In vivo toxicity and efficacy in a mouse model were also evaluated.
   Results IITR06144 was identified as the most promising candidate amongst 29 other potential antibacterial leads, exhibiting the lowest MIC, 0.5mg/L. IITR06144 belongs to the nitrofuran class and exhibited broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against most MDR bacteria, including the 'priority pathogen', carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. IITR06144 retained its potency against nitrofurantoin-resistant clinical isolates. It displayed anti-persister, anti-biofilm activity and lack of spontaneous resistance development. IITR06144 demonstrated a large therapeutic index with no associated in vitro and in vivo toxicity.
   Conclusions In the light of excellent in vitro properties displayed by IITR06144 coupled with its considerable in vivo efficacy, further evaluation of IITR06144 as a therapeutic lead against antibiotic-resistant infections is warranted.

AB  - As of February 29, 2020, more than 85,000 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported from China and 53 other countries with 2,924 deaths. On January 30, 2020, the first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID was reported from Kerala, India. In view of the earlier evidence about effectiveness of repurposed lopinavir/ritonavir against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (CoV), as well as preliminary docking studies conducted by the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization approved the restricted public health use of lopinavir/ritonavir combination amongst symptomatic COVID-19 patients detected in the country. Hospitalized adult patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection with any one of the following criteria will be eligible to receive lopinavir/ritonavir for 14 days after obtaining written informed consent: (i) respiratory distress with respiratory rate >= 22/min or SpO2of <94 per cent; (ii) lung parenchymal infiltrates on chest X-ray; (iii) hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for vasopressor/inotropic medication; (iv) new-onset organ dysfunction; and (v) high-risk groups - age 60 yr, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, chronic lung disease and immunocompromised persons. Patients will be monitored to document clinical (hospital length of stay and mortality at 14, 28 and 90 days), laboratory (presence of viral RNA in serial throat swab samples) and safety (adverse events and serious adverse events) outcomes. Treatment outcomes amongst initial cases would be useful in providing guidance about the clinical management of patients with COVID-19. If found useful in managing initial SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, further evaluation using a randomized control trial design is warranted to guide future therapeutic use of this combination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cushing's disease (CD) is a spectrum of clinical manifestations due to adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma. Transsphenoidal adenomectomy remains the standard treatment. There has been a paradigm shift from microscopic to endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery in recent years. However, the efficacy of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery has not been established. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the superiority of endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, if any, over microscopic surgery.
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery for the treatment of CD and to determine the factors affecting remission.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing surgery for CD from 2009 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Transsphenoidal resection was the preferred treatment, with recent trends in favor of the endonasal endoscopic skull base approach. Postoperative cortisol level of <2 mu g/dL was taken as remission and value between 2 and 5 mu g/dL as possible remission.
   RESULTS: In total, 104 patients operated primarily for CD were included for analysis; 47 patients underwent microscopic surgery, 55 endoscopic surgery, and 2 were operated transcranially. Remission was achieved in 76.47% of patients. In univariate analysis, factors significantly associated with remission were 1) type of surgery (P = 0.01); remission in endoscopy surgery (88.23%) is better than microscopy (56.6%); 2) postoperative day 1 morning cortisol (P = 0.004); and 3) postoperative day 1 morning ACTH (P = 0.015). In multivariate analysis, only postoperative day 1 cortisol was found to be significant predictor of remission (P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative plasma cortisol level is a strong independent predictor of remission. Remission provided by endoscopy is significantly better than the microscopic approach.

AB  - Rituximab is an effective treatment for steroid-dependent/frequently-relapsing nephrotic syndrome (SDFRNS) in children. However, the optimal rituximab regimen remains unknown. To help determine this we conducted an international, multicenter retrospective study at 11 tertiary pediatric nephrology centers in Asia, Europe and North America of children 1-18 years of age with complicated SDFRNS receiving rituximab between 2005-2016 for 18 or more months follow-up. The effect of rituximab prescribed at three dosing levels: low (375 mg/m(2)), medium (750 mg/m(2)) and high (1125-1500 mg/m(2)), with or without maintenance immunosuppression (defined as concurrent use of corticosteroids, mycophenolate motile or calcineurin inhibition at first relapse or for at least six months following the rituximab treatment) was examined. Among the 511 children (median age 11.5 year, 67% boys), 191, 208 and 112 received low, medium and high dose rituximab, respectively. Within this total cohort of 511 children, 283 (55%) received maintenance immunosuppression. Renal biopsies were performed in 317 children indicating the predominant histology was minimal change disease (74%). Without maintenance immunosuppression, low-dose rituximab had a shorter relapse-free period and a higher relapse risk (8.5 months) than medium (12.7 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62) and high dose (14.3 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50; all significant). With maintenance immunosuppression, the relapse-free survival in low-dose rituximab (14 months) was similar to medium (10.9 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.23) and high dose (12.0 months; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.92; all nonsignificant). Most adverse events were mild. Thus, children receiving low-dose rituximab without maintenance immunosuppression had the shortest relapse-free survival. Hence, both rituximab dose and maintenance immunosuppression have important effects on the treatment outcomes.

AB  - Increase in the number of patients suffering from Osteoarthritis is prevalent nowadays and hence, there is need for tissue regeneration. Fabricating a 3D structure giving a better control mimicking the actual tissue properties, especially for osteo-chondral applications is a challenge due to several constraints (like suitable biomaterial for cell encapsulation, mimicking mechanical properties). Here, we mimic the natural process of tissue formation by encapsulating cells in an optimized 3D construct which improves mechanical properties by matrix secretion. We investigated different concentrations of Alginate-Gelatin ink and further characterized the optimized concentration. Behaviour of different infill percentage on the bioactivity and morphology of the scaffold was also investigated. For observing the behaviour of cells on different infill percentages within the scaffolds of same concentration, we used osteoblasts (MG63) cells. The optimized material concentration with the adequate infill showed printability, adequate viscosity, and increased swelling. Both, 20 and 25% infill within the Alginate-Gelatin scaffolds (2.5% w/v Alginate and 5% w/v Gelatin) resulted in higher viability and proliferation of osteoblast cells. Additionally, to control the shape retention ability of the scaffolds dual crosslinking was applied. Thus, the developed Alginate-Gelatin based 3D scaffold maintains the required balance between biomechanics and soft tissue regeneration. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cytoadherence-linked asexual gene 9 (Clag9), a conserved Plasmodium protein expressed during the asexual blood stages, is involved in the cytoadherence of infected red blood cells (RBCs) to the endothelial lining of blood vessels. Here, we show that Plasmodium falciparum Clag9 (PfClag9) is a component of the PfClag9-RhopH complex that is involved in merozoite binding to human erythrocytes. To characterize PfClag9, we expressed four fragments of PfClag9, encompassing the entire protein. Immunostaining analysis using anti-PfClag9 antibodies showed expression and localization of PfClag9 at the apical end of the merozoites. Mass spectrometric analysis of merozoite extracts after immunoprecipitation using anti-PfClag9 antibody identified P. falciparum rhoptry-associated protein 1 (PfRAP1), PfRAP2, PfRAP3, PfRhopH2, and PfRhopH3 as associated proteins. The identified rhoptry proteins were expressed, and their association with PfClag9 domains was assessed by using protein-protein interaction tools. We further showed that PfClag9 binds human RBCs by interacting with the glycophorin A-band 3 receptor-coreceptor complex. In agreement with its cellular localization, PfClag9 was strongly recognized by antibodies generated during natural infection. Mice immunized with the C-terminal domain of PfClag9 were partially protected against a subsequent challenge infection with Plasmodium berghei, further supporting a biological role of PfClag9 during natural infection. Taken together, these results provide direct evidence for the existence of a PfRhopH-Clag9 complex on the Plasmodium merozoite surface that binds to human RBCs.

AB  - Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) requires lifelong replacement of glucocorticoids with regular follow up to manage associated morbidities. The current review focuses on follow-up and management of infants diagnosed with classical CAH pertinent to Indian context. Early initiation of oral hydrocortisone in divided doses is recommended after diagnosis in newborn period, infancy and childhood. Fludrocortisone is recommended for all infants with classical CAH. All infants should be monitored as per protocol for disease and treatment related complications. The role of prenatal steroids to pregnant women with previous history of CAH affected infant for prevention of virilization of female fetus is controversial.

AB  - Meditation is an ancient behavioral intervention, however, its benefits for achieving holistic health have been highlighted in recent times with rigorous scientific studies revealing its benefits in many chronic diseases. It has been specially found useful in neurodegenerative diseases and recent evidence points to the positive effects of meditation in preserving gray and white matter in the adult brain. It is also a potential therapy to downregulate processes implicated in brain aging and confer "neuroprotection"-something we all look forward to for our glaucoma patients. In the current review, we evaluate the benefits of meditation practice for the glaucoma patient and support for its candidature as adjunctive therapy for glaucoma patients. It has multiple potential benefits for normal-pressure and high-pressure glaucoma patients including a reduction in intraocular pressure, increasing cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, and decreasing action of the sympathetic nervous system with a corresponding increase in parasympathetic nervous system activity. Meditation leads to a "relaxation response" mediated by nitric oxide with decrease in the stress hormone cortisol, increase in neurotrophins and mitochondrial energy production, and improves the overall quality of life of glaucoma patients. It can also benefit caregivers of glaucoma patients and health care providers. It appears that meditation can function as a multifaceted management approach for glaucoma using the natural potential of the human body and target not only the eye but the patient behind the eye to ameliorate this "sick eye in a sick body" condition.

AB  - Background A systematic understanding of population-level trends in deaths due to road injuries at the subnational level over time for India's 1.4 billion people, by age, sex, and type of road user is not readily available; we aimed to fill this knowledge gap.
   Methods As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study, we estimated the rate of deaths due to road injuries in each state of India from 1990 to 2017 based on several verbal autopsy data sources. We calculated the number of deaths and death rate for road injuries by type of road user, and assessed the age and sex distribution of these deaths over time. Based on the trends of the age-standardised death rate from 1990 to 2017, we projected the age-standardised death rate to 2030 to assess if the states of India would meet the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target to halve the death rate for road injuries from 2015 by 2020 or 2030. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
   Findings In 2017, 218 876 deaths (95% UI 201 734 to 231141) due to road injuries occurred in India, with an age-standardised death rate for road injuries of 17.2 deaths (15.7 to 18.1) per 100 000 population, which was much higher in males (25.7 deaths [23.5 to 27.4] per 100000) than in females (8.5 deaths [7.2 to 94] per 100 000). The number of deaths due to road injuries in India increased by 58.7% (43.6 to 74.7) from 1990 to 2017, but the age-standardised death rate decreased slightly, by 9.2% (0.6 to 18.3). In 2017, pedestrians accounted for 76 729 (35.1%) of all deaths due to road injuries, motorcyclists accounted for 67 524 (30.9%), motor vehicle occupants accounted for 57 802 (26.4%), and cyclists accounted for 15 324 (7.0%). India had a higher age-standardised death rate for road injury among motorcyclists (4.9 deaths [3.9-5.4] per 100 000 population) and cyclists (1.2 deaths [0. 9-1. 4] per 100 000 population) than the global average. Road injury was the leading cause of death in males aged 15 to 39 years in India in 2017, and the second leading cause in this age group for both sexes combined. The overall age-standardised death rate for road injuries varied by up to 2.6 times between states in 2017. Wide variations were seen between the states in the percentage change in age-standardised death rate for road injuries from 1990 to 2017, ranging from a reduction of 38.2% (22.3 to 51.7) in Delhi to an increase of 17.0% (0.6 to 34.7) in Odisha. If the trends estimated up to 2017 were to continue, no state in India or India overall would achieve the SDG 2020 target in 2020 or even in 2030.
   Interpretation India's contribution to the global number of deaths due to road injuries is increasing, and the country is unlikely to meet the SDG targets if the trends up to 2017 continue. India needs to implement evidence-based road safety interventions, promote strong policies and traffic law enforcement, have better road and vehicle design, and improve care for road injuries at the state level to meet the SDG goal.

AB  - Background Impulse oscillometry is an effort-independent technique of assessment of airway resistance and reactance, and can be performed in children unable to complete spirometry. Objective To evaluate the utility of impulse oscillometry and spirometry for assessing asthma control in children. Study design Prospective cohort study. Participants Children aged 5-15 years, with mild to severe persistent asthma. Intervention On each 3-monthly follow-up visit, clinical assessment, classification of control of asthma, impulse oscillometry and spirometry were performed. Outcome Utility of impulse oscillometry parameters [impedance (Z5), resistance (R5), reactance (X5) at 5 Hz, and R5-20 (resistance at 20Hz -5Hz) (% predicted), and area of reactance (AX, actual values)] and FEV1 (% predicted) to discriminate between controlled and uncontrolled asthma was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Association of FEV1 and impulse oscillometry parameters over time with controlled asthma was evaluated by generalized estimating equation model. Results Number of visits in 256 children [mean (SD) age, 100 (41.6) mo; boys: 198 (77.3%)], where both impulse oscillometry and spirometry were performed was 2616; symptoms were controlled in 48.9% visits. Area under the curve for discrimination between controlled and uncontrolled asthma by FEV1, AX, R5-20, Z5, R5, and X5 were 0.58, 0.55, 0.55, 0.52, 0.52 and 0.52, respectively. FEV1 [OR (95% CI): 1.02 (1.01-1.03)] and AX [OR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.81-0.97)] measured over the duration of follow-up were significantly associated with controlled asthma. Conclusion Spirometry and impulse oscillometry parameters are comparable in ascertaining controlled asthma. Impulse oscillometry being less effort-dependent may be performed for monitoring control of childhood asthma, especially in younger children.

AB  - Street children as a population sub-group exist in significant numbers in the developing world and have been reported to be vulnerable to adverse health and risk behaviours that include physical and sexual risk behaviour. However, the estimation of prevalence for various psychoactive substances among the street children in a representative sample has not been attempted in the developing country like India. This is challenging due to the absence of an appropriate sampling frame, the population living in isolation, hiding their identity and concealing their behaviour. Use of psychoactive substances in street children is riddled with these challenges. The present investigation describes the findings from size estimation study on a representative sample of street child (n = 766) in Delhi, by implementing the Respondent Driven Sampling Methodology (RDS).
   The weighted prevalence for three commonest substances was found as Tobacco (31.1 %), alcohol (13.5 %) and inhalants (11.3 %) used during the last one year with the estimated number as -Tobacco (21,770), Alcohol (9450) and Inhalants (5600). Almost one third of street children were using some substance. Also, a large majority of ever users were also using substances currently.
   The study demonstrates successfully the implementation of RDS for the estimation of the prevalence of psychoactive substances in a representative manner. A large majority of street children use psychoactive substances, and there is a need for more of such studies in other metropolitan cities so that local level interventions and planning can be done for treatment and prevention of psychoactive substances among the street children. The important public health implications had been discussed.

AB  - Introduction: To determine an optimal platelet dose in thrombocytopenic patients is important for their judicious use. Transfusing platelets in different doses and comparing their post transfusion response can achieve this.
   Aim: To compare the efficacy of low and high dose single donor apheresis platelets (SDAP) with standard dose transfusions in terms of Corrected Count Increment (CCI), Percent Platelet Recovery (PPR) and transfusion free interval.
   Method: It was a prospective case control study done from January 2016 to April 2017. Twenty-eight hemato-oncology patients with CCI >= 5000 at 20-24 hours after standard dose (3x10(11)/unit), received low dose (1.5x10(11) platelets/unit) and high dose (> 4x10(11) platelets/unit) SDAP. CCI and PPR were calculated after 20 to 24 hours of transfusion. Transfusion free interval and bleeding episodes were also noted. Grading was done according to WHO bleeding scale.
   Result: There was no statistical difference in CCI and PPR when standard dose was compared with low dose (CCI: p = 0.92, PPR: p = 0.89). When standard and high dose was compared, standard dose gave better results than the high dose in terms of CCI (p = 0.006) and PPR (p = 0.008) although the post transfusion increments were comparable (p = 0.938). High dose gave better (p = 0.005) platelet count increments than low dose but CCI (p = 0.04) and PPR (p = 0.05) was significantly less than the low dose. The difference in transfusion free intervals after three doses was not significant. Donor exposure to the patients was significantly (p = 0.000) reduced to 17.5%.
   Conclusion: Possibility of low dose as an alternative to standard dose can be considered in view of comparable platelet response indicators and significantly reduced donor exposure.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the abilities of clinicians and clinical prediction models to accurately triage emergency department (ED) trauma patients. We compared the decisions made by clinicians with the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the Glasgow Coma Scale, Age and Systolic Blood Pressure (GAP) score, the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) and the Gerdin et al model.
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting Three hospitals in urban India.
   Participants In total, 7697 adult patients who presented to participating hospitals with a history of trauma were approached for enrolment. The final study sample included 5155 patients. The majority (4023, 78.0%) were male.
   Main outcome measure The patient outcome was mortality within 30 days of arrival at the participating hospital. A grid search was used to identify model cut-off values. Clinicians and categorised models were evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and net reclassification improvement in non-survivors (NRI+) and survivors (NRI-) separately.
   Results The differences in AUROCC between each categorised model and the clinicians were 0.016 (95% CI-0.014 to 0.045) for RTS, 0.019 (95% CI-0.007 to 0.058) for GAP, 0.054 (95% CI 0.033 to 0.077) for KTS and-0.007 (95% CI-0.035 to 0.03) for Gerdin et al. The NRI+ for each model were-0.235 (-0.37 to-0.116), 0.17 (-0.042 to 0.405), 0.55 (0.47 to 0.65) and 0.22 (0.11 to 0.717), respectively. The NRI-were 0.385 (0.348 to 0.4), -0.059 (-0.476 to-0.005),-0.162 (-0.18 to-0.146) and 0.039 (-0.229 to 0.06), respectively.
   Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that there are no substantial differences in discrimination and net reclassification improvement between clinicians and all four clinical prediction models when using 30-day mortality as the outcome of ED trauma triage in adult patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The authors sought to analyze the residual connections formed by the temporal stem as a cause for seizure recurrence following endoscopic vertical interhemispheric hemispherotomy and to review and compare lateral approach (perisylvian) with vertical approach surgical techniques to highlight the anatomical factors responsible for residual connections.
   METHODS This study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent endoscopic hemispherotomy for drug-resistant epilepsy. Postoperative MR images were analyzed. Specific attention was given to anatomical 3D-acquired thin-section T1 images to assess the extent of disconnection, which was confirmed with a diffusion tensor imaging sequence. Cadaver brain dissection was done to analyze the anatomical factors responsible for persistent connections.
   RESULTS Of 39 patients who underwent surgery, 80% (31/39) were seizure free (follow-up of 23.61 +/- 8.25 months) following the first surgery. Thirty patients underwent postoperative MRI studies, which revealed persistent connections in 14 patients (11 temporal stem only; 3 temporal stem + amygdala + splenium). Eight of these 14 patients had persistent seizures. In 4 of these 8 patients, investigations revealed good concordance with the affected hemisphere, and repeat endoscopic disconnection of the residual connection was performed. Two of the 8 patients were lost to follow-up, and 2 had bihemispheric seizure onset. The 4 patients who underwent repeat endoscopic disconnection had seizure-free outcomes following the second surgery, increasing the good outcome total among all patients to 90% (35/39). Cadaveric brain dissection analysis revealed the anatomical factors responsible for the persistence of residual connections.
   CONCLUSIONS In endoscopic vertical approach interhemispheric hemispherotomy (and also vertical approach parasagittal hemispherotomy) the temporal stem, which lies deep and parallel to the plane of disconnection, is prone to be missed, which might lead to persistent or recurrent seizures. The recognition of this limitation can lead to improved seizure outcome. The amygdala and splenium are areas less commonly prone to be missed during surgery.

TI  - Laboratory preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 testing in India: Harnessing a network of Virus Research Diagnostic Laboratories
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
KW  - RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS
AB  - Background objectives: An outbreak of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology was reported from Hubei province of Wuhan, People's Republic of China, in December 2019. The outbreak was attributed to a novel coronavirus (CoV), named as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 and the disease as COVID-19. Within one month, cases were reported from 25 countries. In view of the novel viral strain with reported high morbidity, establishing early countrywide diagnosis to detect imported cases became critical. Here we describe the role of a countrywide network of VRDLs in early diagnosis of COVID-19. Methods: The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, established screening as well as confirmatory assays for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 13 VRDLs were provided with the E gene screening real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. VRDLs were selected on the basis of their presence near an international airport/seaport and their past performance. The case definition for testing included all individuals with travel history to Wuhan and symptomatic individuals with travel history to other parts of China. This was later expanded to include symptomatic individuals returning from Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and South Korea. Results: Within a week of standardization of the test at NIV, all VRDLs could initiate testing for SARS-CoV-2. Till February 29, 2020, a total of 2,913 samples were tested. This included both 654 individuals quarantined in the two camps and others fitting within the case definition. The quarantined individuals were tested twice - at days 0 and 14. All tested negative on both occasions. Only three individuals belonging to different districts in Kerala were found to be positive. Interpretation conclusions: Sudden emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and its potential to cause a pandemic posed an unsurmountable challenge to the public health system of India. However, concerted efforts of various arms of the Government of India resulted in a well-coordinated action at each level. India has successfully demonstrated its ability to establish quick diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 at NIV, Pune, and the testing VRDLs.

AB  - Objectives: While the burden of dementia is increasing in low- and middle-income countries, there is a low rate of diagnosis and paucity of research in these regions. A major challenge to study dementia is the limited availability of standardised diagnostic tools for use in populations with linguistic and educational diversity. The objectives of the study were to develop a standardised and comprehensive neurocognitive test battery to diagnose dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to varied etiologies, across different languages and educational levels in India, to facilitate research efforts in diverse settings. Methods: A multidisciplinary expert group formed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) collaborated towards adapting and validating a neurocognitive test battery, that is, the ICMR Neurocognitive Tool Box (ICMR-NCTB) in five Indian languages (Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam), for illiterates and literates, to standardise diagnosis of dementia and MCI in India. Results: Following a review of existing international and national efforts at standardising dementia diagnosis, the ICMR-NCTB was developed and adapted to the Indian setting of sociolinguistic diversity. The battery consisted of tests of cognition, behaviour, and functional activities. A uniform protocol for diagnosis of normal cognition, MCI, and dementia due to neurodegenerative diseases and stroke was followed in six centres. A systematic plan for validating the ICMR-NCTB and establishing cut-off values in a diverse multicentric cohort was developed. Conclusions: A key outcome was the development of a comprehensive diagnostic tool for diagnosis of dementia and MCI due to varied etiologies, in the diverse socio-demographic setting of India.

AB  - Background Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a major complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), which may require necrosectomy. Minimally invasive surgical step-up therapy is preferred for IPN. Aim To assess the effectiveness of percutaneous endoscopic step-up therapy in patients with IPN and identify predictors of its success. Methods Consecutive patients with AP hospitalized to our tertiary care academic center were studied prospectively. Patients with IPN formed the study group. The treatment protocol for IPN was percutaneous endoscopic step-up approach starting with antibiotics and percutaneous catheter drainage, and if required necrosectomy. Percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy (PEN) was performed using a flexible endoscope through the percutaneous tract under conscious sedation. Control of sepsis with resolution of collection(s) was the primary outcome measure. Results A total of 415 patients with AP were included. Of them, 272 patients had necrotizing pancreatitis and 177 (65%) developed IPN. Of these 177 patients, 27 were treated conservatively with antibiotics alone, 56 underwent percutaneous drainage alone, 53 required underwent PEN as a step-up therapy, 1 per-oral endoscopic necrosectomy, and 52 required surgery. Of the 53 patients in the PEN group, 42 (79.2%) were treated successfully-34 after PEN alone and 8 after additional surgery. Eleven of 53 patients died due to organ failure-7 after PEN and 4 after surgery. Independent predictors of mortality were > 50% necrosis and early organ failure. Conclusion Percutaneous endoscopic step-up therapy is an effective strategy for IPN. Organ failure and extensive pancreatic necrosis predicted a suboptimal outcome in patients with infected necrotizing pancreatitis.

AB  - Background: Our aim is to detect the association of BAP1 with ATM protein with AJCC tumor category and its prognostic significance.
   Methods: Based on AJCC tumor category, 69 patients samples were categorized into group A (LBD > 15 mm & tumor thickness 8 mm) and group B (LBD <= 15 mm & tumor thickness < 8 mm) subjected to immunohistochemistry to assess the nuclear expression of ATM and BAP1 proteins. Mutational analysis of BAP1 was performed on five samples from each group.
   Results: Group A tumors showed insertion mutation of BAP1 gene while there was no mutation seen in group B tumor. At translational level loss of ATM and BAP1 was found in 65% and 66% of cases respectively. Loss of ATM with BAP1 was seen in 55% of cases which was more frequent in group A which was statically significant with metastasis (p = 0.006), advanced tumor staging (p = 0.021) and reduced metastasis-free survival (p = 0.048). On multivariate analysis loss of ATM along with BAP1 came out to be an independent prognostic marker (p = 0.035).
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that loss of BAP1 along with ATM might serve as a potential prognostic indicator in patients with an advanced AJCC tumor category, which leads to an increased risk of metastasis.

AB  - Integrated care models offer one approach to treat patients with chronic multimorbidity. However, because these models consist of multiple components designed to provide individualized care, they should be adapted to best meet the needs of patients in diverse settings. This paper presents qualitative and quantitative data from a realist process evaluation embedded in the INtegrating DEPrEssioN and Diabetes treatmENT (INDEPENDENT) study to uncover what worked, for whom, how, and in what circumstances. We aimed to examine adaptations made to a care coordinator-led behavioral intervention, and how patients responded to adaptations, through a secondary analysis of these data. A purposive sample of 62 patients and 3 care coordinators were recruited based on their involvement with the INDEPENDENT care model across two clinics. Patients were interviewed and surveyed about their experiences in the care model and care coordinators were interviewed about their experiences implementing intervention components. Interview data were coded for reported modifications in intervention content, tools, and delivery; then, these adaptations were categorized by how they served to enhance implementation in the Indian context. Adaptations made in the delivery of this care model served two functions: (a) to improve health promotion communication between care coordinators and patients and (b) to improve patient engagement. Patients' expressed needs were consistent with what care coordinators perceived. Patients were satisfied with adaptations designed to improve intervention fit for local contexts. Study findings demonstrate that adapting components of an integrated care model can enhance patient satisfaction and engagement with behavioral interventions.

T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY

KW  - microsurgical repair
KW  - replantation
KW  - superficial temporal artery
KW  - deep temporal artery
AB  - Scalp avulsion injuries are usually attributed to entrapment of long hair or clothing in agricultural or industrial machinery or traffic accidents. Though rare, these injuries may be dangerous, and resulting cosmetic defect and alopecia lead to social stigma and poor self-esteem. Early intervention in the form of microvascular repair and replantation prevent morbidity and improve outcome. In this case series, we have discussed 3 cases of scalp replantation, 2 complete and 1 partial. Immediate microvascular reconstruction was planned in each case. Single surgical team approach was followed, vessels were identified and operated under an operative microscope. No vein grafts were used. Operative outcome was good, and scalp healed well. Cosmetic outcome was excellent, and there was no need for secondary revisions or use of tissue expanders. Immediate referral of such cases to institutes with facility for microvascular repair is recommended to reduce ischemia time. Superficial temporal artery is the first choice for microvascular repair in scalp replants, and a single artery anastomosis is sufficient to perfuse the entire scalp. Deep temporal artery is a viable alternative in cases where repair with superficial temporal vessels will require use of vein graft, cutting short operative time and associated complications.

AB  - Introduction: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumor (UTROSCT) are a unique group of neoplasms with diverse morphology and immunophenotypic characteristics, coexpressing sex cord, epithelial, and smooth-muscle markers. To date, less than 100 cases have been reported and there is paucity of data concerning their clinical behavior. Materials and Methods: All cases of uterine body tumors diagnosed over a period of two and a half years (2016-2018) were retrieved. Histopathological features were reviewed and extended panel of immunohistochemistry was performed to identify cases of UTROSCTs. Results: Six cases of UTROSCTs were identified with a median age of 46.5 years. Four of them presented with menorrhagia, while two with postmenopausal bleeding including one with a history of carcinoma breast. Three of these cases were initially misdiagnosed as endometrial stromal sarcoma and adenocarcinomas. They all underwent hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Conclusion: It is considered a tumor with low malignant potential; however, one out of six cases (16.7%) in our study showed metastasis, within 1 year of diagnosis. It is important to recognize this entity as it mimics a wide range of both benign and malignant tumors. Molecular pathogenesis and exact management protocols remain elusive due to rarity,hence, multi-institutional studies are warranted.

AB  - In this study, we explored the hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) degradation potential of a gram-negative bacterium Pelomonas aquatica strain 12868. The microbe eliminated 80.68% of RDX by utilizing the explosive as a nitrogen source. FTIR study and nitrite assay confirmed the degradation of RDX into non-toxic metabolites in an RDX-succinate aqueous medium. The isolate showed an improved RDX degradation when formulated into water dispersible granules (WDG) using soy flour as a nutrient source. The WDG formulation not only achieved 6.53% enhanced RDX degradation but also stabilized the microbe as only a 24.37% decrease in cfu count was observed after a storage period of six months at 30 degrees C. During the microcosm experiments, RDX degradation followed first-order kinetics with a half-life of 13.9 and 19.04 days in a soil biostimulated by sucrose and wheat straw, respectively. P. aquatica with sucrose as added carbon source effectively degraded 50.91% more RDX compared to unstimulated control after 30 days of treatment. These data imply that microbial formulation mediated RDX reduction coupled with biostimulation has the potential to become a swift and sustainable clean-up approach for RDX contaminated environments.

AB  - While coronary artery disease (CAD) has become a major threat worldwide, the timely biomarker-based early diagnosis of CAD remains a major unmet clinical challenge. We aimed towards assessing the level of circulatory microRNAs as candidates of novel biomarkers in patients with CAD. A total of 147 subjects were recruited which includes 78 subjects with angiographically proven CAD, 15 pre-atherosclerotic normal coronary artery (NCA) subjects and 54 healthy individuals. Quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed. MiR-133b was downregulated by 4.6 fold (p < 0.0001) whereas miR-21 was upregulated by similar to 2 fold (p < 0.0001) in plasma samples of CAD patients. Importantly, both the miRNAs showed association with disease severity as miR-133b was downregulated by 8.45 fold in acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 3.38 fold in Stable angina (SA) and 2.08 fold in NCA. MiR-21 was upregulated by 2.46 fold in ACS, 1.90 fold in SA and 1.12 fold in NCA. Moreover, miR-133b could significantly differentiate subjects with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) from Non-STEMI. Area under the curve (AUC) for miR-133b was 0.80 with >75.6% sensitivity and specificity, AUC for miR-21 was 0.79 with >69.4% sensitivity and specificity. Our results suggest that miR-133b and miR-21 could be possible candidates of novel biomarkers in early prediction of CAD.

AB  - Purpose: With improving survival of preterm neonates, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is emerging as a major cause of childhood blindness. Incidence of sight-threatening ROP can be reduced by improving the quality of care provided to preterm neonates. Methods: This before-and-after study was designed to develop a need-based intervention package to improve knowledge, skills, and practices of those providing care for preterm neonates, and to evaluate the effectiveness of this package when combined with point-of-care quality improvement (POCQI) in improving survival of preterm neonates without sight-threatening ROP. The study had a formative component to assess baseline knowledge, skills, practices and attitudes, and to assess the needs of the healthcare staff to improve the care of preterm neonates. It was conducted in four special care neonatal units (SCNU) in the state of Madhya Pradesh in India. Results: A theory of change was developed to guide the development of study tools including needs assessment and educational package development. The educational package thus developed has been tested at the study sites in combination with POCQI projects driven by local teams of healthcare providers. The effectiveness of the interventions has been evaluated by collection of individual-level data on neonates admitted at the study sites. Conclusion: A multidimensional educational package integrated with system changes in the form of quality improvement (QI) endeavours driven by local context and needs were developed and evaluated in the project.

AB  - To analyze the feasibility, surgical outcomes and possible risks and complications encountered during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for approaching parapharyngeal space (PPS) tumours, a retrospective cohort study was conducted. Out of 108 TORS procedures performed, 5 PPS tumours were identified from May 2011- November 2017. This study included 2 retrostyloid (benign nerve sheath tumour) and 3 prestyloid tumours (pleomorphic adenoma), of which one patient had previously undergone a transcervical approach for deep lobe of parotid pleomorphic adenoma. Average tumour dimensions were 4.56 x 4.5 x 3.64 cm, with largest antero-posterior, medial-lateral and craniocaudal dimensions being, 5.1 cm, 7.1 cm and 6.5 cm, respectively. Adverse peri-operative events encountered were tumour fragmentation (n = 1), Secondary hemorrhage (n = 1) and Horner's syndrome (n = 1). Oral feeds could be initiated after 7.6 days. No recurrences were noted during a mean follow up of 21.6 months. Therefore, in properly selected cases, excellent results in terms of extracapsular resection and low morbidity can be obtained with TORS without resorting to mandibulotomy or transcervical incision.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this prospective study was to compare the efficacy of percutaneous acetic acid (PAAI) to that of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the treatment of small (<= 5cm) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using a randomized trial.
   Material and methods: Consecutive patients with small HCC underwent clinical, biochemical, and imaging evaluation. Those fulfilling the inclusion criteria (Child's A/B cirrhosis, less than 5 HCC nodules, HCC nodules <= 5cm diameter, no extrahepatic disease, patent portal vein, normal coagulation profile with informed consent) were randomly assigned to receive RFA or PAAI. Tumor response and survival rate were estimated. Non-inferiority margin of 10% difference was taken for effectivity of PAAI compared to RFA.
   Results: Of the 86 patients screened, 55 patients with 67 HCC nodules were included. There were 40 men and 15 women with a mean age of 54.3 + 10.5 (SD) years (range: 28-71 years). Of these, 26 patients had PAAI and 29 had RFA. The clinical, demographic and imaging profiles of the two groups were similar. Complete response was non-inferior to RFA [PAAI 75% and RFA 83.3%, difference 8.3% CI (-12.5% to 29.2%)]. Lower limit of this 95% CI (-12.5%) was lower than the 10% non-inferiority margin difference (8.3%). Survival rates were similar at 12 months (PAAI, 81.6% vs. RFA, 71.9%; P=0.68) and at 30 months (PAAI, 54.4% vs. RFA, 52%; P=0.50).
   Conclusion: PAAI and RFA have similar efficacy in treating small HCC. PAAI could thus be a cost-effective alternative in situations where RFA is either unavailable or unaffordable. (C) 2019 Societe francaise de radiologie. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Head and neck cancers (HNCs) are malignant tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract and are the sixth most common cancer worldwide. In India, around 30-40% of all cancers are HNCs. Even though there are global guidelines or recommendations for the management of HNCs, these may not be appropriate for Indian scenarios. In an effort to discuss current practices, latest developments and to come to a consensus to recommend management strategies for different anatomical subsites of HNCs for Indian patients, a group of experts (medical, surgical and radiation oncologists and dentists) was formed. A review of literature from medical databases was conducted to provide the best possible evidence base, which was reviewed by experts during a consensus group meeting (January, 2019) to provide recommendations.

AB  - Background The magnitude of blindness is unevenly distributed worldwide. This systematic review aimed to study gender differences in the prevalence of blindness, cataract blindness and cataract surgical coverage in India among persons aged 50 years and above.
   Methods Literature search was carried out in the Medline, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Trip databases. Data were abstracted and risk of bias was assessed for the selected full-text articles. Pooled prevalence, ORs and risk differences were synthesised by meta-analyses.
   Results 22 studies were included in the systematic review. The pooled prevalence of blindness obtained for men was 4.17% and that for women was 5.68%. Women had 35% higher odds of being blind (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.62) and 69% higher odds of being cataract blind (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.95). Women had a 27% lower odds of getting cataract surgery (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.01). In women, around 35% of the prevalence of blindness and 33% of the prevalence of cataract blindness are attributable to their gender.
   Conclusion Marked gender differences in blindness, cataract blindness and cataract surgical coverage were seen in India, with the odds being unfavourable for women. Interventions implemented for reduction of blindness, including cataract blindness, need to consider these gender differentials in the Indian context. Further research is needed to ascertain the reasons for these differences and devise interventions to reduce these differences in order to tackle the magnitude of avoidable blindness in India.

KW  - COMPLICATIONS
AB  - Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common microvascular complication in young individuals with type 1 diabetes. It is recommended to implement structured screening programs and adopt an appropriate referral mechanism at all levels of the health system to prevent vision loss in this disease. We developed and pilot-tested the feasibility of a comprehensive DR screening model at a tertiary care diabetes clinic in India. The model comprised an affordable DR screening facility at the diabetes clinic, structured education sessions, and annual inhospital diabetes complication screening camps. Over the span of 2 years, we screened 413 eligible patients with type 1 diabetes and 17.4% (n = 72) had any form of DR in at least one eye. Half of the retinopathy positive patients had mild DR. However, only one-third of newly diagnosed patients reported to the eye care facility for DR management. Based on this study, it is feasible to screen all patients with type 1 diabetes for DR by increasing awareness and providing opportunities for DR screening at a tertiary care diabetes clinic. Our model combined with formal referral and follow-up systems would be a potentially scalable approach for DR prevention and management at diabetes care facilities in India.

AB  - Diagnosis of microcytic hypochromia is done by measuring certain characteristics changes in the count of blood cell and related indices. Complete blood count test (CBC) is the common process for measuring these characteristic changes. However, the CBC test cannot be completely relied upon since there are chances of false diagnosis as these characteristics are also related to other disorders. In order to rectify the same, other expensive and lengthy tests need to be done which leads to further delay in accurate diagnosis and which may prove detrimental. In an attempt to find the solution to this problem, this paper proposes a method that uses feature fusion for classification of microcytic hypochromia. Feature fusion means combining blood smear image features extracted by the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and clinical features from CBC test. This fused data-set is further used to predict microcytic hypochromia. After obtaining fused data set we use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce data set dimensions which further results in less computational overhead. To differentiate between microcytic hypochromia patients and normal persons, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network classification models are used. In order to check the performance of the above model, various evaluation metrics are used. Results achieved from the proposed method reflect that fused data set can effectively improve the identification ratio with a very limited number of patients diagnostic images and clinical data (10 for normal and 10 for beta-thalassemia) and feed-forward back-propagation neural network on this data set achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99%, 1.00, and 0.98, respectively. The limited number of patients reduces the system complexity and researcher's time for getting data from different hospital to train the network.

AB  - The delineation of the pathogenic interaction between the host skin immune responses and dermatophytes has remained indigent. The obscure enigma in host-dermatophyte immunopathogenic interactions is the T regulatory (Treg) and T-helper (Th) 17 cell role in maintaining immune homeostasis. We attempted to understand the regulation and recognition of lineage-specific response in chronic dermatophytic skin infection patients. The percentages of Th17 (CD4(+)CD161(+)IL23R(+)) and Treg (CD4(+)CD25(+) FoxP3(+)) cell subpopulations in the peripheral circulation of thirty chronic dermatophytic skin infection patients and twenty healthy individuals was determined. The serum cytokine levels were estimated for disease correlation. The mean duration of the disease was 10.68 +/- 8.72 months, with Trichophyton mentagrophytes complex as the major pathogen. Total serum IgE level of patients was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (305 +/- 117 vs 98.53 +/- 54.55 IU/ml; p < 0.01). Expression of Th17 and Treg cell markers on CD4(+) T cells was significantly elevated in patients than controls (p < 0.05). Comparatively, serum interleukin (IL)-4 and interferon (IFN)-gamma levels were increased, with low IL-10 levels in patients. Our data envisages a complex immune dysfunction in chronic dermatophytosis, arising either as a result of dermatophyte exposure or paradoxical precedence of disease establishment. Designing new treatment strategies and preventing recurrences are challenges for future research.

AB  - Background Neurocritical care is devoted to the care of critically ill patients with acute neurological or neurosurgical emergencies. There is limited information regarding epidemiological data, disease characteristics, variability of clinical care, and in-hospital mortality of neurocritically ill patients worldwide. We addressed these issues in the Point PRevalence In Neurocritical CarE (PRINCE) study, a prospective, cross-sectional, observational study. Methods We recruited patients from various intensive care units (ICUs) admitted on a pre-specified date, and the investigators recorded specific clinical care activities they performed on the subjects during their first 7 days of admission or discharge (whichever came first) from their ICUs and at hospital discharge. In this manuscript, we analyzed the final data set of the study that included patient admission characteristics, disease type and severity, ICU resources, ICU and hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality. We present descriptive statistics to summarize data from the case report form. We tested differences between geographically grouped data using parametric and nonparametric testing as appropriate. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to evaluate factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Results We analyzed data from 1545 patients admitted to 147 participating sites from 31 countries of which most were from North America (69%, N = 1063). Globally, there was variability in patient characteristics, admission diagnosis, ICU treatment team and resource allocation, and in-hospital mortality. Seventy-three percent of the participating centers were academic, and the most common admitting diagnosis was subarachnoid hemorrhage (13%). The majority of patients were male (59%), a half of whom had at least two comorbidities, and median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13. Factors associated with in-hospital mortality included age (OR 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.04); lower GCS (OR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.16 for every point reduction in GCS); pupillary reactivity (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.09 to 3.23 for bilateral unreactive pupils); admission source (emergency room versus direct admission [OR 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.75]; admission from a general ward versus direct admission [OR 5.85; 95% CI, 2.75 to 12.45; and admission from another ICU versus direct admission [OR 3.34; 95% CI, 1.27 to 8.8]); and the absence of a dedicated neurocritical care unit (NCCU) (OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.04 to 2.47). Conclusion PRINCE is the first study to evaluate care patterns of neurocritical patients worldwide. The data suggest that there is a wide variability in clinical care resources and patient characteristics. Neurological severity of illness and the absence of a dedicated NCCU are independent predictors of in-patient mortality.

AB  - Women with PCOS are linked to insulin resistance, inflammation, and vitamin D (VD) deficiency. The study endeavors to comprehend the differential impact of insulin sensitizers vs. anti-androgen on serum leptin levels among women with PCOS rendered vitamin D replete with high VD oral supplement. This was open-labeled randomized study that screened 180 eligible women presenting to Endocrine clinic with oligomenorrhea or features of hyperandrogenism. Ninety-nine women who furnished written informed consent and fulfilled the Rotterdam 2003 criteria for diagnosis of PCOS were randomized into 3 drug treatment arms to receive either spironolactone (50 mg/d; n=30), metformin (1000 mg/d; n=30) or pioglitazone (30 mg/d; n=30). These women were also administered oral VD (4000 IU/day) in addition to the allocated drug for a period of 6 months. Detailed history, clinical examination, and laboratory evaluation was carried out at baseline and 6 months after intervention. Number of menstrual cycles/year increased while as Ferriman-Gallwey score, blood glucose, HOMA-IR, and plasma insulin levels significantly decreased in all the three arms with better outcomes in spironolactone and pioglitazone arms (p<0.05). Similarly, serum leptin levels superiorly improved in spironolactone and pioglitazone group. Pioglitazone group showed better efficacy in lowering serum total testosterone (p<0.05). Co-supplementation of high dosage VD with spironolactone or pioglitazone are more effective in reducing plasma leptin levels than metformin, and thus might prove to be better therapeutic strategies for women with PCOS.

To determine its significance in epilepsy-associated inflammation and response to antiepileptic drug (AED), we evaluated the plasma PGE(2) (median, pg/ml) levels in drug-free patients with epilepsy (N = 34) and patients receiving AED monotherapy (N = 55) in addition to that in healthy controls (N = 34). When compared to controls, plasma PGE(2) levels were significantly elevated in all drug-free patients independent of the type of epilepsy (137.2 versus 475.7 pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Among the patients receiving AED monotherapy, only valproate responders showed a significant decrease compared to both drug-free patients (232.1 versus 475.7 pg/ml, p < 0.01) as well as valproate non-responders (232.1 versus 611.9 pg/ml, p < 0.0001). Both responders and non-responders on phenytoin or carbamazepine monotherapy had elevated PGE(2) levels similar to drug-free patients. In addition, no difference was observed in plasma profiles of PGE(2) precursor, arachidonic acid among the groups. Our work presents the clinical evidence of the association between plasma PGE(2) levels and valproate efficacy in patients with epilepsy.

AB  - Objective: Cerebrovascular accidents are the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide. We hypothesized that cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (ctDCS) of the dentate nuclei and the lower-limb representations in the cerebellum can improve functional reach during standing balance in chronic (>6 months' post-stroke) stroke survivors. Materials and Methods: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based subject-specific electric field was computed across a convenience sample of 10 male chronic (>6 months) stroke survivors and one healthy MRI template to find an optimal bipolar bilateral ctDCS montage to target dentate nuclei and lower-limb representations (lobules VII-IX). Then, in a repeated-measure crossover study on a subset of 5 stroke survivors, we compared 15 min of 2 mA ctDCS based on the effects on successful functional reach (%) during standing balance task. Three-way ANOVA investigated the factors of interest- brain regions, montages, stroke participants, and their interactions. Results: "One-size-fits-all" bipolar ctDCS montage for the clinical study was found to be PO9h-PO10h for dentate nuclei and Exx7-Exx8 for lobules VII-IX with the contralesional anode. PO9h-PO10h ctDCS performed significantly (alpha = 0.05) better in facilitating successful functional reach (%) when compared to Exx7-Exx8 ctDCS. Furthermore, a linear relationship between successful functional reach (%) and electric field strength was found where PO9h-PO10h montage resulted in a significantly (alpha = 0.05) higher electric field strength when compared to Exx7-Exx8 montage for the same 2 mA current. Conclusion: We presented a rational neuroimaging based approach to optimize deep ctDCS of the dentate nuclei and lower limb representations in the cerebellum for post-stroke balance rehabilitation. However, this promising pilot study was limited by "one-size-fits-all" bipolar ctDCS montage as well as a small sample size.

AB  - Background Mental disorders are among the leading causes of non-fatal disease burden in India, but a systematic understanding of their prevalence, disease burden, and risk factors is not readily available for each state of India. In this report, we describe the prevalence and disease burden of each mental disorder for the states of India, from 1990 to 2017.
   Methods We used all accessible data from multiple sources to estimate the prevalence of mental disorders, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by these disorders for all the states of India from 1990 to 2017, as part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We assessed the heterogeneity and time trends of mental disorders across the states of India. We grouped states on the basis of their Socio-demographic Index (SDI), which is a composite measure of per-capita income, mean education, and fertility rate in women younger than 25 years. We also assessed the association of major mental disorders with suicide deaths. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.
   Findings In 2017, 197.3 million (95% UI 178.4-216.4) people had mental disorders in India, including 45.7 million (42.4-49.8) with depressive disorders and 44.9 million (41.2-48.9) with anxiety disorders. We found a significant, but modest, correlation between the prevalence of depressive disorders and suicide death rate at the state level for females (r(2)=0.33, p=0.0009) and males (r(2)=0.19, p=0.015). The contribution of mental disorders to the total DALYs in India increased from 2.5% (2.0-3.1) in 1990 to 4.7% (3.7-5.6) in 2017. In 2017, depressive disorders contributed the most to the total mental disorders DALYs (33.8%, 29.5-38.5), followed by anxiety disorders (19.0%, 15.9-22.4), idiopathic developmental intellectual disability (IDID; 10.8%, 6.3-15.9), schizophrenia (9.8%, 7.7-12.4), bipolar disorder (6.9%, 4.9-9.6), conduct disorder (5.9%, 4.0-8.1), autism spectrum disorders (3.2%, 2.7-3.8), eating disorders (2.2%, 1.7-2.8), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; 0.3%, 0.2-0.5); other mental disorders comprised 8.0% (6.1-10.1) of DALYs. Almost all (>99.9%) of these DALYs were made up of YLDs. The DALY rate point estimates of mental disorders with onset predominantly in childhood and adolescence (IDID, conduct disorder, autism spectrum disorders, and ADHD) were higher in low SDI states than in middle SDI and high SDI states in 2017, whereas the trend was reversed for mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood. Although the prevalence of mental disorders with onset in childhood and adolescence decreased in India from 1990 to 2017, with a stronger decrease in high SDI and middle SDI states than in low SDI states, the prevalence of mental disorders that manifest predominantly during adulthood increased during this period.
   Interpretation One in seven Indians were affected by mental disorders of varying severity in 2017. The proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990. Substantial variations exist between states in the burden from different mental disorders and in their trends over time. These state-specific trends of each mental disorder reported here could guide appropriate policies and health system response to more effectively address the burden of mental disorders in India.

AB  - Type 1 reactions (T1R) an inflammatory condition, of local skin patches in 30-40% leprosy patients during the course of MDT. IL-17A and IL-17F play an important role in regulating skin inflammation through neutrophils. In the present study, we have analyzed 18 of each T1R and Non-reactions (NR) patients through flow cytometry and qPCR. Interestingly we found that, CD3(+) CD4(+) gated IL-17A(+)IL-17F(+) cells were significantly high in T1R in both MLSA stimulated PBMCs and skin lesions as compared to NR leprosy patients. Hierarchical clustering analysis of gene expression showed that CXCL6, CXCL5, CCL20, CCL7, MMP13 and IL-17RB expression were significantly associated with IL-17A and IL-17F expression (Spearman r(2) = 0.77 to 0.98), neutrophils and monocyte markers respectively. In this study, the inflammation noted in lesions of T1R is a different phenotype of Th17 which produce double positive IL-17A(+)IL17F(+) and also contributes IL-17 producing neutrophils and thus would be useful for monitoring, diagnosis and treatment response before reactions episodes.

TI  - Indian Guidelines for Indications and Timing of Intervention for Common Congenital Heart Diseases: Revised and Updated Consensus Statement of the Working Group on Management of Congenital Heart Diseases. Abridged Secondary Publication
T2  - INDIAN PEDIATRICS
AB  - Justification A number of guidelines are available for management of congenital heart diseases from infancy to adult life. However, these guidelines are for patients living in high income countries. Separate guidelines, applicable to Indian children, are required when recommending an intervention for congenital heart diseases, as often these patients present late in the course of the disease and may have co-existing morbidities and malnutrition. Process Guidelines emerged following expert deliberations at the National Consensus Meeting on Management of Congenital Heart Diseases in India, held on 10th and 11th of August 2018 at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The meeting was supported by Children's HeartLink, a non-governmental organization based in Minnesota, USA. Objectives To frame evidence based guidelines for (i) indications and optimal timing of intervention in common congenital heart diseases; (ii) follow-up protocols for patients who have undergone cardiac surgery/catheter interventions for congenital heart diseases. Recommendations Evidence based recommendations are provided for indications and timing of intervention in common congenital heart diseases, including left-to-right shunts (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and others), obstructive lesions (pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis and coarctation of aorta) and cyanotic congenital heart diseases (tetralogy of Fallot, transposition of great arteries, univentricular hearts, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, Ebstein anomaly and others). In addition, protocols for follow-up of post surgical patients are also described, disease wise.

AB  - Childhood blindness causes significant social and economic burden. Even though pediatric eye care has gained priority under Vision 2020, it continues to come under the purview of tertiary care centers due to lack of knowhow and facilities at primary and secondary level. Currently, India does not have standard guidelines on pediatric eye examination, refraction, and amblyopia management and therefore these are being managed inadequately or inappropriately. In view of this, an expert group of pediatric ophthalmologists from across the country met under the aegis of All India Ophthalmological Society, and deliberated to reach a consensus on the correct method of pediatric eye examination, treating refractive error in children and managing amblyopia. The purpose of the consensus statement was to enable all ophthalmologists to have a broad set of guidelines, which can form the basic framework for managing common pediatric eye conditions, in most ophthalmic setups. The consensus statement is divided into three broad categories: Pediatric eye examination, pediatric refraction, and amblyopia management. The pediatric eye exam subsection discusses the recommended clinical history, which should be taken and the essential components of an ophthalmic examination including pediatric vision assessment. Additionally, it discusses the role of special tests and investigations such as imaging and electrophysiology. The section on pediatric refraction emphasizes the correct use of cycloplegia and prescribing glasses in the Indian context. The final section on amblyopia management presents the various options of treating amblyopia and provides standard guidelines for the use of occlusion therapy and its weaning over time.

AB  - To compare the efficacy of low dose fentanyl infusion and 24% oral sucrose in providing optimal pain relief during laser for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), we enrolled fifty-eight spontaneously breathing preterm infants undergoing laser. The preterm infants were randomized to either fentanyl infusion (1 mcg/kg/hr) or 24% oral sucrose (2 ml). We evaluated and compared the proportion of time spent crying during the procedure, salivary cortisol before and after the procedure, premature infant pain profile- revised (PIPP-R) scores during the procedure, apnoea during and after the procedure, need for mechanical ventilation, and feed intolerance and urinary retention 24 h after the procedure between the two groups. We found that the proportion of time spent crying during the procedure was significantly less in the fentanyl group [62.5% (50.7-74.2) vs 73.8% (55.6-83.4); P = 0.02]. Average PIPP-R score during the procedure was significantly less in the fentanyl group [7.2 vs 9.0; (mean difference of - 1.8; P = 0.01)]. There was no difference in other outcomes between the two groups. Conclusion: During laser for ROP, low dose fentanyl infusion was found to be efficacious in reducing pain as compared with 24% sucrose.What is Known:center dot Preterm infants undergoing laser photocoagulation for ROP suffer significant amount of pain.center dot Standard of care for pain relief in infants undergoing laser therapy in developed countries is general anesthesia (GA) or combination of sedation, analgesia, and paralysis (SAP).What is New:center dot During laser photocoagulation for ROP, fentanyl infusion at low dose (1 mcg/kg/hr) is efficacious in reducing pain as compared to 24% oral sucrose.

AB  - Mother is the major source of minerals in foetal life with placenta actively transporting against a concentration and electrochemical gradient. The foetal serum mineral concentration is thereby higher as compared to maternal values, which possibly help in its rapid accretion in developing bones and for counteracting postnatal fall in calcium levels at birth. Parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) play a major role in mineral physiology during foetal life with hormones like calcitriol, calcitonin, FGF-23 and sex steroids having minimal role. PTHrP and PTH also play a major role in endochondral bone formation and mineralization of skeleton. At the birth, as the cord is clamped, there is loss of active transport of minerals through placenta and the neonate has to rely on enteral intake of minerals to meet the demands of growing bones and metabolisms. The calcium levels fall after birth, reaching a nadir at 24-48 h and gradually rise to adult values over several days, probably resulting from a fall in PTHrP levels and hyporesponsiveness of parathyroid glands. As PTH and calcitriol levels increase postnatally, there is a rise in calcium levels with maturation in functioning of kidneys and intestines. However, there may be significant delay in intestinal maturation in preterm infants along with an increased demand for mineral accretion, which predispose them to osteopenia of prematurity.

AB  - Mitigation of air pollution by plants is a well-established phenomenon. Trees planted on the roadside are known to reduce particulate matter pollution by about 25%. In an urban ecosystem, especially in a metropolitan city such as Delhi, roadside trees are constantly exposed to air pollution. We, therefore, evaluated the effect of air pollution on a common Indian roadside tree, Neem (Azadirachta indica), and its associated microbes in areas with high and low levels of particulate matter (PM) pollution in Delhi. We hypothesized that alteration in the air quality index not only influences plant physiology but also its microbiome.
   A 100-fold increase in the number of epiphytic and 10-100 fold increase in endophytic colonies were found with 1.7 times increase in the level of pollutants. Trees in the polluted areas had an abundance of Salmonella, Proteus and Citrobacter, and showed increased secondary metabolites such as phenols and tannins as well as decreased chlorophyll and carotenoid. The number of unique microbes was positively correlated with increased primary metabolites.
   Our study thus indicates that, alteration in air quality affects the natural micro-environment of plants. These results may be utilized as sustainable tools for studying plant adaptations to the urban ecosystem. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: An Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) available in community could be a potential primary eye care (PEC) worker. Training programme for ASHAs on PEC was undertaken & evaluated in a district of a capital city. Methods: ASHAs selected randomly from a district were imparted one day training on PEC & expected to refer patients to nearby Vision Centres (VC). Their knowledge was assessed before & after training and re-evaluated 1 year later. ASHAs were asked to conduct vision screening of 40+ population in their areas and ASHA referrals were noted by Optometrist in VC. Focus Group Discussions (FGD) of ASHAs were held to find barriers & facilitating factors in engaging ASHAs in PEC. Training was evaluated using Kirkpatrick's evaluation model for measuring reactions, learning, behaviour and results. Results: Mean knowledge score increased from 14.96 (+/- 4.34) pre-training to 25.38 (+/- 3.48) post- training and sustained at 21.75 (+/- 4.16) at 1year. Monthly average OPD of vision centres increased by 23.6% after ASHA training. FGDs revealed that ASHAs were willing to work in eye care for awareness generation and patient facilitation but were hesitant in conducting vision screening. Conclusion: ASHAs can be trained as PEC workers provided they have adequate support.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the long-term outcome of 'bleb-sparing epithelial exchange' surgery for dysfunctional filtering blebs in paediatric and adult eyes. Methods Patients who had undergone bleb revision >= 5 years back and were on regular follow-up were included. Age, ocular diagnosis, details of primary filtering surgery including mitomycin-C (MMC) usage, indication and year of bleb revision were recorded. After bleb revision, the mean intraocular pressure (IOP), glaucoma medications and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) up to 5 years were noted. On last review, clinical details, bleb characteristics and swept source anterior segment tomographic (SSOCT) assessment of bleb were recorded. Comparative analysis of paediatric and adult eyes was performed. Main outcome measures Change in IOP and BCVA. 'Complete success' was defined as IOP >= 6 to <= 18mmHg without use of any topical glaucoma medications and 'Qualified success' when >= 1 topical glaucoma medication(s) was required. Results A total of 51 eyes of 51 consecutive patients were studied, among which 22 were children. The mean duration between filtering surgery and bleb revision was 4.54 +/- 1.53 years in paediatric and 6.48 +/- 3.5 years in the adult group, p = 0.04. Children underwent trabeculotomy + trabeculectomy with 0.04% MMC, while adults underwent trabeculectomy with 0.02% MMC. The mean pre-revision IOP was 6.38 +/- 2.80 and 6.51 +/- 2.78 mmHg in the paediatric and adult group respectively, p = 0.86. At 3 months post-revision, it increased to 11.81 +/- 3.48 and 12.75 +/- 3.52 mmHg respectively (p < 0.001). At final review, mean IOP of paediatric group was 10.90 +/- 2.59 and adult group was 11.86 +/- 2.66 mmHg, p = 0.20. At 5 years, complete success was 68.18% and 72.41%, and qualified success was 31.87% and 27.59% in the former and latter group respectively, p = 0.49. No failures were seen. Kaplan-Meier probability at 5 years for IOP target <= 18, <= 15 and <= 12 in children was 95.45%, 63.64% and 50% and in adults 93.10%, 65.52% and 41.38% respectively. BCVA improved up to 1 year in paediatric group, with continued improvement in adults up to 3 years. SSOCT measured bleb height was 0.88 +/- 0.37 and 1.32 +/- 0.49mm in children versus adults (p = 0.006) and wall thickness, 0.35 +/- 0.22 and 0.58 +/- 0.24mm respectively, p = 0.008. Conclusion Bleb-sparing epithelial exchange is an equally safe and effective technique with good long-term success in both paediatric and adult dysfunctional blebs.

AB  - Objective To compare the effect of the application of three growth references (Agarwal, 1992; Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP), 2015; and World Health Organisation (WHO), 2007) on interpretation of anthropometric parameters in schoolchildren. Setting Cross-sectional school-based study. Participants Children 8-15 years studying in one government school and one private school of Delhi. Procedure The age- and gender-specific standard deviation scores of height-for-age and BMI-for-age were estimated for each student enrolled, using the three growth references independently. Main outcome measure The proportion of children with short stature, thinness and overweight/ obesity determined by each growth reference were compared. Results A total of 1237 students participated in the study. A significantly higher proportion of children (both sexes) were classified to have short stature using WHO 2007 reference (8.8%) as compared to the Agarwal (3.3%) charts and IAP, 2015 references (3.6%). The combined prevalence of overweight and obesity was highest (34.8%) by the IAP, 2015 reference as against 32% by Agarwal charts and 29.1% by WHO, 2007 reference. Good agreement existed between the IAP, 2015 reference and Agarwal charts in classifying subjects into different BMI categories (Kappa=0.82) and short stature (Kappa=0.99). Conclusions In view of differences noted, use of national population derived reference data is suggested to correctly define growth trajectories in children.

AB  - Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed on the endothelial cells of tumor-associated neovasculature of various nonprostatic benign and malignant neoplasms. Positive uptake on PET/CT imaging with Ga-68-labeled PSMA is noted in a patient with juvenile nasal angiofibroma, and the same is noted to be absent following complete surgical excision. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT may be a useful tool for juvenile nasal angiofibroma recurrence identification and in differentiating recurrence from surgical site reparative tissue.

AB  - Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity persists as a clinical problem despite several supportive measures to alleviate renal damage. Daidzein (DZ), a dietary isoflavone having antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, is investigated in this study for protective effects against cisplatin-induced renal injury in rats. DZ (25, 50, or 100mg/kg; intraperitoneally; 10 days) was administered along with Cisplatin, single dose, on the 7th day of the experiment. On the 11th day, the rats were euthanized, and different samples were collected for analysis. Biochemical, histopathological, and molecular parameters were assessed to evaluate the effect of daidzein. Cisplatin injection resulted in renal dysfunction, lipid peroxidation that led to consumption of antioxidants, exaggerated apoptosis, and inflammation. These changes were associated with increase in the signaling proteins. DZ attenuated the toxic effects of cisplatin on the kidney at 100mg/kg dose. The study concludes with the finding that daidzein imparts protection against the nephrotoxic effect of Cisplatin and can be considered as a novel, potential therapy.

AB  - Background: Hypoxia reportedly increases free radical generation in the body, causing oxidative stress and inhibiting beta 2-AR signaling. The present study correlates the prophylactic potential of quercetin and salbutamol in ameliorating fluid clearing capacity of lungs by re-sensitizing beta 2-AR signaling under hypoxia.
   Methods: Male SD rats supplemented orally with quercetin (50 mg/Kg BW), and salbutamol (2 mg/Kg BW) were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at 7620 m for 6 h. Western blotting and ELISA quantitated NF kappa B and related genes and GPCR pathway proteins. The binding affinities of drugs with receptor were determined by SPR spectroscopy and further confirmed insilico.
   Results: Quercetin and salbutamol pre-treatment significantly up-regulated the expressions of beta 2-AR, GPR-1, GPR-10, GCS alpha, cAMP content, and down-regulated GRK-2, beta-arrestin, ROS, NF kappa B (p < 0.001), thus, enhancing alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). SPR and insilico findings revealed a higher binding affinity of beta 2-AR with quercetin over salbutamol.
   Conclusion: Results indicated quercetin to be a better prophylactic that augmented AFC in rats exposed to hypoxia by attenuating inflammation and stimulating beta 2-AR.

AB  - Childhood blindness is one of the priority targets of Vision 2020-Right To Sight due to its impact on the psychological and social growth of the child. An extensive search was performed to locate research papers on childhood blindness prevalence and its causes in the community based and blind schools, respectively, conducted from 1990 onward up to the present. Cross references were also manually searched along with expert consultation to enlarge the reference data. A total of five community-based studies on the prevalence including two refractive error studies conducted all over India in children less than 16 years were found. The causes of childhood blindness from the available blind school studies revealed that causes of childhood blindness have mainly shifted from corneal causes to whole globe abnormalities. This article highlights that though with the availability of proper healthcare facilities, the trend is changing for the causes but still a lot of effort in the form of timely neonatal eye care facilities, pediatric surgical services and proper refraction strategies is required.

AB  - Objectives To develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Design A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process. Methods The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, "in our practice" statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. Results The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 49 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, "in our practice" statements were provided. In addition, 52 research priorities were identified. Conclusions A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.

AB  - Objectives: To develop evidence-based recommendations for clinicians caring for children (including infants, school-aged children, and adolescents) with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction.
   Design: A panel of 49 international experts, representing 12 international organizations, as well as three methodologists and three public members was convened. Panel members assembled at key international meetings (for those panel members attending the conference), and a stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in November 2018. A formal conflict-of-interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among the chairs, co-chairs, methodologists, and group heads, as well as within subgroups, served as an integral part of the guideline development process.
   Methods: The panel consisted of six subgroups: recognition and management of infection, hemodynamics and resuscitation, ventilation, endocrine and metabolic therapies, adjunctive therapies, and research priorities. We conducted a systematic review for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes question to identify the best available evidence, statistically summarized the evidence, and then assessed the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. We used the evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or as a best practice statement. In addition, "in our practice" statements were included when evidence was inconclusive to issue a recommendation, but the panel felt that some guidance based on practice patterns may be appropriate. Results: The panel provided 77 statements on the management and resuscitation of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. Overall, six were strong recommendations, 52 were weak recommendations, and nine were best-practice statements. For 13 questions, no recommendations could be made; but, for 10 of these, "in our practice" statements were provided. In addition, 49 research priorities were identified.
   Conclusions: A large cohort of international experts was able to achieve consensus regarding many recommendations for the best care of children with sepsis, acknowledging that most aspects of care had relatively low quality of evidence resulting in the frequent issuance of weak recommendations. Despite this challenge, these recommendations regarding the management of children with septic shock and other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction provide a foundation for consistent care to improve outcomes and inform future research.

AB  - Aerosol emissions from vehicles have been linked to changes in heart rate variability (HRV) parameters of the susceptible population in developed countries. In the present study, the effects of vehicular emission and resuspended road dust on HRV parameters in healthy adults (18-43 years of age) were assessed at Delhi, India, a metro city where the world's largest youth population 356 million of age group 10-24 years resides as per census report of 2011. The study presents personal exposure concentration of fine particulate matter (PM1 and PM2.5) at a road site in Delhi and its link with the changes in HRV parameters. The mixed effect model treated particulate matter (PM) mass concentration, age of participants, body mass index, and climatic parameters (ambient temperature and relative humidity) as independent variables and HRV parameters as dependent variables. The observed data showed that per inter quartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 resulted in a considerable decrease in the HRV indices: percentage of successive NN-intervals that differ from each other by greater than 50 ms (pNN50) [- 26.6% (- 40.52, - 1.29)], root mean square of differences between successive NN-intervals (r-MSSD) [- 9.8% (- 17.53, 1.32)] and high-frequency power (HF) [- 15.6% (- 27.61, 2.89)], and considerable increase in low frequency (LF) by HF ratio [24.0% (0.95, 45.39)]. Greater changes were seen in most of the HRV parameters for PM2.5 as compared to PM1, probably due to the presence of fine dust along with vehicle emissions which aggravate the effect. The change in HRV parameters is considered as a powerful and independent predictor of changes in cardiac autonomic nervous system. The trend observed in the present study was in congruence with that observed in previous studies except for LF, and the reductions in HRV indices were well within the range when compared with literature. But still the impact on HRV was significant which raises a concern for the healthy population which forms a large portion of the society. Also, in light of the limited evidence on the effect of PM1 on cardiac health, the present study summarized that PM1 has a significant impact on HRV too which is of concern due to its high contribution to total PM.

AB  - Introduction This study was designed to investigate the effectiveness of a video-based lifestyle education program (VBLEP) in improving glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with usual care. Methods Patients on stable oral glucose-lowering agents for at least 3 months and HbA1c 7.5-10% were randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Primary outcome measure was the difference in change in mean HbA1c between groups. Results The participants (n = 81) had mean (+/- SD) age of 50.1 (+/- 9.4) years and HbA1c of 8.5 +/- 0.7% (68.87 +/- 7.56 mmol/mol). The follow-up data were available in 96% (78/81) of participants. Of 40 participants, 36 (90%) attended >= 75% (>= 3 out of 4) of the sessions in the VBLEP. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a significant reduction [0.6% 95% CI (0.1, 1.1), p = 0.013] in HbA1c was seen in the VBLEP group compared with usual care. A >= 1% reduction in HbA1c was observed in 39.5% of participants in the VBLEP compared with 15% in the usual care arm. However, a >= 0.5% reduction in HbA1c was observed in 65.8% of participants in the VBLEP compared with 37.5% in the usual care arm (p = 0.012). There was a significant change in weight and body mass index in the VBLEP group compared with usual care. The participants who were employed, had a family history of diabetes, had no diabetes-related complications, and were in the VBLEP group had higher odds of having a favorable HbA1c reduction (>= 0.5%, combined analysis both groups) from baseline. Conclusion The VBLEP demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant HbA1c reduction compared with usual care. A simple VBLEP, when delivered in an interactive manner, can aid in improving glycemic outcomes in the Indian population.

AB  - Objective The aim of the present study was to evaluate polymorphisms of fat mass and obesity (FTO; rs9939609) and vitamin D receptor (VDR, FokI (rs2228570), BsmI (rs1544410), ApaI (rs7975232), and TaqI (rs731236)] genes on weight loss after lifestyle interventions in Asian Indians. Methods In this 6-month pre-post intervention trial, 110 overweight/obese men and women underwent diet and exercise interventions for 180 days resulting in reduction in body weight, (5.1 kg, p < 0.001), waist circumference, and skinfolds. Results Association of the following genotypes was seen in those with >= 5% weight loss: TT of FTO polymorphism; 35 (81.4%) [OR (95% CI) AT, 2.5 (0.6, 10.9); TT, 6.9 (1.6, 28.2); with reference to AA], tt of VDRTaqII polymorphism, 12 (92.3%) [OR (95% CI); tt, 32.2 (2.4, 436.4); TT, 0.5 (0.08, 3.1); all with reference to Tt], bb of VDRBsmI polymorphism; 27 (65.8%) [OR (95% CI) Bb, 0.2 (0.04, 0.9); bb, 10.6 (0.9, 120.3); all with reference to BB] after adjusting for other genotypes. Further, analysis of combined influence of genotypes conferring maximum weight loss showed that the following had high odds of >= 5% weight loss: (1) TT of FTO gene in combination with BB/Bb of VDRBsmI and TT/Tt of VDRTaqI [OR (95% CI) 5.1 (1.5, 17.4)], (2) bb of BsmI and AA/AT of FTO and tt of TaqI [OR (95% CI) 3.2 (0.3, 31.7)], and (3) bb of BsmI plus TT of FTO and tt of TaqI. Conclusions The above observations suggest a significant and independent role of the genotypes of FTO and VDR in influencing weight loss after lifestyle intervention in Asian Indians.

Methods All the cases were evaluated using Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MS-MLPA) of 11p15.5 region to detect the abnormal methylation status of ICR1 (H19DR) and ICR2 (KvDMR) regions. Results The median age at diagnosis was 5.7 mo (range 1.5-13 mo) with female preponderance. Macroglossia, ear creases and abdominal wall defects were the major features. Hypomethylation at ICR2 and hypermethylation at ICR1 was observed in 6/8 and 2/8 patients respectively. No specific genotype and phenotype correlation was observed. Conclusions This report highlights the major clinical features of BWS that should prompt pediatricians to offer genetic testing to evaluate the epigenetic abnormalities using MS-MLPA, as it not only helps in appropriate counseling but also provides further guidance about the tumor risk surveillance.

AB  - India is home to nearly 200 million undernourished people, yet little is known about the characteristics of those experiencing food insecurity, especially among urban households. The objectives of this study were: (1) to report the prevalence of food insecurity in two large, population-based representative samples in urban India, (2) to describe socio-economic correlates of food insecurity in this context, and (3) to compare the dietary intake of adults living in food insecure households to that of adults living in food secure households. Data are from 4334 households participating in an ongoing population-based cohort study of a representative sample of Delhi and Chennai, India. The most recent wave of data (2017-2018) were analyzed. Food insecurity was measured using the 9-item Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) and dietary intake using a 33-item qualitative food frequency questionnaire. The overall prevalence of food insecurity was 8.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.8-10.2); 15.2% (95% CI 12.0-18.4) of the poorest households (lowest wealth index tertile) were food insecure compared to 1.7% (95% CI 1.0-2.3) of the wealthiest households (highest wealth index tertile). Participants experiencing food insecurity were significantly younger and more likely to be from Delhi compared to Chennai. After adjustment for socio-economic factors (city, age, sex, education, wealth index, fuel used for cooking, and source of drinking water), participants experiencing food insecurity had significantly higher meat, poultry, roots and tubers (potato), and sugar sweetened beverage intakes, and lower vegetables, fruit, dairy, and nut intakes. Food insecurity is highly prevalent among the poorest households in urban India and is associated with intake of a number of unhealthy dietary items.

AB  - Musa balbisiana Colla (Family: Musaceae), commonly known as banana and native to India and other parts of Asia, is very rich in nutritional value and has strong antioxidant potential. In the present study, we have developed Musa balbisiana (MB) fruit pulp powder and evaluated its cardioprotective effect in cardiac hypertrophy, which is often associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. An ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) has been used for the detection and systematic characterization of the phenolic compounds present in Musa balbisiana fruit pulp. The cardioprotective effect of MB was evaluated in a rat model of isoproterenol- (ISO-) induced cardiac hypertrophy by subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol (5 mg/kg(-1)/day(-1)), delivered through an alzet minipump for 14 days. Oral administration of MB fruit pulp powder (200 mg/kg/day) significantly (p<0.001) decreased heart weight/tail length ratio and cardiac hypertrophy markers like ANP, BNP, beta-MHC, and collagen-1 gene expression. MB also attenuated ISO-induced cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress. The in vivo data were further confirmed in vitro in H9c2 cells where the antihypertrophic and anti-inflammatory effect of the aqueous extract of MB was observed in the presence of ISO and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), respectively. This study strongly suggests that supplementation of dried Musa balbisiana fruit powder can be useful for the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy via the inhibition of inflammation and oxidative stress.

AB  - Fusion transcripts can contribute to diversity of molecular networks in the human cortex. In this study, we explored the occurrence of fusion transcripts in normal human cortex along with single neurons and astrocytes. We identified 1305 non-redundant fusion events from 388 transcriptomes representing 59 human cortices and 329 single cells. Our results indicate while the majority of fusion transcripts in human cortex are intra-chromosomal (85%), events found in single neurons and astrocytes were primarily inter-chromosomal (80%). The number of fusions in single neurons was significantly higher than that in single astrocytes (p < 0.05), indicating fusion as a possible contributor towards transcriptome diversity in neuronal cells. The identified fusions were largely private and 4 specific recurring events were found both in cortex and in single neurons but not in astrocytes. We found a significant increase in the number of fusion transcripts in human brain with increasing age both in single cells and whole cortex (p < 0.0005 and < 0.005, respectively). This is likely one of the many possible contributors for the inherent plasticity of the adult brain. The fusion transcripts in fetal brain were enriched for genes for long-term depression; while those in adult brain involved genes enriched for long-term potentiation pathways. Our findings demonstrate fusion transcripts are naturally occurring phenomenon spanning across the health-disease continuum, and likely contribute to the diverse molecular network of human brain.

AB  - Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is involved in numerous pathophysiological processes and shares overlapping functions with CO and center dot NO. However, the importance of host-derived H2S in microbial pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show that Mtb-infected mice deficient in the H2S-producing enzyme cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) survive longer with reduced organ burden, and that pharmacological inhibition of CBS reduces Mtb bacillary load in mice. High-resolution respirometry, transcriptomics and mass spectrometry establish that H2S stimulates Mtb respiration and bioenergetics predominantly via cytochrome bd oxidase, and that H2S reverses center dot NO-mediated inhibition of Mtb respiration. Further, exposure of Mtb to H2S regulates genes involved in sulfur and copper metabolism and the Dos regulon. Our results indicate that Mtb exploits host-derived H2S to promote growth and disease, and suggest that host-directed therapies targeting H2S production may be potentially useful for the management of tuberculosis and other microbial infections.

AB  - Objective To review systematically community-based primary care interventions for epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries to rationalize approaches and outcome measures in relation to epilepsy care in these countries. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Global Index Medicus, CINAHL, and Web of Science was undertaken to identify trials and implementation of provision of antiseizure medications, adherence reinforcement, and/or health care provider or community education in community-based samples of epilepsy. Data on populations addressed, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from eligible articles. Results The 24 reports identified comprise mostly care programs addressing active convulsive epilepsy. Phenobarbital has been used most frequently, although other conventional antiseizure medications (ASMs) have also been used, but none of the newer. Tolerability rates in these studies are high, but overall attrition is considerable. Other approaches include updating primary health care providers, reinforcing treatment adherence in clinics, and raising community awareness. In these programs, the coverage of existing treatment gap in the community, epilepsy-related mortality, and comorbidity burden are only fleetingly addressed. None, however, explicitly describe sustainability plans. Conclusions Cost-free provision, mostly of phenobarbital, has resulted in short-term seizure freedom in roughly half of the people with epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries. Future programs should include a range of ASMs. These should cover apart from seizure control and treatment adherence, primary health care provider education, community awareness, and referral protocols for specialist care. Programs should incorporate impact assessment at the local level. Sustainability in the long term as much as resilience and scalability should be addressed in future initiatives.

AB  - Background Overexpression of FAT1 gene and its oncogenic effects have been reported in several cancers. Previously, we have documented upregulation of FAT1 gene in glioblastoma (GBM) tumors which was found to increase the expression of proinflammatory markers, HIF-1 alpha, stemness genes and EMT markers in glioma cells. Here, we reveal NFkB (RelA)/RelA/p65 as the transcriptional regulator of FAT1 gene in GBM cells. Methods In-silico analysis of FAT1 gene promoter was performed using online bioinformatics tool Promo alggen (Transfac 8.3) to identify putative transcription factor(s) binding motifs. A 4.0 kb FAT1 promoter (- 3220 bp to + 848 bp w.r.t. TSS + 1) was cloned into promoter less pGL3Basic reporter vector. Characterization of FAT1 promoter for transcriptional regulation was performed by in-vitro functional assays using promoter deletion constructs, site directed mutagenesis and ChIP in GBM cells. Results Expression levels of NFkB (RelA) and FAT1 were found to be increased and positively correlated in GBM tumors (n = 16), REMBRANDT GBM-database (n = 214) and TCGA GBM-database (n = 153). In addition to glioma, positive correlation between NFkB (RelA) and FAT1 expression was also observed in other tumors like pancreatic, hepatocellular, lung and stomach cancers (data extracted from TCGA tumor data). A 4.0 kb FAT1-promoter-construct [- 3220 bp/+ 848 bp, transcription start site (TSS) + 1, having 17 NFkB (RelA) motifs] showed high FAT1 promoter luciferase-activity in GBM cells (U87MG/A172/U373MG). FAT1 promoter deletion-construct pGL3F1 [- 200 bp/+ 848 bp, with 3-NFkB (RelA)-motifs] showed the highest promoter activity. Exposure of GBM cells to known NFkB (RelA)-activators [severe-hypoxia/TNF-alpha/ectopic-NFkB (RelA) + IKBK vectors] led to increased pGL3F1-promoter activity and increased endogenous-FAT1 expression. Conversely, siRNA-mediated NFkB (RelA) knockdown led to decreased pGL3F1-promoter activity and decreased endogenous-FAT1 expression. Deletion of NFkB (RelA)-motif at - 90 bp/- 80 bp [pGL3F1 delta 1-construct] showed significant decrease in promoter activity. Site directed mutagenesis at -90 bp/- 80 bp and ChIP assay for endogenous-NFkB (RelA) confirmed the importance of this motif in FAT1 expression regulation. Significant reduction in the migration, invasion as well as colony forming capacity of the U87MG glioma cells was observed on siRNA-mediated knockdown of NFkB (RelA). Conclusion Since FAT1 and NFkB (RelA) are independently known to promote pro-tumorigenic inflammation and upregulate the expression of HIF-1 alpha/EMT/stemness in tumors, targeting the NFkB (RelA)-FAT1 axis may attenuate an important tumor-promoting pathway in GBM. This may also be applicable to other tumors.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to demonstrate the temporal profile of changes in heart rate variability (HRV), blood pressure variability (BPV), and cardiac baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) during the course of a healthy pregnancy. Materials and methods This was a longitudinal study during which autonomic variability parameters (HRV, BPV, BRS) were assessed in 66 pregnant women at 11-13, 20-22 and 30-32 weeks of gestation. A lead II electrocardiogram tracing and beat-to-beat blood pressure were recorded with the subject breathing spontaneously in the supine position. Changes in the parameters were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Results Overall HRV (SDNN; standard deviation of all NN intervals) was found to decrease significantly over the course of pregnancy (p < 0.05). Similarly, indices which represent the parasympathetic component of these variables (SDSD [standard deviation of differences between adjacent NN intervals]; pNN50 [NN50 count {number of pairs of adjacent NN intervals differing by more than 50 ms} divided by the total number of all NN intervals]; high-frequency [HF] power) were also found to decrease significantly from the first to third trimester of pregnancy (p < 0.05). Low-frequency (LF) power increased over the course of pregnancy (p < 0.05). The LF/HF ratio increased significantly from first to third trimester of pregnancy (median: 0.66 [first trimester] vs.1.02 [second] vs. 0.91 [third]; p < 0.05) Overall BPV increased during the course of pregnancy, with a significant rise in the HF component of BPV and a significant fall in the LF component of BPV with advancing gestation (p < 0.05). BRS decreased over the course of pregnancy (median: 16.31, interquartile range [IQR] 11.04-23.13 [first trimester] vs. 11.42, IQR 8.54-19.52 [second] vs. 8.84, IQR 7.15-12.45 [third] ms/mmHg; p < 0.05). Conclusion Pregnancy is associated with decreased vagal and increased sympathetic modulation of cardiac autonomic tone with advancing gestation, together with increased BPV. The reduction in cardiac BRS may play a role in increasing BPV and decreasing HRV over the course of pregnancy.

AB  - Introduction: The conventional model of abdominal anatomy described multiple mesenteries. Dissection techniques were based on this. Recent studies demonstrate the mesentery is continuous from duodenojejunal flexure to anorectal junction. Given this, it is important to update dissection techniques related to the mesentery in the cadaveric setting.
   Materials and Methods: A technique of mesenteric dissection was developed and tested in a cohort of 20 adult human cadavers (12 male and 8 female). As the technique enabled excision of the mesentery as a single unit, it was possible to characterize the anatomy of the ex vivo mesentery.
   Results: The technique developed enabled dissection of an intact and continuous mesentery in all cadavers examined. Examination of the ex vivo mesentery demonstrated that a mesoduodenum was present in all cases. The mesentery was continuous from the mesoduodenum to the mesorectum and ended at the level of the anorectal junction.
   Conclusions: A technique was developed that reproducibly enabled dissection of an intact and continuous mesentery from the duodenum to the anorectal junction. A mesoduodenum was consistently observed and noted to be in continuity with the remainder of the mesentery.

AB  - The contribution of miRNA in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC) has emerged in the past few decades. Differential miRNA expression has been demonstrated in UC patients, and their ability to target the genes involved in inflammatory pathway has also been explored in recent years. miR-125b and miR-223 have been demonstrated to get upregulated within the colonic mucosa of UC patients. Here, we explored the biological relevance of miR-125b and miR-223 altered expression during UC by identifying the potential gene targets for miR-125b and miR-223. TRAF6 and A20, the signaling molecules involved in the NF kappa B pathway, were identified as target genes for miR-125b while IKK alpha was identified as a gene target for miR-223. The colonic mucosal samples from UC patients exhibited a significant rise in miR-125b and miR-223 expression while a subsequent downregulation was observed in the expression of TRAF6, A20, and IKK alpha. This negative correlation between miRNAs and their respective target genes was validated by co-transfecting miR-125b and miR-223 in HT29 cells. Co-transfection with miR-125b resulted in a marked decline in the expression of TRAF6 and A20, while the miR-223 co-transfected cells exhibited lower IKK alpha expression levels. Additionally, co-transfection with miR-125b or miR-223 in HT29 cells caused higher p65 and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-8 and IL-1 beta) expression upon LPS stimulation. From our findings, we highlight the possible contribution of miR-125b and miR-223 in regulating the inflammatory response during UC by negatively regulating the expression of TRAF6, A20, and IKK alpha. Therefore, we conclude that these two miRNAs could be considered as potential candidates for developing promising biomarkers for screening and diagnosis of UC.

AB  - Purpose
   To determine the prevalence of cataract and its association with sun exposure and other environmental risk factors in three different geographically diverse populations of India.
   Design
   Population based cross sectional study during 2010-2016
   Participants
   People aged. 40 years residing in randomly sampled villages were enumerated (12021) and 9735 (81%) underwent ophthalmic evaluation from plains, hilly and coastal regions (3595, 3231, 2909 respectively)
   Methods
   A detailed questionnaire-based interview about outdoor activity in present, past and remote past, usage of sun protective measures, exposure to smoke, and detailed ophthalmic examination including assessment of uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity, measurement of intraocular pressure, slit lamp examination, lens opacities categorization using LOCS III and posterior segment evaluation was done. Lifetime effective sun exposure was calculated using Melbourne formula and expressed as quintiles. These were supplemented with physical environmental measurements.
   Main outcome measures
   Lifetime sun exposure hours, smoking, indoor kitchen smoke exposure and their association with cataract and subtypes. Prevalence of cataract calculated based on lens opacities or evidence of cataract surgery.
   Results
   Cataract was identified in 3231 (33.3%) participants. Prevalence of cataract in males (32.3%) and females (34.1%) was similar. Nuclear cataract was the commonest sub-type identified in 94.7% of affected eyes. Sun exposure had a significant association with cataract with odds ratio (OR) increasing from 1.6 (95% Confidence Intervals [CI]: 1.4, 1.9) in 3rd quintile, to 2.6 (CI: 2.2, 3.1) in 4th quintile and 9.4 (CI: 7.9, 11.2) in 5th quintile (p<0.0001). Cataract also showed a significant association with smoking (OR: 1.4, CI: 1.2, 1.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (OR: 1.2, CI: 1.0-1.4). Nuclear cataract showed a positive association with increasing sun exposure in 3rd (beta coefficient 0.5, CI:0.2-0.7), 4th beta: 0.9, CI: 0.7-1.1) and 5th (beta: 2.1, CI:1.8-2.4) quintiles of sun exposure, smoking (beta: 0.4, CI: 0.2-0.6) and indoor kitchen smoke exposure (beta: 0.3, CI: 01-0.5) while cortical cataract showed a positive association with sun exposure only in 5th quintile (beta: 2.6, CI:1.0-4.2). Posterior subcapsular cataract was not associated with any of the risk factors.
   Conclusion
   Cataract is associated with increasing level of sun exposure, smoking and exposure to indoor kitchen smoke.

AB  - Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most common form of birth anomalies. About one-fifth of these are critical requiring very early intervention, the classical examples being transposition of great arteries or obstructive total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. On the other hand, relatively milder and simpler lesions, such as small ventricular septal defects or mild pulmonary stenosis, may either not need intervention at all or intervened as and when deemed necessary. Apart from the cardiovascular effects, some CHDs can significantly affect the physical growth and neurodevelopment of the child. Each type of CHD has unique hemodynamic effects and the intervention is, by and large, timed based on the severity and natural history of each cardiac lesion. Some lesions have a "limited" time window beyond which they may become unsuitable for any intervention. Hence it is critical to intervene at the appropriate time so as to prevent the untoward effects of CHDs and at the same time to avoid unnecessary interventions.

KW  - STRAIN
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen and causes bacteremia, urinary tract infections, meningitis, and pneumonia. The emergence of drug-resistant strain makes most of the current antibiotics ineffective. It is high time to screen some therapeutics against drug-resistant strains. Plant-based medicines have recently emerged as one of the important therapeutic choices. Therefore, in the present study, we have screened the metabolites of Phyllanthus emblica, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Murraya koenigii for their antibacterial effect against carabapenem-resistant strain (RS-307) of A. baumannii. The result showed that the methanolic extract of P. emblica inhibits the growth of RS-307. The composition of this extract was determined using phytochemical screening and nuclear magnetic resonance (1D and 2D-NMR). The mechanism of action of the plant extract was validated by estimating reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, and membrane damage. The result showed that treatment with this extract showed a significant elevation in the production of ROS generations, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation. This confirms that plant extract treatment confirmed ROS-dependent membrane damage mechanism. The NMR result showed the presence of ethyl gallate, ellagic acid, chebulagic acid, quercetin, flavonoid, and alkaloid. To validate the antimicrobial activity of the secondary metabolite (i.e., gallic acid), we synthesized gallate-polyvinylpyrrolidone-capped hybrid silver nanoparticles (G-PVP-AgNPs) and characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). G-PVP-AgNPs showed good antimicrobial activity against RS-307, and its mechanism of action was investigated using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy and FTIR that confirmed ROS-dependent killing mechanism. Therefore, the present study highlighted and recommended the use of G-PVP-AgNPs as suitable therapeutics against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.

AB  - We aimed to assay cytokines and growth factors in peritoneal fluid samples from women with and without endometriosis to understand the inflammatory milieu, and assess their potential diagnostic utility. This cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care hospital included 54 women, aged 20-45 years, with regular menstrual history and undergoing diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy for infertility and/or pain. Peritoneal fluid samples were collected after insertion of trocar & laparoscope but prior to other surgical intervention. A multiplex immunoassay of 27 cytokines and growth factors was performed. The concentration of FGF2 and CSF3 were significantly lower in women with endometriosis than without endometriosis (p = .043 and .003, respectively). The levels of CCL2 and IL1RN were significantly higher in moderate-severe than in minimal-mild endometriosis (p = .038 and .043, respectively). Phase-specific comparison revealed that in proliferative phase, the levels of CSF2 and CSF3 were lower in women with endometriosis than without the disease (p = .047 and .013, respectively). The ROC curve analysis provided a cutoff value 0.78 and 0.76 for FGF2 and CSF3, respectively. Cytokines and growth factors such as FGF2, CSF3, CSF2, CCL2 and IL1RN seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of endometriosis and may have a potential utility for the diagnosis of endometriosis.

AB  - Background The successful deliveries of siRNA depend on their stabilities under physiological conditions because greater in vivo stability enhances cellular uptake and enables endosomal escape. Viral-based systems appears as most efficient approaches for gene delivery but often compromised in terms of biocompatibility, patient safety and high cost scale up process. Here we describe a novel platform of gene delivery by elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) based targeting biopolymers. Results For better tumor targeting and membrane penetrating characteristics, we designed various chimeric ELP-based carriers containing a cell penetrating peptide (Tat), single or multiple copies of AP1 an IL-4 receptor targeting peptide along with coding sequence of ELP and referred as Tat-A(1)E(28) or Tat-A(4)V(48). These targeted polypeptides were further analyzed for its ability to deliver siRNA (Luciferase gene) in tumor cells in comparison with non-targeted controls (Tat-E-28 or E-28). The positively charged amino acids of these polypeptides enabled them to readily complex with negatively charged nucleic acids. The complexation of nucleic acid with respective polypeptides facilitated its transfection efficiency as well as stability. The targeted polypeptides (Tat-A(1)E(28) or Tat-A(4)V(48)) selectively delivered siRNA into tumor cells in a receptor-specific fashion, achieved endosomal and lysosomal escape, and released gene into cytosol. The target specific delivery of siRNA by Tat-A(1)E(28) or Tat-A(4)V(48) was further validated in murine breast carcinoma 4T1 allograft mice model. Conclusion The designed delivery systems efficiently delivered siRNA to the target site of action thereby inducing significant gene silencing activity. The study shows Tat and AP1 functionalized ELPs constitute a novel gene delivery system with potential therapeutic applications.

AB  - Purpose Carotid artery corrected flow time (cFT) derived from Doppler USG is a known predictor of volume responsiveness. However, it can't be obtained continuously, and is operator dependent. In this prospective study, correlation between Doppler derived carotid artery cFT and pressure transducer derived radial artery cFT was evaluated in adult patients undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Methods Doppler derived carotid artery cFT were obtained from n = 51 adult patients at n = 125 time points. Simultaneously, pressure transducer waveforms were saved at the time of measurement of carotid artery cFT. Later, images were analyzed by an image processing computer software; both pulse pressure variation and cFT were estimated from pressure transducer waveform. Results Radial artery flow times measured by two independent observers, were significantly correlated (r(2) = 0.99, p < 0.00001). Bland-Altman analysis found limits of agreement - 8.3 to 6.3 ms [mean difference (95% CI) - 0.98 (- 1.63, - 0.32)]. Doppler derived carotid artery cFT & pressure transducer derived radial artery cFT were also significantly correlated [r(2) = 0.78, p < 0.0001]. However, radial artery cFT was significantly higher than carotid artery cFT [p < 0.0001, paired sample t test]. Radial artery cFT > 404.4 ms had an sensitivity and specificity of 87.34% and 85% respectively with a grey zone was between 393.7 and 417 ms to predict PPV >= 12%. Conclusion Pressure transducer derived radial artery cFT correlated with Doppler derived carotid artery cFT and may be a reasonable predictor of volume responsiveness. Further studies are required to confirm its role in various clinical scenario for prediction of volume responsiveness.

AB  - Purpose Evaluation of the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering efficacy of trabeculectomies over > 10 years and their ability to stabilize glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Methods In total, 181 eyes (136 patients), which underwent trabeculectomy (10 min surgery) at least 10 years prior and were on regular follow-up, were evaluated. Qualified/complete success was taken as criteria A: IOP <= 12 mmHg, B: IOP <= 15 mmHg and C: IOP <= 18 mmHg, with all > 5 mmHg, with/without medications. Target IOP in advanced glaucoma is about 10 mmHg, therefore trabeculectomy 10-10-10 challenge! Results The mean age of patients was 46.32 +/- 11.50 years. Absolute success was 50.27%, 54.14% and 59.66% according to criteria A, B and C at last follow-up, while qualified success was 70.11%, 81.77% and 96.13%. An IOP of <= 12 mmHg was noted in 34, 64.15%, PACG eyes, 14, 73.68%, POAG, 15, 65.22%, JOAG and 64, 74.42%, secondary glaucoma eyes. The reduction in IOP overall was 64.83 +/- 16.80% at last review and was 59.47 +/- 16.07% in PACG, 62.40 +/- 17.72% in POAG, 71.89 +/- 8.50% in JOAG and 67.74 +/- 18.10% in secondary glaucoma eyes. "Target" IOP was achieved in 97.29% of early glaucoma, 85.71% moderate glaucoma and 70% severe glaucoma eyes. 97.24% of patients were perimetrically stable. 2.21% of eyes post-trabeculectomy had a shallow anterior chamber needing surgical intervention. Visual acuity was maintained or better in 93.92% of patients, with a cataract surgery performed in 6.63% eyes. A repeat trabeculectomy was performed in 3.31% of eyes. Conclusion Trabeculectomy 10-10-10 is achievable in the long term, with few complications or repeat surgical interventions in the majority of POAG, PACG, JOAG and secondary glaucomas. Therefore, trabeculectomy should not be relegated to a last resort, but should be undertaken as soon as possible, if medical therapy is inadequate, unaffordable or compliance is an issue.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to etiology of type 2 diabetes in Asian Indians. The objectives of this study was to evaluate effect of vitamin D supplementation on glycemic profile and body composition in prediabetic and vitamin D deficient overweight/obese Asian Indian women. In this open-label randomized placebo-controlled trial (78 weeks duration), 121 females (aged 20-60 years) with prediabetes and vitamin D deficiency were randomly allocated in intervention (n, 61) and placebo (n, 60) groups. The primary outcome variables were fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2-h blood glucose post OGTT (2-h BG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), and reversal to normoglycemia. In Intention-to-treat analysis, at the end of intervention, we observed significant decrease in FBG [-5.0 (-12.6-2.4), p = 0.04], 2-h blood glucose post OGTT [-11(-49.3-26.9), p = 0.02], hemoglobin A1c [-0.41 (5.89, 6.55), p = 0.05] and increase in 25(OH) D [7.5 (-6.0-20.9), p = 0.002] levels in intervention as compared to the placebo group. Changes in glycemic category based on FBG were as follows; intervention group: normal FBG, 58.6%; impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 39%; and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), 2.4%; placebo group: normal FBG, 48.8%; IFG, 46.3%; and T2DM, 4.9%. Changes in category of 2-hour glucose post OGTT after intervention were as follows; intervention group: normal glucose tolerance (NGT) 51.2% and prediabetes, 48.8%; placebo group: NGT, 43.9%; prediabetes, 53.7% and T2DM, 2.4%. After intervention, subscapular skinfold (visit Ist compared to visit IIIrd) and suprailiac skinfold (visit IInd compared to visit IIIrd) were significantly lower in intervention group vs. control group. In conclusion, we observed significant reduction in FBG, 2-hour glucose post OGTT, HbA1c, and truncal subcutaneous fat and reversal to normoglycemia in overweight/obese prediabetic vitamin D deficient Asian Indian women after 78 weeks of vitamin D supplementation.

AB  - Background The effect of baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) on the sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12) among chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients receiving the second generation, pan-genotypic glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) regimen is unclear. Aim To assess the effect of RAS on the SVR12 in CHC patients treated with G/P regimen. Methods The EMBASE, MEDLINE and Cochrane central register of controlled trials databases were searched for relevant studies published before 1 March 2019. The principal outcome was to compare the SVR12 in CHC patients with and without baseline RAS, particularly in genotype-1, genotype-3 and direct-acting anti-virals (DAAs) failure patients. The outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model and odds ratio (OR) was calculated. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tools for randomised and nonrandomised interventional studies. Results After initially identifying 410 studies, 3302 patients from 17 studies were included. Among 50 cases of virologic failures, 48% had genotype-3 infection, 44% genotype-1 infection and 36% DAA-failure patients. Baseline RAS were present in 44(88%) patients. The most common NS5a and NS3 mutations were Y93H and A166S respectively. The odds of SVR12 were significantly reduced in patients with any baseline RAS (NS3 and/or NS5a) (OR 0.32, 95%C I[0.15, 0.65], I-2 = 0%) and NS5a substitutions (OR 0.36, 95%CI [0.18,0.73]). The impact of RAS on SVR12 was significant among genotype-3 patients, but not among genotype-1 or DAA-failure cases. The presence of Y93H and A30K mutations significantly impacted SVR12 rates in genotype-3 patients. Conclusion Baseline NS3 or NS5a RAS, especially the NS5a substitutions-A30K, Y93H, decrease the odds of achieving SVR12 in genotype-3 CHC patients.

AB  - Abnormal expression patterns of regulatory small non-coding RNA (sncRNA) molecules such as microRNAs (miRs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) play an important role in the development and progression of cancer. Identification of clinically relevant sncRNA signatures could, therefore, be of tremendous translational value. In the present study, genome-wide small RNA sequencing identified a unique pattern of differential regulation of eight miRs in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). Among these, three were up-regulated (miR-1295a, miR-155, miR-4524a) and five were down-regulated (miR-30a, miR-423, miR-486*, let-7e, and miR-744) in CLL. Altered expression of all these eight differentially expressed miRs (DEMs) was validated by RQ-PCR. Besides, seven novel sequences identified to have elevated expression levels in CLL turned out to be transfer RNA (tRNA)/piRNAs (piRNA-30799, piRNA-36225)/snoRNA (SNORD43) related. Multivariate analysis showed that miR-4524a (HR: 1.916, 95% CI: 1.080-3.4, p value: 0.026) and miR-744 (HR: 0.415, 95% CI: 0.224-0.769, p value: 0.005) were significantly associated with risk and time to first treatment. Further investigations could help establish the scope of integration of these DEM markers into risk stratification designs and prognostication approaches for CLL.

AB  - Background Oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Morin, a bioflavonoid, has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and other diverse pharmacological activities in various experimental models such as isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity, as well as cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of morin in myocardial IR injury model and its underlying mechanisms. Method To accomplish this, male albino Wistar rats were pre-treated with morin (40 and 80 mg/kg; po) for 28 days and on 29th day, rats experienced 45-min myocardial ischemia followed by 60-min reperfusion. Results In comparison to IR-control group, morin pre-treatment significantly normalized hemodynamic parameters, restored antioxidant status, improved pathological changes, reduced the release of cardiac injury markers, inhibited inflammation (TNF-alpha/IL-6/NF kappa B/IKK beta) and apoptosis (increased Bcl-2, decreased Bax/Caspase-3 and TUNEL positivity) in the myocardium. This improvement in antioxidant, inflammation and anti-apoptosis markers could be due to downregulation of SAPK (p38/JNK) pathway and upregulation of survival kinase, i.e. RISK pathway (ERK/eNOS) in the myocardium. Conclusion Thus, morin attenuated myocardial IR injury in rats by regulation of RISK/SAPK pathways. Graphic abstract

AB  - Organophosphorus compounds (OPC) are commonly used pesticides and suicidal ingestion is a common mode of poisoning. The manifestation of OPC poisoning and its severity depend upon the type, dose and potency of the OPC consumed. Neurological presentations are well defined clinical syndromes consisting of early, intermediate and delayed manifestations (rare), categorised on the basis of time elapsed since OPC exposure. We report a rare delayed manifestation of organophosphorus poisoning in the form of pure motor spastic paraparesis due to dorsal myelopathy. A possibility of delayed manifestations of toxicity should be considered in individuals presenting with features suggestive of myelopathy and a previous history of organophosphate exposure.

AB  - The persistent discoloration in lichen planus pigmentosus (LPP) is secondary to persistent melanophages in the superficial dermis in these patients. We evaluated the effect of Q-switched Nd-YAG laser on the clinical, pigmentary, and immunological markers in patients with LPP. Nine females with a clinical diagnosis of LPP were included in the study. After six sessions of laser with toning protocol, performed over a representative area of 5 x 5 cm(2) at 2-weekly intervals, the mean clinical improvement as per the physician assessment was 25.7% (10-40%). There was no significant reduction in melanin and erythema index. On expression analysis using quantitative-polymerase chain reaction, the reduction in tyrosinase (p = 0.03) was statistically significant, though, the reduction in other pigment and immunological markers was not significant. The immunohistochemistry quantification data of corresponding proteins also did not show any significant difference. Post inflammatory hypopigmentation was noted in one patient. Q-switched Nd-YAG laser toning protocol resulted in modest clinical and histological improvement in patients of LPP.

AB  - The discovery of an active lymphatic system in the meninges (dura mater) has opened up a wide range of possibilities for the role of CNS immunoglobulins in brain development in early fetal life or during infancy. The antibody-dependent and -independent functions of B cells in the immunopathogenesis of multiple sclerosis are not new to immunologists, yet their role in other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is incompletely understood. Deep cervical lymph nodes have emerged as a candidate site for autosensitization against CNS antigens and have been shown to provide the right kind of milieu for the dynamic interaction of antigen-presenting cells, B cells, and T cells. The presence of different B cells in the lymph nodes and the production of natural autoantibodies by B-1 cells have definitely unlocked another piece of the puzzle. At a time when CD19 and CD20 monoclonal antibodies have shown remarkable results in ameliorating the relapse and progression of multiple sclerosis, it is imperative to dissect out the diversity in B cell populations inside the CNS to identify new targets to improve current treatment regimens for neurodegenerative diseases. This review highlights the origin, migration, function, and regulation of B cells and the production of intrathecal immunoglobulins considering the previous and current findings and taking into account the differences between a healthy state and the changes that occur during an inflammatory or autoimmune response.

AB  - Background Stigma against those who suffer from mental illness is a major issue in many nations. Stigma, which is comprised of prejudice, ignorance, and discrimination, serves as a barrier to seeking help and staying in contact with mental health services. It is thus imperative that concerted efforts are taken against stigma. Methods Eight young psychiatrists from eight Asian nations offer a narrative review of the state of stigma in their respective nations, the sociocultural reasons behind this stigma, recent anti-stigma efforts and the effects, if any, of such efforts. Results Despite these eight nations lying varying significantly in terms of economic developmental levels, there are sociocultural commonalities that undergird stigma across these nations. It is also evident that there have been more recent concerted efforts to combat this stigma, and in some countries, there has been a change in the perceptions of mental illness. Conclusion The causes of stigma tend to be similar across various nations, and this perhaps suggests that international collaboration and a concerted global effort to combat this problem might thus be a possibility.

AB  - Purpose: To provide a comprehensive review of rare and emerging micro-organisms causing infectious keratitis. Material and Methods: A literature search was performed using PubMed Medline, Cochrane Library Database, EMBASE and Scopus (1960 onwards), using the terms: keratitis caused by rare pathogens; mycotic keratitis; fungal keratitis; bacterial keratitis; infectious keratitis; infective keratitis; atypical fungal keratitis; fungal keratitis caused by rare organisms; fungal keratitis caused by rare ocular pathogen; atypical bacterial keratitis; bacterial keratitis caused by rare organisms; bacterial keratitis caused by rare ocular pathogen. All relevant articles were included in this review. Results: A total of 1232 articles matched our search strategy of which 124 articles were included in this mini-review. The rare and emerging bacteria causing keratitis include atypical mycobacteria, Nocardia spp., Chrysebacterium spp., Delftia acidovorans, Kocuria spp., Enterococcus spp., Bartonella henslae, Achromobacter spp. and others. The rare and emerging fungi causing keratitis include Pythium spp., Alternaria spp., Acremonium spp., Cladosporium spp., Curvularia spp., Bipolaris spp., Microsporidia spp., Pseudallescheria spp., Colletotrichum spp., and others. The clinical presentation of these cases is variable. While a few organisms produce characteristic clinical features, rest present similar to bacterial or fungal keratitis with variable response to routine treatment. A strong degree of suspicion is therefore essential for its diagnosis. Special investigations like polymerase chain reaction, gene sequencing, mass spectroscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are required for accurate identification of these organisms. Culture-sensitivity is extremely useful as drug resistance to routinely used anti-microbial drugs is common. Prognosis is usually poor for keratitis with Pythium spp., Pseudallescheria spp., Arthrographis spp., Purpureocillium spp., Kociria spp. and Achromobacter spp. Conclusion: Keratitis caused by rare and emerging micro-organisms must be suspected in cases where the infection runs an unusual course or shows a poor response to standard anti-microbial drugs. Early diagnosis and timely treatment hold the key for a good outcome.

AB  - Purpose: Gene expression data generated from microarray technology is often analyzed for disease diagnostics and treatment. However, this data suffers with missing values that may lead to inaccurate findings. Since data capture is expensive, time consuming, and is required to be collected from subjects, it is worthwhile to recover missing values instead of re-collecting the data. In this paper, a novel but simple method, namely, DSNN (Doubly Sparse DCT domain with Nuclear Norm minimization) has been proposed for imputing missing values in microarray data. Extensive experiments including pathway enrichment have been carried out on four blood cancer dataset to validate the method as well as to establish the significance of imputation.
   Methods: A new method, namely, DSNN, was proposed for missing value imputation on gene expression data. Method was validated on four dataset, CLL, AML, MM (Spanish data), and MM (Indian data). All the dataset were downloaded from GEO repository. Missing values were introduced in the original data from 10 to 90% in steps of 10% because method validation requires ground truth. Quantitative results on normalized mean square error (NMSE) between the ground truth and imputed data were computed. To further validate and establish the significance of the proposed imputation method, two experiments were carried out on the data imputed with the proposed method, data imputed with the state-of-art methods, and data with missing values. In the first experiment, classification of normal vs. cancer subjects was carried out. In the second experiment, biological significance of imputation was ascertained by identifying top candidate tumor drivers using the existing state-of-the-art SPARROW algorithm, followed by gene list enrichment analysis on top candidate drivers.
   Results: Quantitative NMSE results of the DSNN method were compared with three state-of-the-art imputation methods. DSNN method was observed to perform better compared to these other methods both at high as well as low observable data. Experiment-1 demonstrated superior results on classification with imputation compared to that performed on missing data matrix as well as compared to classification on imputed data with existing methods. In experiment-2, cancer affected pathways were discovered with higher significance in the data imputed with the proposed method compared to those discovered with the missing data matrix.
   Conclusion: Missing value problem in microarray data is a serious problem and can adversely influence downstream analysis. A novel method, namely, DSNN is proposed for missing value imputation. The method is validated quantitatively on the application of classification and biologically by performing pathway enrichment analysis.

AB  - Autistic epileptiform regression is an uncommon but extensively described malady in children. The clinico-etiological spectrum of this entity ranges from electrical status epilepticus in sleep to various neurogenetic and neurodegenerative disorders. Identification of these disorders is crucial considering their therapeutic and prognostic implications. Simple investigations such as neuroimaging and electroencephalography with activation procedures can provide valuable diagnostic clues in resource-limited settings; facilitating targeted genetic/metabolic testing. Here we report a 3.5-year-old girl with autistic regression and epilepsy. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis was suspected as her electroencephalogram showed photoparoxysmal response on low-frequency (1-3 Hz) intermittent photic stimulation. A deficient leukocyte tripeptidyl peptidase 1 enzyme confirmed the diagnosis of late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.

AB  - Background Ras are small cellular GTPases which regulate diverse cellular processes. It has three isoforms: H-Ras, K-Ras, and N-Ras. Owing to the N-terminus (1-165 residues) sequence homology these isoforms were thought to be functionally redundant. However, only K-Ras-deficient mice but not H-Ras- and N-Ras-deficient mice show embryonic lethality. Similarly, mutations in a given Ras isoform are associated with a particular type of cancer. Moreover, we have previously reported that Ras isoforms perform unique functions in Leishmania major infection. Thus, Ras isoforms are implicated to have signaling and functional specificity but the mechanism remains to be elucidated. Result Using CD40 as a model receptor, we showed that depending on the strength of signaling, specific Ras isoforms are activated. Weak CD40 signal activates N-Ras, whereas strong signal activates H-Ras and K-Ras. Additionally, we showed that suppression of N-Ras expression reduced CD40-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) activation and Interleukin (IL)-10 production; whereas suppression of H-Ras or K-Ras reduced CD40-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) activation and IL-12 production. Furthermore, we showed that Ras isoforms have activator (GEF) specificity as weak CD40 signal-activated N-Ras requires Sos-1/2 whereas strong CD40 signal-activated H-Ras/K-Ras requires Ras-GRP as the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) inducing ERK-1/2- or p38MAPK-mediated IL-10 or IL-12 productions, respectively, in macrophages. Silencing of syk reduced CD40-induced N-Ras activation but silencing of lyn inhibited H-Ras and K-Ras activation. In CD40 signaling, Ras isoforms also showed effector specificity; while H-Ras and K-Ras showed specificity for phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase activation at high dose of CD40 stimulation, N-Ras primarily associated with Raf-1 at low dose of CD40 stimulation. Moreover, fractal analysis showed that functional site surface roughness for H-Ras (SurfaceFD = 2.39) and K-Ras (SurfaceFD = 2.39) are similar but significantly different from N-Ras (SurfaceFD = 2.25). Conclusion The activator and effector specificities of Ras isoforms in CD40 signaling indicated their differential involvement in CD40 pathway and in maintaining the reciprocity. Our observations reveal Ras-regulated signaling outcome and its potential for developing Ras isoform-targeted immunotherapy and prophylaxis.

AB  - Introduction Parkinson's disease (PD) is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, highlights a broad array of symptoms and pathological features influencing organs throughout the body. The metabolic profile of saliva in patients with PD may be influenced by malabsorption in the gastroenteric tract, neurodegeneration, and mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we apply a powerful NMR metabolomics approach for biomarker identification in PD using saliva, a non-invasive bio-fluid. Methods Metabolic profiling of saliva were studied in patients with PD (n = 76) and healthy controls (HC, n = 37) were analyzed and differentiated PD from HC. A total of 40 metabolites including aromatic amino acids, short-chain fatty acids, branched chain amino acids, taurine, and N-acetylglutamate were identified. Spectral binned data and concentration of metabolites were estimated for analysis. Results Increased concentration of phenylalanine, tyrosine, histidine, glycine, acetoacetate, taurine, TMAO, GABA, N-acetylglutamate, acetoin, acetate, alanine, fucose, propionate, isoleucine, and valine were observed in PD as compared to HC. Further, subgroup analysis among early PD, advanced PD, and HC groups, revealed increased metabolite concentration in early PD group as compared to advanced PD and HC group. Discussion Analysis revealed potential biomarkers and their involvement in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, neurotransmitters metabolism, and microflora system. Patients with early PD exhibited higher metabolite concentration as compared to advanced PD group which might be associated with dopaminergic treatment. Conclusion The results of our data indicate that patients with PD might be characterized by metabolic imbalances like gut microflora system, energy metabolites, and neurotransmitters which may contribute to the PD pathogenesis.

KW  - CANCER
AB  - Prostate cancer is the fourth most common cancer and population-based screening programmes are being increasingly adopted worldwide. Screening-positive patients undergo routine transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided systematic biopsy, which is the current diagnostic standard for prostate cancer. However, systematic biopsies suffer from poor sensitivity, especially for the tumors of the anterior prostate and apex as well as in large volume glands. In the past decade, MRI-guided targeted biopsies have come up, which utilize the multiparametric capability of MRI to target lesions for sampling. MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies combine the advantages of MRI-targeting with that of real-time guidance made possible by TRUS. MRI-TRUS fusion biopsies are being increasingly used in men with high clinical suspicion of prostate cancer who have had prior negative systematic biopsies. A large number of fusion biopsy platforms are currently available commercially. Although the basic workflow is similar, there are differences in the operational software, biopsy routes offered, TRUS acquisition technique, type of correction applied at the time of fusion and in the probe tracking hardware. The article describes the current role and indications of MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy followed by a discussion on the workflow, patient preparation, biopsy procedure and complications.

AB  - Aims: In this study, we aimed to estimate cross-sectional associations of fish or shellfish consumption with diabetes and glycemia in three South Asian mega-cities. Methods: We analyzed baseline data from 2010-2011 of a cohort (n = 16,287) representing the population >= 20 years old that was neither pregnant nor on bedrest from Karachi (unweighted n = 4017), Delhi (unweighted n = 5364), and Chennai (unweighted n = 6906). Diabetes was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, fasting plasma glucose >= 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), or glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) >= 6.5% (48 mmol/mol). We estimated adjusted and unadjusted odds ratios for diabetes using survey estimation logistic regression for each city, and differences in glucose and HbA1c using survey estimation linear regression for each city. Adjusted models controlled for age, gender, body mass index, waist-height ratio, sedentary lifestyle, educational attainment, tobacco use, an unhealthy diet index score, income, self-reported physician diagnosis of high blood pressure, and self-reported physician diagnosis of high cholesterol. Results: The prevalence of diabetes was 26.7% (95% confidence interval: 24.8, 28.6) in Chennai, 36.7% (32.9, 40.5) in Delhi, and 24.3% (22.0, 26.6) in Karachi. Fish and shellfish were consumed more frequently in Chennai than in the other two cities. In Chennai, the adjusted odds ratio for diabetes, comparing more than weekly vs. less than weekly fish consumption, was 0.81 (0.61, 1.08); in Delhi, it was 1.18 (0.87, 1.58), and, in Karachi, it was 1.30 (0.94, 1.80). In Chennai, the adjusted odds ratio of prevalent diabetes among persons consuming shellfish more than weekly versus less than weekly was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.30); in Delhi, it was 1.35 (0.90, 2.01), and, in Karachi, it was 1.68 (0.98, 2.86). Conclusions: Both the direction and the magnitude of association between seafood consumption and glycemia may vary by city. Further investigation into specific locally consumed seafoods and their prospective associations with incident diabetes and related pathophysiology are warranted.

AB  - Background and Aim There is a paucity of data on the clinical presentations and outcome of Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) patients presenting as acute-on-chronic liver failure (BCS-ACLF). We aimed to describe the profile and outcomes of endovascular interventions in patients with BCS-ACLF. Methods All BCS-ACLF patients presenting between October 2007 and April 2019 satisfying the Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) definition were studied. We compared 30- , 90- and, 180-day survival among BCS-ACLF patients who underwent endovascular intervention with those who did not, and with a historical cohort of Child-C BCS patients without ACLF who underwent endovascular intervention. Results Twenty-eight (5%) of 553 BCS patients presented as ACLF as per APASL definition. The majority (60.7%) were males, and mean age was 29.6 +/- 11.2 years. The most common site of the block was isolated involvement of hepatic veins-HV (68%), followed by combined inferior vena cava (IVC) and HV block (25%) and isolated IVC block (7%). The acute precipitants were stent thrombosis (17.9%), acute HV thrombosis (10.7%), acute viral hepatitis (7.1%), and antituberculosis drug with hepatitis B virus reactivation (3.6%). In 60.7% patients, no acute precipitant could be identified. The 30- , 90- , and 180-day survival in BCS-ACLF post-endovascular intervention (n = 15), BCS-ACLF without endovascular intervention (n = 13), and Child-C BCS without ACLF who underwent endovascular intervention (n = 25) were (93%, 87%, and 87%), (46%, 28%, and 0%) and (96%, 92%, and 88%), respectively (log-rank test, p value < 0.001). On multivariate Cox proportional analysis, endovascular intervention and the presence of hepatic encephalopathy were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion Budd-Chiari syndrome can present as acute-on-chronic liver failure. Endovascular intervention is associated with an improved outcome.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome, a prediabetic and precardiovascular pathologic condition that begins early in life, tracks into adulthood and magnifies with age. Randomized controlled trials evaluating efficacy of yoga-based lifestyle vs. dietary intervention on metabolic syndrome are lacking. Here, the efficacy of a 12-week yoga-based lifestyle intervention vs. dietary intervention on cardio-metabolic risk factors and metabolic syndrome risk scores have been assessed in Indian adults with metabolic syndrome. In this two-arm, open label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, 260 adults (20-45 years) diagnosed with metabolic syndrome as per joint interim statement, 2009 were randomized to yoga-based (including diet) lifestyle or dietary intervention alone (n = 130, each) for 12 weeks. Primary endpoints were the 12-week changes in cardio-metabolic risk factors and metabolic risk scores. The secondary endpoints were the 12-week changes in the proportion of subjects recovered from metabolic syndrome, dietary intake, and physical activity. Intent-to-treat analysis was performed including all the subjects with baseline data with imputed missing data. Treatment x time interaction showed yoga-based lifestyle intervention had a greater treatment effect over dietary intervention by significantly reducing waist circumference, continuous metabolic syndrome z-score, and dietary intake/day while significantly increasing physical activity. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol showed a significantly greater reduction following dietary intervention than yoga-based lifestyle intervention. A significantly greater proportion of subjects recovered from metabolic syndrome in yoga-based lifestyle (45.4%) vs. dietary intervention group (32.3%). A 12-week yoga-based lifestyle intervention is more efficacious than usual dietary intervention in improving cardio-metabolic risk factor and metabolic risk score in Indian adults with metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Corrosive injury is a devastating injury which carries significant morbidity. The upper gastrointestinal tract is predominantly affected with severity ranging from mild inflammation to full thickness necrosis which may result in perforation and death. Among the complications, stricture formation is most common, causing dysphagia and malnutrition. Endoscopy has a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management, with a few shortcomings. Imaging has an important role to play. Besides radiography, there is an increasing role of CT scan in the emergency setting with good accuracy in identifying patients who are likely to benefit from surgery. Further, CT scan has a role in the diagnosis of complications. Oral contrast studies help in assessing the severity and extent of stricture formation and associated fistulous complications in the subacute and chronic phase. The scope of intervention radiology for this condition is increasing. Fluoroscopyguided balloon dilatation, drainage of collections or mucoceles, endovascular embolization of point bleeders, placement of feeding jejunostomy and image-guided biopsy are among the procedures that are being performed. Through this review we aim to stress the role the radiologist plays in the diagnosis and follow-up of these patients and in performing radiological interventions. Besides this, we have also highlighted few salient points to help understand the pathophysiology and management of such injuries which is paramount to ensure a good long-term outcome.

AB  - Context: Parkinson's disease (PD) has devastating effects on quality of life (QoL), but there is no instrument that has been developed for Hindi-speaking persons with Parkinson's disease (PWP). Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and validate an instrument in Hindi language to measure health-related QoL (HRQoL) in PWP. Subjects and Methods: Literature review and interviews of stakeholders were done to create a pool of 68 items to develop a questionnaire. Self-rated global QoL item was also included in the questionnaire. Questionnaire was tested on 300 Hindi-speaking PWP. Item reduction was achieved through factor analysis and clinimetrics to finalize the QoL in PD (QLPD) instrument. Validity and reliability of the QLPD were tested. Results: "QLPD" is a 45-item instrument with nine subscales, namely, activities of daily living, mobility, psychological, fear, social, family, treatment, finance, and nonmotor symptom subscales. Internal consistency of QLPD's summary score and all subscales except treatment subscale was high (alpha = 0.74-0.94). Intraclass correlation coefficient between summary score and global QoL was 0.79. Summary score and subscale scores were significantly different (P < 0.0001) for predefined five categories on global QoL (very good to very bad). QLPD subscales exhibited good convergent and divergent validity with subscales of 39-item PD questionnaire and short form-36 scale. Higher Hoehn and Yahr stage, lower monthly per capita income, and higher levodopa equivalent daily dosage were found to be independently associated with poor HRQoL. Conclusion: QLPD is a valid and reliable instrument to measure HRQoL in Hindi-speaking PWP.

AB  - The study involved purification of trypsin inhibitor from the seeds of Indian peanuts (Arachis hypogaea), a member of leguminosae family. The inhibitor was purified to homogeneity via three sequential step procedure i.e., salt precipitation to anion-exchange chromatography. The purity and molecular mass was detected using SDS PAGE analysis i.e. ~ 16 kDa. The purified inhibitor termed as Peanut Trypsin Inhibitor (PTI) which inhibits trypsin belonging to serpins family. Anti- neoplastic potential on breast cancer cells (MCF-7) and normal Human Embryonic Kidney cells (HEK) was determined using MTT assay. PTI exhibited IC50 value of ~ 18.412 mu g/mL in HEK cells compared to ~ 9.635 mu g/mL in MCF-7 cells. The values were quite comparable to curcumin, the standard anticancer drug demonstrating IC50 values of ~ 21.581 mu g/mL and ~ 7.135 mu g/mL in HEK and MCF-7 respectively. Therefore, we conclude that PTI may be used as supplement along with the conventional drugs for increased efficacy in the treatment of cancer.

AB  - Scrambler therapy (ST) is a novel noninvasive modality for treatment of chronic neuropathic and cancer pain using 5 artificial neurons. The principle with Scrambler Therapy is that synthetic "non-pain" information is transmitted by C fiber surface receptors. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can markedly deteriorate patient's quality of life and can also negatively affect compliance with the anticancer treatment. Chronic neuropathic pain presents a therapeutic challenge if resistant to pharmacological management opioids and other types of treatments. We have described here successful use of scrambler therapy in three cases of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

AB  - The majority of testicular tumors are germ cell tumors (GCTs), but there are numerous other types, making testicular tumors one of the most diverse areas of human pathology, despite their relative rarity. Testicular tumors are usually diagnosed only after radical surgery, as biopsies are not performed. Further management of the patient is dependent on the diagnosis at microscopy, which itself is based on the sections taken at the time of grossing the specimen. Many pathologists often aren't well versed with guidelines for handling of orchiectomy specimens and for microscopy. This article discusses, in detail, the approach to grossing of a testicular tumour specimen and elaborates of the reasons as to why we do what we do at the initial "cut-up". It explains the logic behind the reporting guidelines for testicular tumors and offer a clinical primer to the pathologist as to why we do what we do while grossing testicular tumor specimens.

AB  - Introduction: The world is seeing a growth of the aging population and the number of surgical treatments in this age group which is also true for spinal conditions. The greatest increase in spinal fusion surgery has been observed in patients aged 65 years and above. Only a few works of literature were available on the issue, especially in India.
   Materials and Methods: An observational study in which 70 patients aged 70 years and above who underwent spinal surgery for degenerative and traumatic spinal injury, from January 2013 to July 2017 in the neurosurgery department of a single institute, were reviewed. Around 53 patients were assessed for disability/functional outcome and their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the Oswestry disability index (ODI) and RAND 36-item health survey 1.0 scoring method (SF-36) comparing the preoperative and postoperative status.
   Result: The mean age was 74.19 years (range 70-91 years). Laminectomy-19 (27.14%) was the most common surgical procedure performed. Overall there were nine (12.85%) major complications with mortality of five (7.14%) patients. There was a significant reduction of crippled patients (14-9, P = 0.009) in the ODI score. SF-36: There was significant improvement in degenerative patient (P = 0.000 to P= 0.012). In traumatic patient, only pain had significant improvement (P = 0.045).
   Conclusion: This study showed that the age of the patient should not be the limiting factor for the surgical management of a patient with a degenerative or a traumatic spinal condition.

AB  - In the recent scenario, nanotechnology-based therapeutics intervention has gained tremendous impetus all across the globe. Nano-based pharmacological intervention of various bioactive compounds has been explored on an increasing scale. Sesquiterpenes are major constituents of essential oils (EOs) present in various plant species which possess intriguing therapeutic potentials. However, owing to their poor physicochemical properties; they have pharmacological limitations. Recent advances in nano-based therapeutic interventions offer various avenues to improve their therapeutic applicability. Reckoning with these, the present review collates various nano-based therapeutic intervention of sesquiterpenes with prospective potential against various debilitating diseases especially cancer. In our viewpoint, considering the burgeoning advancement in the field of nanomedicine; in the near future, the clinical applicability of these nano-formulated sesquiterpenes can be foreseen with great enthusiasm.

AB  - Background & objectives: Pulmonary disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). The infection occurs with a unique spectrum of bacterial pathogens that are usually acquired in an age-dependent fashion. The objective of this study was to find out the aetiological agents in respiratory specimens from children with CF during pulmonary exacerbation and relate with demographic variables. Methods: In this observational study, airway secretions from children (n=104) with CF presenting with pulmonary exacerbations were collected and tested for bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and viral pathogens using appropriate laboratory techniques. The frequencies of isolation of various organisms were calculated and associated with various demographic profiles. Results: Bacteria were isolated in 37 (35.5%) and viral RNA in 27 (29.3%) children. Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. Interpretation & conclusions: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations.

AB  - The low-and-middle-income country (LMIC) context is volatile, uncertain and resource-constrained. India, an LMIC, has put up a complex response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an analytic approach, we have described India's response to combat the pandemic during the initial months (from 17 January to 20 April 2020). India issued travel advisories and implemented graded international border controls between January and March 2020. By early March, cases started to surge. States scaled up movement restrictions. On 25 March, India went into a nationwide lockdown to ramp up preparedness. The lockdown uncovered contextual vulnerabilities and stimulated countermeasures. India leveraged existing legal frameworks, institutional mechanisms and administrative provisions to respond to the pandemic. Nevertheless, the cross-sectoral impact of the initial combat was intense and is potentially long-lasting. The country could have further benefited from evidence-based policy and planning attuned to local needs and vulnerabilities. Experience from India offers insights to nations, especially LMICs, on the need to have contextualised pandemic response plans.

AB  - Standard treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy, due to left mesial temporal sclerosis, is anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy (ATL). This carries a risk of cognitive deficits, including comprehension, verbal memory, and visual memory. Preoperative language lateralization and localization is important to preserve these functions. Often Wada testing is used for these, but it carries risk due to its invasive nature. In addition, it can lateralize but not localize and may not be readily available. We hereby present a mathematics genius who underwent left ATL under the guidance of functional MRI and neuropsychological assessment alone, resulting in the preservation of all of his cognitive abilities even in the immediate postoperative period. A video demonstration of his calendar likeability is also shown.

AB  - Background: Screening and diagnostic tests provide an objective measure of cognitive performance and also aid in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from major neurocognitive disorder (MNCD). Further, when such tests are culturally and educationally unbiased, it strengthens their diagnostic utility. This study aimed to validate the Hindi version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III (ACE-III) in Indian older adults and compare its validity with the Hindi Mini-Mental State Examination (HMSE).
   Methods: A sample of 412 consenting older adults visiting a memory clinic was recruited into the study. They were categorized into three groups: healthy controls (n=222), MCI (n=70), and MNCD (n=120). The complete clinical protocol was followed. Hindi ACE-III and HMSE were administered and were statistically analyzed.
   Results: The optimal cut-off values to detect MCI and MNCD with ACE-III were 71 and 62 (AUC: 0.849 and 0.884), respectively, which were slightly higher than with HMSE (AUC: 0.822, 0.861). Education- and age-stratified cut-offs were also computed.
   Conclusion: Hindi ACE-III has good discriminating power at lower cut-offs than the standard scores in differentiating between MCI and MNCD.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a havoc across the globe, and has significantly affected oncology services, especially radiation therapy due to the need of social distancing as a measure for the pandemic mitigation. Brachytherapy, being an integral part of radiation therapy, posts a dilemma related to the practice of evidence-based oncology. It requires a significant amount of resources and personnel, thereby increasing the risk of exposure to the virus. There has been a significant amount of papers published providing the best available alternatives to external radiation; however, there is a lack of literature on the practice of brachytherapy. In times of the pandemic, deploying brachytherapy as a treatment modality can act as a double-edged sword and therefore, judicious use is warranted in such times of crisis. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the role of brachytherapy in various forms and different malignancy sites.

AB  - Introduction Depression is a common mental disorder in the elderly population, which significantly impacts their quality of life. However, correct estimates of its magnitude are not available in the elderly in India. The present systematic review and meta-analysis would attempt to estimate the prevalence of depression using diagnostic instruments among elderly persons aged 60 years and above. Methods and analysis Searches will be performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and PsycINFO. Community-based cross-sectional and cohort studies (2001 to September 2019) reporting the prevalence of depression in the elderly, using diagnostic instruments will be included. Studies conducted among chronic disease patients, in-hospital patients and special groups such as with disaster-stricken populations, and studies reporting the only one or two subcategories of depression, will be excluded. Disagreements in study selection and data abstraction will be resolved by consensus and arbitration by a third reviewer. AXIS critical appraisal tool will be used for quality assessment of individual studies. Findings of eligible studies will be pooled using fixed-effects or random-effects meta-analysis whichever is appropriate. Heterogeneity between studies will be examined by Cochran's Q test and quantified by I-2 statistic. A cumulative meta-analysis will be used to detect temporal trends in the prevalence of depression and the effect of poor-quality studies on the pooled estimate. Publication bias will be assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and the Egger test. Ethics and dissemination No ethical approval will be needed because it will be a systematic review. Data from previously published studies will be retrieved and analysed. Findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication in a scientific journal and conferences.

AB  - Purpose: Brachytherapy (BT) forms major treatment modality in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck can-cers (HNC). However, there is a dearth of literature and guidelines for the use in various indications. High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in Indian scenario is an important treatment modality, and the recommendations in this guidelines aim to provide the necessary recommendations for the use of HDR-BT for uniform application across the country in patients with HNC.
   Material and methods: A panel consisting of members of the Indian Brachytherapy Society (IBS), based on their clinical experience was invited. The process involved defining important steps, precautions, target volumes and indications, thorough literature review, and discussion with fellow members. The guidelines were established and formulated the recommendations for HDR-BT based on available evidences and individual experience for sites, relevant to Indian settings.
   Results: The IBS recommends the use of HDR brachytherapy as a part of treatment of head and neck tumors. The scope of these guidelines and recommendations included practical suggestions, ensuring efficient use of brachytherapy treatment as radical with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) boost, palliative and adjuvant as definitive, or re-radiation as salvage for HNC in India. The IBS has made specific site-wise recommendations for previously untreated and recurrent HNC patients on their selection criteria, implant techniques, target volume definition, and HDR treatment parameters, such as time, dose rate, total dose, and fractionation schedules. Limited experience exists with HDR-BT in patients with head and neck cancers in India and across the globe.
   Conclusions: IBS provided a consensus statement and guidelines for the head and neck brachytherapy and believed that these recommendations will overcome the fear of practicing radiation oncologists. This should generate interest amongst students and will help radiation oncologists all across the country to use the art of brachytherapy carefully in HNC patients, with better curative and salvage options.

TI  - Quantitative vs. Semiquantitative Assessment of Intratumoral Susceptibility Signals in Patients With Different Grades of Glioma
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
KW  - HIGH-RESOLUTION
KW  - CLINICAL-APPLICATIONS
KW  - HIGH-FIELD
KW  - PERFUSION
AB  - Background: Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) provides vascular information and plays an important role in improving the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative glioma grading. Intratumoral susceptibility signal intensities (ITSS) obtained from SWI has been used in glioma grading. However, the current method for estimation of ITSS is semiquantitative, manual count-dependent, and includes hemorrhage as well as vasculature.
   Purpose: To develop a quantitative approach that calculates the vasculature volume within tumors by filtering out the hemorrhage from ITSS using R-2* values and connected component analysis-based segmentation algorithm; to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed ITSS vasculature volume (IVV) for differentiating various grades of glioma; and compare it with reported semiquantitative ITSS approach.
   Study Type: Retrospective.
   Subjects: Histopathologically confirmed 41 grade IV, 19 grade III, and 15 grade II glioma patients.Field Strength/Sequence: SWI (four echoes: 5.6, 11.8, 18, 24.2 msec) along with conventional MRI sequences (T-2-weighted, T-1-weighted, 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], and diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) at 3.0T.
   Assessment: R-2* relaxation maps were calculated from multiecho SWI. The R-2* cutoff value for hemorrhage ITSS was determined. A segmentation algorithm was designed, based on this R-2* hemorrhage combined with connected component shape analysis, to quantify the IVV from all slices containing tumor by filtering out hemorrhages. Semiquantitative ITSS scoring as well as total ITSS volume (TIV) including hemorrhages were also calculated.
   Statistical Tests: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests were performed to see the difference among the three grades of the tumor (II, III, and IV) in terms of semiquantitative ITSS scoring, TIV, and IVV. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the three methods individually in discriminating between grades of glioma.
   Results: One-way ANOVA showed that only the proposed IVV significantly differentiated different grades of gliomas having visible ITSS. ROC analysis showed that IVV provided the highest AUC for the discrimination of grade II vs. III (0.93), grade III vs. IV (0.98), and grade II vs. IV glioma (0.94). IVV also provided the highest sensitivity and specificity for differentiating grade II vs. III (87.44, 98.41), grade III vs. IV (97.15, 94.12), and grade II vs. IV (98.72, 92.31).
   Data Conclusion: The proposed quantitative method segregates hemorrhage from tumor vasculature. It scores above the existing semiquantitative method in terms of ITSS estimation and grading accuracy.

AB  - Background & objectives: Obesity-mediated chronic inflammatory state is primarily governed by lifestyle and food habits in adolescents and marked by alterations in the level of various inflammatory markers. This cross-sectional study was aimed to compare the inflammatory status of healthy Indian adolescents vis-a-vis their obesity profile. The inflammatory state of urban adolescents attending private and government-funded schools, and the relationship between inflammatory marker levels and anthropometric indices in the study participants from both groups were examined. Methods: A total of 4438 study participants (10-17 yr) were chosen from various schools of Delhi, India, and their anthropometric parameters were measured. Plasma adipocytokines (adiponectin, leptin and resistin) of the study participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were assayed by a biochemical analyzer. Metabolic syndrome-related risk factors such as waist circumference, hip circumference (HC), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides of normal-weight adolescents were also evaluated. Results: The level of leptin and CRP increased with increasing adiposity, whereas adiponectin levels were found to be negatively related to obesity. All plasma cytokine levels (adiponectin, leptin and resistin) were significantly elevated in female than male adolescents. Age-based classification revealed a distinct trend of variability in the levels of all the inflammatory markers among adolescents of varying age groups. Significant differences were observed between private and government schoolgoing adolescents in terms of anthropometric and inflammatory parameters, with higher adiposity indices in the former group. The relationship of plasma adipokine and CRP levels with various adiposity indices was found to be distinctly different between private and government schoolgoing students. Interpretation & conclusions: Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated in overweight/obese adolescents. The socio-economic condition of urban Indian schoolgoing adolescents reflecting lifestyle transition has profound effects on their adiposity indices and inflammatory states. Longitudinal studies in different regions of the country need to be done to further confirm the findings.

AB  - Leukocyte adhesion deficiencies (LADs) are a type of primary immunodeficiencies characterized by delayed detachment of the umbilical cord, impaired wound healing, leukocytosis, and recurrent infections. The disease is caused by genetic defects affecting different steps in the process of leukocyte adhesion cascade such as rolling, integrin activation, and adhesion of leukocytes, resulting in the impairment of leukocyte trafficking. Till date, three types of LAD have been documented: type I, II and III. Type I LAD is caused by congenital defect in the beta 2 integrin receptor complex CD11/CD18 on the cell surface of leukocytes, which results in impaired leukocytes connection to endothelial cells and migration. Type II LAD is caused by defect in the fucose metabolism resulting in the absence of fucosylated selectin ligands on neutrophils and impaired rolling phase of the leukocyte adhesion cascade. Type III LAD is caused by mutations in the kindlin-3 gene resulting in defective integrin activation. In this article, we present a review of literature for type I LAD, and successful treatment of patient using umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation.

AB  - The spread of COVID-19 is recent in India, which has within 4 months caused over 190 000 infections, as of 1 June 2020, despite four stringent lockdowns. With the current rate of the disease transmission in India, which is home to over 1.35 billion people, the infection spread is predicted to be worse than the USA in the upcoming months. To date, there is a major lack of understanding of the transmission dynamics and epidemiological characteristics of the disease in India, inhibiting effective measures to control the pandemic. We collected all the available data of the individual patients, cases and a range of parameters such as population distribution, testing and healthcare facilities, and weather, across all Indian states till May 2020. Numerical analysis was conducted to determine the effect of each parameter on the COVID-19 situation in India. A significant amount of local transmission in India initiated with travellers returning from abroad. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi are currently the top three infected states in India with doubling time of 14.5 days. The average recovery rate across Indian states is 42%, with a mortality rate below 3%. The rest 55% are currently active cases. In total, 88% of the patients experienced symptoms of high fever, 68% suffered from dry cough and 7.1% patients were asymptomatic. In total, 66.8% patients were males, 73% were in the age group of 20-59 years and over 83% recovered in 11-25 days. Approximately 3.4 million people were tested between 1 April and 25 May 2020, out of which 4% were detected COVID-19-positive. Given the current doubling time of infections, several states may face a major shortage of public beds and healthcare facilities soon. Weather has minimal effect on the infection spread in most Indian states. The study results will help policymakers to predict the trends of the disease spread in the upcoming months and devise better control measures.

AB  - Purpose: To study the role of combined vitrectomy and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection for stage 4 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with extensive neovascular proliferation.
   Methods: In a retrospective interventional study at a tertiary eye care center, 15 eyes (9 infants) with advanced stage 4 ROP underwent 25-gauge vitrectomy combined with intravitreal 0.625 mg of bevacizumab (n = 12) or 0.25 mg of ranibizumab (n = 3) injection and were followed up until 65 weeks' postconceptional age (PCA). The perinatal history, tractional retinal detachment (TRD) characteristics (zone, stage, and presence of "plus" disease), treatment details, and anatomical outcomes were reviewed. The main outcome measures were fibrovascular tissue and TRD regression and final macular status.
   Results: Mean gestational age and birth weight were 28.5 +/- 1.2 weeks and 1,167 +/- 185 g, respectively. Thirteen eyes had zone I disease and 2 eyes had zone II disease. Thirteen eyes were stage 4A and 2 eyes were stage 4B ROP. The morphology was aggressive posterior ROP in 10 eyes. The mean PCA at surgery was 37.8 +/- 2.3 weeks. Lensectomy was also performed in 2 eyes. Rapid fibrovascular tissue regression was seen in 14 eyes within 2 weeks, followed by TRD regression and macular vascularization, although 2 eyes had macular pucker formation. Persistent vitreous bleeding was present in 1 eye, which needed lavage, and eventually the TRD regressed. Disease reactivation was noted in 1 eye at 5 weeks and was managed with repeat intravitreal anti-VEGF injection.
   Conclusions: Anti-VEGF treatment combined with vitrectomy leads to rapid disease regression in advanced stage 4 ROP with extensive neovascular proliferation.

AB  - Introduction A huge population in India is at high risk of type-2 diabetes (T2DM). Physical activity and a healthy diet (healthy lifestyle) improve blood glucose levels in people at high risk of T2DM. However, an unhealthy lifestyle is common among Indians. Yoga covers physical activity and a healthy diet and can help to prevent T2DM. The research question to be addressed by the main randomised controlled trial (RCT) is whether a Yoga programme for T2DM prevention (YOGA-DP) is effective in preventing T2DM among high risk people in India as compared with enhanced standard care. In this current study, we are determining the feasibility of undertaking the main RCT. Intervention YOGA-DP is a structured lifestyle education and exercise programme. The exercise part is based on Yoga and includes Shithilikarana Vyayama (loosening exercises), Surya Namaskar (sun salutation exercises), Asana (Yogic poses), Pranayama (breathing practices) and Dhyana (meditation) and relaxation practices. Methods and analysis This is a multicentre, two-arm, parallel-group, feasibility RCT with blinded outcome assessment and integrated mixed-methods process evaluation. Eligible participants should be aged 18-74 years, at high risk of T2DM (fasting plasma glucose level 5.6-6.9 mmol/L) and safe to participate in physical activities. At least 64 participants will be randomised to intervention or control group with final follow-up at 6 months. Important parameters, needed to design the main RCT, will be estimated, such as SD of the outcome measure (fasting plasma glucose level at 6-month follow-up), recruitment, intervention adherence, follow-up, potential contamination and time needed to conduct the study. Semistructured qualitative interviews will be conducted with up to 20-30 participants, a sample of those declining to participate, four YOGA-DP instructors and around eight study staff to explore their perceptions and experiences of taking part in the study and of the intervention, reasons behind non-participation, experiences of delivering the intervention and running the study, respectively. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from the following Research Ethics Committees: Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Nottingham (UK); Centre for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC, India); Bapu Nature Cure Hospital and Yogashram (BNCHY, India) and Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA, India). The results will be widely disseminated among key stakeholders through various avenues.

AB  - Background: Psoriasis is a chronic immune mediated skin disorder with global prevalence of 0.2-11.4%. Despite rare mortality, the severity of the disease could be understood by the accompanying comorbidities, that has even led to psychological problems among several patients. The cause and the disease mechanism still remain elusive.
   Objective: To identify potential therapeutic targets and affecting pathways for better insight of the disease pathogenesis.
   Method: The gene expression profile GSE13355 and GSE14905 were retrieved from NCBI, Gene Expression Omnibus database. The GEO profiles were integrated and the DEGs of lesional and non-lesional psoriasis skin were identified using the affy package in R software. The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes pathways of the DEGs were analyzed using cluster-Profiler. Cytoscape, V3.7.1 was utilized to construct protein interaction network and analyze the interactome map of candidate proteins encoded in DEGs. Functionally relevant clusters were detected through Cytohubba and MCODE.
   Results: A total of 1013 genes were differentially expressed in lesional skin of which 557 were upregulated and 456 were downregulated. Seven dysregulated genes were extracted in non-lesional skin. The disease gene network of these DEGs revealed 75 newly identified differentially expressed gene that might have a role in development and progression of the disease. GO analysis revealed keratinocyte differentiation and positive regulation of cytokine production to be the most enriched biological process and molecular function. Cytokines -cytokine receptor was the most enriched pathways. Among 1013 identified DEGs in lesional group, 36 DEGs were found to have altered genetic signature including IL1B and STAT3 which are also reported as hub genes. CCNB1, CCNA2, CDK1, IL1B, CXCL8, MKI 67, ESR1, UBE2C, STAT1 and STAT3 were top 10 hub gene.
   Conclusion: The hub genes, genomic altered DEGs and other newly identified differentially dysregulated genes would improve our understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, moreover, the hub genes could be explored as potential therapeutic targets for psoriasis.

AB  - Introduction: Unavailability of optimal susceptibility testing (ST) challenges the clinical use of colistin. Broth microdilution (BMD), which is the reference for colistin ST, is inconvenient for diagnostics. Vitek2 and E-test although technically easier, are no longer recommended. Materials and Methods: For the evaluation of Vitek2 and E-test in reference with BMD, a total of 138 Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) especially carbapenem-resistant isolates from Tata Medical Center, Kolkata, India, were included during 2017-2018. The evaluation was performed only for Enterobacteriaceae (n = 102), but not for non-fermentative GNB (n = 36) due to lack of colistin-resistant (COLR) isolates. Results and Conclusion: Of 138 isolates, meropenem, colistin and dual resistance were detected in 110 (79.7%), 31 (22.5%) and 21 (15.2%) of isolates, respectively. Using the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines (susceptible, <= 2 mu g/ml), Vitek2 performed better than E-test (essential agreement, 92.2% vs. 63.7%; categorical agreement, 94.1% vs. 93.1%; very major error [VME], 10% vs. 23.3%). However, Vitek2 overcalled resistance than E-test (major error, 4.2% vs. 0%). Considering Chew et al. proposed breakpoints (susceptible, <= 1 mu g/ml), VMEs declined for both test (6.7% vs. 10%), but still remained unacceptable. Of eight colistin-heteroresistant isolates, two VME were categorised by Vitek2, one VME was by E-test, and two were uninterpretable. Both Vitek2 and E-test are unreliable. Further studies correlating minimum inhibitory concentrations with clinical outcome are needed to determine the accurate breakpoints for better patient management.

AB  - Background: We evaluated an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (IIV4) in children 6-35 months of age in a phase III, observer-blind trial. Methods: The aim of this analysis was to estimate vaccine efficacy (VE) in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in each of 5 independent seasonal cohorts (2011-2014), as well as vaccine impact on healthcare utilization in 3 study regions (Europe/Mediterranean, Asia-Pacific and Central America). Healthy children were randomized 1:1 to IIV4 or control vaccines. VE was estimated against influenza confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on nasal swabs. Cultured isolates were characterized as antigenically matched/mismatched to vaccine strains. Results: The total vaccinated cohort included 12,018 children (N = 1777, 2526, 1564, 1501 and 4650 in cohorts 1-5, respectively). For reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed influenza of any severity (all strains combined), VE in cohorts 1-5 was 57.8%, 52.9%, 73.4%, 30.3% and 41.4%, respectively, with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval >0 for all estimates. The proportion of vaccine match for all strains combined in each cohort was 0.9%, 79.3%, 72.5%, 24.1% and 28.6%, respectively. Antibiotic use associated with influenza illness was reduced with IIV4 by 71% in Europe, 36% in Asia Pacific and 59% in Central America. Conclusions: IIV4 prevented influenza in children 6-35 months of age in each of 5 separate influenza seasons in diverse geographical regions. A possible interaction between VE, degree of vaccine match and socioeconomic status was observed. The IIV4 attenuated the severity of breakthrough influenza illness and reduced healthcare utilization, particularly antibiotic use.

AB  - Blood transfusion is an indispensable part of modern medical and surgical practices. More than 35% of critically ill patients receive transfusion of blood components during their intensive care unit stay. The aim of study is to obtain an information regarding the relationship of platelet concentrate (PC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusion on clinical outcome of neonates admitted in neonatal ICU (NICU). This prospective cohort study was conducted from 1st November 2011 to 30th April 2013. The clinical history, blood component details and laboratory parameters were evaluated with clinical outcome. The neonates requiring PC and FFP transfusion were followed up in blood bank for laboratory parameters. Clinical parameters were noted from case file. During the study period, 291 neonates were admitted in NICU. 2 neonates had congenital malformations and thus, were excluded from the study. Of the remaining 289 neonates, 49 neonates received transfusion of platelets and/or FFP. The combined mean donor exposure for all components was found to be 1.48. The mean volume of PC and FFP transfused was 20 ml and 30 ml respectively. The mean pre- and post-transfusion platelet count was 34,000 mu l and 42,000 mu l respectively. The mean pre- and post-transfusion INR was 2.37 and 1.53 respectively. There was a significant increase in platelet count and decrease in INR in transfused neonates. However, no clinical benefit of PC and FFP transfusion seen on bleeding. Transfusion of PC and FFP has significant effect on laboratory parameters as compared to clinical parameter.

AB  - We performed a prospective multi-centre observational study to understand the incidence of IFI in patients with AML in India with use of anti-fungal prophylaxis. All patients with AML receiving either induction chemotherapy or salvage chemotherapy between November 2014 and February 2016 were included in this prospective observational study from 10 Indian centres. IFI was defined as per the revised EORTC-MSG criteria. Data on type of chemotherapy used, type of anti-fungal prophylaxis used, time to neutrophil recovery, incidence of IFI and survival were collected. Two hundred patients (118 male and 82 females) with a median age of 35 years (range: 2-66) were recruited. One hundred and eighty-six (93%) had newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) while 14 (7%) had relapsed disease. IFI occurred in 53 patients (26.5%) with proven or probable IFI occurring in 17 (8.5%). Use of posaconazole prophylaxis (p = 0.027) was the only factor found to be associated with a reduced incidence of IFI. The overall survival (OS) at 6 weeks and 3 months respectively was similar among patients who had IFI (83.0 +/- 5.2%; 81.0 +/- 5.4%) as compared to those without IFI (84.4 + 3.0%; 81.4 +/- 3.2%). This prospective study reveals a high incidence of IFI in patients undergoing chemotherapy for AML in India. The use of posaconazole prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower incidence of IFI. Optimal strategies to prevent IFI need to be studied.

AB  - Objective: Granulosa cell tumors (GCT) are low-grade malignant sex cord-stromal tumors (SCST) with late metastasis/recurrences and long disease-free periods. We performed a clinicopathological evaluation of GCT to ascertain features having prognostic impact. Materials and Methods: All cases of GCT of ovary from January 2006 to December 2018 were assessed for architectural patterns, nuclear grooves, and Call-Exner bodies. Each feature was graded on frequency of occurrence: not present (0)-very frequent (3). Anisonucleosis, necrosis, and inflammation were noted. Cases were grouped on mitotic count; <10 mitosis/10 High power field (HPF) or >=11 mitoses/10 HPF and Ki-67 index; <10% Ki-67 and >=11% Ki-67. Results: GCT formed 60.1% of SCST. Sixty cases' ages were in the range of 15-78 years (median 45). Clinical details were available in 37. Commonest presentation was abnormal uterine bleeding. Serum CA125 was raised in 16.1% and Inhibin in 58.8%. Seventy percent were in stage I. Disease recurrence was associated with higher stage (P = 0.007). The most frequent pattern was diffuse sheets (47%). Call-Exner bodies were absent in 22.2%. Grooves with score 1, 2, and 3 were seen in 35.8%, 23.5%, and 13.6%, respectively. Anisonucleosis was present in 26.7%, necrosis in 11.1%, and lympho-plasmacytic infiltrate in 43%. Out of total, 93.3% had <10 mitosis/10 HPF and 43.2% had recurrence, most with high Ki-67 (P = 0.064). Conclusion: Our study outlines histomorphological spectrum of GCT and emphasizes its frequent occurrence in lower stages with late recurrences. The presence of grooves may indicate granulosa-cell origin. Call-Exner bodies are not a necessity. Histomorphological features are not prognostically important. However, prognostic value of Ki-67 cannot be excluded. Limitation of the study was a small number of cases with follow-up.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES
KW  - CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE
KW  - BIOSYNTHESIS
AB  - Phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase catalyzes a rate limiting penultimate step of the multistep reaction which produces coenzyme A (CoA) as a final product. CoA is required as an essential cofactor in a number of metabolic reactions. Therefore inhibiting the function of this enzyme will lead to cell death in bacteria. Acinetobacter baumannii is multi drug resistant pathogen and causes infections in immunocompromised patients. AbPPAT has been cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized and structures of two complexes of AbPPAT with dephospho coenzyme A (dPCoA) and coenzyme A (CoA) have been determined. Both dPCoA and CoA molecules are observed in the substrate binding site of AbPPAT. A comparison with the structures of the complexes of PPAT from other species shows that the orientations of dPCoA are identical in all the structures. On the other hand, as observed from the structures of the complexes of CoA with PPAT, the orientations of CoA are found to differ considerably. This shows that the substrates occupy identical positions in the substrate binding sites of enzymes whereas the positions of inhibitors may differ. The binding studies carried out using fluorescence method and surface plasmon resonance techniques showed that binding affinity of CoA towards AbPPAT is nearly three times higher than that of dPCoA.

AB  - Amyloidosis secondary to juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a known complication of poorly controlled systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA), occurring in 1-2% of the patients. The IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab is effective in controlling systemic signs and symptoms of sJIA and may be of therapeutic benefit in secondary amyloidosis. Herein, we report the clinical timeline of a 10-year boy with sJIA and secondary amyloidosis, who showed a sustained improvement of systemic symptoms and a reduction in proteinuria with tocilizumab. Compared to the data on adult patients affected with the secondary amyloidosis, there are very few reports on therapeutic options for the children affected with SJIA and secondary amyloidosis in the paediatric population. While doing a systematic literature search for writing this review, we could only retrieve nine case reports and one case series of the children affected with SJIA and secondary amyloidosis, including five cases which were treated with tocilizumab. We also looked into the clinical and biochemical response to various agents that have been used in the previous cases, including tocilizumab. The available literature and the present case report suggest that tocilizumab may be considered as a safe and effective option to treat SJIA-related secondary amyloidosis.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the clinical and molecular spectrum, and factors affecting clinical outcome of patients in India diagnosed with infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD).
   Study design In this multicenter, cross-sectional study, we evaluated the records of 77 patients with IOPD to analyze their clinical course, outcomes, and factors influencing the outcomes.
   Results Of the 77 patients with IOPD, phenotype data were available in 59; 46 (78%) had the classic phenotype. Overall, 58 of 77 (75%) and 19 of 77 (25%) patients were symptomatic before and after age 6 months, respectively. Alphaglucosidase gene variant analysis available for 48 patients (96 alleles) showed missense variants in 49 alleles. Crossreactive immunologic material (CRIM) status could be determined or predicted in 44 of 48 patients. In total, 32 of 44 patients (72%) were CRIM-positive, and 12 of 44 patients (27%) were CRIM-negative. Thirty-nine cases received enzyme-replacement therapy (ERT), alglucosidase alfa, and 38 patients never received ERT. Median age at initiation of ERT was 6.5 months. Response to ERT was better in babies who had CRIM-positive, non-classic IOPD.
   Conclusions This study highlights the clinical spectrum of IOPD in India and provides an insight on various factors, such as undernutrition, feeding difficulties, and recurrent respiratory infection, as possible factors influencing clinical outcomes in these patients. The study also reiterates the importance of raising awareness among clinicians about the need for early diagnosis and timely treatment of IOPD.

AB  - Objective To estimate average annual expenditures per person, total economic burden and distress health financing associated with the treatment of five cardio-metabolic diseases (CMDs-hypertension, diabetes, heart disease (angina, myocardial infarction and heart failure), stroke and chronic kidney disease) in three metropolitan cities in South Asia. Design Cross-sectional surveys. Setting We analysed community-based baseline data from the Centre for cArdio-metabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) Study collected in 2010-2011 representing Chennai and New Delhi (India), and Karachi (Pakistan). Participants We used data from non-pregnant adults (>= 20 years) from the aforementioned cities that responded to a cost-of-illness questionnaire. We estimated health utilisation and expenditures among those reporting taking treatment(s) for the aforementioned CMDs in the last 1 year. We converted all costs to International Dollars (Int$ 2011) and inflated to 2018 values. The annual costs per person were stratified by city, sociodemographic characteristics, contributor of costs and financing methods. The total economic burden of CMDs for each city was projected using age-standardised prevalence and per-person costs of diseases reported in CARRS, applying these to population data from the most recent census. We also calculated distress financing (DF) as having to borrow or sell assets to pay for CMD treatment and identified sociodemographic groups at most risk of DF using multiple regression. Results Of 16 287 CARRS participants, 2883 (17.7%) reported receiving treatment for CMDs. The total annual expenditures reported per patient for CMDs ranged from Int$358 to Int$2425. Medications constituted 46% of total direct expenditures and out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures accounted for nearly 80% of financing these health expenditures. Total economic burdens of CMDs were Int$0.42 billion, Int$3.4 billion and Int$1.4 billion in Chennai, New Delhi and Karachi, respectively. Overall, 36.1% experienced DF, and women (OR=4.4), unemployed (OR=10.7) and uninsured (OR=8.1) adults experienced higher odds of DF. Conclusion CMDs are associated with large economic burdens in South Asia. Due to most payments coming from OOP expenditures and limited insurance, the odds of DF are high.

AB  - A new technique of correcting tube-corneal touch is described in a case of Ahmed glaucoma valve implantation. This technique repositions the intracameral tube without externalization unlike the standard procedures which aim to correct tube-corneal touch. The technique makes use of a transscleral supracapsular anchor suture to facilitate repositioning of the tube within the ciliary sulcus. Feasible only in pseudophakic and aphakic patients, either a preexisting iridectomy or intraoperative iridectomy is an essential prerequisite to perform this procedure. The final positioning of the tube within the sulcus potentially prevents chronic rubbing of the iris by polypropylene suture as opposed to a transcameral suture.

AB  - Purpose The current study was conducted to explore the potential of rutin in preventing sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy. Methods Wistar albino rats (either sex) weighing 200-225 g were intraperitoneally injected with 45 mg/kg streptozotocin (pH 4.5). Rats having blood glucose >= 300 mg/dL were divided into two groups (n = 8; each group). Group I served as diabetic control and received normal saline p.o. Group II received rutin 50 mg/kg p.o. for 24 weeks. At the end of 24 weeks, retinal fundus and fluorescein imaging were done, rats were killed, and retinal biochemical assessments were conducted. Moreover, ocular pharmacokinetics of rutin was assessed in the normal rats after a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg. Results Rutin treatment significantly (p < 0.001) lowered retinal vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and aldose reductase. Rutin treatment significantly (p < 0.001) elevated the levels of total antioxidant capacity of the retinas. Fundus examination of rutin-treated group showed significantly lower tortuosity index and normal fluorescein angiography. Rutin was detected in the retina as well as in aqueous humor of normal rats. Conclusion Rutin treatment significantly arrested the biochemical disturbances of diabetic retinopathy. The distribution of orally ingested rutin in ocular tissues further substantiate its site-specific action.

KW  - herniation
KW  - sub-falcine
KW  - supratentorial
KW  - ventriculostomy
KW  - HERNIATION
AB  - Background: CSF drainage from the ventricular system is a popular and effective technique for intraoperative brain relaxation as it reduces ICP, enlarges extra-axial operative corridors, and slackens the brain increasing its tolerance for surgical manipulation. However, sometimes when the ventricular chambers distant from the site of pathology are tapped, there is a risk of neurological worsening due to paradoxical herniation of the brain, exemplified by the phenomenon of upward transtentorial herniation observed in posterior fossa tumors, consequent to a supratentorial ventriculostomy. Expectation of an analogous phenomenon precludes contralateral ventricular drainage in supratentorial brain tumors producing midline shift, subfalcine herniation, and resultant distension of the opposite lateral ventricles.
   Objective: Demonstrating the safety and efficacy of intraoperative contralateral ventricular drainage in the presence of sub-falcine herniation.
   Methods: Clinical and imaging information were retrospectively collected for four cases in which this technique was adopted.
   Results: The first case was a large clinoidal meningioma with a midline shift and contralateral ventriculomegaly. EVD from the dilated ventricle provided optimum brain conditions for safe resection of the tumor through an orbitopterional approach. The second case required a contralateral EVD to reduce ICP intraoperatively, for a recurrent anaplastic ependymoma with severe mass effect. It reduced the venous hypertension related to raised ICP minimizing the blood loss. Contralateral EVD was utilized to enlarge the working corridor for interhemispheric approach in two cases.
   Conclusion: Contralateral ventricular drainage is a safe, effective, and convenient operative step for reducing brain turgor in the presence of sub-falcine herniation produced by large supratentorial tumors.

AB  - Research on the primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) diagnosis is limited, with only a few large sample size studies, reported from Asian countries. The aim of the present study was to clarify the current prevalence and challenges in PTL diagnosis, and recommended ancillary studies for PTL in non-Western countries. PTL (n = 153) cases were retrieved from 10 institutions in non-Western countries and analyzed. Ultrasound examination (UE) and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were used as main preoperative diagnostic tools in all participating institutions. Flow cytometry (FCM) was performed in the 5 institutions (50%). Lobectomy was the most common histological procedure to confirm the PTL diagnosis. All institutions routinely performed immuno-histochemical analysis. PTL was 0.54% of malignant thyroid tumor cases, with mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALTL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being 54.9% and 38.6%, respectively. Kuma Hospital, where the frequency of MALTL was highest (83.7%), routinely performed FCM using the materials obtained by FNAC. UE and FNAC sensitivities were 62.5% and 57.8%, respectively. In both UE and FNAC, sensitivity of MALTL was lower than of DLBCL. The study elucidated that the prevalence of PTL in non-Western countries was lower than previously reported. We propose that FCM should be more actively used to improve the preoperative diagnosis of MALTL. Our data predicted that the MALTL proportion will increase with improved diagnostic tools, while observation of PTL-suspected nodules without histological examination remains a viable option.

AB  - The zebrafish (Danio rerio), among all amniotes is emerging as a powerful model to study vertebrate organogenesis and regeneration. In contrast to mammals, the adult zebrafish is capable of regenerating damaged axonal tracts; it can replace neurons and glia lost after spinal cord injury (SCI) and functionally recover. In the present paper, we report ultrastructural and cell biological analyses of regeneration processes after SCI. We have focused on event specific analyses of spinal cord regeneration involving different neuronal and glial cell progenitors, such as radial glia, oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPC), and Schwann cells. While comparing the different events, we frequently refer to previous ultrastructural analyses of central nervous system (CNS) injury in higher vertebrates. Our data show (a) the cellular events following injury, such as cell death and proliferation; (b) demyelination and remyelination followed by target innervation and regeneration of synaptic junctions and c) the existence of different progenitors and their roles during regeneration. The present ultrastructural analysis corroborates the cellular basis of regeneration in the zebrafish spinal cord and confirms the presence of both neuronal and different glial progenitors.

AB  - Introduction Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is the most common form of brainstem glioma. The present study was performed to assess if hypofractionated radiotherapy completed in < 3 weeks with temozolomide improves survival in DIPG. Material and methods The present study is a phase II open label randomized trial. The study included newly diagnosed patients with DIPG. Patients in arm A received conventional fractionated RT of 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks while patients in arm B received hypo-fractionated radiotherapy of 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 2.6 weeks along with concurrent Temozolomide (TMZ) 75 mg/m(2) from day 1 to day 17 followed by adjuvant TMZ for six cycles. The survival analysis was performed with modified intention to treat analysis. Results A total of 35 patients were randomized. 33 patients were evaluable. 93% (n = 14) of patients in the conventional arm completed treatment while only 17% (n = 3) of the children could complete planned course of treatment in the experimental arm. The median overall survival (OS) was 11 months (95% CI - 7.5 to 14.5 months) in the conventional arm and 12 months (95% CI - 10.5 to 13.5 months) in the experimental arm (p = 0.208). 28% (n = 5) patients in the experimental arm developed grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity. Conclusion The above study shows that hypofractionated radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide does not improve OS and has higher hematological toxicity. Conventional radiotherapy remains the standard of care.

AB  - Background: Intravenous iron is associated with oxidative stress, and very few studies have assessed change in oxidative stress markers post infusion. Objectives: The study aimed to measure the change in levels of hemoglobin (Hb), serum ferritin, and select oxidative stress markers (malondialdehyde [MDA], superoxide dismutase [SOD], and ferric reducing ability of plasma [FRAP]) 4 weeks following the administration of intravenous iron sucrose (IVIS) among moderately anemic pregnant women who were attending a secondary-level health-care facility, Haryana, North India. Methods: An observational study was conducted (May 2016 to Jan 2018) among pregnant women receiving intravenous iron sucrose i.e., IVIS (300 mg per dose) diluted in 300 mL of normal saline over 20-45 min and were followed up for a period of 4 weeks after the last dose of IVIS (end line). The study outcomes were measured in the levels of Hb, serum ferritin, MDA, SOD, and FRAP from the baseline to the end line. Results: The mean (95% confidence interval) change in the Hb and serum ferritin level 4 weeks after the last dose of IVIS was an increase of 2.5 (2.1-3.0) g/dL (P < 0.001) and 63.0 (44.7-81.3) ng/mL (P < 0.001), respectively. There were no significant changes (baseline to end line) in mean (standard deviation [SD]) MDA level and mean (SD) FRAP level. The mean (SD) SOD level declined significantly (2.2 [0.4] U/mL to 1.6 [0.5] U/mL [P < 0.001]). No life-threatening adverse events were encountered during the study. Conclusion: IVIS was well tolerated and effective in treating moderate anemia in pregnancy. Body iron store was replenished following IVIS administration. There was no increase in oxidative stress following IVIS therapy.

AB  - Increasing HER-2/neu resistance in gastric carcinoma has encouraged search for new biomarkers for targeted therapy. Cellular mesenchymal epithelial transition (C-MET) is one such tyrosine kinase inhibitor proposed for personalized salvage treatment. We determined frequency of C-MET gene copy number variation (CNV) by Fluorescent in-situ hybridization ( FISH) in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and sought its correlation with conventional clinicopathologic parameters. Dual-coloured FISH was done on 32 GAC cases. C-MET gene and centromere 7 signals were counted under fluorescent microscope and ratio was calculated for each case. Correlation between C-MET CNV and conventional clinic-pathologic parameters was done by Fischer exact test. CNV was identified in the form of amplification and polysomy (3.1% each) and associated with poorer prognostic parameters. Our pilot study highlights limited subset of patients that may benefit from anti-C-MET-targeted therapy and thus could be a novel biomarker for targeted intervention in GAC.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, serotype distribution and sequence type (ST) of Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from invasive and non-invasive infection and correlate it with isolates from commensal nasopharyngeal flora to ascertain their role in infection. Materials and Methods: S. pneumoniae isolates from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid and respiratory secretions (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasopharyngeal swab/throat swab) were analysed to determine ST, serotype and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. Serotyping was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reactions as well as by quellung reaction. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was determined using Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method as per the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Minimum inhibitory concentration was determined using E-test for penicillin. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was done to understand genetic relatedness and evolutionary relationship among strains. Results: A total of 125 S. pneumoniae isolates were collected, including 25 from invasive pneumococcal disease, 25 from non-invasive and 75 from nasopharyngeal swab of healthy children (Commensal). Resistance to penicillin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole was observed in 14.4%, 12% and 81.6% of the isolates, respectively, by KirbyBauer's disc diffusion method. Serotype 14 was found to be the most prevalent in invasive and non-invasive isolates, while serotype 6 was the most common in commensal isolates. New STs were found among invasive (ST13826, ST13827), non-invasive (ST13823, ST13824, and ST13961) and commensal (ST13825) isolates. Conclusion: MLST sequence analysis shows that invasive isolates were found to be clustered with non-invasive and commensal isolates. Analysis of MLST suggests the possibility of genetic relatedness and exchange of genetic material between invasive, non-invasive and commensal isolates.

AB  - Background: Augmentation of coronary artery flow by surgical grafting increases coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF), which can be quantified on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). However, transit time flowmetry (TTF) technology remains the most used intraoperative technique for coronary artery graft assessment. The purpose of the present pilot study was to evaluate the predictive value of TEE-based CSBF estimation for identifying favorable TTF graft measurements.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: Single university hospital.
   Patients: Forty patients undergoing triple vessel coronary artery bypass grafting.
   Measurements and Main Results: CSBF was assessed on TEE examination before and after revascularization, estimating the percentage increase in CSBF (LICSBF). Postoperative TTF graft measurements were averaged to compute mean diastolic filling (DF) and pulsatility index (PI). Subjects were grouped based on favorable (PI <= 3, DF >= 50%) and unfavorable (PI > 3, DF < 50%) parameters. The group with PI <= 3 (n = 32) had significantly higher ACSBF compared with the group with PI > 3 (n = 8) (38.22% +/- 12.05%, 13.75% +/- 3.37%, p < 0.001). Delta CSBF was higher in the DF >= 50% group (n = 35) (36.40 +/- 12.99) in contrast to DF < 50% group (n = 5) (11.80 +/- 2.59%). A strong negative and significantly positive correlation was observed between ACSBF with PI, DF (r = -0.903, 0.571, respectively, p <0.001). A Delta CSBF >= 15.5% was found to predict a mean PI <= 3 and DF >= 50% with sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 62.5% for PI and 100% and 100% for DF. A Delta CSBF >= 19% demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100%, 100% and 91.4% for prediction of PI <= 3 and DF >= 50%, respectively.
   Conclusion: TEE-based demonstration of an augmented CSBF can ensure favorable TTF graft parameters, guiding the adequacy of surgical revascularization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and objectives: Nose is considered to be a conspicuous feature of human face. Its different parameters like shape, size, nasal angles etc may indicate one's gender, age, race, adapted climatic conditions, and the environment to which one belongs to. Furthermore, it is an important component and determinant of an individual's physical outlook and appearance. The current study provides a new approach for the assistance of anthropologists and forensic experts in human identification and sex determination from the nasal angles.
   Methodology: The study was performed on a total of 500 subjects (250 males and 250 females) belonging to north India (Mandi, Himachal Pradesh State). In comparison to the classical and manual methods for nasal angle measurements, an automated approach was followed in the present study. A Windows-based software called tpsDig2 was used for nasal angle measurements by utilization of the landmarks (nasion, pronasale, subnasale, and alare). Three nasal angles (nasal prominence angle, inter-alar angle, and nasal tip angle) were measured in all the subjects and each measurement was repeated thrice to reduce the measurement error and increase the specificity and efficiency of the results. Discriminant function statistics was used for determination of sex from different nasal angles.
   Results and Conclusion: The results of the statistical analysis (ANOVA) performed using SPSS reveal the significant difference between males and females in all the 3 repeated measurements of nasal angles. The final discriminant classification statistics show that 64% of original grouped cases have been correctly classified and the designed statistical model can be used in several forensic scenarios for the sex determination on the basis of the available nasal angles. The study may be further useful in the identification cases pertaining to facial reconstruction. The investigation may also be helpful in providing specific correlation of the nasal angles with the other parts of the face in the cases of remodelling and reformation of craniofacial alterations and reconstructions in plastic surgery and aesthetics.

AB  - Objective To describe the perspectives on life participation by young adults with childhood-onset chronic kidney disease (CKD). Design Semi-structured interviews; thematic analysis. Setting Multiple centres across six countries (Australia, Canada, India, UK, USA and New Zealand). Participants Thirty young adults aged 18 to 35 years diagnosed with CKD during childhood. Results We identified six themes: struggling with daily restrictions (debilitating symptoms and side effects, giving up valued activities, impossible to attend school and work, trapped in a medicalised life, overprotected by adults and cautious to avoid health risks); lagging and falling behind (delayed independence, failing to keep up with peers and socially inept); defeated and hopeless (incapacitated by worry, an uncertain and bleak future, unworthy of relationships and low self-esteem and shame); reorienting plans and goals (focussing on the day-to-day, planning parenthood and forward and flexible planning); immersing oneself in normal activities (refusing to miss out, finding enjoyment, determined to do what peers do and being present at social events); and striving to reach potential and seizing opportunities (encouragement from others, motivated by the illness, establishing new career goals and grateful for opportunities). Conclusions Young adults encounter lifestyle limitations and missed school and social opportunities as a consequence of developing CKD during childhood and as a consequence lack confidence and social skills, are uncertain of the future, and feel vulnerable. Some re-adjust their goals and become more determined to participate in 'normal' activities to avoid missing out. Strategies are needed to improve life participation in young adult 'graduates' of childhood CKD and thereby strengthen their mental and social well-being and enhance their overall health.

AB  - Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a crucial role in neuroplasticity of the brain, and its role in alcohol dependence has been explored in the recent past. Animal studies suggest that BDNF may function as a protective factor in transition from social drinking to an alcohol use disorder. However, clinical studies have not been able to establish similar findings and have shown mixed results. In order to obtain a comprehensive understanding, the current review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the role of BDNF in alcohol dependence. Articles were retrieved using search engines PubMed and Google Scholar. Original research studies focusing on human participants, published in English till October 2018 were reviewed. Studies which measured BDNF levels in serum or plasma or both were included in this study. A total of 13 studies were found which compared BDNF levels in alcohol-dependent patients with control population. The studies have mixed findings. Seven studies measured BDNF levels across the abstinence period, and most of the studies show improving BDNF levels across the abstinence. The current review supports the notion that BDNF plays an important role in the neuroplasticity of alcohol dependence. However, it is premature at this stage to draw conclusions that BDNF may be used as a biomarker, as there have been inconclusive findings when compared with control population. Future studies with longer follow-ups, larger sample size, comparing early and late periods of alcohol abstinence are required for better understanding of the role BDNF in alcohol dependence.

AB  - Phospholipases A2 (PLA(2)s) belong to a superfamily of enzymes responsible for hydrolysis of the sn-2 fatty acids of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid. PLA(2)s are the rate limiting enzyme for the downstream synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes that are the main mediators of inflammation. The extracellular forms of this enzyme are also called the secretary phospholipase A2 (sPLA(2)) and are distributed extensively in most of the tissues in the human body. Their integral role in inflammatory pathways has been the primary reason for the extensive research on this molecule. The catalytic mechanism of sPLA(2) is initiated by a histidine/aspartic acid/calcium complex within the active site. Though they are known to have certain housekeeping functions, certain mutations of sPLA(2) are known to be implicated in causation of certain pathologies leading to diseases such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, benign fleck retina, neurodegeneration, and asthma. We present an overview of human sPLA(2) and a comprehensive compilation of the mutations that result in various disease phenotypes. The study not only helps to have a holistic understanding of human sPLA(2) mutations and their clinical implications, but is also a useful platform to initiate research pertaining to structure-function relationship of the mutations to develop effective therapies for management of these diseases.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the structural features of wild and mutant forms of the pPAF-AH enzyme that are responsible for coronary artery disease.
   Methods: Mutant variants of human pPAF-AH having either V279F, Q281R, or both were modelled and evaluated for stereo chemical and structural correctness. The 3D coordinates of substrate PAF were retrieved from the PubChem database was solvated and minimized on Discovery Studio, and docked to the wild and mutant enzyme models. The top docked pose complex was refined by MD simulation.
   Results: pPAF-AH model comprises of 420 amino acids in a a/(3-hydrolase fold that contains a substrate-binding hydrophobic channel with an active site pocket having a catalytic triad of Ser273, Asp296 and His351. Mutations at positions 279 and 281 are opposite one another on the middle of 12 residues long H5 helix that forms the hydrophobic core of the enzyme. V279F causes a tilt on the axis of the mutation bearing helix to avoid steric clashes with the hydrophobic residues on the fl-sheets adjacent to it, inducing subtle conformational changes on the H5-fl8 loop, fl8 sheet, and the loop bearing Asp296. A cascade of conformational changes induces a change in the orientation of His351 resulting in loss of hydrogen bonded interaction with catalytic Ser273. Q281R causes a shortening of H5 and fl8, which induces conformational changes of the loops bearing Ser273 and Asp296, respectively. Simultaneous conformational changes of secondary structural elements result in the flipping of His351 causing a break in the catalytic triad. Also, there is a compromise in the substrate-binding area and volume in the mutants resulting in loss of binding to its substrate.
   Conclusion: Mutant enzymes show changes at the site of the mutation, secondary motif conformations and global structural conformations that adversely affect the active site, decrease substrate channel volume and decrease stability, thereby affecting enzymatic function.

AB  - Bisphenols are widely used in the synthesis of polycarbonate plastics, epoxy resins, and thermal paper, which are used in manufacturing items of daily use. Packaged foods and drinks are the main sources of exposure to bisphenols. These chemicals affect humans and animals by disrupting the estrogen, androgen, progesterone, thyroid, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor functions. Bisphenols exert numerous harmful effects because of their interaction with receptors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell signal alterations. Both cohort and case-control studies have determined an association between bisphenol exposure and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, reproductive abnormalities, obesity, and diabetes. Prenatal exposure to bisphenols results in developmental disorders in animals. These chemicals also affect the immune cells and play a significant role in initiating the inflammatory response. Exposure to bisphenols exhibit age, gender, and dose-dependent effects. Even at low concentrations, bisphenols exert toxicity, and hence deserve a critical assessment of their uses. Since bisphenols have a global influence on human health, the need to discover the underlying pathways involved in all disease conditions is essential. Furthermore, it is important to promote the use of alternatives for bisphenols, thereby restricting their uses.

AB  - Purpose: A review study on the biochemistry of epilepsy showed that in epileptic patients, serum glucose and cholesterol concentrations are low, sodium is unaffected, potassium increases, glucose is high and mild hypocalcemia. We have conducted a biochemical study on sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) cases in an attempt to establish the characteristic biochemical values to diagnose these deaths.
   Methods: This was a hospital based case-control study done at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi for one year. Twenty SUDEP cases and 20 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study. Femoral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, vitreous humor, and pericardial fluid were biochemically analyzed for sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose, N-acetyl- cysteine activated creatine kinase (CK-NAC) and isoenzyme CK-MB.
   Result: Serum sodium, CK-MB and CK-NAC level was found significantly increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths. Likewise, in CSF, sodium and CK-NAC was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases. In vitreous humor, sodium and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to nonepileptic deaths. In pericardial fluid, sodium, CK-NAC and CK-MB level was found increased and potassium level was found decreased in SUDEP cases in comparison to non-epileptic deaths.
   Conclusion: It concludes that high sodium level and low potassium level could be associated with SUDEP. However, this is a small size study, a larger study is needed to verify the findings. Furthermore, it is difficult to conclude whether these findings are exclusive to SUDEP.

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - Background: Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) is a known cause of progressive myelopathy which can be treated either by surgery or embolization. Indocyanine green angiography videoangiography (ICG-VA) during surgery can locate the exact location of AV shunting.
   Objective: To determine the clinical outcome following obliteration of the fistula and to study the role of ICG in identifying the presence and location of SDAVF; to add a comparative study of patients treated by embolization.
   Materials and Methods: Patients treated for SDAVF in our centre from 2005 to 2015 were studied for clinical and radiological features, and outcome following obliteration of fistula.
   Results: Of the total 33 patients (27 males, six females), 19 patients were operated without the use of ICG, nine were operated with the use of ICG and successful embolization was done in five. Acute presentation was seen in five. Single feeder was seen in 20 patients, multiple in 13. Mean follow-up was 58 months. All patients in ICG group improved. Three out of 19 patients in the non-ICG group (15.78%) required re-operation. With the use of ICG, the improvement in Aminoff Logue score was significantly better (P < 0.005). Embolization was tried in 13 cases, but successful in five (38%).
   Conclusions: Surgery with intraoperative ICG shows the exact location of AVF. This decreases the chance of postoperative clinical deterioration and improves patient outcome.

AB  - Background: Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in the SHOX, GHR, and IGFALS genes among Indian children with idiopathic short stature (ISS), and assess the genotype-phenotype correlation.
   Methods: We recruited 61 children with short stature, who were born appropriate for gestational age, had no obvious dysmorphism or disproportion, and in whom step-wise investigative work-up (including provocative growth hormone test) was normal. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was undertaken for identifying deletions/duplications in the SHOX gene. Bidirectional sequencing was performed for identifying variants in the SHOX and GHR genes in all, and for the IGFALS gene in those with serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) <-1 standard deviation. The genotype-phenotype correlation was studied.
   Results: Four children (6.5%) had pathogenic heterozygous variants in the SHOX gene, with one child each having duplication of exon 5, splice site point variant c.278-1G >C in exon 3, partial deletion and complete deletion. None of the patients had pathogenic variants in the GHR gene. Of the 39 patients in whom the IGFALS gene was sequenced, novel heterozygous likely pathogenic variants were found in two children. One had the frameshift variant c.764_765insT, p.A265Gfs*114. The second had the missense variant c.1793G > A, p.R598H predicted by MutationTaster as 'disease causing', and indicated by the protein-modelling study as having compromised binding with IGF-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) due to altered conformation of the interacting loop.
   Conclusions: Pathogenic variants in the SHOX and IGFALS genes account for a significant proportion of Indian children with ISS. Further molecular studies using next generation sequencing are needed to gain insight into pathophysiological mechanisms and effective treatment strategies for ISS.

TI  - Aggressive pelvic angiomyxoma and its mimics: can imaging be the guiding light?
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the imaging characteristics of aggressive angiomyxoma (AA) and identify features which would help to differentiate it from similar appearing lesions.
   Methods: A retrospective review of departmental records was done and cases where AA was suspected on CT or MRI were included. With histopathology as gold-standard, the cases were grouped into AA or mimics and differentiating features were identified on USG, CT and MRI. Fischer's exact test was applied for the statistical significance of the differentiating features.
   Results: 18 patients were identified of which 2 were excluded for lack of histopathology records. 10 were AA and 6 mimics which included 2 fibromatoses, 2 neurogenic tumors, and 1 each of germ cell tumor and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. On MRI, all AA showed T2 hyperintensity and intense contrast enhancement with characteristic laminated pattern in 7/9 cases. Diffusion restriction was seen in 2/3 cases, cystic component in 4/10 and hemorrhage in 1/10 cases. Pelvic fibromatosis was the closest imaging differential showing laminated pattern in one of the cases.
   Conclusion: Large pelvic mass with abdominal/perineal extension in reproductive age female patient should lead to suspicion of AA. Laminated pattern on T2 weighted images and intense homogeneous contrast enhancement further add to the diagnostic confidence.
   Advances in knowledge: This study for the first time describes radiological mimics of AA. Large cystic component, diffusion restriction, hemorrhage and organ infiltration have not been previously described in AA.

AB  - Introduction: Genetic factors may play a role in the susceptibility of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The present case -control study hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) gene may affect the risk of ICH.
   Materials and Methods: In this study, we investigated the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (-308G/A, +488G/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C) within TNF-alpha gene promoter and their haplotypes with the risk of ICH in a North Indian population. Genotyping was determined by using the SNaPshot method for 100 ICH patients and 100 age and sex-matched ICH-free controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis with adjusting multiple demographic and risk factor variables was used to calculate the strength of association between INF-alpha gene polymorphisms and risk of ICH. Haplotypes were reconstructed using PHASE 2.0, and patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis were performed using Haploview version 4.2 software.
   Results: TNF-alpha, +488G/A gene polymorphism was found to be independently associated with the risk of ICH under dominant [GG + GA vs. AAJ (OR = 3.1; 95% CI = 12-8.2: P= 0.001) and allelic [G vs. A] (OR = 22; 95% CI = 1.2-4.2: P= 0.007) models. However, no significant association between -3080/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C gene polymorphisms and risk of ICH was observed. Haplotype analysis showed that 308A-488G -857C -1031T and 308G -488A-857T-1031T haplotypes were significantly associated with an increased risk of ICH. Strong LD was observed for + 488G/A and -857CiT TNF-alpha polymorphisms (D' = 0.72, ru= 0.01).
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the INF-cc +488G/A polymorphism may be an important risk factor for ICH, whereas -3080/A, -857C/T, and -1031T/C gene polymorphisms may not be associated with risk of ICH in North Indian population.

AB  - Objective To develop a normal reference range of Infant pulmonary function test (IPFT) indices for Indian children. Design Prospective birth cohort study. Setting Division of Pediatric Pulmonology of a tertiary-care institute in India from August 2012 to March 2017. Participants All neonates born at the institute during the study period were screened for eligibility. Measurement IPFT at baseline and every 6-month until 36-months of age. Main Outcome Measure(s) Tidal breathing flow-volume loop (TBFVL), Rapid thoracoabdominal compression (RTC), and Raised volume RTC (RVRTC) indices at baseline and follow-up. Results 310 newborns were enrolled in the cohort; 281 of them (169 male) had completed 36-months of follow-up at the end of the study period. There was no influence of gender on the baseline IPFT indices. Tidal volume per unit body weight (V-T/kg) significantly increased from baseline to 36 months of age (P<0.001) while the peak ratio (t(PTEF)/t(E)) initially decreased in first 18-months of age (P<0.001), after that returned to the baseline value by 36 months of age. RTC indices did not change significantly from baseline values. In RVRTC, the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 0.5s to forced vital capacity (FEV0.5/FVC) was significantly decreased from baseline to 36 months of age (P=0.002). Conclusions Normal values for various IPFT indices for TBFVL, RTC, and RVRTC from neonates to the age of 36-month are provided. These data may be used as normative data for healthy neonates and children of Indian origin.

AB  - Protective antibody responses to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection evolve only in a fraction of infected individuals by developing broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and/or effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). HIV-1 chronically infected adults and children on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) showed a reduction in ADCC activity and improvement in HIV-1 specific neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses. Early initiation of cART in infected adults is found to be beneficial in reducing the viral load and delaying disease progression. Herein, we longitudinally evaluated the effect of cART on HIV-1 specific plasma ADCC and nAb responses in a cohort of 20 perinatally HIV-1 subtype-C infected infants and children 52 years of age, pre-cART and up to 1 year post-cART initiation. Significant reductions in HIV-1 specific plasma ADCC responses to subtype-C and subtype-B viruses and improvement in HIV-1 neutralization were observed in HIV-1 infected children 1 year post cART initiation. A positive correlation between reduction in viral load and the loss of ADCC response was observed. This study provides information aiding the understanding of the effects of early initiation of cART on antibody effector functions and viral neutralization in HIV-1 infected children, which needs to be further evaluated in large cohorts of HIV-1 infected children on cART to plan future intervention strategies.

AB  - G-quadruplexes can form in protein coding and non-coding segments such as the untranslated regions and introns of the mRNA transcript of several genes. This implies that amino acid forms of the G-quadruplex may have important consequences for protein homeostasis and the diseases caused by their alterations thereof. However, the absence of a suitable model and multitude of predicted physical forms has precluded a comprehensive enumeration and analysis of potential translatable G-quadruplexes. In this manuscript a mathematical model of a short translatable G-quadruplex (TG4) in the protein coding segment of the mRNA of a hypothetical gene is presented. Several novel indices (alpha, beta) are formulated and utilized to categorize and select codons along with the amino acids that they code for. A generic algorithm is then iteratively deployed which computes the entire complement of peptide members that TG4 corresponds to, i.e., PTG4 similar to TG4. The presence, distribution and relevance of this peptidome to protein sequence is investigated by comparing it with disorder promoting short linear motifs. In frame termination codon, co-occurrence, homology and distribution of overlapping/shared amino acids suggests that TG4 (similar to PTG4) may facilitate misfolding-induced proteostasis. The findings presented rigorously argue for the existence of a unique and potentially clinically relevant peptidome of a short translatable G-quadruplex that could be used as a diagnostic- or prognostic-screen of certain proteopathies.

AB  - Purpose: Barrett Universal II (BU-II) is considered as one of the most accurate intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas; however, there is no literature studying the same in Indian population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of BU-II formula in prediction of IOL power for cataract surgery in Asian Indian population. This was an institutional, prospective, observational study. Methods: Patients with senile cataract who underwent phacoemulsification with posterior chamber IOL implantation were enrolled in the study. Biometry data from Lenstar-LS900 was used and IOL power was calculated using four IOL formulas: modified SRK-II, SRK/T, Olsen, and BU-II. Primary outcome was measured as the prediction error in postoperative refraction for each formula and secondary outcome was measured as the difference in mean absolute errors between the four formulas. SPSS Version-21 with P < 0.05 considered significant. Results: A total of 244 eyes were included in the study and were divided into three groups in accordance to axial length (AL): Group 1 (AL: 22-24.5 mm; N = 135), Group 2 (AL <22 mm; N = 53), and Group 3 (AL >24.5 mm; N = 56). BU-II formula gave the lowest mean absolute error (0.37 +/- 0.27D) and median absolute error (0.34) in predicted postoperative refraction in the entire study population. When compared with the other formulas, mean absolute error was significantly lower in all three groups (P < 0.0005) as well, except for Olsen formula in the normal AL group, where the results were comparable (P = 0.742). Conclusion: BU-II performed as the most accurate formula in the prediction of postoperative refraction over a wide range of ALs.

TI  - Towards understanding global patterns of antimicrobial use and resistance in neonatal sepsis: insights from the NeoAMR network
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DISEASE IN CHILDHOOD
KW  - B STREPTOCOCCAL DISEASE
KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - Objective To gain an understanding of the variation in available resources and clinical practices between neonatal units (NNUs) in the low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) setting to inform the design of an observational study on the burden of unit-level antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
   Design A web-based survey using a REDCap database was circulated to NNUs participating in the Neonatal AMR research network. The survey included questions about NNU funding structure, size, admission rates, access to supportive therapies, empirical antimicrobial guidelines and period prevalence of neonatal blood culture isolates and their resistance patterns.
   Setting 39 NNUs from 12 countries.
   Patients Any neonate admitted to one of the participating NNUs.
   Interventions This was an observational cohort study.
   Results The number of live births per unit ranged from 513 to 27 700 over the 12-month study period, with the number of neonatal cots ranging from 12 to 110. The proportion of preterm admissions <32 weeks ranged from 0% to 19%, and the majority of units (26/39, 66%) use Essential Medicines List 'Access' antimicrobials as their first-line treatment in neonatal sepsis. Cephalosporin resistance rates in Gram-negative isolates ranged from 26% to 84%, and carbapenem resistance rates ranged from 0% to 81%. Glycopeptide resistance rates among Gram-positive isolates ranged from 0% to 45%.
   Conclusion AMR is already a significant issue in NNUs worldwide. The apparent burden of AMR in a given NNU in the LMIC setting can be influenced by a range of factors which will vary substantially between NNUs. These variations must be considered when designing interventions to improve neonatal mortality globally.

AB  - Background: The high mobility group box 1 (hmgb1) is one of the frequently over-expressed genes whose aberrant expression is reported in a number of human cancers. Various strategies are underway to inhibit hmgb1 expression in cancer cells having considerable therapeutic value.
   Objective: The present work involves selective transcriptional inhibition of the hmgb1 gene using selective DNA triplex structure-based gene technology. Here, the promoter region of the hmgb1 gene at position (-183 to -165) from the transcription start site as a target was selected using bioinformatic tools.
   Methods: The DNA triplex formation by the DNA of the target gene and TFO was confirmed using UV absorption spectroscopy, Circular Dichroism, and Isothermal Calorimetry.
   Results: Treatment of HepG2 cell with specific Triplex-forming Oligonucleotide significantly downregulated HMGB1 expression level at mRNA and protein levels by 50%, while the classical anticancer drugs, actinomycin/adriamycin as positive controls showed 65% and the combination of TFO and drug decreased by 70%. The anti-proliferative effects of TFO correlated well with the fact of accumulation of cells in the Go phase and apoptotic cell death. Further, the binding of anti-cancer drugs to hmgb1 is stronger in DNA triplex state as compared to hmgb I alone, suggesting the combination therapy as a better option.
   Conclusion: Therefore, the ability of hmgb1 targeted triplex-forming oligonucleotide in combination with triplex selective anticancer drug holds promise in the treatment of malignancies associated with hmgbl overexpression. The result obtained may open up new vistas to provide a basis for the rational drug design and searching for high-affinity ligands with a high triplex selectivity.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are a group of heterogeneous aggressive tumors affecting more than half a million patients worldwide annually. While the tobacco- and alcohol-associated HNSCC tumors are declining, human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced tumors are on rise. Despite recent advances in multimodality therapeutic interventions including surgery in combination with chemoradiation therapy (CRT), the overall 5-year survival has not improved more than 50%. The underlying reasons for this dismal prognosis is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to CRT. While previous studies were focused to target tumor cells, recent findings have implicated the involvement of tumor microenvironment (TME) on tumor progression and response to therapy. HNSCC TME includes cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, immune cells, endocrine cells, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including collagen and fibronectin. Understanding the crosstalk between TME and cancer cells is important to formulate more effective novel therapies and to overcome resistance mechanisms. Here, we summarized the current literature on recent advances on HNSCC TME with special emphasis on novel cell-cell interactions and therapies currently under development.

AB  - Background: Family accommodation (FA) is a phenomenon whereby caregivers assist/facilitate rituals or behaviors related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). FA, however, has been explored primarily in the Western population, and it is unclear to what extent it might be present in diverse cultural settings. At present, little is known about the extent and predictors of FA among caregivers of adult OCD patients in India. Aims: The study aims to assess the extent, clinical correlates, and predictors of FA in the caregivers of adults with OCD. Settings and Design: Cross-sectional study conducted in an outpatient setting in a tertiary-care hospital. Materials and Methods: Hundred and one adult patients of either gender with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 diagnosis of OCD and 101 caregivers were included. The patients were assessed using Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule Version 2.0 12-item version (WHO-DAS 2.0.12), Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impressions Scale for Improvement. The FA Scale-Self Rated Version (FAS-SR) was applied on caregivers after Hindi translation. Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics, group comparisons, and Pearson's product moment correlations were carried out. Multiple linear regression modeling was performed with the total FAS-SR score as the dependent variable. Results: About 92% of caregivers displayed at least some form of FA. Higher scores on HAM-D, YBOCS, WHODAS, and CGI-S were associated with higher scores on FAS-SR scale, which reached statistical significance (P < 0.01). Conclusions: FA in OCD appears to be a frequent phenomenon. Higher FA is associated with higher symptom severity and disability, emphasizing its clinical and research relevance for future studies.

AB  - Background: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, systemic disease mainly affecting joints. Presently, there is no specific treatment/ drug available for curing RA except few supportive medicines. Therefore, the focus has been shifted to medicinal plants for the treatment of such diseases. Choerospondias axillaris commonly known as Lupsi/Lapsi and has been reported to have several properties for the treatment of various diseases.
   Objective: The present study has been conducted to explore the anti-inflammatory effects of Choerospondi as axillaris fruit extract on Synoviocytes (FLS) and Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat model.
   Methods: Methanolic extract of the Choerospondias arillaris fruit was used for determining phytochemical, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Antioxidant activity of Choerospondias axillaris fruit was determined by free radicals scavenging assays and bioactive compounds were identified via LC-MS/MS analysis. Anti-inflammatory effect was investigated in RA and Osteo Arthritis (OA) primary cells and also in Collagen Induced Arthritis (CIA) rat models. Further, the medicinal properties of anti-inflammatory bioactive compounds were supported by docking studies.
   Results: In-vitro and in-vivo studies showed significant decrease in the levels of inflammatory cytokines. Docking analysis revealed that quercetin inhibits TNF-alpha having -9.1 kcal/mol binding energy and 10.13 mu M inhibitory constant. Quercetin also inhibits IL-6 having -6.6 kcal/mol binding energy and 21.9 mu M inhibitory constant.
   Conclusion: Observed results suggest that the underutilized fruit Choerospondias axillaris can be used to reduce the inflammation of inflammatory diseases like RA.

AB  - Case fatality rate (CFR) and doubling time are important characteristics of any epidemic. For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), wide variations in the CFR and doubling time have been noted among various countries. Early in the epidemic, CFR calculations involving all patients as denominator do not account for the hospitalised patients who are ill and will die in the future. Hence, we calculated cumulative CFR (cCFR) using only patients whose final clinical outcomes were known at a certain time point. We also estimated the daily average doubling time. Calculating CFR using this method leads to temporal stability in the fatality rates, the cCFR stabilises at different values for different countries. The possible reasons for this are an improved outcome rate by the end of the epidemic and a wider testing strategy. The United States, France, Turkey and China had high cCFR at the start due to low outcome rate. By 22 April, Germany, China and South Korea had a low cCFR. China and South Korea controlled the epidemic and achieved high doubling times. The doubling time in Russia did not cross 10 days during the study period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Split cord malformations (SCMs) are among the rare congenital spinal anomalies. In 1992, Pang et al. proposed the unified theory of embryogenesis and explained the formation of SCM type 1 and 2. This theory has been widely accepted in the neurosurgical literature, backed by several studies. However, there have been reports in the literature that defy both the classification as well as the formation of SCMs, based on the unified theory of embryogenesis. We report a case of SCM that does not fit into this classification scheme and try to elucidate its embryologic basis, with review of the relevant literature. We also attempt to include this variety into the existing classification system of SCMs.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: An 11-year-old boy presented with low backache after trivial trauma. He was neurologically intact. Imaging showed low-lying tethered cord and a midline ventral bony spur (D12, L1) with a single dural sac encasing both the hemicords. Surgical exploration showed a ventral bony spur with 2 hemicords, enclosed in a single dural tube. Excision of the bony spur and detethering of the filum terminal were performed. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged satisfactorily.
   CONCLUSIONS: SCMs possibly represent a continuum of changes beginning at the gestational age of days 20-30. Terminology such as mixed or intermediate type is used to denote SCMs that show features of both type 1 and type II. We prefer using type 1.5 SCMs for all such cases, thereby avoiding confusion and maintaining uniformity in the nomenclature. However, further experimental studies are required to substantiate our understanding of these complex embryologic anomalies on the basis of current hypotheses.

AB  - Introduction: Most of the cardiovascular diseases come under the umbrella of atherosclerosis. Statins, a class of drug, well known to treat cardiovascular diseases, exhibit poor solubility and low bioavailability which limits their applications. In this study, oyster mushroom (Pleurotus sajor-caju), was used to prepare nanoparticles of statins to explore whether it could achieve better solubility, bioavailability and efficacy at a lower dose compared with nanoparticles from Lovastatin, a commercial drug.
   Methods: Nanoparticles of statins were prepared from both the commercial as well as herbal source using the wet milling technique. Prepared nanoparticles from both the sources were characterized using characterization techniques such as DLS, UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, FTIR and HPLC which were compared with their bulk form for their efficacy. Antioxidant activity of statins was also evaluated by DPPH scavenging assay.
   Results: These results demonstrated a new method of preparation of statin nanoparticles. The SEM analysis of herbal as well as commercial nano formulations showed the size ranged between 60-90 nm and their HPLC analysis confirmed the presence and elution of lovastatin at approximately 9 min. Results of the antioxidant assay showed that nanoparticles synthesized from commercial drug, lovastatin, and from mushroom showed 76.57 % and 73.83 % of inhibition, respectively which was much higher than their bulk counterpart which showed only 16.77 % inhibition.
   Conclusions: The study has provided a method to combat the toxicity effects associated with bulk statins by synthesising nanoparticles of statins with greater efficacy, higher bioavailability, more solubility and greater radical scavenging capacity at a lower dose.

AB  - High-throughput, accurate, cost-effective and rapid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) is the need of the hour in face of the global coronavirus disease pandemic. This target is achievable, within a relatively short time through capacity building of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests by utilising the strengths of intra and inter institutional networks. These networks act as force multiplier for vital resources which are required for capacity building, namely, leadership, expertise, equipment, space, infection control inputs and human resources. In this article, we report the experience of capacity building for delivery of RT-PCR tests for SARS CoV-2 from a cancer hospital in Eastern India. The relevance, mode of operation and value addition of this essential public health service are discussed in the context of inter departmental collaboration and interaction with other institutes through the existing diagnostic, surveillance and infection control networks. This networking model for service development and delivery could be used by other centres.

AB  - Aim Pattern of kidney diseases varies across geographies due to multiple factors. There is a paucity of information from South Asia due to the absence of nationwide/regional biopsy registries. This study aimed to delineate the spectrum of renal parenchymal diseases in our region. Methods Records of kidney biopsies done in our nephrology department between 2006 and 2016 were analysed. Clinico-pathological correlation was done from the available records. Results Of the 3275 biopsy evaluated, 61.9% were males, and mean age was 33.2 +/- 14.2 years. 6.2% patients were elderly (age >= 60 years). Nephrotic syndrome (60.3%) was the commonest indication for biopsy. On histology, 73.0% patients had primary glomerulonephritis (GN), 15.5% secondary GN, 5.3% tubulo-interstitial and 3.7% vascular disease. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) was the commonest primary GN accounting for 18.2% of all GNs, followed by minimal change disease (16.8%), membranous nephropathy (MN) (16.0%) and IgA nephropathy (10.4%). Lupus nephritis (10.6%) and amyloidosis (3.7%) were the commonest secondary GN. The commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome was minimal change disease (22.9%), acute nephritic syndrome was lupus nephritis (30.6%), rapidly progressive renal failure was pauci-immune crescentic GN (24.5%). IgA nephropathy was the commonest etiology of asymptomatic urinary abnormalities (26.3%) and gross haematuria (50%). About 60.9% patients of undetermined chronic kidney disease had glomerular diseases, and 13.6% had chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. Lupus nephritis and acute cortical necrosis were significantly more common in females compared with males. Conclusion This is one of the largest cohorts of kidney biopsies from India, and it delineates the unique features and differences in the pattern of kidney disease in our population.

AB  - Aim: The aim of the present study is to understand the distribution of A1c in four different age groups in young adults and its relation to other co-variants.
   Methods: The countrywide data was collected in 2017 in Individuals with high risk analysed by Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) and self-declared diabetics were identified after screening a sample of 240,968 individuals from rural (4 villages of about 500 adults each) and urban (4 census enumeration blocks of about 500 adults each) population spanning 65 districts of 29 states/UTs of Indian subcontinent. Blood tests and other detailed assessments were carried out on this selected group. This study presents the analysis of the A1c values of 2862 young adults (<35 years).
   Results: In the age group of 31-34 years, the proportion of Diabetes (22.36%) and Prediabetes (9.86%) was higher in comparison with younger age groups. Also, Diabetes (7.3%) and Prediabetes (22%) were highest among those who had parental history of DM in both parents as compared to those with Diabetes history in one parent [Diabetes (7.1%) or Prediabetes (19.0%)] and no Diabetes Parental History (Diabetes (7.3%) and Prediabetes (18.3%) cases. BMI was found to play a significant positive correlation with Diabetes and Prediabetes (p < 0.001) with range of A1c.
   Conclusion: Age, BMI and parental history were found to be correlated with A1c levels in IDRS screened high-risk population. With increasing age, the proportion of Diabetics and Prediabetics also increased with positive correlation of age with A1c levels. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Phototherapeutic keratectomy is an excimer laser-based surgical procedure widely performed by corneal surgeons for treating anterior corneal stromal pathologies. Phototherapeutic keratectomy helps by ablating the corneal stroma, thereby improving corneal clarity and smoothening the surface. Transient discomfort and induced hyperopia from corneal flattening are the immediate postoperative concerns. The long-term course is often marked by the recurrence of original corneal pathology and corneal haze formation. Phototherapeutic keratectomy, however, allows for repeat stromal ablation for managing recurrences, as the corneal thickness permits, without affecting the outcome of future keratoplasty. Adjunctive methods such as topical mitomycin-C may be additionally used to reduce recurrence rates. Also, various masking agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose, sodium hyaluronate, and dextran are used in eyes with irregular corneal surface to allow for uniform stromal ablation. Overall, phototherapeutic keratectomy has provided corneal surgeons an additional surgical tool, particularly those residing in developing nations where the availability of donor corneal tissue is an important limiting factor.

AB  - Many neurological conditions may result in long-term disability. The measures of prevalence and mortality vastly understate the disability they cause. In the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 (equal opportunities, protection of rights, and full participation), neurological conditions are ignored. Although Indian Disability Evaluation and Asessment Scale (IDEAS), which assesses psychiatric conditions, does include dementia as one of the neurodegenerative conditions. Additionally, according to the global burden of disease report, 33% of years lived with neurological disability and 13% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are due to neurological and psychiatric disorders. In 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a new definition of disability, declaring it an umbrella term with the following three major components; 1) impairments: problems in body function or structure, 2) activity limitations: difficulties encountered by a person in executing a task or action, and 3) participation restrictions: problems of involvement in life situations experienced by a person. Hence, an attempt was made to rectify the above concerns. To address the above mentioned concerns, we think that there is a need of a comprehensive format for neurological disabilities assessment which would also include objective neuropsychological assessments. As future directions, national level meetings are required to formulate 'Indian Standard Track for Assessing Neurological Disability' (I-STAND) and uniform guidelines for disability assessment in 'chronic neurological conditions' with a special focus on "neuropsychological disability".

AB  - Objective: To investigate the social determinants of cervical cancer screening and report the locations vulnerable to poor utilization of cervical cancer screening services.
   Study design: An ecological study with the data derived from fourth round of the National Family Health Survey conducted in India in the period 2015-2016.
   Methods: The study focused on the percentage of women who have never undergone cervical cancer screening across 639 districts in India. Moran's I statistic was used to investigate the overall clustering of location. The Getis-Ord Gi* statistic was used for the detection of significant local clusters. Spatial error, spatial lag, spatial Durbin and spatial Durbin error models were compared, and the model with best fit was reported. ArcGIS, GeoDa and R software were used for the analysis.
   Results: The existence of spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.61) necessitates the consideration of spatial component while studying the screening data. A significant clustering of districts with poor screening has been observed in the North-Central and NorthEastern regions of India. The geographic arrangement of the percentage of women who have undergone cervical cancer screening was associated with the percentage of women with poor wealth index (P < 0.001), not using a modern method of contraception (P < 0.001), residing in rural areas (P = 0.033) and never heard of sexually transmitted infection (P = 0.014). The range of percentage of women getting cervix screened for cancer was 0.5 -68.4%, presenting the heterogeneity among the population elements.
   Conclusion: A higher risk of poor cervical cancer screening is observed in the districts where most of the women have poor wealth index, reside in urban area, have never heard of sexually transmitted infection and do not use a modern method of contraception.

AB  - Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is a reversible condition in which there is transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction characterised most commonly by basal hyperkinesis and mid-apical LV ballooning and hypokinesia. It is said to be triggered by stress and mimics, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS) clinically. Diagnosis is usually suspected on echocardiography due to the characteristic contraction pattern in a patient with symptoms and signs of ACS but normal coronary arteries on catheter angiography. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), with its latest advancements, is the diagnostic modality of choice for diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients. The advances in CMR (including T1, T2, ECV mapping and threshold-based late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) measurements have revolutionised the role of CMR in tissue characterisation and prognostication in patients with TC. In this review, we highlight the current role of CMR in management of TC and enumerate the CMR findings in TC as well the current advances in the field of CMR, which could help in prognosticating these patients.

AB  - A 35-year-old male, a case of Takayasu arteritis on treatment with oral prednisolone and methotrexate, revealed novel ultrawide field fluorescein angiographic features in bilateral eyes. The typical features of delayed arm-retina circulation time, lobulated areas of nonperfusion in choroid, cattle trucking of red blood cells in veins, and delayed arteriovenous transit time were nicely captured. Additionally, we noted peripheral perivascular hyperfluorescence and disc hyperfluorescence. We believe these findings could possibly be used as markers of disease activity. Lack of marked capillary nonperfusion areas and marked perivascular leakage probably signifies modulation of disease activity by the immunosuppressants.

AB  - Variations in pulmonary venous anatomy (in the absence of any anomalous pulmonary venous connections) is not uncommon. Commonly occurring variations include presence of conjoined pulmonary veins (PV), supernumerary PVs and ostial PVs. Variant PV anatomy is often asymptomatic; however, it may assume importance in the pre-procedural planning prior to cardiothoracic surgeries and radiofrequency catheter-directed ablation for PV isolation. It is therefore important that the radiologist is aware of the conventional normal and variant PV anatomy in addition to obvious abnormalities like anomalous PV drainage or PV stenosis/ occlusion. Multidetector CT (MDCT) is often used as the first-line imaging modality for pre-procedural PV mapping as it provides high quality images with short acquisition times and availability of numerous post-processing tools.This pictorial review focusses on the MDCT-based PV imaging describing the reporting nomenclature, the conventional normal as well as non-anomalous variant PV anatomy along with their clinical significance.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to investigate the association between volume and attenuation of epicardial fat and presence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and high-risk plaque features (HRPF) on CT angiography (CTA) in patients with atypical chest pain and whether the association, if any, is independent of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and coronary artery calcium score (CACS).
   Methods: Patients referred for coronary CTA with atypical chest pain and clinical suspicion of CAD were included in the study. Quantification of CACS, epicardial fat volume (EFV) and epicardial fat attenuation (EFat) was performed on non-contrast images. CTA was evaluated for presence of obstructive CAD and presence of HRPF.
   Results: 255 patients (median age [interquartile range; IQR]: 51[41-60] years, 51.8% males) were included. On CTA, CAD, obstructive CAD (>= 50% stenosis) and CTAderived HRPFs was present in 133 (52.2%), 37 (14.5%) and 82 (32.2%) patients respectively. A significantly lower EFat was seen in patients with obstructive CAD than in those without (-86HU [IQR:-88 to -82 HU] vs -84 [IQR:-87 H11 to -82 HU]; p = 0.0486) and in patients with HRPF compared to those without (-86 HU [IQR:-88 to -83 H11] vs -83 HU [-86 H11 to -81.750 HU]; p < 0.0001). EFat showed significant association with obstructive CAD (unadjusted Odd's ratio (OR) [95%CI]: 0.90 [0.81-0.99]; = 0.0248) and HRPF (unadjusted OR [95%CI]: 0.83 [0.76-0.90];p < 0.0001) in univariate analysis, which remained significant in multivariate analysis. However, EFV did not show any significant association with neither obstructive CAD nor HRPF in multivariate analysis. Adding EFat to conventional coronary risk factors and CACS in the pre-test probability models increased the area-under curve (AUC) for prediction of both obstructive CAD (AUC[95%CI]: 0.76 [0.70-0.81] vs 0.71 [0.65-0.77)) and HRPF (AUC [95%CI]: 0.92 [0.88-0.95] vs 0.89 [0.85-0.93]), although not reaching statistical significance.
   Conclusion: EFat, but not EFV, is an independent predictor of obstructive CAD and HRPF. Addition of EFat to traditional cardiovascular risk factors and CACS improves estimation for pretest probability of obstructive CAD and HRPF.
   Advances in knowledge: EFat is an important attribute of epicardial fat as it reflects the "quality" of fat, taking into account the effects of brown-white fat transformation and fibrosis, as opposed to mere evaluation of "quantity" of fat by EFV. Our study shows that EFat is a better predictor of obstructive CAD and HRPF than EFV and can thus explain the inconsistent association of increased EFV alone with CAD.

AB  - Background
   Epilepsy is a central nervous system disorder (neurological disorder). Epileptic seizures are the result of excessive and abnormal cortical nerve cell electrical activity in the brain. Despite the development of more than 10 new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) since the early 2000s, approximately a third of people with epilepsy remain resistant to pharmacotherapy, often requiring treatment with a combination of AEDs. In this review, we summarised the current evidence regarding rufinamide, a novel anticonvulsant medication, which, as a triazole derivative, is structurally unrelated to any other currently used anticonvulsant medication when used as an add-on treatment for drug resistant epilepsy. In January 2009, rufinamide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of children four years of age and older with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. It is also approved as an add-on treatment for adults and adolescents with focal seizures.
   This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in 2018.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.
   Search methods
   We imposed no language restrictions. We contacted the manufacturers of rufinamide and authors in the field to identify any relevant unpublished studies.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, add-on trials of rufinamide, recruiting people (of any age or gender) with drug-resistant epilepsy.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted the relevant data. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency (primary outcome); seizure freedom; treatment withdrawal; and adverse effects (secondary outcomes). Primary analyses were intention-to-treat (ITT) and we presented summary risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (as). We evaluated dose response in regression models. We carried out a risk of bias assessment for each included study using the Cochrane Risk of bias' tool and assessed the overall certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.
   Main results The review included six trials, representing 1759 participants. Four trials (1563 participants) included people with uncontrolled focal seizures. Two trials (196 participants) included individuals with established Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Overall, the age of adults ranged from 18 to 80 years and the age of children ranged from 4 to 16 years. Baseline phases ranged from 28 to 56 days and double-blind phases from 84 to 96 days. Five of the six included trials described adequate methods of concealment of randomisation, and only three described adequate blinding. All analyses were by ITT. Overall, five studies were at low risk of bias and one had unclear risk of bias due to lack of reported information around study design. All trials were sponsored by the manufacturer of rufinamide and therefore were at high risk of funding bias. The overall RR for 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency was 1.79 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.22; 6 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1759 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), indicating that rufinamide (plus conventional AED) was significantly more effective than placebo (plus conventional AED) in reducing seizure frequency by at least 50% when added to conventionally used AEDs in people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Data from only one study (73 participants) reported seizure freedom: RR 1.32 (95% CI 0.36 to 4.86; 1 RCT, 73 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).
   The overall RR for treatment withdrawal (for any reason and due to AED) was 1.83 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.31; 6 RCTs, 1759 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), showing that rufinamide was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than placebo. Most adverse effects were significantly more likely to occur in the rufinamide-treated group. Adverse events significantly associated with rufinamide were headache, dizziness, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and diplopia. The RRs for these adverse effects were as follows: headache 1.36 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.69; 3 RCTs, 1228 participants; high-certainty evidence); dizziness 2.52 (95% CI 1.90 to 3.34; 3 RCTs, 1295 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); somnolence 1.94 (95% CE 1.44 to 2.61; 6 RCTs, 1759 participants; moderate certainty evidence); vomiting 2.95 (95% CI 1.80 to 4.82; 4 RCTs, 777 participants; low-certainty evidence); nausea 1.87 (95% CI 1.33 to 2.64; 3 RCTs, 1295 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); fatigue 1.46 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.97; 3 RCTs, 1295 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and diplopia 4.60 (95% CI 2.53 to 8.38; 3 RCTs, 1295 participants; low-certainty evidence). There was no important heterogeneity between studies for any outcomes. Overall, we assessed the evidence as moderate to low certainty due to wide CIs and potential risk of bias from some studies contributing to the analysis.
   Authors' conclusions
   For people with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, rufinamide when used as an add-on treatment was effective in reducing seizure frequency. However, the trials reviewed were of relatively short duration and provided no evidence for long-term use of rufinamide. In the short term, rufinamide as an add-on was associated with several adverse events. This review focused on the use of rufinamide in drug-resistant focal epilepsy, and the results cannot be generalised to add-on treatment for generalised epilepsies. Likewise, no inference can be made about the effects of rufinamide when used as monotherapy.

AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women across the world. Some of the patients who present in the early stage of disease are affected by metastasis to the axillary group of lymph nodes. The first among this group that is affected is called as sentinel lymph node, and its diagnosis is crucial for the staging of cancer thereby dictating the type of surgical therapy. Therefore, the sentinel lymph node status provides the most relevant information to the surgeon and patient prognosis. The expanded utilization of breast conservation surgery has declined the morbidity associated with mastectomy and axillary lymph node surgery. Recent interest is, therefore, centered on techniques that allow accurate assessment of the sentinel lymph node metastasis. A current procedure such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) that is used to assess axillary lymph node metastasis is neither specific nor sensitive, and besides, it is time-consuming.
   Objective: To compare the protein profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic lymph nodes to identify a biomarker that can flag lymph node metastasis.
   Materials and Methods: Women with early breast cancer were screened using mammography imaging and recruited to the study. Surgical resection was done to remove the breast tissue, and sentinel lymph node was identified using fluorescein and methylene blue tracer. Lymph node was sliced, and one set was sent for histopathology, which was considered the gold standard to assess the metastatic status of the lymph node. One set of slices was taken for proteomic experiments. Proteins were labelled with fluorescent cyanine tags and were subjected to difference gel electrophoresis experiment. Differentially expressed spots that had at least a twofold relative ratio and consistent pattern across three sets of biological replicate experiments were marked. Gel spots were trypsin digested and identified on mass spectrometry machine. Validation study was done by Western blot experiment on the same set of samples.
   Results: Thymidylate synthase has a twofold higher expression in the metastatic sentinel lymph nodes as compared to non-metastatic lymph nodes in early breast cancer patients.
   Conclusion: Differential in gel expression proteomics is an ideal platform for the identification of potential protein biomarker candidates that can differentiate metastatic from non-metastatic lymph nodes in early breast cancer. The identification of thymidylate synthase offers a scope to develop an on-table diagnostic kit to assess the status of sentinel lymph nodes during mastectomy procedure to guide surgical management of axillary lymph nodes in early breast cancer.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the clinical, demographic, and etiological profile of patients of acquired ocular motor palsy presenting in a tertiary eye care center.
   Design: A retrospective hospital record-based study was conducted in patients of paralytic strabismus presenting from April 2016 to December 2017.
   Methods: Data included demographic and clinical details, diagnosis, underlying etiology, imaging, laboratory reports, and the outcome.
   Results: Mean age of presentation of 345 patients included in the study was 38.2 +/- 19.5 years (range = 365 years). Pediatric patients (age: <= 16 years) constituted 9.5% of the entire cohort. Mean duration of complaints was 5.87 +/- 2 months. Of the 372 eyes of 345 cases, 42.7% were sixth nerve palsy, 34.7% were third nerve palsy, 17.7% were fourth nerve palsy, and 4.8% had multiple ocular motor nerve involvement. Third and sixth nerve palsies were mostly due to ischemic event (58.1% and 69.8% cases, respectively), whereas fourth nerve palsies were commonly caused by trauma (63.6%). Amongst traumatic cases, road traffic accident was the most common mode of trauma. Systemic risk factors were preexistent in 18.2% cases (n = 63); in the remaining (40.8%; n = 141), they were diagnosed after presentation. Complete or partial recovery was noted in 69.7% cases in third nerve palsy, 67.9% cases in sixth nerve palsy, and 45% cases in fourth nerve palsy.
   Conclusions: Acquired cranial nerve palsy has younger onset in Indian scenario. Ischemia is the most common etiology raising concerns about the health issues of young Indians. Sixth nerve is most commonly involved in all age groups. Low recovery rate in fourth nerve palsy can be attributed to traumatic etiology.

AB  - In this paper, we provide recommendations on the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among patients with confirmed or suspected coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to facilitate the decision making of healthcare professionals in low resource settings. The emergence of novel coronavirus disease, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has presented an unprecedented global challenge for the healthcare community. The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to get transmitted during the asymptomatic phase and its high infectivity have led to the rapid transmission of COVID-19 beyond geographic regions, leading to a pandemic. There is concern that COVID-19 is cardiotropic, and it interacts with the cardiovascular system on multiple levels. Individuals with established CVD are more susceptible to severe COVID-19. Through a consensus approach involving an international group this WHF statement summarizes the links between cardiovascular disease and COVID-19 and present some practical recommendations for the management of hypertension and diabetes, acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, rheumatic heart disease, Chagas disease, and myocardial injury for patients with COVID-19 in low-resource settings. This document is not a clinical guideline and it is not intended to replace national clinical guidelines or recommendations. Given the rapidly growing burden posed by COVID-19 illness and the associated severe prognostic implication of CVD involvement, further research is required to understand the potential mechanisms linking COVID-19 and CVD, clinical presentation, and outcomes of various cardiovascular manifestations in COVID-19 patients.

AB  - Bilateral lung parenchymal involvement is seen in infective as well as noninfective conditions, appearing as focal or diffuse lung disease. PET/CT with FDG helps in characterization (increased glucose utilization is seen by both inflammatory and neoplastic cells). In this article, we describe the spectrum of patterns of FDG uptake and associated CT changes involving bilateral lung parenchyma. Benign conditions described are aspiration pneumonia; pulmonary toxicity by bleomycin; infections, namely, sarcoidosis, miliary pulmonary tuberculosis, and pulmonary nocardiosis; and inflammatory conditions such as pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Neoplastic conditions described are bilateral pulmonary metastases and lymphangitic carcinomatosis.

KW  - BLUNT OCULAR TRAUMA
AB  - During blunt ocular trauma, the anteroposterior compressive forces confronted lead to consequent equatorial expansion of the globe. This may result in ciliary body trauma, typically manifesting as angle recession or cyclodialysis. The authors hypothesize that a likely asymmetric contraction between the longitudinal and circular ciliary fibers, and an intrinsic weak "oblique buffer zone" creates a plane of separation between the 2, resulting in angle recession. When stronger forces are met with, the equatorial expansion of the sclera may outperform the ability of the ciliary body to follow it, and the taut longitudinal ciliary fibers may subsequently disinsert from the scleral spur causing cyclodialysis. In addition to this, the routinely thought dismembering aqueous jets directed toward the angle may also accentuate ciliary body trauma. Therefore, the vivid distractive external forces along with the complex ciliary muscle anatomy and differential functionality may play a crucial role in causation of post-traumatic angle recession and cyclodialysis.

AB  - Aim: To assess the efficacy of first trimester glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c-FT) in diagnosing or predicting gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Asian Indian women.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study involved 2275 women who underwent both HbA1c-FT estimation and GDM screening with a one-step 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve statistics were applied to assess the discriminative ability of HbA1c-FT in GDM diagnosis. A multivariable logistic regression analysis after adjusting for plausible confounders was used to evaluate the independent effect of HbA1c-FT on GDM diagnosis.
   Results: The mean HbA1c-FT of GDM (n = 578) and non-GDM women (n = 1697) were 5.04 + 0.04% and 4.9 + 0.37%, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to women with a HbA1c-FT < 5.2%, the adjusted odds ratio to develop GDM of women with an HbA1c-FT range of 5.2-5.5% and those >5.6% to develop GDM were 1.627 (p < 0.004) and 2.6 (p < 0.001), respectively. The area under the ROC curve to detect GDM was 0.606 (95% CI: 0.519-0.633 p < 0.001), but the sensitivity and specificity of the HbA1c-FTwere not sufficient to diagnose, rule in or rule out GDM.
   Conclusions: HbA1c-FT is an independent GDM predictor in Asian Indian women but lacks sufficient sensitivity or specificity for use as a diagnostic test. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Paediatric sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of disorders constituting bone sarcoma and various soft tissue sarcomas. Almost one-third of these presents with metastasis at baseline and another one-third recur after initial curative treatment. There is a huge unmet need in this cohort in terms of curative options and/or prolongation of survival. In this review, we have discussed the current treatment options, challenges and future strategies of managing relapsed/refractory paediatric sarcomas. Upfront risk-adapted treatment with multidisciplinary management remains the main strategy to prevent future recurrence or relapse of the disease. In the case of limited local and/or systemic relapse or late relapse, initial multimodality management can be administered. In treatment-refractory cases or where cure is not feasible, the treatment options are limited to novel therapeutics, immunotherapeutic approach, targeted therapies, and metronomic therapies. A better understanding of disease biology, mechanism of treatment refractoriness, identifications of driver mutation, the discovery of novel targeted therapies, cellular vaccine and adapted therapies should be explored in relapsed/refractory cases. Close national and international collaboration for translation research is needed to fulfil the unmet need.

AB  - Composite tumor of larynx, a recently included entity in the current WHO classification, is often a difficult pathological diagnosis, especially in small biopsies. We report a case of laryngeal composite tumor, initially misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma, which later turned out to be composite in nature, with associated neuroendocrine (small cell carcinoma) component. This report emphasizes the need for obtaining deeper biopsies and their thorough pathological examination to improve the diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - Infectious disease outbreaks pose major threats to human health and security. Countries with robust capacities for preventing, detecting and responding to outbreaks can avert many of the social, political, economic and health system costs of such crises. The Global Health Security Index (GHS Index)-the first comprehensive assessment and benchmarking of health security and related capabilities across 195 countries-recently found that no country is sufficiently prepared for epidemics or pandemics. The GHS Index can help health security stakeholders identify areas of weakness, as well as opportunities to collaborate across sectors, collectively strengthen health systems and achieve shared public health goals. Some scholars have recently offered constructive critiques of the GHS Index's approach to scoring and ranking countries; its weighting of select indicators; its emphasis on transparency; its focus on biosecurity and biosafety capacities; and divergence between select country scores and corresponding COVID-19-associated caseloads, morbidity, and mortality. Here, we (1) describe the practical value of the GHS Index; (2) present potential use cases to help policymakers and practitioners maximise the utility of the tool; (3) discuss the importance of scoring and ranking; (4) describe the robust methodology underpinning country scores and ranks; (5) highlight the GHS Index's emphasis on transparency and (6) articulate caveats for users wishing to use GHS Index data in health security research, policymaking and practice.

AB  - Heterogeneity in epilepsy often interferes with its diagnosis as well as treatment. To examine this heterogeneity at transcriptomic level, we performed whole-genome mRNA expression profiling in whole blood samples from 34 patients with epilepsy (PWE) (idiopathic, n = 13; cryptogenic, n = 9; and symptomatic, n = 12) and 41 healthy controls (HC) using Illumina HT-12 Expression Beadchip v4 microarray. In silico analysis using R software identified 165 genes to be significantly differentially expressed in PWE compared to HC (fold change > 1.3, p < 0.05). Hierarchical clustering of resultant DEGs segregated idiopathic epilepsy from the rest of the epilepsy classes as well as HC. The class also displayed the most differential expression pattern with the highest number of DEGs among the three epilepsy classes. Gene ontology analysis revealed several biologically relevant inflammatory and other immune-related pathways. Our study provides insight into the relevance of altered blood gene expression patterns in understanding epilepsy and its etiologic classes.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the utility of magnetic resonance texture analysis (MRTA) in differentiating renal cell carcinoma (RCC) from lipid-poor angiomyolipoma (IpAML) and oncocytoma.
   Methods: After ethical approval, 42 patients with 54 masses (34 RCC, 14 IpAML and six oncocytomas) who underwent MRI on a 1.5T scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) between January 2011 and December 2012 were retrospectively included in the study. MRTA was performed on the TexRAD research software (Feedback Plc., Cambridge, UK) using freehand polygonal region of interest (ROI) drawn on the maximum cross-sectional area of the tumor to generate six first-order statistical parameters. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to look for any statically significant difference. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to select the parameter with the highest class separation capacity [area under the curve (AUC)] for each MRI sequence.
   Results: Several texture parameters on MRI showed high-class separation capacity (AUC > 0.8) in differentiating RCC from IpAML and oncocytoma. The best performing parameter in differentiating RCC from IpAML was mean of positive pixels (MPP) at SSF 2 (AUC: 0.891) on DWI b500, In differentiating RCC from oncocytoma, the best parameter was mean at SSF 0 (AUC: 0.935) on DWI b1000.
   Conclusions: MRTA could potentially serve as a useful non-invasive tool for differentiating RCC from IpAML and oncocytoma.
   Advances in knowledge: There is limited literature addressing the role of MRTA in differentiating RCC from IpAML and oncocytoma. Our study demonstrated several texture parameters which were useful in this regard.

AB  - Objectives: Patients with muscle-specific kinase (MuSK)-positive myasthenia are generally considered to have a grave prognosis. We present our experience of patients with myasthenia with different antibody status. This is followed by a short discourse on previous studies and the current view on MuSK-positive myasthenia, focusing on the associated prejudice. Materials and Methods: This study compares 23 patients with MuSK-positive myasthenia with 55 patients with acetylcholine receptor-positive myasthenia and 9 patients with double-seronegative myasthenia at a tertiary level center. Results: We did not find any significant difference in terms of clinical characteristics, treatment response to immunosuppressants, long-term prognosis, and quality of life. Conclusion: Seropositivity for antibodies should not be used in isolation to guide the management or predict the prognosis. Undue negative prognostication may affect the morale of patient. Clinical features and response to therapy in addition to antibody status must be considered before planning therapy.

AB  - In India, the number of people with disabilities is continuously growing over the past few decades. The figure is expected to increase due to population aging, with a resultant increase in chronic health conditions. The health of people with disabilities is a relatively neglected and ignored area. Further, the disabled face poor access to healthcare and frequently encounter discrimination or stigmatization. These situations make them more vulnerable to many comorbidities in their health, making severe compromises in their quality of life. Therefore, people with disabilities need special healthcare than people without disabilities. There is a need for sensitization of all health-care providers to ensure quality, affordable, and accessible health-care services for people with disabilities. To address the health-care needs of people with disabilities to the maximum, Ministry of Health, Government of India should incorporate appropriate guidelines in various national health programs and work together with a relevant ministry.

AB  - Introduction The development of type 2 diabetes mellitus disproportionately affects South Asian women with prior gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The Lifestyle InterVention IN Gestational diabetes (LIVING) Study is a randomised controlled trial of a low-intensity lifestyle modification programme tailored to women with previous GDM, in India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, aimed at preventing diabetes/pre-diabetes. The aim of this process evaluation is to understand what worked, and why, during the LIVING intervention implementation, and to provide additional data that will assist in the interpretation of the LIVING Study results. The findings will also inform future scale-up efforts if the intervention is found to be effective.
   Methods and analysis The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) methodological approach informed the evaluation framework. Michie's Behaviour Change Theory and Normalisation Process Theory were used to guide the design of our qualitative evaluation tools within the overall RE-AIM evaluation framework. Mixed methods including qualitative interviews, focus groups and quantitative analyses will be used to evaluate the intervention from the perspectives of the women receiving the intervention, facilitators, site investigators and project management staff. The evaluation will use evaluation datasets, administratively collected process data accessed during monitoring visits, check lists and logs, quantitative participant evaluation surveys, semistructured interviews and focus group discussions. Interview participants will be recruited using maximum variation purposive sampling. We will undertake thematic analysis of all qualitative data, conducted contemporaneously with data collection until thematic saturation has been achieved. To triangulate data, the analysis team will engage in constant iterative comparison among data from various stakeholders.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from the respective human research ethics committees of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India; University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; and site-specific approval at each local site in the three countries: India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. This includes approvals from the Institutional Ethics Committee at King Edwards Memorial Hospital, Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, Centre for Disease Control New Delhi, Goa Medical College, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Christian Medical College Vellore, Fernandez Hospital Foundation, Castle Street Hospital for Women, University of Kelaniya, Topiwala National Medical College and BYL Nair Charitable Hospital, Birdem General Hospital and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research. Findings will be documented in academic publications, presentations at scientific meetings and stakeholder workshops.

AB  - Cardiac outpouchings pose a diagnostic challenge when encountered in practice, as the signs, symptoms, and initial investigations, such as radiographs and electrocardiogram, are nonspecific. They may remain asymptomatic and be incidentally detected. However, a few may present with progressive shortness of breath, thromboembolic complications, arrhythmias, pressure effects, rupture, or even death. Imaging is of paramount importance in establishing an accurate diagnosis, delineating morphology and extent of the lesion along with its hemodynamic significance, planning management, and in the follow-up.

AB  - Biodegradable porous iron having topologically ordered porosity and tailorable properties as per the required application has been the major requirement in the field of biodegradable biomaterials. Hence, in the present study, iron scaffolds with the topologically ordered porous structure were developed and for the first time, the effect of the variation in the topology on the in vitro degradation behaviour, cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility were investigated. Iron scaffold samples were fabricated using a novel process based on the combination of 3D printing and pressureless microwave sintering. To investigate the effect of topology, two different types of topological structures namely Truncated Octahedron (TO) (with variable strut size) and Cubic (C) were used. From the morphological characterization, it was found that fabricated iron scaffold possessed interconnected porosity varying from 50.70%-80.97% which included the random microporosities in the strut and designed macroporosity. Furthermore, it was inferred that the topology of the iron scaffold significantly affected its degradation properties and cytocompatibility. Increase in the weight loss, corrosion rate and reduction in cell viability with the reduction in porosity were obtained. The maximum corrosion rate and weight loss achieved was 1.64 mmpy and 6.4% respectively. Direct cytotoxicity test results revealed cytotoxicity, while prepared iron scaffold samples exhibited excellent hemocompatibility and anti-platelet adhesion property. A comparative study with relevant literature was performed and it was established that the developed iron scaffold exhibited favorable degradation and biological properties which could be tailored to suit appropriate bone tissue engineering applications.

AB  - Sinuses of Valsalva aneurysms are rare cardiac anomalies with a varied clinical spectrum. The presentation may range from silent asymptomatic cases detected incidentally to catastrophic rupture. They are associated with potentially fatal complications; however, the prognosis after treatment is excellent, which mandates prompt and accurate diagnosis. Imaging is of paramount importance in diagnosis, treatment planning, and postsurgical follow-up. Echocardiography remains the initial investigation of choice; however, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography are being increasingly utilized as complementary imaging techniques. The latest generation multidetector computed tomography with its improved spatial and temporal resolution provides high-quality reconstructed images with reduced radiation burden. Moreover, it allows the simultaneous assessment of coronary arteries, thereby helping in mapping the ideal treatment option. Surgical repair remains the treatment of choice with percutaneous closure in selected patients.

AB  - Background: Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and REM sleep without atonia (RWA) have assumed much clinical importance with long-term data showing progression into neurodegenerative conditions among older adults. However, much less is known about RBD and RWA in younger populations. This study aims at comparing clinical and polysomnographic (PSG) characteristics of young patients presenting with RBD, young patients with other neurological conditions, and normal age-matched subjects. Methods: A retrospective chart review was carried out for consecutive young patients (<25 years) presenting with clinical features of RBD; and data were compared to data from patients with epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism, as well as normal subjects who underwent PSG during a 2-year-period. Results: Twelve patients fulfilling RBD diagnostic criteria, 22 autism patients, 10 with ADHD, 30 with epilepsy, and 14 normal subjects were included. Eight patients with autism (30%), three with ADHD (30%), one with epilepsy (3.3%), and six patients who had presented with RBD like symptoms (50%) had abnormal movements and behaviors during REM sleep. Excessive transient muscle activity and/or sustained muscle activity during REM epochs was found in all patients who had presented with RBD, in 16/22 (72%) autistic patients, 6/10 (60%) ADHD patients compared to only 6/30 (20%) patients with epilepsy and in none of the normal subjects. Conclusion: We observed that a large percentage of young patients with autism and ADHD and some with epilepsy demonstrate loss of REM-associated atonia and some RBD-like behaviors on polysomnography similar to young patients presenting with RBD.

AB  - Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a promising treatment strategy for negative symptoms. However, the evidence for its efficacy is mixed, with contradictory results between studies due to lack of consensus about the optimal stimulation parameters. Aim: The present study was planned to assess the safety and efficacy of 20-Hz rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Lt-DLPFC) with more robust stimulation parameters for adjunctive treatment of negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients with negative symptoms of schizophrenia (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] negative subscore =15) were randomized to receive a 4-week treatment with either real-rTMS (n = 15) or sham-rTMS (n = 15). The study outcomes were assessed at baseline, after 5th and 20th rTMS sessions with PANSS, Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia, Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of illness scale, and rTMS side-effect checklist. Results: There was significantly greater reduction in negative symptoms assessed by SANS score in the real rTMS group, compared with the sham rTMS group. There was no significant difference in the rate of side-effects reported between the two groups. The rTMS treatment was well-tolerated by all the patients, except one seizure episode reported in the active group. Conclusion: The high-frequency rTMS protocol was safe and well-tolerated, provided patients prone to developing seizure were excluded by baseline electroencephalography prior to starting of the treatment. The 20-Hz rTMS over Lt-DLPFC with more robust stimulation parameters (100% motor threshold and 40,000 pulses) might be an effective augmentation strategy for the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia.

AB  - Abiotic stress tolerance is a complex trait regulated by multiple genes and gene networks in plants. A range of abiotic stresses are known to limit rice productivity. Meta-transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful approach to decipher stress-associated molecular network in model crops. However, retaining specificity of gene expression in tolerant and susceptible genotypes during meta-transcriptome analysis is important for understanding genotype-dependent stress tolerance mechanisms. Addressing this aspect, we describe here "abiotic stress tolerant" (ASTR) genes and networks specifically and differentially expressing in tolerant rice genotypes in response to different abiotic stress conditions. We identified 6,956 ASTR genes, key hub regulatory genes, transcription factors, and functional modules having significant association with abiotic stress-related ontologies and cis-motifs. Out of the 6956 ASTR genes, 73 were co-located within the boundary of previously identified abiotic stress trait-related quantitative trait loci. Functional annotation of 14 uncharacterized ASTR genes is proposed using multiple computational methods. Around 65% of the top ASTR genes were found to be differentially expressed in at least one of the tolerant genotypes under different stress conditions (cold, salt, drought, or heat) from publicly available RNAseq data comparison. The candidate ASTR genes specifically associated with tolerance could be utilized for engineering rice and possibly other crops for broad-spectrum tolerance to abiotic stresses.

AB  - Clear cell sarcoma-like tumor of the gastrointestinal tract (CCSGT) is a rare, aggressive tumor with many histological mimickers. Herein, we have documented our experience of three cases of CCSGT and reviewed the literature. The index cases were identified in male patients in their twenties, one in jejunum and two in the distal colon. Histomorphological examination revealed the characteristic heterogeneous histomorphology with patchy immunohistochemical positivity with S100 protein and negative melanocytic markers. The fluorescence in-situ hybridization test showed translocation of the EWSR1 (22q12) gene in >80% tumor cells. While one of our patients died after 2 years with lung metastasis, the other two patients are still alive on 1.5 years and 3 months follow up, respectively. CCSGT is a rare malignant tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Although characteristic morphology, use of a judicial panel of immunohistochemical stains, and translocation study for EWSR1 gene can establish the diagnosis, experience in adjuvant therapy is still limited.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with pressure support (NIV-PSV) to noninvasive neurally-adjusted ventilatory assist (NIV-NAVA) during COPD exacerbation. METHODS: In this study, 40 subjects with COPD and acute hypercapnic respiratory failure were randomized to receive either NIV-NAVA (n = 20) or NIV-PSV (n = 20) via a critical care ventilator. Subjects' vital parameters, arterial blood gas values, patient-ventilator asynchrony events, and asynchrony index were noted at specific time intervals in both groups. The duration of NIV, rate of NIV failure, and length hospital stay were also recorded for these 2 modes of NIV. RESULTS: NIV-NAVA significantly reduced the total number (median [interquartile range]) of asynchrony events compared to NIV-PSV: 22 (15-32.5) versus 65 (50.75-104.25), respectively, P = .002. Severe asynchrony defined as asynchrony index > 10% was also significantly lower in NIV-NAVA than in NIV-PSV (P < .001). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding improvement in gas exchange and vital parameters. Rate of failure of NIV (P = .73), duration of the requirement of ventilatory support (P = .40), and hospital length of stay (P = .46) were also comparable between the 2 modes of ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to NIV-PSV, NIV-NAVA was associated with better patient-ventilator synchrony and a reduction in the number of asynchrony events in subjects with an exacerbation of COPD, with similar effects on improvement in gas exchange, duration of NIV, hospital lenght of stay, and rate of NIV failure.

AB  - Background Many countries have shown marked declines in diarrhoea! disease mortality among children younger than 5 years. With this analysis, we provide updated results on diarrhoeal disease mortality among children younger than 5 years from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) and use the study's comparative risk assessment to quantify trends and effects of risk factors, interventions, and broader sociodemographic development on mortality changes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2017.
   Methods This analysis for GBD 2017 had three main components. Diarrhoea mortality was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive, Bayesian, ensemble modelling tool; and the attribution of risk factors and interventions for diarrhoea were modelled in a counterfactual framework that combines modelled population-level prevalence of the exposure to each risk or intervention with the relative risk of diarrhoea given exposure to that factor. We assessed the relative and absolute change in diarrhoea mortality rate between 1990 and 2017, and used the change in risk factor exposure and sociodemographic status to explain differences in the trends of diarrhoea mortality among children younger than 5 years.
   Findings Diarrhoea was responsible for an estimated 533 768 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 477 162-593 145) among children younger than 5 years globally in 2017, a rate of 78.4 deaths (70.1-87.1) per 100 000 children. The diarrhoea mortality rate ranged between countries by over 685 deaths per 100 000 children. Diarrhoea mortality per 100 000 globally decreased by 69.6% (63.1-74.6) between 1990 and 2017. Among the risk factors considered in this study, those responsible for the largest declines in the diarrhoea mortality rate were reduction in exposure to unsafe sanitation (13.3% decrease, 11.2-15.5), childhood wasting (9.9% decrease, 9.6-10.2), and low use of oral rehydration solution (6.9% decrease, 4-8-8-4).
   Interpretation Diarrhoea mortality has declined substantially since 1990, although there are variations by country. Improvements in sociodemographic indicators might explain some of these trends, but changes in exposure to risk factors-particularly unsafe sanitation, childhood growth failure, and low use of oral rehydration solution-appear to be related to the relative and absolute rates of decline in diarrhoea mortality. Although the most effective interventions might vary by country or region, identifying and scaling up the interventions aimed at preventing and protecting against diarrhoea that have already reduced diarrhoea mortality could further avert many thousands of deaths due to this illness.

AB  - Background Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases. To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates.
   Methods We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years.
   Findings In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286-873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65.4% decrease, 61.5-68.5) and in mortality rate (from 362.7 deaths [3304-392.0] per 100 000 children to 118.9 deaths [109.8-128.3] per 100 000 children; 67.2% decrease, 63.5-70.1). LRI incidence dedined globally (32.4% decrease, 27.2-37.5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11.4% decrease, 0.0-24.5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6.3% decrease, 6.1-6.3), and reductions in household air pollution (8.4%, 6 8-9.2).
   Interpretation Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

AB  - Over the last decade, research has intensified worldwide on the use of low-temperature plasmas in medicine and healthcare. Researchers have discovered many methods of applying plasmas to living tissues to deactivate pathogens; to end the flow of blood without damaging healthy tissue; to sanitize wounds and accelerate its healing; and to selectively kill malignant cancer cells. This review paper presents the latest development of advanced and plasma-based technologies used for applications in neurology in particular. Institute for Plasma Research (IPR), an aided institute of the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), has also developed various technologies in some of these areas. One of these is an Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ). This device is being studied to treat skin diseases, for coagulation of blood at faster rates and its interaction with oral, lung, and brain cancer cells. In certain cases, in-vitro studies have yielded encouraging results and limited in-vivo studies have been initiated. Plasma activated water has been produced in the laboratory for microbial disinfection, with potential applications in the health sector. Recently, plasmonic nanoparticle arrays which allow detection of very low concentrations of chemicals is studied in detail to allow early-stage detection of diseases. IPR has also been developing AI-based software called DeepCXR and AIBacilli for automated, high-speed screening and detection of footprints of tuberculosis (TB) in Chest X-ray images and for recognizing single/multiple TB bacilli in sputum smear test images, respectively. Deep Learning systems are increasingly being used around the world for analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for emotion recognition, mental workload, and seizure detection.

AB  - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an autosomal recessive endocrine disorder which can manifest after birth with ambiguous genitalia and salt-wasting crisis. However, genital ambiguity is not seen in male babies and may be mild in female babies, leading to a missed diagnosis of classical CAH at birth. In this review, we provide a standard operating protocol for routine newborn screening for CAH in Indian settings. A standardization of first tier screening tests with a single consistent set of cut-off values stratified by gestational age is also suggested. The protocol also recommends a two-tier protocol of initial immunoassay/time resolved fluoroimmunoassay followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry for confirmation of screen positive babies, wherever feasible. Routine molecular and genetic testing is not essential for establishing the diagnosis in all screen positive babies, but has significant utility in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for future pregnancy.

AB  - Background: The activation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway has been shown to protect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by reducing oxidative stress. Berberine (Ber), an isoquinoline alkaloid, has demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities in various experimental models.
   Aim: To check the effect of Ber on cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and to explore the involved mechanism.
   Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were divided into 6 groups: Normal, cisplatin-control, treatment groups and per se group. Normal saline and Ber (20, 40 and 80 mg/kg; p.o.) was administered to rats for 10 days. A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (8 mg/kg) was injected on 7th day to induced nephrotoxicity. On 10th day, rats were sacrificed, the kidney was removed and stored for the estimation of various parameters.
   Results: As compared to cisplatin-control group, Ber pretreatment improved renal function system and preserved renal architecture. It also diminished oxidative stress by upregulating the expression of Nrf2/HO-1 proteins. In addition, Ber attenuated the cisplatin mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Furthermore, it also reduced the phosphorylation of p38/JNK and PARP/Beclin-1 expression in the kidney.
   Conclusion: Ber attenuated renal injury by activating Nrf2/HO-1 and inhibiting JNIC/p38MAPKs/PARP/Beclin-1 expression which prevented oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in renal tissue.

AB  - Objective: Rapid advancements in medicine and changing standards in medical education require new, efficient educational strategies. We investigated whether an online intervention could increase residents' knowledge and improve knowledge retention in mechanical ventilation when compared with a clinical rotation and whether the timing of intervention had an impact on overall knowledge gains. Design: A prospective, interventional crossover study conducted from October 2015 to December 2017. Setting: Multicenter study conducted in 33 PICUs across eight countries. Subjects: Pediatric categorical residents rotating through the PICU for the first time. We allocated 483 residents into two arms based on rotation date to use an online intervention either before or after the clinical rotation. Interventions: Residents completed an online virtual mechanical ventilation simulator either before or after a 1-month clinical rotation with a 2-month period between interventions. Measurements and Main Results: Performance on case-based, multiple-choice question tests before and after each intervention was used to quantify knowledge gains and knowledge retention. Initial knowledge gains in residents who completed the online intervention (average knowledge gain, 6.9%; sd, 18.2) were noninferior compared with those who completed 1 month of a clinical rotation (average knowledge gain, 6.1%; sd, 18.9; difference, 0.8%; 95% CI, -5.05 to 6.47; p = 0.81). Knowledge retention was greater following completion of the online intervention when compared with the clinical rotation when controlling for time (difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 0.7-14.5; p = 0.03). When the online intervention was sequenced before (average knowledge gain, 14.6%; sd, 15.4) rather than after (average knowledge gain, 7.0%; sd, 19.1) the clinical rotation, residents had superior overall knowledge acquisition (difference, 7.6%; 95% CI, 2.01-12.97;p = 0.008). Conclusions: Incorporating an interactive online educational intervention prior to a clinical rotation may offer a strategy to prime learners for the upcoming rotation, augmenting clinical learning in graduate medical education.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
   Methods: In this prospective, single-arm, single-institutional study, 90 mCRPC patients with progressive disease (PD) on second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients underwent Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy at 8- to 12-weekly intervals. The primary end point was to assess the overall survival. The secondary and cosecondary end points included biochemical response assessment as per the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria, progression-free survival, radiological andmolecular response criteria, clinical response, safety profile, and disease control rates. All the outcome parameters were evaluated in 90 patients except for the radiographic and molecular response, which was evaluated in 69 patients.
   Results: The median age of patients was 66.5 years (range, 30-88 years). The median activity administered per cycle was 3.7 to 8 GBq ranging from 1 to 7 cycles, and patients were followed up over a median duration of 28 months. At 2- to 3-month interval after the first therapy and the end of the assessment, greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen was observed in 32.2% and 45.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis did not reveal any variables such as prior therapies, laboratory parameters, concomitant hormonal therapy, and SUV patient parameters associated with prostate-specific antigen decline. Radiographic response by diagnostic CT revealed partial remission in 23% (16/69), stable disease in 54% (37/69), and PD in 23% (16/69) of patients. Molecular tumor response by PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumor 1 criteria revealed 19 (27.5%) of 69 patients with partial remission, 30 (43.5%) of 69 with stable disease, and 20 (29%) of 69 with PD. The disease control rates according to the radiographic and molecular response-were 77% and 71%, respectively. The median overall survival and median progression-free survivals were 14 and 11.8 months, respectively. Toxicities related to radioligand therapywere lowand transientwith no serious adverse effects.
   Conclusions: Lu-177-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy is a safe and effective approach to the treatment of mCRPC patients.

AB  - Rationale: Despite the success of several standards of care treatment options in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), a significant number of patients attain therapeutic resistance and eventually develop disease progression. Managing these patients are currently challenging. Hence, there is an unmet need for further efficient therapeutic options that induce anti-tumor activity and improve survival. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of Ac-225-PSMA-617 targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in mCRPC patients in real-world conditions.
   Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited patients with mCRPC who either were refractory to Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) or did not receive previous Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. Patients were treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT (100 KBq/Kg body weight) at 8-weekly intervals. The primary endpoint included the assessment of biochemical response by measuring the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate as per the prostate cancer working group criteria (PCWG3). Secondary endpoints comprised the estimation of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), molecular tumor response assessment (PERCIST 1 criteria), disease control rate (DCR), toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response evaluation.
   Results: A total of 28 patients were recruited for this cohort study among whom 15 (54%) received prior Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT and the remaining 13 (46%) patients were Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT naive. The mean age was 69.7 years (range: 46-87 years). All patients, except one, had extensive skeletal metastases on baseline Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan; one patient had lymph node dominant disease and advanced primary prostatic tumor. The mean activity administered was 26.5 +/- 12 MBq (range: 9.25 - 62.9 MBq) [715.5 +/- 327 mu Ci, range: 250 - 1700 mu Ci] with a median of 3 cycles (range: 1 - 7 cycles). At 8th week of post first cycle of Ac-225-PSMA-617 therapy (initial follow-up) and the end of the follow-up, >50% decline in PSA was observed in 25% and 39%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 12 months (95% CI: 9 - 13 months) and 17 months (95% CI: 16 months - upper limit not reached), respectively. Molecular tumor response by PERCIST 1 criteria could be conducted in 22/28 (78.6%) patients, which revealed complete response in 2/22 (9%), partial response in 10/22 (45.4%) patients, 2/22 (9%) with stable disease, and 8/22 (36%) with progressive diseases. The disease control rate, according to the biochemical and molecular tumor response criteria, was 82% and 63.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed PSA progression as adverse prognostic indicator of OS, and any PSA decline as a good prognostic indicator of PFS. There was no Grade III/IV toxicity noted in this series. The most common side-effect was transient fatigue (50%) followed by grade I/II xerostomia (29%).
   Conclusion: Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT showed promising disease control rate, even when all other therapeutic options were exhausted, with low treatment-related toxicities.

AB  - Background Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common malignant pediatric liver tumor, and cytology material is often the only tissue available for evaluation before definitive therapy. Subcategorization of HB based on cytomorphological features thus carries an important role in its prognostication. Spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4), a marker of embryonic stem cells that is also found in the fetal liver, is reactivated in certain liver tumors. Limited studies have evaluated its role in HB. This study was aimed at evaluating the cytomorphological features of HB and assessing the utility of SALL4 immunocytochemistry (ICC) in its subtyping and prognostication. Methods Pretherapy fine-needle aspiration smears from patients diagnosed with HB over a period of 9 years were retrieved. Aspirates were subclassified on the basis of the cytomorphology and were correlated with the histology wherever it was available. ICC for SALL4 was performed in 33 cases, and nuclear staining was considered positive. Results A total of 53 HB cases were included with 30 available postchemotherapy resection specimens. All the patients were diagnosed as epithelial HB on cytology, and the cases were subclassified as pure fetal (9 of 53), pure embryonal (2 of 53), or combined epithelial HB (42 of 53). There was good concordance between cytology and histology for subtyping. SALL4 immunostaining displayed strong and diffuse nuclear positivity in the embryonal component while focal and weak to negative staining in fetal cells. Conclusions Fine-needle aspiration cytology serves as a rapid and effective tool for a correct diagnosis of HB before the implementation of chemotherapy, and SALL4 may serve as a useful diagnostic and prognostic marker.

AB  - Analyses of the proportions of individuals who have completed key levels of schooling across all low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 reveal inequalities across countries as well as within populations.
   Educational attainment is an important social determinant of maternal, newborn, and child health(1-3). As a tool for promoting gender equity, it has gained increasing traction in popular media, international aid strategies, and global agenda-setting(4-6). The global health agenda is increasingly focused on evidence of precision public health, which illustrates the subnational distribution of disease and illness(7,8); however, an agenda focused on future equity must integrate comparable evidence on the distribution of social determinants of health(9-11). Here we expand on the available precision SDG evidence by estimating the subnational distribution of educational attainment, including the proportions of individuals who have completed key levels of schooling, across all low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017. Previous analyses have focused on geographical disparities in average attainment across Africa or for specific countries, but-to our knowledge-no analysis has examined the subnational proportions of individuals who completed specific levels of education across all low- and middle-income countries(12-14). By geolocating subnational data for more than 184 million person-years across 528 data sources, we precisely identify inequalities across geography as well as within populations.

AB  - Cryopyrin-associated periodic fever syndrome (CAPS) represents an increasingly recognized disease group entity, with varied presentations. CAPS includes 3 clinical entities, namely, familial cold-induced autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS; MIM #120100), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS; MIM #191900) and chronic inflammatory neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA; MIM #607115); which share several overlapping clinical features. These patients often present with early-onset episodes of fever and rash, and variable systemic signs and symptoms, making it a great mimicker of other systemic autoimmune diseases. The episodes are transient and related to exposure to cold temperature and worsen in the winter season. We hereby present a case presenting with recurrent seasonal fever and rash, diagnosed as FCAS/ MWS overlap based on clinical signs and symptoms and positive testing for NLRP3 gene mutation. We also discuss the clinical presentation and complications of CAPS, chiefly FCAS and MWS, along with the previously described pediatric cases of CAPS. We tried to review the complexities of management of such patients, including the genetic diagnosis and the role of biological therapy. Based on the review of the literature, given the evident broad spectrum of symptoms and signs, use of next-generation sequencing can help in prompt diagnosis and early initiation of biological agents, which may play a great role in reducing the complications that these patients may experience in the long run.

AB  - Turner syndrome (TS) is a common multiple congenital anomaly syndrome resulting from complete or partial absence of the second X chromosome. In this study, we explore the phenotype of TS in diverse populations using clinical examination and facial analysis technology. Clinical data from 78 individuals and images from 108 individuals with TS from 19 different countries were analyzed. Individuals were grouped into categories of African descent (African), Asian, Latin American, Caucasian (European descent), and Middle Eastern. The most common phenotype features across all population groups were short stature (86%), cubitus valgus (76%), and low posterior hairline 70%. Two facial analysis technology experiments were conducted: TS versus general population and TS versus Noonan syndrome. Across all ethnicities, facial analysis was accurate in diagnosing TS from frontal facial images as measured by the area under the curve (AUC). An AUC of 0.903 (p < .001) was found for TS versus general population controls and 0.925 (p < .001) for TS versus individuals with Noonan syndrome. In summary, we present consistent clinical findings from global populations with TS and additionally demonstrate that facial analysis technology can accurately distinguish TS from the general population and Noonan syndrome.

AB  - There are limited reports on the etiology of multiple enteric viruses causing acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in North India. In the present study we have determined the prevalence of three enteric viruses, namely rotavirus, astrovirus (AstV) and adenovirus (AdV) in a total of 312 diarrheic children (<5 years) hospitalized at Lala Lajpat Rai Memorial Medical College, Meerut, Uttar Pradesh from August 2014 to July 2016; and results were compared with data from Delhi. The fecal samples were individually screened for group A rotavirus (RVA), AdV, and AstV using enzyme immunoassay kits. At least one viral agent was detected in 29.2% of 312 fecal specimens. RNA of rotavirus antigen-positive samples was extracted by TRIzol method. Rotavirus G/P genotyping was performed using seminested multiplex reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RVA was the most predominant virus (18.3%) followed by AstV (12.5%), and AdV (9.9%). Coinfections were detected in 10.6% cases and the most common coinfection in diarrheic children was RVA combined with AstV (36.4%). Overall, the enteric viruses were found most prevalent in the 6 to 11 months age group (P = .01). Increased duration of vomiting (>= 3 days) was significantly (P = .04) associated with AdV infection (61.3%) as compared with AstV (30.76%) and rotavirus (26.31%). G1P[8] was detected throughout as the most prevalent rotavirus strain (10.5%). Unusual RV strains like G2P[6] and G2P[8] were also detected. Of note G3, G4, and G12 rotavirus were detected for the first time in Meerut. This is the first report that demonstrated the important contribution of multiple enteric viruses causing AGE in young children in this part of Uttar Pradesh (Meerut).

AB  - Background Extraocular sebaceous carcinoma (EOSC) is an aggressive malignancy of the sebaceous gland. Surgery is considered the cornerstone of treatment, but there is lack of clarity about extent and adjuvant treatment. Methods We conducted a systematic review and analysis of individual patient data of all published cases of EOSC to look into demography, pattern of care, importance of type of surgery, and other adjuvant treatment and survival outcome. A search of PubMed and Google Scholar was done with the key words sebaceous carcinoma, extraocular sebaceous carcinoma, and Muir-Torre syndrome till December 2017. The data were compiled in an Excel chart and analyzed using SPSS IBM software. Results Data of 206 patients were retrieved. Median age at presentation was 65 years (range: 11-96 years). Surgery was performed in all except 13 patients. Of these 13, eight were deemed inoperable for extensive disease, and five had metastatic disease. Median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 84 months (95% CI: 10-158 months) and 92 months (95% CI: 59-126 months). Univariate analysis revealed significantly poor survival for patients with a metastatic disease, regional nodal metastasis, and those with Mohs micrographic or incomplete surgery. Conclusion EOSC is a disease of elderly patients with good prognosis. Complete surgery with regional lymph node dissection is standard treatment. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy is debatable but can be considered in patients with incomplete surgery or high-risk factors.

AB  - Rationale Recurrent stroke, cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality are important causes of poor outcome in patients with index stroke. Despite the availability of best medical management recurrent stroke occur in up to 15-20% of patients with stroke in India. Education for stroke prevention could be a strategy to prevent recurrent strokes. Hypothesis We hypothesize that a structured semi-interactive stroke prevention package can reduce the risk of recurrent strokes, acute coronary artery syndrome, and death in patients with sub-acute stroke at the end of one year. Design Secondary Prevention by Structured Semi-Interactive Stroke Prevention Package in INDIA (SPRINT INDIA) is a multi-center stroke trial involving 25 centers under the Indian Stroke Clinical Trial Network. Patients with first ever sub-acute stroke within two days to three months of onset, age 18-85 years, mRS <5, showing recent stroke in imaging are included. Participants or caregivers able to read and complete tasks suggested in a stroke prevention workbook and have a cellular device for receiving short message service and watching videos. A total of 5830 stroke patients speaking 11 different languages are being randomized to intervention or control arm. Patients in the intervention arm are receiving a stroke prevention workbook, regular educational short messages, and videos. All patients in the control arm are receiving standard of care management. Structured semi-interactive stroke prevention package may reduce the risk of recurrent strokes, acute coronary artery syndrome, and death in patients with sub-acute stroke.

AB  - The guidelines for surfactant therapy are largely based on studies done in developed coun1tries wherein the facility infrastructure, patient profile, and clinical practices are different from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Though SRT is widely practiced in developing countries, there exists variability in clinical practice. Our objective was to identify the factors which would predict the need of surfactant administration and develop a "clinical respiratory distress (RD) score" for surfactant administration in preterm neonates with respiratory distress. A prospective observational study was conducted in 153 preterm infants (26(0/7) to 34(6/7) weeks gestation) with respiratory distress who were managed with CPAP and/or surfactant where indicated. Gestation < 32 weeks, no antenatal corticosteroid (ANS), hypothermia at admission, Apgar score < 3 at 1 minute, and Silverman score > 2 at 2 hours were found to be the significant factors in predicting surfactant requirement in multivariate regression analysis. A seven point scale was developed and categorized into two categories as < 4 and >= 4. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 67%, 87%, 86%, and 68%, respectively, with a cutoff score >= 4. The positive likelihood ratio was 5.07 (95% CI 2.71-9.48), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.38 (95% CI 0.28-0.52). The observed rate of surfactant administration was found to be around 32% when the composite score was below four, and the rate increased to almost 86% when the composite score was >= 4. The predictive accuracy of the model was subsequently evaluated in a cohort of 56 preterm infants with respiratory distress.. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value during the validation phase were 97%, 73%, 85%, and 94%, respectively. With a composite score less than 4, the observed rate of surfactant administration was 6% (95% CI 1%-28%) as against the model predicted rate of 24%, while with composite score >= 4, the observed rate was 85% (95% CI 69%-94%) as against the model predicted rate of 90%. Conclusion: "Clinical RD score" is a simple score, which can be utilized for decision-making for early surfactant administration for preterm infants (26(0/7) to 34(6/7) weeks gestation) with respiratory distress. Trial Registration: What is Known:center dot Both CPAP and surfactant therapy are effective in management of preterm infants with RDS.center dot The efficacy of surfactant replacement therapy is better when it is administered early in the course of disease.What is New:center dot Many of the known risk factors for RDS do not predict surfactant requirement.center dot "Composite RD score" comprising of five independent predictors of surfactant requirement with a numeric cutoff may help decide which preterm neonates with respiratory distress need early surfactant administration in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that intrinsically disordered proteins often mediate host-pathogen interactions and modulate host functions for pathogen survival and virulence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) has evolved largely through reductive evolution, with a few exceptions such as the glycine-alanine-rich PE-PPE/PGRS protein family, which has been expanding in pathogenic mycobacteria. Here, our analyses of the M.tb proteome and secretome revealed that the PE-PGRS subfamily is enriched for disordered regions and disordered binding sites, pointing to their importance in host-pathogen interactions. As a case study, the secondary structure of PE35-PPE68 and PE32-PPE65 of the pathogenesis-related RD1 and RD8 regions was analyzed through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. These disordered proteins displayed a considerable structural shift from disordered to ordered while engaged in the formation of complexes. While these proteins are immunogenic individually and enhance the pro-pathogen response, their corresponding complexes enhanced the responses manifold as displayed here by PE35 and PPE68. It is likely that M.tb exploits such disorder-order structural dynamics as a strategy to mount a pro-pathogen response and subvert host defense for productive infection. This functional gain also serves as a means to compensate genomic content loss due to reductive evolution.

AB  - Purpose: To standardize a nomenclature system for defining clinical phenotypes, and outcome measures for reporting clinical and research data in patients with ocular tuberculosis (OTB). Methods: Uveitis experts initially administered and further deliberated the survey in an open meeting to determine and propose the preferred nomenclature for terms related to the OTB, terms describing the clinical phenotypes and treatment and reporting outcomes. Results: The group of experts reached a consensus on terming uveitis attributable to tuberculosis (TB) as tubercular uveitis. The working group introduced a SUN-compatible nomenclature that also defines disease "remission" and "cure", both of which are relevant for reporting treatment outcomes. Conclusion: A consensus nomenclature system has been adopted by a large group of international uveitis experts for OTB. The working group recommends the use of standardized nomenclature to prevent ambiguity in communication and to achieve the goal of spreading awareness of this blinding uveitis entity.

AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is defined as the growth of a significant number of microorganisms of a single species in the urine, in the presence of symptoms. Symptoms in young children are non-specific such as fever without focus; young infants may manifest with irritability, failure to thrive, jaundice, vomiting and diarrhea. Older children usually have symptoms of cystitis or pyelonephritis. Symptoms of cystitis are dysuria, frequency, new onset incontinence and malodorous urine while symptoms of pyelonephritis are high grade fever, flank pain and vomiting. Rapid urine testing by microscopy for pus cells, dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite, and enhanced urinalysis are supportive tests. Urine culture samples should be collected with proper technique and results interpreted for significant growth accordingly. Antibiotic therapy for 7-14 d for complicated UTI and 3-4 d for uncomplicated UTI is adequate. Further evaluation is recommended clinically for bladder-bowel dysfunction and obvious anatomical defects and by imaging for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), usually by micturating cystourethrography (MCU). Since MCU involves exposure to radiation and urethral catheterization, it is now reserved for children with parenchymal involvement or recurrent UTI. VUR is the backward flow of urine into one or both ureters. Clinical manifestations other than UTI include incidental diagnosis on antenatal ultrasonography. Reflux nephropathy, the renal scarring associated with VUR may manifest clinically as hypertension, proteinuria and renal failure. The management of VUR is primarily with antibiotic prophylaxis. Anatomical correction is indicated in case of breakthrough febrile UTI. No intervention has been shown to reduce renal scarring.

AB  - In India, there are marked variations in resources for cervical cancer screening. For the first time, resource-stratified screening guidelines have been developed that will be suitable for low middle-income countries with similar diversities. The current article describes the process and outcomes of these resource stratified guidelines for screening and treatment of preinvasive lesions of cervix. Evidence from literature was collated and various guidelines were reviewed by an expert panel. Based on the level of evidence, guidelines were developed for screening by human papillomavirus (HPV) testing, cytology and visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA), and management of screen positive lesions in different resource settings. Expert opinion was used for certain country-specific situations. The healthcare system was stratified into two resource settings - good or limited. The mode of screening and treatment for each was described. HPV testing is the preferred method for cervical cancer screening. VIA by trained providers is especially suitable for low resource settings until an affordable HPV test becomes available. Healthcare providers can choose the most appropriate screening and treatment modality. A single visit approach is encouraged and treatment may be offered based on colposcopy diagnosis ('see and treat') or even on the basis of HPV test or VIA results ('screen and treat'), if compliance cannot be ensured. The Federation of Obsterician and Gynaecologists of India Good Clinical Practice Recommendations (FOGSI) GCPR are appropriately designed for countries with varied resource situations to ensure an acceptable cervical cancer prevention strategy.

AB  - Few studies have tried to assess prognostic variables in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV). We evaluated serum C reactive protein, (CRP) pre-albumin (PA) and transferrin (TR) levels in AE-COPD patients requiring MV as prognostic markers of in hospital mortality. 93 AE-COPD patients on MV were evaluated. Detailed clinical evaluation was done daily. Serum CRP & PA were measured on admission, 3rd, 8th and 16th day; TR was measured on admission, 8th and 16th day. Demographics, baseline parameters, CRP, PA and TR were correlated with mortality. Of 93 patients, 49 (52.69%) survived whereas 44 patients (47.31%) died. APACHE II, serum urea & albumin were similar in survivors & non-survivors. Baseline CRP (>= 10.5 mg/dl) had sensitivity of 60.5%, specificity of 60.2%, with area under curve (AUC) of 0.62 as predictor of mortality. CRP (>= 7 mg/dl) on day 3 had sensitivity (65.5%) and specificity (63.3%) with AUC 0.70 as predictor of mortality. Baseline serum prealbumin was 11.00 (0.09-29.26) mg/dl, and similar in survivors & non-survivors (p = 0.7). Prealbumin at day 8 (n = 50) < 13.5 mg/dl had sensitivity 54.6%, and specificity 51.4% with AUC 0.54 (95% CI 0.34-0.75) as predictor of mortality. Transferrin at day 8 (n = 50) of <148.9 had sensitivity 63.4% and specificity 61.4% with AUC 0.61 with respect to mortality. High CRP levels at baseline, persistently elevated CRP (on day 3) may predict mortality in AE-COPD patients requiring MV. Further studies are required to establish prognostic variables in this patient population.

AB  - Introduction Internal drainage of walled of necrosis of pancreas has been considered as the standard of care. For symptomatic walled off necrosis (WON) of pancreas with the advent of laparoscopy and refinement of techniques and instrumentation, laparoscopic internal drainage is becoming the standard surgical drainage procedure for these patients. However, there is a dearth of literature regarding outcomes following laparoscopic drainage. Most of the studies have small number of patients with limited follow-up. We in this study describe our experience of laparoscopic internal drainage of walled off necrosis over the last 13 years. Materials and methods This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. All patients with WON undergoing laparoscopic internal drainage between January 2005 and December 2018 were included. Primary outcome measure was successful drainage. Secondary outcome measures included morbidity, hospital stay, re-intervention rate and mortality. Patients were followed up post-operatively at 1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months and then annually thereafter. Ultrasonography was done periodically for the assessment of cyst resolution. Results Between 2005 and 2018, 154 surgical drainage procedures were performed for symptomatic pseudocyst/walled off necrosis. Out of these, 134 underwent laparoscopic drainage; 129 patients (96.3%) underwent laparoscopic cystogastrostomy and 5 (3.7%) underwent laparoscopic cystojejunostomy. Majority of the patients were male (male:female = 6:1) with a mean age of 36 +/- 12.9 years (range 15-58 years). The mean operative time was 94 min (range 64-144 min). There were three conversions because of intra-operative bleeding. The overall post-operative morbidity was 8.9%. The average hospital stay was 4.4 days (2-19 days). The mean duration of follow-up was 5.5 years (range 6 months-13 years). Complete cyst resolution was achieved in 95.5% (n = 128) patients. There has been no mortality till date. Conclusion In conclusion, laparoscopic internal drainage is a very effective technique for drainage of WON with an excellent success rate.

AB  - Introduction: Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas, which runs a severe course in 20% of patients, wherein it is associated with high mortality. It is associated with several pleuro-pulmonary complications with variable severity that may occur either in isolation but are frequently present in combination. Clinicians need to be aware of these complications for early and appropriate management. Areas covered: We performed a systematic search of the PUBMED database (1970-2019) to identify relevant articles focusing on pleuro-pulmonary complications that may occur in patients with acute pancreatitis. We also retrieved articles describing the pathophysiological mechanisms and treatment approach of the various complications. Expert opinion: Acute pancreatitis is usually a self-limiting disease, but the development of organ failure during the course worsens the clinical outcome. Pulmonary complications usually occur early in the course of acute pancreatitis. Clinicians need to recognize the various pulmonary complications of acute pancreatitis, early during the disease, and manage them appropriately and aggressively to improve outcomes.

AB  - Purpose To compare the effect of 'intermittent' central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO(2)) monitoring with 'continuous' ScvO(2) monitoring on shock resolution and mortality in children with septic shock. Methods Primary outcome was the achievement of therapeutic goals or shock resolution in the first 6 h. We randomly assigned children < 17 years' age with septic shock to 'intermittent ScvO(2)' or 'continuous ScvO(2)' groups. All children were subjected to subclavian/internal jugular line insertion and managed as per Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. To guide resuscitation, we used ScvO(2) estimated at other clinical and laboratory parameters were monitored similarly in both groups. Results We enrolled 75 and 77 children [median (IQR) age: 6 (1.5-10) years] in the 'intermittent' and 'continuous' groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups. When compared to the 'continuous' group, fewer children in the 'intermittent' group achieved shock resolution within first 6 h [19% vs. 36%; relative risk (RR) 0.51; 95% CI 0.29-0.89; risk difference - 18.0%; 95% CI - 32.0 to - 4.0]. The lower bound of confidence interval, however, crossed the pre-specified non-inferiority margin. There was no difference in the proportion of children attaining shock resolution within 24 h (63% vs. 69%; RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.68-1.08) or risk of mortality between the groups (47% vs. 43%; RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.74-1.51). Conclusions Given that a greater proportion of children attained therapeutic end points in the first 6 h, continuous monitoring of ScvO(2) should preferably be used to titrate therapy in the first few hours in children with septic shock. In the absence of such facility, intermittent monitoring of ScvO(2) can be used to titrate therapy in these children, given the lack of difference in the proportion of patients achieving shock resolution at 24 h or in risk of mortality between the intermittent and continuous groups.

AB  - Background: Studies have suggested promising evidence that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) could be used as a blood biomarker to distinguish between ischaemic stroke (IS) and intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) in acute stage. Objective: To determine the available evidence for GFAP as a blood biomarker for differentiating ICH from IS and stroke mimics using a meta-analysis approach. Methods: Search terms were used for literature search: ("STROKE" [Mesh] OR "BIOMARKER" [Title/] OR "GFAP" [Title/])] OR "SPECIFICITY" OR "SENSTIVITY" at various search engines like PubMed, Google scholar, Trip database, clinicaltrial.gov for articles from 1990 to April 2019 using filter 'human subjects'. Data were analysed using software STATA version 13. Results: A pooled analysis including 12 studies suggested that GFAP if used as a biomarker to differentiate between different types of strokes (ICH from IS and mimics) had a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 67-86%) and a specificity of 95% (95% CI: 88-98%). Positive likelihood ratio (LR) was 14.4 and negative LR was 0.23. SROC with prediction and confidence contours suggests promising area under the curve 0.93, 95% CI ranges from 0.90 to 0.95. Diagnostic odds ratio with 95% CI was observed 63 (31-125). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggests that GFAP has a promising diagnostic accuracy for the differentiation of ICH from IS and mimics. Further, phase II and phase III diagnostic test studies are required to validate the findings before using GFAP as a blood based biomarker for clinical use.

AB  - Background and Aim Anticoagulants play an important role in the management of Budd-Chiari syndrome. There is a paucity of data on the efficacy and safety of direct-acting oral anticoagulants-dabigatran, among patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome. Methods In a retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained data, the stent patency rates, major bleeding episode, and a composite endpoint of major bleed and/or mortality rates were compared between Budd-Chiari syndrome patients treated with dabigatran (n = 36) or vitamin K antagonists (n = 62) following endovascular intervention. Results The baseline characteristics, including sites of block and types of interventions, were similar between the two groups. The mean duration of follow-up in the dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist groups was 10.5 +/- 6.7 and 14.1 +/- 6.9 months (P = 0.006), respectively. The endovascular stent patency rates were comparable between the dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist groups at 6 months (91% vs 96.5%) and 12 months (91% vs 93%), P = 0.296 (log-rank test), respectively. Major bleeding events were comparable between the dabigatran and vitamin K antagonist groups at 6 months (3.5% vs 2%) and 12 months (3.5% vs 6.5%), P = 0.895 (log-rank test), respectively. The composite endpoint of mortality and major bleed was comparable between dabigatran and vitamin K antagonists at 6 months (4% vs 5%) and 12 months (4% vs 8%), P = 0.875 (log-rank test), respectively. Conclusions Dabigatran, as compared with vitamin K antagonists, is associated with similar stent patency rates and complications among patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome post-endovascular intervention.

AB  - Purpose Recently, the new hybrid chelator DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazepine-triacetate) has been introduced, which has the advantage of high yield and radiolabelling of DATA-based octreotide derivative (TOC) at room temperature in contrast to tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (DOTA) that needs 95 degrees C for effective labelling. However, the diagnostic potential of DATA-TOC has not been studied with other chelators in humans. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic efficacy of [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC (which is the current standard for imaging neuroendocrine tumours (NET)) in patients of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). Methods Fifty patients (thirty-one males and nineteen females) with biopsy-proven GEP-NETs were included in the study. Patients age ranged from 14 to 75 years (mean 46.11 years). All patients underwent two PET studies with [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC. Images were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively using maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of tumour, mediastinum and liver. Tumour-to-liver (T/L) and tumour-to-mediastinum (T/M) SUVmax ratios were computed. For the purpose of comparison, patient-wise as well as lesion-wise analysis was carried out. The nonparametric-related samples Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for comparison of the SUVmax values and ratios. Results On visual evaluation, the biodistribution and image quality of [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC was similar to [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC. Physiological liver uptake was lower in [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC as compared with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC, 7.65 +/- 5.37 vs 8.94 +/- 5.95 (p = 0.009), respectively. On a patient-wise analysis, both [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC were lesion-positive in the 44 patients (88%) and were negative in the 6 patients (12%). On a lesion-based analysis, [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC had 98.6% concordance with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC (232 out of 235 lesions detected). The target tumour SUVmax on [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC and [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC were 36.63 +/- 32.24 and 40.82 +/- 36.89, respectively (p = 0.097). The T/L SUVmax ratios were not significantly different (5.99 +/- 5.52 vs 5.67 +/- 4.96, p = 0.77). Conclusion [Ga-68]Ga-DATA-TOC PET/CT imaging produced results that were comparable with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-NOC. It, thus, has potential utility as an effective and safe alternative to Ga-68-DOTA-NOC with the added benefit of ease, cost-effective and improved yield of instant kit-type synthesis.

AB  - RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor gene, and its hypermethylation has been observed in cancers. RASSF1A acts as an upstream regulator of Hippo pathway and modulates its function. The aim of this study was to analyze expression of RASSF1A, Hippo pathway molecules (YAP, MST) and downstream targets (CTGF, Cyr61 and AREG) in bladder cancer patients. Later, the link between RASSF1A and Hippo pathway and a potential therapeutic scope of this link in UBC were also studied. MSPCR was performed to study methylation of RASSF1A promoter. Expression of molecules was studied using qPCR, Western blot and IHC. The link between RASSF1A and Hippo pathway was studied using Spearman's correlation in patients and validated by overexpressing RASSF1A in HT1376 cells and its effect on Hippo pathway was observed using qPCR and Western blot. Further therapeutic potential of this link was studied using MTT and PI assays. The expression of RASSF1A was lower, whereas the expression of YAP, CTGF and CYR61 was higher. The expression of RASSF1A protein gradually decreased, while the expression of YAP, CTGF and CYR61 increased with severity of disease. Based on Spearman's correlation, RASSF1A showed a negative correlation with YAP, CTGF and CYR61. YAP showed a positive correlation with CTGF and CYR61. To validate this link, RASSF1A was overexpressed in HT1376 cells. Overexpressed RASSF1A activated Hippo pathway, followed by a decrease in CTGF and CYR61 at mRNA, and enhanced cytotoxicity to chemotherapeutic drugs. This study finds a previously unrecognized role of RASSF1A in the regulation of CTGF and CYR61 through mediation of Hippo pathway in UBC and supports the significance of this link as a potential therapeutic target for UBC.

AB  - Cutting force and torque are important factors in the success of the bone drilling process. In the recent past, many attempts have been made to reduce the cutting force and torque in the bone drilling process. In this work, drilling on human cadaver bones has been performed using rotary ultrasonic bone drilling process to investigate the effect of drilling parameters on cutting force and torque. The experimental work was carried on a recently developed rotary ultrasonic bone drilling machine for surgical operations. The experimental work was performed in two phases. The first phase includes a comparative study between rotary ultrasonic bone drilling and conventional surgical bone drilling, to study the influence of various drilling parameters (rotational speed, drill diameter, and drilling tool feed rate) on the cutting force and torque. The results revealed that the cutting force and torque produced during drilling operations in rotary ultrasonic bone drilling were lesser (30%-40%) than conventional surgical bone drilling. In the second phase, response surface methodology was used to perform the statistical modeling of cutting force and torque in rotary ultrasonic bone drilling process. Analysis of variance was performed at a confidence interval of 95% to analyze the significant contribution (p < 0.05) of process parameters (drilling speed, feed rate, drill diameter, and abrasive particle size) on the responses (cutting force and torque). The confirmatory experiments were performed to validate the developed statistical models. It was found that both cutting force and torque decrease with increase in drilling speed and increases with the increasing drill diameter, feed rate, and abrasive particle size.

AB  - Traumatic dental injuries (TDI) have emerged as a significant global public health concern. One major problem which is developing and yet unreported is the incidence of traumatic dental injuries and soft tissue facial trauma due to the inadvertent falling of smartphones on to the face during their use in rest time. This is related to the weight of the smartphones and their excessive use in all parts of the world. This paper aims to highlight this phenomenon as an emerging aetiological factor for dental and facial injuries in children.

AB  - Objectives Antiepileptic drug (AED) tapering in persons with epilepsy (PWE) after 2-3 years of seizure freedom is still debatable because of the risk of seizure recurrence. Tapering patterns have wide variability and could impact seizure recurrence; this study aimed to find out the correlation between them. Material and Methods This prospective, observational independent assessor study enrolled PWE undergoing AED tapering in a tertiary care hospital. Data collected included demography, seizure history, AED treatment, and investigational findings. Tapering pattern was assessed based on seizure-free period and AED dose before onset of tapering, dose reduction percentage and frequency, duration of tapering, and follow-up. These variables were compared among the PWE with seizure recurrence and no seizure recurrence. Results Among 408 enrolled PWE, 181 were on AED monotherapy: levetiracetam (73), valproate (45), carbamazepine (44), phenytoin (16), and clobazam (3). With a minimum 19 (maximum 41 months) follow-up, seizure recurrence was reported in 119 (29.2%) PWE. The seizure recurrence was not significantly different in-between mono and polytherapy groups; however, among monotherapy groups seizure recurrence was significantly higher (P = .023) in valproate (35.5%) followed by levetiracetam (28.8%) group. Parameters having significant association with seizure recurrence were duration of epilepsy (P = .03), frequency of seizures before control (P = .002), history of previously failed tapering (P = .04), and history of smoking/alcoholic/tobacco intake (P = .003). Conclusions There is a wide variation in AEDs tapering pattern and seizure recurrence risk can be minimized by considering the risk factors like history of smoking/alcoholic/tobacco, longer duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures before control, and previously failed tapering.

AB  - Background: Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) caused by hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), is often severe and difficult to treat. The most common source of exposure to Cr(VI) in Sweden used to be cement, and more recently leather. The contact allergy can be diminished or inhibited if the exposure is decreased or ceases. Barrier creams against different kinds of allergens have been investigated for their protective properties which may offer protection against Cr(VI) exposure.
   Objectives: To investigate the capacity of formulas containing glutathione (GSH) and iron sulfate to inhibit elicitation of ACD in Cr(VI)-allergic individuals when exposed to Cr(VI).
   Methods: In 18 Cr(VI)-allergic volunteers the back was divided into eight patch test areas which were treated with preparations of possible barrier creams, prior to patch testing with a dilution series of potassium dichromate and a buffered extract of cement.
   Results: A significant reduction in reactivity to Cr(VI) and cement extract on skin treated with formulas containing GSH or iron sulfate was noticed, compared with untreated skin.
   Conclusion: Formulas containing GSH or iron sulfate in barrier creams inhibit ACD in individuals allergic to Cr(VI) when applied before exposure to Cr(VI) and cement extract.

AB  - Background and Aim Hemostasis in cirrhosis is dynamic and balanced. Thromboelastography (TEG) assesses global coagulation status. We aimed to assess whether TEG-guided blood product transfusions result in lower blood product requirements in patients with cirrhosis undergoing invasive liver-related procedures as compared to the conventional standard of care (SOC). Methods In this open-label, randomized controlled trial, cirrhosis patients with coagulopathy, undergoing invasive liver-related procedures, were randomized to either TEG-guided blood product transfusion or SOC. The primary outcome was difference in the amount of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and platelet units transfused between the two groups. The secondary outcome was procedure-related bleeding complications within 5 days and any complications until 28 days. Results From November 2017 till June 2019, 58 patients were recruited (29: TEG and 29: SOC). Most common procedures performed were percutaneous liver biopsy (n = 48), followed by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (n = 2), percutaneous acetic acid injection (n = 2), and transarterial chemoembolization (n = 2). There were no differences in baseline demographics, hemostatic profile, and types of procedures between the two groups. Only nine patients in TEG group received transfusions compared to all patients in SOC (31% vs 100%; P < 0.001). In TEG group, six (20.7%) received FFP (P = 0.753 vs. SOC), two (6.9%) received platelets (P < 0.001 vs. SOC), and 1(3.4%) patient received both FFP and platelet (P >= 0.999 vs. SOC) transfusion. None of the patients in either group developed procedure-related bleeding complications until 5 days post-procedure. The complication rates at 28-day follow-up were similar between the groups. Conclusion TEG-guided blood product transfusion strategy reduces blood product transfusion without increased risk of bleeding in cirrhotic patients undergoing invasive liver-related procedures (CTRI/2017/12/010822).

AB  - Purpose The objective of this study was to investigate and present the early results on the efficacy, safety, and quality of life of Ac-225-DOTATATE targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in patients with advanced, progressive, Lu-177-DOTATATE refractory, and somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expressing metastatic GEP-NETs. Methods In this prospective study, we recruited patients with metastatic GEP-NETs who were stable or progressive disease on Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy. Systemic TAT using Ac-225-DOTATATE was performed in all the patients with Ac-225-DOTATATE (100 kBq/kg body weight) at an interval of 8 weeks. The primary end point was to assess the objective response (measured by RECIST 1.1 and functional M.D. Anderson criteria). The secondary end points included biochemical response assessment as per the Italian Trials in Medical Oncology (ITMO), adverse event profile as per CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response assessment by the quality of life (assessed with EORTC QLQ-GI.NET21 patient-based questionnaire). Results Between April 2018 and March 2019, 32 patients (17 females, 15 males, mean age 52 +/- 9.2 years, 35-72 years) with either stable disease after completing Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy (14, 44%) or progressive disease on Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy (18, 56%) were included in the study. The morphological response was assessed in 24/32 patients that revealed partial remission in 15 and stable disease in 9. There was no documented disease progression or deaths in the median follow-up of 8 months (range 2-13 months). There was a significant decrease in the plasma chromogranin level post-Ac-225-DOTATATE therapy (P < 0.0001). Conclusion Our short-term clinical results indicate Ac-225-DOTATATE TAT as a promising treatment option which adds a new dimension in patients who are refractory to Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy or have reached the maximum prescribed cycles of Lu-177-DOTATATE therapy.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of adding metformin or spironolactone to rosiglitazone in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This is a prospective non-randomized study in a tertiary care with at in a tertiary care endocrine clinic. Women (n = 138) diagnosed with PCOS on the basis of Rotterdam criteria 2003 were categorized into three groups on the basis of drug intake as - rosiglitazone (R), rosiglitazone with spironolactone (R + S), and rosiglitazone with metformin (R + M). Clinical, biochemical, hormonal, and insulin sensitivity parameters were assessed at baseline and after six months of follow up. There was a significant improvement in number of menstrual cycles per year and Ferriman Gallwey (FG) score in all three groups after 6 months. Plasma insulin (0, 2 h), HOMA-IR and serum total testosterone levels decreased after six months in all the three groups. The inter group comparison showed higher efficacy of R + S in improving hyperandrogenism whereas R + M was most effective in decreasing body weight and plasma insulin levels compared to R and R + S (p<.05). Treatment of women with PCOS using rosiglitazone alone and in combination with spironolactone or metformin is safe and efficacious with limited adverse events however randomized trials with longer duration of follow up are warranted.

AB  - Warthin tumor (WT) is the second most common benign salivary gland neoplasm. It is also the most frequent salivary gland tumor to occur synchronously or metachronously with another salivary gland neoplasm, in the same gland or on the other side. Oncocytic papillary cystadenomas (OPCs) are rare neoplasms that are more common in minor salivary gland locations and in women. We describe in detail the case of a 73-year-old male smoker with synchronous OPC and WT of the parotid gland. On microscopy, both tumors resembled each other considerably, with the only difference being that the OPC lacked the tumor-associated lymphoid proliferation characteristic of WT. These findings highlight that OPC bears considerable similarity to WT. While this morphological similarity may lead to misdiagnosis on rare occasions, it does not affect patient management, as clinical behavior of both these tumors is similar.

AB  - Flow cytometry has become 'gold standard' for detecting abnormal clones in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), aplastic anemia (AA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). This pilot study was conducted in 2015 with a primary aim to evaluate the utility of single tube fluorescent aerolysin (FLAER) based testing and its comparison with two tubes non-FLAER based testing (CD55, CD59, CD24 and CD66b) in detecting abnormal PNH clones in these newly diagnosed cases. The secondary aim was an attempt to distinguish PNH from AA/MDS cases associated with PNH clones based on clinical, laboratory features and clone size at diagnosis. In this study, the abnormal PNH clones were detected using a single tube FLAER based testing and two tubes non-FLAER based testing in all cases of PNH (n=12), healthy subjects (n=18) and AA/MDS with PNH clone (n=9) and compared with clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis. The receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis defined the optimal cut-offs for FLAER in granulocytes (>0.7%) and monocytes (>0.9%). There was significant positive correlation between FLAER and non-FLAER based testing in these cells (r>0.3 and p<0.05). FLAER based testing helped us in picking up smaller clones which were missed by latter technique in four patients thereby increasing its sensitivity and also technically proved to be cost-effective (Rs. 1800 vs. Rs. 2100). Even in PNH patients, the clone size was slightly higher by using FLAER when compared to non-FLAER based antibodies panel. The clone size of monocytes was always higher than granulocytes in both PNH and AA/MDS groups. Bone marrow cellularity and mean size of granulocytes and monocytes clone at diagnosis showed a striking statistically significant 'p' value of<0.0001 between these groups. In this pilot study, a single tube FLAER based PNH testing had improved clone detection in all cases of PNH, AA/MDS with PNH clones. The clone size was>30% in majority of PNH cases whereas in AA/MDS, it was usually<10% at diagnosis. Hence this newer technique not only increased the sensitivity of PNH clone detection but also proved to be cost-effective.

AB  - Various modifications of the reconstruction following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) have been described. Pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) was first described clinically by Waugh and Clagett from the Mayo Clinic in 1946. Despite recent randomized trials and meta-analysis, the literature is still ambiguous as to which is a safer procedure. We hereby describe our experience of more than 400 pancreaticogastrostomies. The legacy of performing only pancreaticogastrostomy (PG) started by the senior author (BMLK) continued from 1977 to date in this surgical unit of a tertiary care hospital. We present the results of this case series analysis of a total of 467 Whipple's pancreaticoduodenectomy in whom PG was performed. The mean operative time was 260.8 +/- 50.3 min (180-390 min) with an average blood loss of 1068 +/- 606.19 ml (400-2600 ml). None of the patients had clinically significant POPF. Thirty-five patients had postoperative bleeding out of which 12 were early and 23 had delayed hemorrhage. The most common postoperative complication was delayed gastric emptying which was seen in 96 patients (20.5%). Transient bile leak was seen in 84 patients (18%). Wound infection was seen in 70 (15%) patients. The overall 30-day mortality was 2% (10 out of 400). PG as a reconstructive technique is a safe option following PD with minimal incidence of clinically significant postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) as shown in our series of more than 400 patients. This is the largest series to date of pancreaticogastrostomy following PD.

AB  - The availability of clotting factor concentrates of both factor VIII and factor IX have improved hemophilia treatment to a great extent. Many more improvements like physiotherapy, and comprehensive care are needed to give better care. One important complication that occurs, but is often set aside is the development of inhibitors. When an inhibitor develops in a patient of severe hemophilia then the care becomes more difficult and expensive. Eradication of the inhibitor is possible by Immune tolerance induction (ITI), this paper explains some important essential factors and practical issues during my experience with ITI.

Major clinical features of AYGRPS include congenital cataracts, sensorineural hearing loss, intellectual disability, and a distinctive flat facial appearance. Skeletal abnormalities have also been observed in affected individuals, even though these features have not been assessed systematically. Expanding the series with four additional patients, here we provide a more accurate delineation of the molecular aspects and clinical phenotype, particularly focusing on the skeletal features characterizing this disorder. Apart from previously reported malar flattening and joint limitations, we document that carpal/tarsal and long bone defects, and hip dysplasia occur in affected subjects more frequently than formerly appreciated.

AB  - Background and Aim Demonstration of villous abnormalities is an essential component of diagnosis of celiac disease (CeD) that requires duodenal biopsies. There is a need for non-invasive biomarker(s) that can predict the presence of villous abnormalities. Methods Levels of plasma citrulline, plasma intestinal fatty acid binding protein (I-FABP), and serum regenerating gene 1 alpha (Reg1 alpha) were estimated in treatment naive patients with CeD and controls. The levels of these biomarkers and their cyclical pattern were validated in a predicted model of enteropathy. Optimum diagnostic cut-off values were derived, and the results were further validated in a prospective validation cohort. Results While level of plasma citrulline was significantly lower, the levels of plasma I-FABP and serum Reg1 alpha were significantly higher in patients with CeD (n = 131) in comparison with healthy (n = 216) and disease controls (n = 133), and their levels reversed after a gluten-free diet (GFD). In the model of predicted enteropathy (n = 70), a sequential decrease and then increase in the level of plasma citrulline was observed; such a sequential change was not observed with I-FABP and Reg1 alpha. The diagnostic accuracy for prediction of presence of villous abnormality was 89% and 78% if citrulline level was <= 30 mu M/L and I-FABP levels were >= 1100 pg/mL, respectively. The results were validated in a prospective validation cohort (n = 104) with a sensitivity and specificity of 79.5% and 83.1%, respectively, for predicting villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade > 2 at calculated cut-off values of citrulline and I-FABP. Conclusions Plasma citrulline <= 30 mu M/L is the most consistent, highly reproducible non-invasive biomarker that can predict the presence of villous abnormality and has the potential for avoiding duodenal biopsies in 78% patients suspected to have CeD.

AB  - Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours (AT/RTs) are highly aggressive and uncommon malignant tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) affecting children younger than 3 years of age. Primary spinal cord involvement is an extremely rare presentation. AT/RTs show necrosis and haemorrhages on histopathology frequently. However, spinal atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT) with hematomyelia and spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), as seen in our case, has never been reported in the literature in the paediatric age group. We report a case of primary spinal AT/RT in a 3-year-old male child presenting acutely with hematomyelia and spinal SAH and try to elucidate its pathophysiological basis.

AB  - The inflammatory process plays a key role in neurodegenerative disorder. The inflammatory molecule, 5-lipooxygenase (5-LOX), protein is involved in the pathologic phenotype of AD which includes A beta amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. This study aims to identify the mechanistic role in neuroprotection by 5-LOX inhibitor in neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cell line model by evaluating different cell survival pathway. The neurotoxic SH-SY5Y cells were developed by the treatment of A beta(25-35). The cells were then treated with 5-LOX peptide inhibitor, YWCS to prevent neurotoxicity reported earlier from our lab. The effect of 5-LOX inhibition on cell survival pathways were determined by western blot experiment with different doses of peptide by using polyclonal anti body of p53, anti-Akt and anti-phosphorylated Akt. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopic studies were done to identify the altered proteins appeared on the blot. Over expression of phosphorylated Akt and 3 bands on p53 lane blot other than p53 were observed. Three bands were identified as isoforms of p53 which correspond to p73, Delta 133p53 and Delta 160p53 in the cells treated only with 80 mu M of YWCS compare to untreated cells. However, no alteration of total p53 and Akt were observed in treated cells. The results exposed the novel mechanistic pathway of neuroprotection by 5-LOX inhibition is likely to be mediated by DNA DSB repair through p53 isoforms and PI3K/Akt pathway. Our finding has opened a new window in the therapeutic approach for the prevention of AD.

AB  - Objectives Hypotension is common after induction of general anesthesia, and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative end-organ injury such as acute kidney injury and myocardial ischemia. This study was designed to determine the utility of the carotid corrected flow time (cFT) and carotid artery peak blood flow velocity variation (oV(peak)) for prediction of hypotension after induction of general anesthesia. Methods Adult patients (n = 112) undergoing any elective surgery under general anesthesia who fasted for at least 6 to 8 hours were recruited in this prospective observational study. The common carotid artery cFT and oV(peak) were measured with ultrasound 10 minutes before induction of general anesthesia. After that, general anesthesia with propofol was used, and hemodynamic data were collected until 3 minutes after induction of anesthesia. Results The carotid cFT was significantly correlated with percentages of the fall in the systolic blood pressure at 2 minutes (P < .0001) and 3 minutes (P < .0001) and percentages of the fall in the mean arterial pressure at 1 minute (P = .0006), 2 minutes (P < .0001), and 3 minutes (P < .0001). The cFT was a predictor of hypotension after induction of general anesthesia, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.91. The best cutoff value obtained from this study was 330.2 milliseconds or less, which predicted postinduction hypotension with sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and 96.8%, respectively. The oV(peak) was an inferior predictor of postinduction hypotension, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68. The optimum cutoff value was 18.8%, with sensitivity and specificity of 61.9% and 67.4%. Conclusions The cFT measured in the common carotid artery is a reasonable predictor of hypotension after induction of general anesthesia in American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II patients. Further studies are required to identify its role in high-risk patients such as older groups and patients with cardiovascular diseases and also to identify interobserver and intraobserver variability of cFT and oV(peak) measurements.

AB  - The encoding of visuospatial information is the foremost and indispensable step which determines the outcome in a visuospatial working memory (VSWM) task. It is considered to play a crucial role in limiting our ability to attend and process only 3-5 integrated items of information. Despite its importance in determining VSWM performance, the neural mechanisms underlying VSWM encoding have not been clearly differentiated from those involved during VSWM retention, manipulation and/or retrieval. The high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) and improved spatial resolution with dense array data acquisition makes it an ideal tool to study the dynamics in the functional brain connectivity during a cognitive task. In the present study, the changes in the functional brain connectivity due to memory load during VSWM encoding were studied using 128-channel EEG. Lagged linear coherence (LagR) was computed between 84 regions of interest (ROIs) defined according to the Brodmann areas for seven EEG frequency bands: delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz), beta 1 (13-20 Hz), beta 2 (20-30 Hz), and gamma (30-45 Hz). Interestingly, out of seven EEG frequency bands investigated in the current study, LagR of only theta band varied significantly in 13 brain connections due to memory load during VSWM encoding. LagR of theta band increased significantly at high memory load when compared to low memory load in twelve brain connections with the maximum change observed between right cuneus and right middle temporal gyrus (Cohen's d = 0.836), indicating the integration of brain processes to confront the increase in memory demands. Theta LagR decreased significantly between left postcentral gyrus and right precentral gyrus at high memory load as compared to low memory load, which might have a role for sustaining attention during encoding. Change in the LagR values due to memory load between fusiform gyrus and lingual gyrus in the right hemisphere had a positive correlation (r = 0.464, p = 0.003) with the error rate, signifying the crucial role played by these two regions in predicting the performance. The current study has not only identified the neural connections that are responsible for the formation of working memory traces during VSWM encoding, but also support the notion that encoding is a rate-limiting process underlying our memory capacity limit.

AB  - Background Lumbar radicular pain (LRP) results from inflammation and irritation of lumbar spinal nerves and the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Methods Our study is a prospective, triple-blind, randomized, activecontrol trial (CTRI/2016/02/006666) comparing transforaminal epidural local anesthetic (LA) injection and pulsed radiofrequency treatment of DRG in patients with chronic LRP. Patients with LRP after failed conservative management for >3 months received selective diagnostic nerve root block with 1 mL 2% lidocaine. Fifty patients showing positive responses were divided into groups of 25 each. The LA group received transforaminal epidural injection of 1 mL 0.5% bupivacaine. The lumbar pulsed radiofrequency (LPRF) group received transforaminal epidural injection of 1 mL 0.5% bupivacaine with 3 cycles of pulsed radiofrequency of the DRG for 180 seconds Results Both groups were compared by observing pain intensity on a 0- to 100-point VAS and improvement in functional status by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI version 2.0) at 2 weeks and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. All baseline variables were comparable between the 2 groups. Statistically significant reduction in both outcomes was seen in the LPRF group compared to the LA group from 2 weeks to 6 months. One hundred percent of patients in the LPRF group had a >= 20- point decrease in VAS and significant percentage reduction in ODI at all time intervals up to 6 months, whereas it was seen in 80% and 28% of patients in the LA group at 3 and 6 months, respectively. No complications were seen in any patients Conclusion Pulsed radiofrequency of the DRG applied for longer duration results in long-term pain relief and improvement in the functional quality of life in patients with chronic LRP.

AB  - The study aimed to analyse the utilization of the operation theatres at a tertiary care teaching hospital. An observational study with time monitoring of various processes was carried out from January to December 2016 in the OT complex of a public sector tertiary care hospital. OT complex comprised of 12 operating rooms and all the elective OTs (11) were included in the study except the emergency OT. One OT for a full day per week was observed. Selection of operation theatre and weekday for data collection was done using simple random sampling without replacement using chit system. OTs were observed for 26 days spread over a period of 6 months with resource hours of 15,000 min (250 h). A total of 129 (69.34%) surgeries out of 186 scheduled surgeries were conducted with an average of 4.61 surgeries per day and an observed cancellation rate of 30.66%. Overall raw utilization of OT was observed to be 99.29%, while overall adjusted utilization was 128.53% with an idle time of 0.81% only. Total time spent on "anaesthesia preparation" was 1624 min (8.42%), "surgical preparation time" was 1930 min (10.01%), "actual surgery time" was 9554 min (49.56%), "room set-up and room clean-up time" was 4441 min (23.04%), "surgery finish and anaesthesia finish time" was 574 min (2.98%) and "turn over time" was 1000 min (5.19%). The operation theatres are being optimally utilized, however, an effort should be made to make the ancillary processes (room set up and clean up) more efficient.

AB  - Oxidative stress (OS) plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and glutathione (GSH) mitigates this effect by maintaining redox-imbalance and free-radical neutralization. Quantified brain GSH concentration provides distinct information about OS among age-matched normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients. We report alterations of in vivo GSH conformers, along with the choline, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate levels in the cingulate cortex (CC) containing anterior (ACC) and posterior (PCC) regions of 64 (27 NC, 19 MCI, and 18 AD) participants using MEscher-GArwood-Point-RESolved spectroscopy sequence. Result indicated, tissue corrected GSH depletion in PCC among MCI (p = .001) and AD (p = .028) and in ACC among MCI (p = .194) and AD (p = .025) as compared to NC. Effects of the group, region, and group x region on GSH with age and gender as covariates were analyzed using a generalized linear model with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A significant effect of group with GSH depletion in AD and MCI was observed as compared to NC. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis of GSH level in CC differentiated between MCI and NC groups with an accuracy of 82.8% and 73.5% between AD and NC groups. Multivariate ROC analysis for the combined effect of the GSH alteration in both ACC and PCC regions provided improved diagnostic accuracy of 86.6% for NC to MCI conversion and 76.4% for NC to AD conversion. We conclude that only closed GSH conformer depletion in the ACC and PCC regions is critical and constitute a potential biomarker for AD.

AB  - Accurate and reliable point of care tests (POCTs) for hemoglobin estimation is essential for early diagnosis and management of anemia. This study was aimed to assess the reliability and validity of two versions of digital hemoglobinometer (HemoCue 201+ and HemoCue 301) compared to the gold standard Sysmex autoanalyzer for hemoglobin estimation. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Primary Health Centre and a Sub Divisional Hospital in Haryana, India, were recruited. After obtaining consent, capillary blood samples were collected and tested for hemoglobin levels with digital hemoglobinometers (HemoCue 201+ and HemoCue 301). Among same pregnant women venous blood was collected and hemoglobin levels were estimated using autoanalyzer. Validity and reliability of POCTs compared to Sysmex autoanalyzer were reported. Of the 102 pregnant women included in the study, 44 (43%) were primigravida, with mean (SD) age of 23.3 (3.4) years. The mean (SD) of difference in hemoglobin levels using HemoCue 201+ was -0.53 (1.01) and using HemoCue 301 was -0.25 (0.85) g/dL as compared to auto-analyzer. Lin's concordance coefficient was 0.80 for HemoCue 201+ and 0.85 for HemoCue 301. Weighted Cohen's Kappa indicated moderate degree of agreement with the gold standard. Sensitivity (HemoCue 201+: 93%; HemoCue 301: 90%) and specificity (HemoCue 201: 76% HemoCue 301: 80%) for detecting anemia was similar for both the POCT devices. The digital hemoglobinometers used in the study had moderate degree of agreement and concordance with the autoanalyzer for hemoglobin estimation. HemoCue 301 had higher validity as compared to HemoCue 201+.

AB  - The abnormal growth of malignant plasma cells in Multiple Myeloma (MM) requires bone marrow (BM) niche consisting of proteoglycans, cytokines, etc. Versican (VCAN), a chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan promotes progression in solid tumours but there is dearth of literature in MM. Hence, we studied the involvement of VCAN in MM and its regulation by microRNAs as a therapeutic approach. Thirty MM patients and 20 controls were recruited and BM stromal cells (BMSCs) were isolated by primary culture. Molecular levels of VCAN, miR-144, miR-199 & miR-203 were determined in study subjects and cell lines. The involvement of VCAN in myeloma pathogenesis was studied using BMSCs-conditioned medium (BMSCs-CM) and VCAN-neutralizing antibody or microRNA mimics. Elevated expression of VCAN was observed in patients especially in BM stroma while microRNA expression was significantly lower and showed negative correlation with VCAN. Moreover, BMSCs-CM showed the presence of VCAN which upon supplementing to MM cells alter parameters in favour of myeloma progression, however, this effect was neutralized by VCAN antibody or miR (miR-144 and miR-199) mimics. The downstream signalling of VCAN was found to activate FAK and STAT3 which subsides by using VCAN antibody or miR mimics. The neutralization of oncogenic effect of BMSCs-CM by VCAN blockage affirms its plausible role in progression of MM. VCAN was observed as a paracrine mediator in the cross-talk of BMSCs and myeloma cells in BM microenvironment. Therefore, these findings suggest exploring VCAN as novel therapeutic target and utilization of microRNAs as a therapy to regulate VCAN for better management of MM.

TI  - Effect of a multicomponent intervention on achievement and improvements in quality-of-care indices among people with Type 2 diabetes in South Asia: the CARRS trial
T2  - DIABETIC MEDICINE
AB  - Aims To evaluate whether and what combinations of diabetes quality metrics were achieved in a multicentre trial in South Asia evaluating a multicomponent quality improvement intervention that included non-physician care coordinators to promote adherence and clinical decision-support software to enhance physician practices, in comparision with usual care. Methods Using data from the Centre for Cardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) trial, we evaluated the proportions of trial participants achieving specific and combinations of five diabetes care targets (HbA(1c)<53 mmol/mol [7%], blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, LDL cholesterol <2.6 mmol/L, non-smoking status, and aspirin use). Additionally, we examined the proportions of participants achieving the following risk factor improvements from baseline: >= 11-mmol/mol (1%) reduction in HbA(1c), >= 10-mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure, and/or >= 0.26-mmol/l reduction in LDL cholesterol. Results Baseline characteristics were similar in the intervention and usual care arms. Overall, 12.3%, 29.4%, 36.5%, 19.5% and 2.2% of participants in the intervention group and 16.2%, 38.3%, 31.6%, 11.3% and 0.8% of participants in the usual care group achieved any one, two, three, four or five targets, respectively. We noted sizeable improvements in HbA(1c), blood pressure and cholesterol, and found that participants in the intervention group were twice as likely to achieve improvements in all three indices at 12 months that were sustained over 28 months of the study [relative risk 2.1 (95% CI 1.5,2.8) and 1.8 (95% CI 1.5,2.3), respectively]. Conclusions The intervention was associated with significantly higher achievement of and greater improvements in composite diabetes quality care goals. However, among these higher-risk participants, very small proportions achieved the complete group of targets, which suggests that achievement of multiple quality-of-care goals is challenging and that other methods may be needed in closing care gaps.

KW  - EFFICACY
AB  - Background Noncultured extracted hair follicle outer root sheath cell suspension (NC-EHF-ORS-CS) is an upcoming surgical technique to treat stable vitiligo. Conventionally it employs trypsin to tap the hair follicle (HF) reservoir for autologous melanocytes and their precursors for transplantation. However, a perifollicular dermal sheath composed of type 1 collagen encases the target 'bulge' region of the HF. Adding collagenase type 1 would digest the ORS, facilitating better release of cells. Aim To compare the repigmentation achieved using trypsin and a combination of collagenase plus trypsin, respectively, with dermabrasion alone, and to compare cell counts, viability and composition of both suspensions. Methods This was a randomized, double-blind, comparative, therapeutic trial, conducted as a pilot study on 22 patients with stable vitiligo. Three similar patches were randomized into three parallel treatment arms [(A) trypsin plus collagenase, (B) trypsin alone and (C) dermabrasion with vehicle alone]. Each patient's HF sample was divided and digested by the two methods, and transplanted as suspensions onto dermabraded patches, while a third dermabraded patch received the vehicle only. Suspensions were sent for laboratory analysis. Repigmentation was assessed over a follow-up of 6 months. Results There was a significant increase in cell yield and comparable viability when collagenase was added. Immunohistochemical and flow cytometry studies showed a nonsignificant increase in HMB45+ melanocytes and their precursor stem cells in group A. This trend was reflected clinically in the extent of repigmentation [group A (33.22%) > B (24.31%) > C (16.59%); P = 0.13]. Adding collagenase induced significantly higher repigmentation than dermabrasion alone (P < 0.05). Conclusions Incorporating collagenase type I into the conventional NC-EHF-ORS-CS technique resulted in enhanced retrieval of pigment-forming cells and subsequently improved repigmentation in vitiligo.

AB  - What is known and objective Oxidative stress and inflammation are known to be high in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, association of change in their levels with treatment response remains unaddressed. The present study evaluated change in blood levels of oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in NSCLC patients, after first course of platinum-based chemotherapy. Methods This prospective cohort study enrolled newly diagnosed NSCLC patients receiving either pemetrexed-carboplatin (group A) or paclitaxel-carboplatin (group B). Blood levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were measured at baseline and after first cycle. Response to treatment was noted after 2nd or 4th cycle, as available. Subgroup analysis was done (group B), based on paclitaxel dose/formulation. Results Of the 85 patients screened, 38 were enrolled with a mean age of 56.7 +/- 9.2 years. Baseline levels of oxidative and inflammatory markers were not different between the groups and did not change significantly within the groups. Significant reduction in IL-6 was seen with three-weekly paclitaxel-carboplatin (from median 81.3 [range 8.6, 1006] pg/mL to 51.8 [11.4, 99.5] pg/mL; P = .025). C-reactive protein levels reduced with weekly nab-paclitaxel (P = .043). Change in levels did not relate with therapeutic response except for IL-6 which decreased in patients with partial response (from 102.6 [8.1, 1006] pg/mL to 38.9 [8.4, 99.5] pg/mL; P = .036). What is new and conclusion Although the levels of oxidative and inflammatory markers varied following chemotherapy, trend indicates that IL-6 may be a potential marker of treatment response in NSCLC patients.

AB  - Candida auris, a recently identified multiresistant Candida species, was first reported in Japan in 2009. It is different from other pathogenic yeast species because of its propensity to cause outbreaks and transmits between patients within health care settings. The invasive infections caused by C. auris are associated with high mortality rates, approaching 70% particularly in intensive care unit patients. Conventional biochemical methods are inaccurate in identifying this species of Candida. Although C. auris is frequently reported as multi-, extended-, or pan drug resistant to antifungal drugs, there is a wide variability in the susceptibility among reports worldwide. In this study we report a case series of five hospitalized patients with multidrug-resistant candidemia caused by C. auris in a tertiary hospital in India. Our finding suggests that correct identification followed by therapeutic intervention is necessary for favorable outcome in patients with C. auris fungemia.

AB  - Background Myoinvasion and tumor-type determines surgical planning in endometrial carcinoma. Purpose To evaluate whole tumor diffusion tensor imaging histogram texture parameters in evaluating myoinvasion and tumor type in endometrial carcinoma. Material and Methods Twenty-seven patients with endometrial carcinoma underwent diffusion tensor imaging on a 1.5-T MRI system using echo-planar imaging sequence with 0 and 700 s/mm(2) b values. Whole tumor histogram parameters were obtained from fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity maps. Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used Results The mean fractional anisotropy of tumors with no myoinvasion was significantly higher than tumors which underwent myoinvasion, suggesting higher anisotropy in tumors which did not invade the myometrium. Voxel-wise heterogeneity in distribution of fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity was seen in the form of higher uniformity and lower entropy of tumors with superficial 50% myoinvasion. Uniformity, entropy, and energy of voxel-wise fractional anisotropy distribution gave an area under the curve of 0.827, 0.821, and 0.796, respectively, in predicting the presence of deep myometrial invasion while energy, entropy, and uniformity of mean diffusivity distribution in tumor gave an area under the curve of 0.84, 0.815, and 0.809 respectively. Tumor type was predicted with an area under the curve of 0.747, 0.759, and 0.765 for the uniformity, energy, and entropy of voxel-wise fractional anisotropy distribution. A logistic regression combining all the important histogram parameters obtained 94% and 88% sensitivity and 88% and 80% specificity in predicting deep myoinvasion and tumor type, respectively. Conclusion Diffusion tensor histogram analysis can better characterize endometrial carcinomas and can be used as a quantitative marker of tumor behavior.

AB  - We sought to evaluate the role and diagnostic potential of ocular B-scan ultrasonography in childhood eye disease in an observational cross-sectional study; 1091 patients with a total of 1445 eyes examined were studied. Cataract was the single most common indication for ultrasound followed by corneal pathology, ocular trauma, posterior segment pathology, primary congenital glaucoma, leukocoria, orbital pathology and other disease. Ultrasonography resulted in a change in diagnosis in 198 cases (18%). We conclude that B-scan ultrasonography plays an important adjunctive role in the management of childhood eye disease.

Methods: Narrative review of preventive programs that have a high strength of recommendation according to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grading system. Results: Prevention programs that met the criteria are school and college based, family-based, community based, peer-led, workplace-based, and technology-based interventions. They target the known modifiable risk factors associated with illicit drug use among adolescents and young adults. Conclusion: The preventive programs we reviewed are utilizing evidence-based strategies for the prevention of illicit drug use. Further research is needed to formulate new and effective preventive strategies for the reduction of illicit drug use by emerging adults.

AB  - Background: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G antigens are inducible non-classical major histocompatibility complex class Ib molecules which play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and immunomodulation in autoimmune diseases. There are controversial reports on the impact of HLA-G gene polymorphisms on rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This study aimed at examining the impact of 14 base pair (bp) ins/del (rs66554220) and +3142G>C (rs1063320) polymorphisms and correlating these with soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) levels to understand the susceptibility to RA in our sample cohort. Methods: Genomic DNA from 140 RA patients and 125 healthy controls was isolated using the salting out method. The genotyping of two polymorphisms of HLA-G (+3142G>C and 14 bp ins/del) was done by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR method, respectively. Levels of sHLA-G were estimated by ELISA and disease activity was calculated by disease activity score (DAS28-ESR). Results: The HLA-G +3142G>C polymorphism was found to be associated with a decreased risk of RA as attributed to recessive inheritance tested model results (OR = 0.4, 95%C.I. = 0.2-0.9, p = .0313*, GG + GC versus CC). Our finding did not support an association between HLA-G 14 bp ins/del variant and risk/protection of RA. The sHLA-G levels were significantly lower in +3142GG and +3142GC RA patients as compared to healthy controls. Conclusion: HLA-G +3142G>C gene polymorphism might decrease the risk of occurrence of RA in our sample cohort as +3142CC genotype is associated with increased sHLA-G levels. Units: soluble HLA-G: Units/mL {U/mL}

AB  - Background: Comparison between various approaches of ultrasound (USG)-guided internal jugular vein cannulation, that is, short-axis out-of-plane approach, long-axis in-plane approach, and oblique-axis approach, is sparse. In this network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, all three approaches were evaluated to identify the best technique for USG-guided internal jugular vein cannulation. Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing short-axis out-of-plane approach, long-axis in-plane approach, and oblique-axis approach in any combination (i.e. comparison of any two or all three) for USG-guided internal jugular vein cannulation were included in this meta-analysis. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted with a non-informative prior effect size and heterogeneity, and all results were reported as posterior median odds ratio with 95% credible interval. Results: Data of 658 patients from five randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. No difference was obtained in first attempt success rate of cannulation in three approaches (posterior median odds ratio between long-axis and short-axis view, oblique-axis and short-axis view, and long-axis and oblique-axis view were 0.67 (0.20, 2.08), 0.92 (0.09, 4.790), and 1.3420 (0.1680, 6.7820), respectively). No difference was seen in the incidence of carotid artery puncture and overall success rate of cannulation. Conclusion: All three commonly used approaches for USG-guided internal jugular vein cannulation, that is, short axis, long axis, and oblique axis, are comparable in terms of clinical utility and safety. There is insufficient evidence to recommend one approach over another for this purpose.

AB  - Background: Vitamin B-12 deficiency owing to a vegetarian diet is common in India and is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of vitamin B-12 deficiency in infants aged 1-12 months and to correlate the results with neurodevelopment. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 200 infants aged 1-12 months presenting to the emergency department or ward and requiring blood sampling or intravenous cannulation was undertaken in a tertiary-care centre of Northern India. Patients' serum vitamin B-12 levels were correlated with Denver development screening test II (DDST II). Results: Of 200 infants recruited, 43 (22%) were vitamin B-12-deficient (<211 pg/ml). After excluding 16 (8%) infants who were unsuitable for DDST screening, 21/39 (54%) and 22/145 (15%) were DDST-suspect in the vitamin B-12-deficient and sufficient groups, respectively (p = 0.0001). There was a statistically significant correlation between B-12 deficiency and an abnormal DDST (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: In India, vitamin B-12 deficiency is prevalent in infancy and is associated with neurodevelopmental delay.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
KW  - OUTCOMES
KW  - CYCLE
AB  - Background Rituximab is increasingly being used as an adjuvant treatment for recalcitrant or relapsed pemphigus, but information on its use as a first-line agent is limited. We describe the long-term effectiveness and safety of rituximab in the treatment of pemphigus and compare the treatment outcomes when rituximab is used as first-line treatment vis-a-vis after treatment failure or relapse. Methods This was a retrospective review of 61 patients with pemphigus treated with rituximab at our center from March 2012 to October 2018. Results Of the 61 patients, 51 achieved complete remission (on or off treatment) and 10 had partial remission. Forty-nine (80.33%) patients achieved complete remission off prednisolone over a mean period of 8.08 +/- 4.45 (range 3-20) months. Seventeen (27.9%) patients relapsed after a mean period of 23.94 +/- 13.15 months after first rituximab cycle and 15.97 + 13.7 months after stopping prednisolone. Treatment-related serious adverse effects were noted in six (9.8%) patients. Eighteen (29.5%) patients were administered rituximab as the first-line adjuvant, while 43 (70.5%) patients received it after treatment failure or relapse. In both groups, remission rates on prednisolone (88.9%, 81.4%) and off prednisolone (88.9%, 76.7%) were comparable (P > 0.05). Relapse rates in the group which received rituximab as first-line treatment were about half of those who received rituximab after relapse or treatment failure (16.7% vs. 32.6%, P = 0.348). No statistically significant difference was seen in the times to different treatment endpoints (disease control, complete remission on and off prednisolone, and relapse) between the two groups. Conclusions Rituximab is a safe and effective adjuvant in the treatment of pemphigus. Treatment outcomes were better for patients who received rituximab as first-line treatment, but the difference was not statistically significant.

AB  - A large number of hazardous chemicals have entered the environment due to the rapid growth of urbanisation and industrial development and are exerting harmful effects on wildlife as well as on human health. Plastic materials are one of the most leading causes for this contamination which are widely used in daily activities of human beings, i.e. disposal purpose, food packaging, bottles, containers, cups, grocery bags, etc. These materials contain Bisphenol A (BPA) and Bis-sulphone (BIS) which have been recognised as potential endocrine disruptors. In the present study, a selective and reliable high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) based method was developed with the mobile phase of 10 mM ammonium acetate buffer-acetonitrile (58:42 v/v, pH: 5) using quality by design (QbD) approach and the method was validated for the simultaneous assessment of BPA and BIS. The method was observed with a good linearity range of 50-500 ng/mL with an r(2) value of 0.998 and 0.999 for BPA and BIS, respectively. The developed and validated method was applied for the estimation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals in sewage water and soil samples. The results showed a considerable amount of BPA and BIS in the samples. This preliminary data explored the presence of BPA and BIS in these environmental samples that give the primary awareness of the effluence of BPA and BIS in the environment.

AB  - Diaphragmatic rupture is the tear of the diaphragm muscle result from blunt or penetrating trauma and occurs in about 5% of cases of severe blunt trauma. Both finite element (FE) modelling and experimental testing have enhanced our understanding of the injury mechanisms associated with diaphragmatic rupture. A constitutive model for human diaphragm tissue is developed and implemented via user subroutine (UMAT) in LS Dyna that accounts for the strain rate-dependent effects and bilinear behaviour observed experimentally. To better understand the material properties of the human diaphragm, 16 dynamic tensile tests were conducted at three different strain rates of 65/s, 130/s and 190/s from six whole human diaphragms. The engineering stress-strain relationship obtained from these tests showed a bilinear behaviour and strain rate dependency. A strain rate-dependent bilinear stress-strain model was developed, and its parameters were optimised using a genetic algorithm-based inverse characterization method. The results demonstrate a good correlation between experiments and the model, with an average difference of 2 +/- 2.8% (mean +/- SD) between the optimised FE and experimental load-time curves. The material parameters found in this study can be used in dynamic simulations using FE models of diaphragm tissues.
