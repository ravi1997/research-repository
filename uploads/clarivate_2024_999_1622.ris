AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided multiple injection costotransverse block (MICB) and compare it with erector spinae plane block (ESPB) for poststernotomy pain relief in pediatric cardiac surgical patients. Design: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, comparative study. Setting: At a single institution tertiary referral cardiac center. Participants: A total of 90 children with acyanotic congenital heart disease requiring surgery via sternotomy. Interventions: Children were allocated randomly to 1 of the 3 following groups: ESPB (group 1), MICB (group 2), or Control (group 3). Participants in groups 1 and 2 received 4 mg/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine for bilateral ultrasound-guided block after induction of anesthesia. Postoperatively, intravenous paracetamol was used for multimodal analgesia, and fentanyl/tramadol was used for rescue analgesia. Measurements and Main Results: The modified objective pain score (MOPS) was evaluated at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours postextubation. After all exclusions, 84 patients were analyzed. The MOPS score was found to be significantly lower in ESPB and MICB groups compared to the control group until 10 hours postextubation (p < 0.05), with no statistically significant difference at the 12th hour (p = 0.2198). The total intraoperative fentanyl consumption (p = 0.0005), need for fentanyl supplementation on incision (p < 0.0001), and need for rescue opioid requirement in the postoperative period (p = 0.034) were significantly lower in both the ESPB and MICB groups than the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in both primary and secondary outcomes between the ESPB and MICB groups. Conclusion: Ultrasound-guided MICB was effective and comparable to ESPB for post-sternotomy pain management in pediatric cardiac surgical patients. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) is a member of the F-box family of substrate-recognition subunits in the SCF ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes. It is associated with ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the mammalian cell cycle components and other target proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and transcription. Being an oncogene in solid tumors and hematological malignancies, it is frequently associated with drug resistance and poor disease outcomes. In the current review, we discussed the novel role of SKP2 in different hematological malignancies. Further, we performed a limited in-silico analysis to establish the involvement of SKP2 in a few publicly available cancer datasets. Interestingly, our study identified Skp2 expression to be altered in a cancer-specific manner. While it was found to be overexpressed in several cancer types, few cancer showed a down-regulation in SKP2. Our review provides evidence for developing novel SKP2 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. We also investigated the effect of SKP2 status on survival and disease progression. In addition, the role of miRNA and its associated families in regulating Skp2 expression was explored. Subsequently, we predicted common miRNAs against Skp2 genes by using miRNA-predication tools. Finally, we discussed current approaches and future prospective approaches to target the Skp2 gene by using different drugs and miRNA-based therapeutics applications in translational research.

T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a spinocerebellar degenerative disease caused by microsatellite (GAA.TTC)n repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN gene. Here, we developed iPSC lines from an FRDA patient (IGIBi016-A) and non-FRDA healthy control (IGIBi017-A). Both iPSC lines displayed typical iPSC morphology, expression of pluripotency markers, regular karyotypes (46, XY; 46, XX), capacity to grow into three germ layers, and FRDA hallmark -GAA repeat expansion and decreased FXN mRNA. Through these iPSC lines, FRDA phenotypes may be replicated in the in vitro assays, by creating neuron subtypes, cardiomyocytes and 3D organoids, for molecular and cellular biomarkers and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Background and objective: Radio-frequency ablation (RFA)-mediated thermosensitive liposomes (TSL) drug delivery promotes loco-regional drug delivery, simultaneously reducing systemic toxicity. However, the heterogeneous intratumoral microenvironment, such as non-uniformly distributed microvascular network, extracellular matrix, intracellular space, disproportionate blood flow through tumor microvessels, and disparate extracellular diffusion impedes the transport of intravenously administered TSL, significantly affecting therapeutic efficacy. The current study is focused on elucidating the effect of aforementioned tumor microenvironment heterogeneities on TSL drug delivery outcomes, which remains unexplored.
   Methods: Different tumor heterogeneities, namely blood flow, extracellular drug diffusion, microvascular, extracellular and intracellular volume fractions, and 3D brain tumor geometry, are extracted using advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. The extracted patient-specific information is incorporated in the bioheat-fluid-mass transport coupled solver developed in OpenFOAM to numerically predict the effect of each heterogeneity on drug delivery efficacy and compare with homogeneous scenarios.
   Results: A significant underestimation of 70-72% in free drug and TSL extracellular concentrations and 56% in intracellular drug concentration is observed when using homogeneous properties compared to complete heterogeneous. Further, microvascular and extracellular volume fractions significantly affect the drug distribution patterns of the four heterogeneities, with blood flow and drug diffusion contributing the least.
   Conclusions: The current study highlights the need to incorporate patient-specific tumor microenvironment heterogeneities in future modeling studies to predict the therapeutic outcomes of hyperthermia-related drug delivery treatments.

AB  - BackgroundCancer survivors experience a decrement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) resulting from the disease as well as adverse effects of therapy. We evaluated the HRQoL of cancer patients, stratified by primary cancer site, stage, treatment response and associated adverse events, along with its determinants. MethodsData were collected from 12,148 patients, sampled from seven purposively chosen leading cancer hospitals in India, to elicit HRQoL using the EuroQol questionnaire comprising of 5-dimensions and 5-levels (EQ-5D-5L). Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between HRQoL and various socio-demographic as well as clinical characteristics. ResultsMajority outpatients (78.4%) and inpatients (81.2%) had solid cancers. The disease was found to be more prevalent among outpatients (37.5%) and inpatients (40.5%) aged 45-60 years and females (49.3-58.3%). Most patients were found to be in stage III (40-40.6%) or stage IV (29.4-37.3%) at the time of recruitment. The mean EQ-5D-5 L utility score was significantly higher among outpatients [0.630 (95% CI: 0.623, 0.637)] as compared to inpatients [0.553 (95% CI: 0.539, 0.567)]. The HRQoL decreased with advancing cancer stage among both inpatients and outpatients, respectively [stage IV: (0.516 & 0.557); stage III (0.609 & 0.689); stage II (0.677 & 0.713); stage I (0.638 & 0.748), p value < 0.001]. The outpatients on hormone therapy (B = 0.076) showed significantly better HRQoL in comparison to patients on chemotherapy. However, palliative care (B=-0.137) and surgery (B=-0.110) were found to be associated with significantly with poorer HRQoL paralleled to chemotherapy. The utility scores among outpatients ranged from 0.305 (bone cancer) to 0.782 (Leukemia). Among hospitalized cases, the utility score was lowest for multiple myeloma (0.255) and highest for testicular cancer (0.771). ConclusionOlder age, lower educational status, chemotherapy, palliative care and surgery, advanced cancer stage and progressive disease were associated with poor HRQoL. Our study findings will be useful in optimising patient care, formulating individualized treatment plan, improving compliance and follow-up.

AB  - Cancer treatment is challenged due to immunosuppressive inflammatory tumour microenvironment (TME) caused by infiltration of tumour-promoting and inhibition of tumour-inhibiting immune cells. Here, we report the engineering of chimeric nanomicelles (NMs) targeting the cell proliferation using docetaxel (DTX) and inflammation using dexamethasone (DEX) that alters the immunosuppressive TME. We show that a combination of phospholipid-DTX conjugate and PEGylated-lipid-DEX conjugate can self-assemble to form sub-100 nm chimeric NMs (DTX-DEX NMs). Anti-cancer activities against syngeneic and xenograft mouse models showed that the DTX-DEX NMs are more effective in tumour regression, enhance the survival of mice over other treatment modes, and alter the tumour stroma. DTX-DEX NMs cause a significant reduction in myeloid-derived suppressor cells, alter the polarization of macrophages, and enhance the accumulation of cytotoxic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumour tissues, along with alterations in cytokine expression. We further demonstrated that these DTX-DEX NMs inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins, especially PGE2, by targeting the cyclooxygenase 2 that is partly responsible for immunosuppressive TME. Therefore, this study presents, for the first time, the engineering of lithocholic acid-derived chimeric NMs that affect the prostaglandin pathway, alter the TME, and mitigate tumour progression with enhanced mice survival.

AB  - Sepsis is a dysregulated inflammatory response leading to multiple organ failure. Current methods of sepsis detection are time-consuming, involving nonspecific clinical signs, biomarkers, and blood cultures. Hence, efficient and rapid sepsis detection platforms are of utmost need for immediate antibiotic treatment. In the current study, a noninvasive rapid monitoring electrochemical sensing (ECS) platform was developed for the detection and classification of plasma samples of patients with liver cirrhosis by measuring the current peak shifts using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique. A total of 61 hospitalized cirrhotic patients with confirmed (culture-positive) or suspected (culture-negative) sepsis were enrolled. The presence of bacteria in the plasma was observed by growth kinetics, and for rapidness, the samples were co-encapsulated in microscaffolds with carbon nanodots that were sensitive enough to detect redox changes occurring due to the change in the pH of the surrounding medium, causing shifts in current peaks in the voltammograms within 2 h. The percentage area under the curve for confirmed infections was 94 and that with suspected cases was 87 in comparison to 69 and 71 with PCT, respectively. Furthermore, the charge was measured for class identification. The charge for LPS-absent bacteria ranged from -400 to -600 mu C, whereas the charge for LPS-containing bacteria class ranged from -290 to -300 mu C. Thus, the developed cost-effective system was sensitive enough to detect and identify bacterial sepsis.

TI  - Negative Regulator of Reactive Oxygen Species-Related Microgliopathy
T2  - NEUROLOGY
AB  - A 21-month-old boy presented with regression of milestones since the onset of epileptic spasms at the age of 12 months, with an uneventful perinatal period. Examination revealed microcephaly, disc pallor, and spasticity. Neuroimaging showed intracranial calcifications, diffuse cerebral atrophy, corpus callosum thinning, and nonspecific white matter hyperintensities (Figure 1). Common differentials for this imaging pattern encompass congenital TORCH infection, Aicardi Gouti & egrave;res syndrome, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and Cockayne syndrome.1 EEG showed a burst-suppression variant of hypsarrhythmia (Figure 2). Next-generation sequencing yielded a homozygous, likely pathogenic variant c.716del (p.Glu239GlyfsTer72) in exon 3 of the NRROS gene. Negative regulator of reactive oxygen species-related microgliopathy is an autosomal recessive condition presenting in late infancy with drug-refractory epilepsy, commonly epileptic spasms with intracranial calcifications and neurodegeneration.2 It facilitates activation of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in the microglia, essential for neuronal growth, survival, and differentiation. Despite treatment with steroids, vigabatrin, and multiple antiseizure medications, the spasms often persist.

AB  - Purpose The use of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy has become increasingly recognized as a viable therapeutic approach for patients in the advanced stages of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, there is limited data regarding its effectiveness and safety in earlier lines. This study aims to present our institution's experience with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 as a first-line systemic therapy for mCRPC. Methods We collected and analyzed data from consecutive mCRPC patients who underwent first-line treatment with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 at our center from 2015 to 2023. The various outcome measures included best prostate-specific antigen-response rate (PSA-RR) (proportion of patients achieving a >= 50% decline in PSA); objective radiographic response rate (ORR) (proportion of patients achieving complete or partial radiographic responses); radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (measured from treatment initiation until radiographic progression or death from any cause); overall survival (OS) (measured from treatment initiation until death from any cause); and adverse events. Results Forty treatment-na & iuml;ve mCRPC patients with PSMA-positive disease on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were included (median age: 68.5 years, range: 45-78; median PSA: 41 ng/mL, range: 1-3028). These patients received a median cumulative activity of 22.2 GBq (range: 5.55-44.4) [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 over 1-6 cycles at 8-12 week intervals. A >= 50% decline in PSA was observed in 25/40 (62.5%) patients (best PSA-RR). Radiographic responses were evaluated for thirty-eight patients, with thirteen showing partial responses (ORR 34.2%). Over a median follow-up of 36 months, the median rPFS was 12 months (95% confidence interval, CI: 9-15), and the median OS was 17 months (95% CI: 12-22). Treatment-emergent grade >= 3 anemia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia were noted in 4/40 (10%), 1/40 (2.5%), and 3/40 (7.5%) patients, respectively. Conclusion The findings suggest that [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 is a safe and effective option as a first-line treatment in mCRPC. Further trials are needed to definitively establish its role as an upfront treatment modality in this setting.

AB  - BackgroundNovel interfascial plane blocks like PEricapsular Nerve Group (PENG) and SupraInguinal Fascia Iliaca (SIFI) blocks are effective for management of hip fracture pain. We compared the difference in the distribution of the dye injected and nerves stained by the addition of the SIFI block to the PENG block.MethodsA total of 24 designated dye injections were performed in eight soft-embalmed cadavers. Under ultrasound guidance 20 ml green ink injected bilaterally in PENG block and 30 ml methylene blue dye was injected in the SIFI block on the right side. The cadavers were dissected 24 h later to assess the extent of dye spread.ResultsExtensive spread of dyes was seen on both side of iliacus muscle on the right side, but blue dye was not visible medial to the psoas tendon. The subcostal and iliohypogastric nerves were stained green in the infra-inguinal region. On the left side (PENG alone), the anterior division of the obturator, femoral and saphenous nerve (7/8) and iliohypogastric nerves (3/8) were stained in the infrainguinal region. In the suprainguinal region, the femoral nerve (5/8), accessory obturator nerve (3/8), lateral femoral cutaneous (1/8) and nerve to rectus femoris (4/8) were stained. The main obturator nerve trunk was spared with both injections while its anterior branch and accessory obturator nerve were stained with the PENG injection.ConclusionThe study findings indicate that combined PENG + SIFI injections lead to an extensive craniocaudal and longitudinal spread along the iliacus muscle. We perceive that the combination of these two injections will have a superior clinical outcome.

AB  - Addiction medicine is a dynamic field that encompasses clinical practice and research in the context of societal, economic, and cultural factors at the local, national, regional, and global levels. This field has evolved profoundly during the past decades in terms of scopes and activities with the contribution of addiction medicine scientists and professionals globally. The dynamic nature of drug addiction at the global level has resulted in a crucial need for developing an international collaborative network of addiction societies, treatment programs and experts to monitor emerging national, regional, and global concerns. This protocol paper presents methodological details of running longitudinal surveys at national, regional, and global levels through the Global Expert Network of the International Society of Addiction Medicine (ISAM-GEN). The initial formation of the network with a recruitment phase and a round of snowball sampling provided 354 experts from 78 countries across the globe. In addition, 43 national/regional addiction societies/associations are also included in the database. The surveys will be developed by global experts in addiction medicine on treatment services, service coverage, co-occurring disorders, treatment standards and barriers, emerging addictions and/or dynamic changes in treatment needs worldwide. Survey participants in categories of (1) addiction societies/associations, (2) addiction treatment programs, (3) addiction experts/clinicians and (4) related stakeholders will respond to these global longitudinal surveys. The results will be analyzed and cross-examined with available data and peer-reviewed for publication.

AB  - Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (EC. 2.7.7.3, PPAT) catalyzes the penultimate step of the multistep reaction in the coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis pathway. In this step, an adenylyl group from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is transferred to 4 '-phosphopantetheine (PNS) yielding 3 '-dephospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA) and pyrophosphate (PPi). PPAT from strain C3 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpPPAT) was cloned, expressed and purified. It was crystallized using 0.1 M HEPES buffer and PEG10000 at pH 7.5. The crystals belonged to tetragonal space group P41212 with cell dimensions of a = b = 72.82 angstrom and c = 200.37 angstrom. The structure was determined using the molecular replacement method and refined to values of 0.208 and 0.255 for Rcryst and Rfree factors, respectively. The structure determination showed the presence of three crystallographically independent molecules A, B and C in the asymmetric unit. The molecules A and B are observed in the form of a dimer in the asymmetric unit while molecule C belongs to the second dimer whose partner is related by crystallographic twofold symmetry. The polypeptide chain of KpPPAT folds into a beta/alpha structure. The conformations of the side chains of several residues in the substrate binding site in KpPPAT are significantly different from those reported in other PPATs. As a result, the modes of binding of substrates, phosphopantetheine (PNS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) differ considerably. The binding studies using fluorescence spectroscopy indicated a KD value of 3.45 x 10-4 M for ATP which is significantly lower than the corresponding values reported for PPAT from other species.

AB  - IntroductionDespite extensive research, comprehensive characterization of leukaemic stem cells (LSC) and information on their immunophenotypic differences from normal haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is lacking. Herein, we attempted to unravel the immunophenotypic (IPT) characteristics and heterogeneity of LSC using multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) and single-cell sequencing. Materials and MethodsBone marrow aspirate samples from patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were evaluated using MFC at diagnostic and post induction time points using a single tube-10-colour-panel containing LSC-associated antibodies CD123, CD45RA, CD44, CD33 and COMPOSITE (CLL-1, TIM-3, CD25, CD11b, CD22, CD7, CD56) with backbone markers that is, CD45, CD34, CD38, CD117, sCD3. Single-cell sequencing of the whole transcriptome was also done in a bone marrow sample. ResultsLSCs and HSCs were identified in 225/255 (88.2%) and 183/255 (71.6%) samples, respectively. Significantly higher expression was noted for COMPOSITE, CD45RA, CD123, CD33, and CD44 in LSCs than HSCs (p < 0.0001). On comparing the LSC specific antigen expressions between CD34+ (n = 184) and CD34- LSCs (n = 41), no difference was observed between the groups. More than one sub-population of LSC was demonstrated in 4.4% of cases, which further revealed high concordance between MFC and single cell transcriptomic analysis in one of the cases displaying three LSC subpopulations by both methods. ConclusionA single tube-10-colour MFC panel is proposed as an easy and reproducible tool to identify and discriminate LSCs from HSCs. LSCs display both inter- and intra-sample heterogeneity in terms of antigen expressions, which opens the facets for single cell molecular analysis to elucidate the role of subpopulations of LSCs in AML progression.

AB  - Coronary artery disease (CAD) has a high mortality rate. Despite various therapeutic targets, non-responsiveness to drugs remains a prevalent issue. Pharmacogenomics assesses the way an individual's genetic attributes affect their likely response to drug therapy. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms play a crucial role in determining these outcomes. This review offers an overview of single-nucleotide polymorphisms investigated in clinical studies and their associations with drug response/nonresponse in the treatment of CAD. A total of 104 studies of whole sets of chromosomes and several genes were explored. A total of 161 polymorphisms exhibited associations with drug response/nonresponse in CAD across diverse ethnic populations. This pool can serve as a pharmacogenomic biomarker for predicting response to drug therapy in patients with CAD.

TI  - Vaccination coverage against COVID-19 among rural population in Haryana, India: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - PREVALENCE
KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Background Conducting a study in rural pre-dominant areas will help to understand the penetration of the vaccination campaign during the COVID-19 health crisis. This study aimed to investigate vaccination coverage against COVID-19 among the rural adult population in India and to identify factors associated with vaccination coverage.Methods A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the rural population in one district of north India from January to February 2023. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed on the SurveyMonkey digital platform for interviewing the participants, which consisted of questions related to socio-demographic profile, health problems, vaccination status, types of vaccine, re-infection after vaccination, and functional difficulties. The data regarding infection with COVID-19 was collected based on self-reported positive testing for SARS-CoV 2 on RT-PCR.Findings A total of 3700 eligible individuals were enumerated for the survey, out of which 2954 (79.8%) were interviewed. The infection rate of past COVID-19 infection, based on self-report of testing positive, was 6.2% (95%CI: 5.3-7.1). Covishield vaccine was received by most participants (81.3%, 2380) followed by Covaxin (12.3%, 361) and Pfizer manufactured vaccine (0.03,1). The coverage for first, second, and booster doses of the vaccine was 98.2% (2902), 94.8% (2802), and 10.7% (315) respectively. The risk of reinfection at 12 months or more among participants with two doses of vaccine was 1.6% (46/2802, 95%CI: 1.2-2.1). The coverage among those with severe functional difficulties was lesser as compared to those with some or no difficulties.Interpretation Vaccination coverage against COVID-19 in rural Haryana, India is not dependent on factors like gender or occupation but is dependent on age and education. Although the full and partial vaccination coverage is high, the booster dose coverage is poor. In addition, the presence of severe disability was significantly associated with reduced vaccination coverage.

AB  - - INTRODUCTION: This survey was conducted to explore the perceptions of undergraduate (UG) medical students regarding enrolling in a neurosurgical training program. The purpose was to understand ' expectations, reasons, apprehensions, and variables influencing students ' decisions to pursue a career in neurosurgery. The results shed light on students ' perceptions and can help educational institutions and training programs draw in and encourage aspiring neurosurgeons. - METHODS: A 35-point online questionnaire was created using Google Forms (Google LLC) after content and face validation and circulated using social media platforms among various public medical colleges across India. Responses were collected over a period of 3 months, from February 2023 to April 2023. A 5-point Likert scale was used to collect the responses wherever applicable. - RESULTS: A total of 1042 respondents from 47 medical colleges completed the survey. The majority of the students were not exposed to neurosurgery during their UG program, but despite this, 60.1% (n = 627) were willing to consider it as their career option. Around 91.4% of the respondents perceived neurosurgery to be a challenging but prestigious specialty that has a long learning curve and the worst work-life balance when compared with other specialties. The majority of the respondents (strongly disagree = 24.3%, n = 253; disagree = 31.7%, n = 330) did not view neurosurgery as a male-dominated specialty. Most students preferred a 6-year training program over a 3-year program ( P = 0.001) if their medical college had such a course. - CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that although a majority of the UG students would like to join neurosurgery residency, there are significant barriers in the form of less exposure, negative perceptions, and apprehensions toward the branch. Enhancing medical students ' awareness about neurosurgery necessitates the integration of hands-on workshops, simulation-based training, didactic lectures, and neurosurgery rotations into the UG curriculum.

AB  - Curcumin is known for its antioxidant properties. This study aimed to investigate the impact of curcumin on acrylamide (ACR)-induced alterations in the first-line antioxidant defense of ovarian tissue. Female Balb/c mice were divided into control, ACR (50 mg/kg), ACR/CUR100 (received Acr + curcumin100 mg/kg), and ACR/CUR200 (Acr + curcumin 200 mg/kg) groups, and received oral treatments for 35 days. Evaluation of antioxidant enzyme expression (Sod, Cat, Gpx genes), pro-apoptotic gene expressions (Bax, Caspase 3), and anti-apoptotic gene expression (Bcl2l1) at mRNA and protein levels was done. Percentage of apoptotic cells using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed. The model group (ACR) showed decreased mRNA expression of Sod, Cat, and Gpx genes compared with the control group. Treatment with two different doses of curcumin (CUR100 and CUR200) significantly increased Sod, Cat, and Gpx gene expression, with CUR200 demonstrating significant recovery. SOD, CAT, and GPX protein levels were similar to mRNA expression trends, significantly increased with curcumin administration. Acrylamide exposure significantly increased Bax and Caspase 3 expression and decreased Bcl2l1 gene expression leading to a notable rise in apoptosis in ACR group as compared to the control group. Conversely, curcumin administration, significantly reduced Bax and Caspase 3 expressions, with an increase in Bcl2l1expression, though not statistically significant. TUNEL assay revealed a substantial decrease in apoptosis in curcumin-received groups. In our study, ACR exposure adversely affected ovarian antioxidant defense thereby leading to increased pro-apoptotic markers. Notably, curcumin treatment effectively mitigated these effects, restored antioxidant potential, and reduced acrylamide-induced toxicity in female mouse ovaries.
   The issue of whether and how acrylamide intake affects human health and fertility status, has recently attracted considerable attention. The purpose of this study was to determine whether curcumin treatment, as a potential antioxidant, impacts ACR-induced alterations in the first-line antioxidant defense and apoptosis in the mouse ovarian tissues.image

AB  - BackgroundSurvival outcomes for multiple myeloma have improved dramatically since the introduction of novel therapeutic agents. While these drugs are highly effective in improving survival outcomes and quality of life in patients with multiple myeloma, they come at a significant cost. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of bortezomib-based triplet or quadruplet drug regimens in isolation and followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) in the Indian context.MethodsA Markov model was developed to assess the health and economic outcomes of novel drug regimens with and without AHSCT for the treatment of NDMM in India. We estimated the lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs in each scenario. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed and compared against the current willingness-to-pay threshold of a one-time per capita gross domestic product of 146,890 (US$1,927.70) for India. Parameter uncertainty was assessed through Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis.ResultsAmong seven treatment sequences, the VCd (bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone) alone arm has the lowest cost and health benefits as compared to four treatment sequences, namely VTd (bortezomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) alone, VRd (bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) alone, VRd plus AHSCT and DVRd (Daratumumab, bortezomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone) plus AHSCT. It was found that VTd plus AHSCT and VCd plus AHSCT arms were extendedly dominated (ED) by combination of two alternative treatments. Among the five non-dominated strategies, VRd has a lowest incremental cost of 2,20,093 (US$2,888) per QALY gained compared to VTd alone followed by VRd plus AHSCT [3,14,530 (US$4,128) per QALY gained] in comparison to VRd alone. None of the novel treatment sequences were found to be cost-effective at the current WTP threshold of 1,46,890 (US$1,927.7).ConclusionAt the current WTP threshold of one-time per capita GDP ( 146,890) of India, VRd alone and VRd plus AHSCT has 38.1% and 6.9% probability to be cost-effective, respectively. Reduction in current reimbursement rates of novel drugs, namely VRd, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide plus dexamethasone under national insurance program and societal cost of transplant by 50%, would make VRd plus AHSCT and VTd plus AHSCT cost-effective at an incremental cost of 40,671 (US$34) and 97,639 (US$1,281) per QALY gained, respectively.

AB  - Intravenous injection of capsaicin produces vagal-mediated protective cardio-pulmonary (CP) reflexes manifesting as tachypnea, bradycardia, and triphasic blood pressure (BP) response in anesthetized rats. Particulate matter from diesel engine exhaust has been reported to attenuate these reflexes. However, the effects of gaseous constituents of diesel exhaust are not known. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the effects of gaseous pollutants in diesel exhaust, on capsaicin-induced CP reflexes in rat model. Adult male rats were randomly assigned to three groups: Non-exposed (NE) group, filtered diesel exhaust-exposed (FDE) group and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)-treated FDE group. FDE group of rats (n = 6) were exposed to filtered diesel exhaust for 5 h a day for 5 days (D1-D5), and were taken for dissection on day 6 (D6), while NE group of rats (n = 6) remained unexposed. On D6, rats were anesthetized, following which jugular vein was cannulated for injection of chemicals, and femoral artery was cannulated to record the BP. Lead II electrocardiogram and respiratory movements were also recorded. Results show that intravenous injection of capsaicin (0.1 ml; 10 mu g/kg) produced immediate tachypneic, hyperventilatory, hypotensive, and bradycardiac responses in both NE and FDE groups of rats. However, these capsaicin-induced CP responses were significantly attenuated in FDE group as compared to the NE group of rats. Further, FDE-induced attenuation of capsaicin-evoked CP responses were diminished in the N-acetyl cysteine-treated FDE rats. These findings demonstrate that oxidant stress mechanisms could possibly be involved in inhibition of CP reflexes by gaseous pollutants in diesel engine exhaust.

AB  - Aims: Synovial sarcoma is a rare but aggressive variant of soft-tissue sarcoma. Literature is sparse and reported mostly from the West. We analysed the clinical pro files and prognostic factors of extremity synovial sarcoma patients in order to study their clinical journey. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective analysis. All patients with extremity synovial sarcoma treated between 1992 and 2020 were included. Patients with metastases at presentation were excluded. A descriptive analysis of demographic and clinicopathological features of patients undergoing limb salvage surgery (LSS) or amputation was carried out. Overall survival and disease-free survival were calculated for the entire cohort as well as for the LSS and amputation groups. Factors prognostic for survival were identified. Results: In total, 157 patients had localised extremity synovial sarcoma. Predominantly, young adults (median 31 years) and males (61%) were affected. Over 70% of patients presented after recurrence or unplanned surgeries. Sixty-seven per cent of tumours were >5 cm, 69% were deep and 23% involved bone. The limb salvage rate was 64%. In the LSS group, adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy were given to 72% and 68% of patients, respectively. In the amputation group, 72% of patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. In a median follow-up of 59 months, 39.4% of patients had recurrences, the majority (61.2%) were systemic. Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 53.4% and 49.8%, respectively. Overall survival was 63.9% and 29.7% in the LSS and amputation groups, respectively. On multivariate analysis, tumour size, depth, omission of radiotherapy and bone invasion were found to be the adverse prognostic factors. Conclusion: This is one of the largest studies on extremity synovial sarcoma. Mostly males and young adults were affected. The limb salvage rate was 64%, despite most being referred after unplanned surgery. Almost 70% of patients received radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Overall survival was inferior in the amputation group. Tumour size >5 cm, depth and bone invasion were negative, whereas adjuvant radiotherapy was a positive prognostic factor for survival. Chemotherapy had no impact on survival. (c) 2024 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Delirium is a common complication in hospitalized older adults with multifactorial etiology and poor health outcomes. Aim: To determine the frequency and predictors of delirium and its short-term and long-term outcomes in hospitalized older adults. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed in patients aged >= 60 years consecutively admitted to geriatric ward. Potential risk factors were assessed within 24 hours of hospital admission. Delirium screening was performed on admission and daily thereafter throughout the hospital stay using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Patients were followed up at 1-year post-discharge. Results: The study included 200 patients with mean age 73.1 +/- 8.83 years. Incidence and prevalence rate of delirium were 5% and 20% respectively. Multivariable regression analysis revealed emergency admission (OR=5.12 (1.94-13.57), p=0.001), functional dependency (Katz index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living (Katz-ADL) score <5) 2 weeks before admission (OR=3.08 (1.30-7.33), p=0.011) and more psychopathological symptoms (higher Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total score) (OR=1.12 (1.06-1.18), p=0.001) to be independently associated with delirium. Patients in delirium group had significantly high in-hospital mortality (OR=5.02 (2.12-11.8), p=0.001) and post-discharge mortality (HR=2.02 (1.13-3.61), p=0.017) and functional dependency (Katz-ADL score <5) (OR=5.45 (1.49-19.31), p=0.01) at 1-year follow up. Conclusion: Delirium is quite frequent in geriatric inpatients and is associated with high in-hospital and post- discharge mortality risk and long-term functional dependency. Emergency admission, pre-hospitalization func-tional dependency, and more general psychopathological symptoms are independently associated factors. Hence, earliest identification and treatment with early implementation of rehabilitation services is warranted.

AB  - Bloodstream infections are associated with high mortality, which can be reduced by targeted antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection. Direct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) from flagged positive blood cultures may facilitate the administration of early effective antimicrobials much before the routine AST. This study aimed to evaluate three different direct AST protocols for Gram-negative rods from flagged positive blood culture broths. Blood culture broths showing Gram-negative rods only were subjected to direct AST by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended direct disk diffusion (protocol A). Additionally, automated AST (protocol B) and Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (protocol C) were performed with standard inoculum prepared from bacterial pellets obtained by centrifuging blood culture broths in serum separator vials. For comparison, conventional AST of isolates from solid media subculture was also performed with Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (reference standard) and the automated method. Overall, categorical agreements of protocols A, B, and C were 97.6%, 95.7%, and 95.9%, respectively. Among Enterobacterales, minor error, major error, and very major error rates of protocol B were 3.5%, 0.36%, and 0.43%, respectively, whereas minor error, major error, and very major error rates of protocol C were 3.4%, 0.72%, and 0.21%, respectively, and among non-fermenters, protocol B had a minor error rate of 6.5%, and protocol C had a minor error rate of 4.1% and major error rate of 1.9%. All three direct AST protocols demonstrated excellent categorical agreements with the reference method. Performance of protocols B and C between Enterobacterales and non-fermenters was not statistically different.IMPORTANCEBloodstream infections are associated with high mortality that can be reduced by targeted antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection. Direct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) from flagged positive blood cultures may facilitate the administration of early effective antimicrobials much before the routine AST. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended direct AST can be performed with a limited number of antibiotic disks only. On the other hand, using an automated system for direct AST will not only allow effective laboratory workflow with reduced turnaround time but also provide the minimum inhibitory concentration values of tested antibiotics. However, using expensive automated systems for direct AST may not be feasible for resource-limited laboratories. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the CLSI-recommended method and two other direct AST protocols (one with an automated system and the other with disk diffusion) for Gram-negative rods from flagged positive blood cultures.
   Bloodstream infections are associated with high mortality that can be reduced by targeted antibiotic therapy in the early stages of infection. Direct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) from flagged positive blood cultures may facilitate the administration of early effective antimicrobials much before the routine AST. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended direct AST can be performed with a limited number of antibiotic disks only. On the other hand, using an automated system for direct AST will not only allow effective laboratory workflow with reduced turnaround time but also provide the minimum inhibitory concentration values of tested antibiotics. However, using expensive automated systems for direct AST may not be feasible for resource-limited laboratories. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the CLSI-recommended method and two other direct AST protocols (one with an automated system and the other with disk diffusion) for Gram-negative rods from flagged positive blood cultures.

AB  - The therapeutic potential of the human genome has been explored through the development of next-generation therapeutics, which have had a high impact on treating genetic disorders. Classical treatments have traditionally focused on common diseases that require repeated treatments. However, with the recent advancements in the development of nucleic acids, utilizing DNA and RNA to modify or correct gene expression in genetic disorders, there has been a paradigm shift in the treatment of rare diseases, offering more potential one-time cure options. Advanced technologies that use CRISPR-Cas 9, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA, miRNA, and aptamers are promising tools that have achieved successful breakthroughs in the treatment of various genetic disorders. The advancement in the chemistry of these molecules has improved their efficacy, reduced toxicity, and expanded their clinical use across a wide range of tissues in various categories of human disorders. However, challenges persist regarding the safety and efficacy of these advanced technologies in translating into clinical practice. This review mainly focuses on the potential therapies for rare genetic diseases and considers how next-generation techniques enable drug development to achieve long-lasting curative effects through gene inhibition, replacement, and editing.

AB  - Background: Neuropsychological Rehabilitation (NR) helps manage cognitive deficits in epilepsy. As internationally developed programs have limited applicability to resource-limited countries, we developed a program to bridge this gap. This 6-week caregiver-assisted, culturally suitable program has components of (1) psychoeducation, (2) compensatory training, and, (3) cognitive retraining and is called EMPOWER (Indigenized Home Based Attention and Memory Rehabilitation Program for Adult Patients with Drug Refractory Epilepsy). Its efficacy needs to be determined. Methods: We carried out an open-label parallel randomized controlled trial. Adults aged 18-45 years with Drug Refractory Epilepsy (DRE), fluency in Hindi and or English, with impaired attention or memory (n = 28) were randomized to Intervention Group (IG) and Control Group (CG). The primary outcomes were objective memory (Auditory Verbal Learning Test), patient and caregiver reported everyday memory difficulties (Everyday Memory Questionnaire-Revised), number of memory aids in use, depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) and quality of life (Quality of Life in Epilepsy-31). Intention to treat was carried out for group analysis. In the absence of norms necessary for computing Reliable Change Indices (RCIs), a cut-off of +1.0 Standard Deviation (SD) was utilized to identify clinically meaningful changes in the individual analysis of objective memory. A cut-off of 11.8 points was used for quality of life. Feedback and program evaluation responses were noted. Results: The majority of the sample comprised DRE patients with temporal lobe epilepsy who had undergone epilepsy surgery. Group analysis indicated improved learning (p = 0.013), immediate recall (p = 0.001), delayed recall (p < 0.001), long-term retention (p = 0.031), patient-reported everyday memory (p < 0.001), caregiver-reported everyday memory (p < 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.039) and total quality of life (p < 0.001). Individual analysis showed improvement in 50 %, 64 %, 71 %, 57 %, and 64 % of patients on learning, immediate recall, delayed recall, long-term retention, and total quality of life respectively. Despite improvements, themes indicative of a lack of awareness and understanding of cognitive deficits were identified. Overall, the program was rated favorably by patients and caregivers alike. Conclusion: NR shows promise for patients with DRE, however larger studies are warranted. The role of cognition in epilepsy needs to be introduced at the time of diagnosis to help lay the foundation for education and acceptance.

AB  - Background: Methadone take-home doses for opioid dependence treatment are strictly regulated due to diversion and overdose concerns, so patients must visit the clinic daily for dispensing. This was also done in India until the COVID-19 pandemic, when lockdown restriction compelled take- home dispensing of methadone. This study examined experience of patients who received take- home methadone during COVID-19 pandemic in India. Methods: Observational, cross-sectional design. We contacted all consenting methadone centres in India during the lockdown and selected those that provided take-home doses for the study. Patients who received daily methadone before the lockdown and take-home doses after were interviewed using a study -specific questionnaire. Results: The study had 210 participants. Take-home methadone was dispensed for 2.5 days on average in each dispensing. When taking methadone at home, 3.3% split their dose 25% took less than the prescribed dose to save it for a rainy days, and 3.3% reported an overdose episode. Adherence improved in 58.6% participants after take-home methadone. Participants perceived many benefits from take-home methadone such as reduced hospital visits and travel time to collect methadone, improvement in work, and financial savings. About 54.3% participants reported storing their take-home doses safely, and 1.9% reported that their family consumed methadone by mistake. Conclusions: Take-home methadone was found to be beneficial to most participants in terms of time saved and improved productivity. Preconceived concerns of providing take-home methadone in terms of its overdose, diversion, or accidental ingestion by others are not commonly seen when individuals are provided take-home doses of methadone.

AB  - Introduction: Severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors are currently being treated with bypassing agents like activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) and recombinant factor VIIa. Emicizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, introduced to reduce the bleeding events, improve treatment adherence, and quality of life. However, costeffectiveness and long-term sustainability of the intervention is not studied in a low middle income setting like India. Aim: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the cost -utility of Emicizumab compared to traditional bypassing agents in the treatment of severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India. Secondary objective was to analyze the budgetary impact of introducing Emicizumab for this patient population from the perspective of public health system in India. Methods: Markov model was created to compare the prophylactic emicizumab therapy against bypassing agents for a hypothetical cohort of 10 -year -old adolescents in India. The time horizon was 10 years and model built based on health system perspective. Cost utility was expressed as costs per quality -adjusted life -years (QALYs) gained. All costs were expressed as 2021 US dollars. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of the estimates. Results: Prophylactic emicizumab was a cost saving intervention with negative Incremental Cost Utility Ratio (ICUR) against recombinant factor VIIa of -853,573 USD (INR -63,109,773), and negative ICUR of -211,675 USD (INR -15,650,403) against APCC. The estimated total budget for treating all the severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India was USD 59,042,000 (INR 4,365,329,312) for 10 years' time horizon (per patient cost of USD 295,210 [INR 21,826,646.56]). Conclusion: Prophylactic emicizumab therapy is a cost saving intervention when compared to both the bypassing agents as it is less costly and more effective for severe Haemophilia A patients with inhibitors in India.

AB  - AimThis qualitative study sought to assess the influence of cultural factors and family on oral health behaviour of 12- to 15-year-old adolescents from the socially disadvantaged population.DesignA qualitative design was developed with focus group discussions (FGDs) among 12- to 15-year-old adolescents. Four focus groups (n = 32 participants) were created from a selected sample to capture oral health beliefs and practices, oral health-seeking behaviour along with other relevant information. Focus group discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and translated. Data were analysed thematically and structural coding was applied.ResultsThree key themes that emerged from FGDs were importance of oral health; role of family in oral health behaviour; and beliefs influencing access, prevention and treatment of oral diseases. Cultural background, family values and beliefs were imperative in moulding the behaviour of adolescents towards oral health. The use of traditional oral hygiene aides was a norm in this population.ConclusionsFindings of the study provide greater insights into the authoritative role of family and cultural barriers in the uptake of dental services. The study also highlights the potential value of qualitative research and emphasizes the need to integrate oral health-associated cultural beliefs and attitudes of the adolescents towards a wider evidence base.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The role of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in operable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. This study was aimed to evaluate the feasibility for identification of cfDNA in pleural lavage fluid and its correlation with plasma in resectable NSCLCs. Methods: Consecutively resected NSCLCs were evaluated for cfDNA levels in preoperative plasma (PLS1), intraoperative pleural-lavage (PLV) and postoperative (at 1 month) plasma sample (PLS2). CfDNA was isolated and measured quantitatively by qPCR in a TaqMan probe-detection approach using the human beta-actin gene as the amplifying target. Results: All (n = 34) except one were negative for malignant cells in PLV cytology. CfDNA could be isolated from all the three samples (PLS1, PLV, and PLS2) successfully in each patient. The median cfDNA levels in PLS1, PLV and PLS2 were 118 ng/mL (IQR 61-158), 167 ng/mL (IQR 59.9-179.9) and 103 ng/mL (IQR 66.5-125.4) respectively. The median follow-up was 34.1 months (IQR 25.2-41.6). A significant overall-survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were recorded for patients with cfDNA level cut-offs at 125, 170, and 100 ng/mL, respectively for PLS1, PLV, and PLS2. Patients with raised cfDNA in PLS1 (>125 ng/mL) and PLV (>170 ng/mL) had significantly poorer 2-year OS, p = 0.005 and p = 0.012, respectively. The hazards (OS) were also higher for those with raised cfDNA in PLV (HR = 5.779, 95% CI = 1.162-28.745, p = 0.032). PLV (>170 ng/mL) had increased pleural recurrences (p = 0.021) and correlated significantly with poorer DFS at 2-years (p = 0.001) with increased hazards (HR = 9.767, 95% CI = 2.098-45.451, p = 0.004). Multivariable analysis suggested higher cfDNA in PLV as a poor prognostic factor for both OS and DFS. Conclusions: Among patients with operable NSCLC, it is feasible to identify cfDNA in pleural lavage and correlate PLV cfDNA with pleural recurrences and outcomes.

AB  - Background: Emerging infectious diseases, often zoonotic, demand a collaborative "One -Health" surveillance approach due to human activities. The need for standardized diagnostic and surveillance algorithms is emphasized to address the difficulty in clinical differentiation and curb antimicrobial resistance. Objective: The present recommendations are comprehensive diagnostic and surveillance algorithm for ARIs, developed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which aims to enhance early detection and treatment with improved surveillance. This algorithm shall be serving as a blueprint for respiratory infections landscape in the country and early detection of surge of respiratory infections in the country. Content: The ICMR has risen up to the threat of emerging and re-emerging infections. Here, we seek to recommend a structured approach for diagnosing respiratory illnesses. The recommendations emphasize the significance of prioritizing respiratory pathogens based on factors such as the frequency of occurrence (seasonal or geographical), disease severity, ease of diagnosis and public health importance. The proposed surveillance -based diagnostic algorithm for ARI relies on a combination of gold -standard conventional methods, innovative serological and molecular techniques, as well as radiological approaches, which collectively contribute to the detection of various causative agents.

AB  - A 3-year-old boy presented with acute headache, vomiting and right focal clonic seizures without history of fever, joint pain or altered sensorium. Neuroimaging showed multifocal contrast enhancing lesions with significant perilesional edema. CECT chest and abdomen showed multiple variable sized nodules in the lungs and hypodense lesion in liver with mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There was persistent eosinophilia with maximum upto 35 %. Liver biopsy and brain biopsy revealed Cladophialophora bantiana. He was treated with IV liposomal amphotericin and voriconazole for 6 weeks with repeat neuroimaging showing more than 50 % resolution of the intracranial lesions. He was transitioned to oral combination of flucytosine and voriconazole. At 14 months follow-up, he remained symptom free with complete radiological resolution of the lesions and no eosinophilia. High suspicion, an aggressive approach in obtaining microbiological diagnosis and timely combination antifungal therapy may give satisfactory outcome without surgery.

AB  - With the recent advancement in technologies, real-time integrated intraoperative optical coherence tomography (iOCT) microscopes are available, which facilitates surgical precision and also reduces the risk of complications. Two glaucoma patients with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy, who underwent uneventful trabeculectomy with 0.02% mitomycin C, developed persistent hypotony postoperatively till 4-6 weeks. On clinical examination, visual acuity was 1/60 with low intraocular pressure (IOP) of 4 mmHg. Elevated, overfiltering bleb was seen on slit-lamp examination, along with hypotonous maculopathy. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) showed multiple large hyporeflective fluid spaces suggestive of overfiltering bleb. Considering the risk of choroidal detachment and further deterioration of vision, iOCT-guided transconjunctival bleb suturing was planned. iOCT helped to identify the exact location of scleral flap, and transconjunctival suturing was done with successful outcomes in terms of improved IOP and visual acuity.

AB  - Various studies have shown that oropharyngeal colostrum application (OPCA) is beneficial to preterm neonates. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess whether OPCA reduces the incidence of culture-proven neonatal sepsis in preterm neonates. Randomized controlled trials comparing OPCA with placebo or standard care in preterm neonates were included. Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and CENTRAL were searched for studies published up to June 15, 2023. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, version 2, for risk of bias assessment, the random-effects model (RevMan 5.4) for meta-analysis, and Gradepro software for assessing the certainty of evidence. Twenty-one studies involving 2393 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Four studies had a low risk of bias, whereas seven had a high risk. Oropharyngeal colostrum significantly reduced the incidence of culture-proven sepsis (18 studies, 1990 neonates, risk ratio [RR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.65, 0.94), mortality (18 studies, 2117 neonates, RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (17 studies, 1692 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.82), feeding intolerance episodes (four studies, 445 neonates, RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.92), and the time to full enteral feeding (19 studies, 2142 neonates, mean difference: -2 to 21 days, 95% CI: -3.44, -0.99 days). There was no reduction in intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, neurodevelopmental abnormalities, hospital stay duration, time to full oral feeding, weight at discharge, pneumonia, and duration of antibiotic therapy. The certainty of the evidence was high for the outcomes of culture-positive sepsis and mortality, moderate for NEC, low for time to full enteral feeding, and very low for feeding intolerance. OPCA reduces culture-positive sepsis and mortality (high certainty), NEC (moderate certainty), and time to full enteral feeding (low certainty) in preterm neonates. However, scarcity of data from extremely premature infants limits the generalizability of these results to this population.
   The graphical abstract shows the immunological benefits of using oropharyngeal colostrum in the left half, as well as the participants and results of the meta-analysis in the right half. image
   What is Known Neonatal sepsis is a significant cause of mortality, especially in preterm neonates. Breast milk has several advantages in the management of preterm neonates. Varied results were noted from randomized controlled trials on the impact of oropharyngeal colostrum application in reducing neonatal sepsis rates.What is New There is a significant reduction in the rates of culture-positive sepsis with oropharyngeal colostrum. There is also a reduction in mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis. No harm was noted.

AB  - Background & objectives: : Trauma is one of the leading causes of disability and death, worldwide. Ninety per cent of trauma related mortality occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite this, there is paucity of literature emanating from LMICs with studies that present and/or evaluate feasible interventions that can have a measurable impact on outcomes after injury, primarily mortality. The current article aims at developing such interventions key elements of implementation and measures of compliance and impact. Methods: : A literature review was conducted to evaluate the status of injury care among LMICs worldwide. Based on this review, interventions were identified/developed, that (i) were feasible to implement within the constraints of available resources; (ii) could be implemented within a two year timespan; and (iii) would improve outcomes primarily, mortality. These interventions were then discussed at a symposium of experts and stakeholders from around the world. Results: : The literature review identified gaps across the entire spectrum of injury care at all levels - primary, secondary and tertiary prevention. Additionally, lack of data systems capable of ensuring quality of care and driving performance improvement was identified. Utilizing the review as the basis and focusing on hospital level interventions, one policy intervention, five in-hospital interventions and one major research question were identified/developed that met the defined criteria. Interpretation & conclusions: : Gaps in trauma care in LMICs at every level and in data systems were identified. Feasible interventions that can be implemented within the resource constraints of LMICs in a reasonable timeframe and that can have a measurable impact on injury related mortality were developed and are presented.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and remains an important public health issue in developing countries worldwide. The existing methods and techniques available for the diagnosis of TB are based on combinations of laboratory (chemical and biological), radiological, and clinical tests. These methods are sophisticated and laborious and have limitations in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Clinical settings need improved diagnostic biomarkers to accurately detect biological changes due to pathogen invasion and pharmacological responses. Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles and mediators of intercellular signaling processes that play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various diseases, such as tuberculosis, and can act as promising biomarkers for the monitoring of TB infection. Compared to conventional biomarkers, exosome-derived biomarkers are advantageous because they are easier to detect in different biofluids, are more sensitive and specific, and may be useful in tracking patients' reactions to therapy. This review provides insights into the types of biomarkers, methods of exosome isolation, and roles of the cargo (proteins) present in exosomes isolated from patients through omics studies, such as proteomics. These findings will aid in developing new prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers and could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets in the clinical setting.

AB  - Background & objectives: Improving access to acute cardiac care requires remodelling of existing health systems into a service delivery network with an anchor establishment (Hub) offering a full array of services, complemented by spoke establishments that offer limited services. We assessed the availability of cardiac services in the district of Faridabad in the northern State of Haryana, India and explored the feasibility and challenges of implementing a hub-and-spoke model. Methods: In 2019-2020, we listed all the facilities in private and public sectors in the study-district and mapped their geocoordinates with the help of QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System) software version 3.20. After consent, we assessed the availability of specific cardiac care-related inputs (medicines, technologies and staff) using a checklist by enquiring from the hospital staff. Each facility was classified as L1 (No ECG) to L5 (cardiac catheterization) as per the national guidelines for the management of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Results: There were 109 health facilities (66% private) in the district, 1.6 cardiologists and 5.4 coronary care unit beds per 100,000 population (94% private). Only one district hospital running in a public- private partnership mode at the L5 level provided any cardiac services. Private facilities were providing a range of services with a considerable number of them functional at L5. The higher-level facilities were concentrated in the central and urban parts of the district. Only 46 per cent of the ambulances had oxygen cylinders and 14.7 per cent had defibrillators. Interpretation & conclusions: Implementation of a hub-and-spoke model for cardiac care in Faridabad district will require significant strengthening of public health services, development of a private-sector participation model, and strengthening of ambulance services.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The results from 2 phase 3 studies, through 2 years, in chronic hepatitis B infection showed tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) had similar efficacy to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) with superior renal and bone safety. We report updated results through 5 years. METHODS: Patients with HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B infection with or without compensated cirrhosis were randomized (2:1) to TAF 25 mg or TDF 300 mg once daily in double-blind (DB) fashion for up to 3 years, followed by open-label (OL) TAF up to 8 years. Efficacy (antiviral, biochemical, and serologic), resistance (deep sequencing of polymerase/reverse transcriptase and phenotyping), and safety, including renal and bone parameters, were evaluated by pooled analyses. RESULTS: Of 1,298 randomized and treated patients, 866 receiving TAF (DB and OL) and 432 receiving TDF with rollover to OL TAF at year 2 (n = 180; TDF -> TAF3y) or year 3 (n = 202; TDF -> TAF2y) were included. Fifty (4%) TDF patients who discontinued during DB were excluded. At year 5, 85%, 83%, and 90% achieved HBV DNA <29 IU/mL (missing = failure) in the TAF, TDF -> TAF3y, and TDF -> TAF2y groups, respectively; no patient developed TAF or TDF resistance. Median estimated glomerular filtration rate (by using Cockcroft-Gault) declined <2.5 mL/min, and mean declines of <1% in hip and spine bone mineral density were seen at year 5 in the TAF group; patients in the TDF -> TAF groups had improvements in these parameters at year 5 after switching to OL TAF. DISCUSSION: Long-term TAF treatment resulted in high rates of viral suppression, no resistance, and favorable renal and bone safety.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: India has taken several initiatives to provide health care to its population while keeping the related expenditure minimum. Since cardiovascular diseases are the most prevalent chronic conditions, in the present study, we aimed to analyze the difference in prices of medicines prescribed for three cardiovascular risk factors, based on (a) listed and not listed in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) and (b) generic and branded drugs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Outpatient prescriptions for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia were retrospectively analyzed from 12 tertiary centers. The prices of medicines prescribed were compared based on presence or absence in NLEM India-2015 and prescribing by generic versus brand name. The price was standardized and presented as average price per medicine per year for a given medicine. The results are presented in Indian rupee (INR) and as median (range).
   RESULTS: Of the 4,736 prescriptions collected, 843 contained oral antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and/or hypolipidemic medicines. The price per medicine per year for NLEM oral antidiabetics was INR 2849 (2593-3104) and for non-NLEM was INR 5343 (2964-14364). It was INR 806 (243-2132) for generic and INR 3809 (1968-14364) for branded antidiabetics. Antihypertensives and hypolipidemics followed the trend. The price of branded non-NLEM medicines was 5-22 times higher compared to generic NLEM which, for a population of 1.37 billion, would translate to a potential saving of 346.8 billion INR for statins. The variability was significant for sulfonylureas, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, diuretics, and statins (P < 0.0001).
   CONCLUSION: The study highlights an urgent need for intervention to actualize the maximum benefit of government policies and minimize the out-of-pocket expenditure on medicines.

AB  - Precis:Patients with primary open angle glaucoma were advised to follow the "365 breathing technique" for 6 weeks in addition to their pharmacological glaucoma treatment. It helped to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), stress biomarker-cortisol, and improve autonomic dysfunction.Objective:To study the effect of the "365 breathing technique" on IOP, autonomic functions, and stress biomarkers in patients with primary open angle glaucoma.Methods:In this randomized, controlled, interventional trial, after randomization, 40 patients in the intervention group followed "365 breathing" (three times a day, breathing rate: 6 cycles/min for 5 min) in addition to their pharmacological glaucoma treatment and 40 patients in the control group continued only with their pharmacological glaucoma treatment. IOP, serum cortisol, heart rate variability (HRV), and heart rate response to deep breathing test (DBT) were recorded at preintervention and 6 weeks postintervention.Results:The mean IOP, serum cortisol, parameters of the HRV test, and DBT were comparable between the two groups at baseline. At the 6-week follow-up, in the intervention group, mean IOP was significantly lower (16.09 +/- 2.24 vs 18.38 +/- 1.58 mm Hg, P = 0.03) and serum cortisol were significantly lower (13.20 +/- 3.11 vs 14.95 +/- 2.60 mcg/dL, P = 0.038) compared with the control group. In the HRV test, time domain analysis showed a significant difference in the root mean square of the successive difference between RR interval values between both groups at 6 weeks (P = 0.015) pointing towards higher postintervention parasympathetic activation in the intervention group. In frequency domain analysis (HRV test), the ratio of the low-frequency component to the high-frequency component was significantly lower in the intervention group at 6 weeks (1.65 vs 1.79, P = 0.019) indicating a shift in sympathovagal balance towards greater vagal modulation.There was a significant increase in delta heart rate (P = 0.019) and expiratory:inspiratory ratio (P = 0.011) in the intervention group at 6 weeks when compared with baseline values, indicating improved parasympathetic reactivity to DBT.Results:The mean IOP, serum cortisol, parameters of the HRV test, and DBT were comparable between the two groups at baseline. At the 6-week follow-up, in the intervention group, mean IOP was significantly lower (16.09 +/- 2.24 vs 18.38 +/- 1.58 mm Hg, P = 0.03) and serum cortisol were significantly lower (13.20 +/- 3.11 vs 14.95 +/- 2.60 mcg/dL, P = 0.038) compared with the control group.

AB  - Background: Aberrance in switching from default mode network (DMN) to fronto-parietal network (FPN) is proposed to underlie working memory deficits in subjects with substance use disorders, which can be studied using neuro-imaging techniques during cognitive tasks. The current study used EEG to investigate pre-stimulus microstates during the performance of Sternberg's working memory task in subjects with substance use disorders. Methods: 128-channel EEG was acquired and processed in ten age and gender-matched subjects, each with alcohol use disorder, opioid use disorder, and controls while they performed Sternberg's task. Behavioral parameters, pre-stimulus EEG microstate, and underlying sources were analyzed and compared between subjects with substance use disorders and controls. Results: Both alcohol and opioid use disorder subjects had significantly lower accuracy (P < 0.01), while reaction times were significantly higher only in subjects of alcohol use disorder compared to controls (P < 0.01) and opioid use disorder (P < 0.01), reflecting working memory deficits of varying degrees in subjects with substance use disorders. Pre-stimulus EEG microstate revealed four topographic Maps 1-4: subjects of alcohol and opioid use disorder showing significantly lower mean duration of Map 3 (visual processing) and Map 2 (saliency and DMN switching), respectively, compared to controls (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Reduced mean durations in Map 3 and 2 in subjects of alcohol and opioid use disorder can underlie their poorer performance in Sternberg's task. Furthermore, cortical sources revealed higher activity in both groups of substance use disorders in the parahippocampal gyrus- a hub of DMN; superior and middle temporal gyri associated with impulsivity; and insula that maintains balance between executive reflective system and impulsive system. EEG microstates can be used to envisage neural underpinnings implicated for working memory deficits in subjects of alcohol and opioid use disorders, reflected by aberrant switching between neural networks and information processing mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has considerable relevance in neural growth and differentiation. It has been evaluated as a biomarker for individuals with various psychiatric disorders such as substance-related disorders and psychotic disorders.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study explored differences in the levels of BDNF (in serum) among subjects using cannabis (with and without schizophrenia).
   METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study compared the serum BDNF level in male subjects aged 18-45 years. Four groups of 20 subjects each were included: individuals with tobacco use disorder only, patients having schizophrenia, patients with cannabis use disorder, and finally patients with comorbid cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia.
   RESULTS: The BDNF levels were found to be significantly different across the four groups. The BDNF levels in subjects with concurrent schizophrenia and cannabis use disorder were higher than each of the other three groups (cannabis use disorder, schizophrenia, and tobacco use disorder only).
   CONCLUSION: We find that BDNF may be higher when cannabis use disorder and schizophrenia co-occur, as compared to either of the conditions alone. The findings should be interpreted with caution due to the low sample size and potential confounders.

AB  - Corneal haze, due to edema or opacity, is a major contraindication for performing ab interno angle surgeries such as goniotomy in children with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), despite otherwise favorable surgical outcomes expected in these patients. In this case series involving patients of PCG with moderate corneal haze, the authors describe a technique for performing goniotomy in cases with compromised visibility by using indocyanine green (ICG) to aid in the visualization of angle structures. The authors used 0.2% ICG intracamerally, which stained the anterior and posterior trabecular meshwork (TM) with different intensities, before proceeding with goniotomy. The junction between the two zones was discernible due to the contrast imparted by ICG staining, despite poor visibility, allowing the surgeon to incise the TM at the correct site. The possibility of performing goniotomy in such patients with the help of ICG can revolutionize our surgical approach to patients with PCG and corneal edema.

AB  - Purpose: To compare aqueous humor outflow (AHO) pathway patterns between eyes of childhood glaucoma patients and non-glaucomatous patients receiving cataract surgery. Methods: Aqueous angiography was performed in childhood glaucoma eyes (n = 5) receiving glaucoma surgery and in pediatric (n = 1) and healthy adult (n = 5) eyes receiving cataract surgery. Indocyanine green (0.4%) was introduced into the anterior chamber, and AHO was imaged using an angiographic camera (SPECTRALIS HRA+OCT with Flex Module). Images were acquired and analyzed (ImageJ with Analyze Skeleton 2D/3D plugin) from the nasal sides of the eyes, the usual site of glaucoma angle procedures. Image analysis endpoints included AHO vessel length, maximum vessel length, number of branches, number of branch junctions, and vessel density. Results: Qualitatively, childhood glaucoma eyes demonstrated lesser AHO pathway arborization compared to pediatric and adult eyes without glaucoma. Quantitatively, childhood glaucoma and healthy adult cataract eyes showed similar AHO pathway average branch lengths and maximum branch lengths (P = 0.49-0.99). However, childhood glaucoma eyes demonstrated fewer branches (childhood glaucoma, 198.2 +/- 35.3; adult cataract, 506 +/- 59.5; P = 0.002), fewer branch junctions (childhood glaucoma, 74.6 +/- 13.9; adult cataract, 202 +/- 41.2; P = 0.019), and lower vessel densities (childhood glaucoma, 8% +/- 1.4%; adult cataract, 17% +/- 2.5%; P = 0.01). Conclusions: Childhood glaucoma patients demonstrated fewer distal AHO pathways and lesser AHO pathway arborization. These anatomical alternations may result in a new source of trabecular meshwork-independent AHO resistance in this disease cohort. Translational Relevance: Elevated distal outflow pathway resistance due to decreased AHO pathway arborization may explain some cases of failed trabecular bypass surgery in childhood glaucoma.

AB  - Purpose: To predict the presence of angle dysgenesis on anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (ADoA) by using deep learning (DL) and to correlate ADoA with mutations in known glaucoma genes. Participants: In total, 800 high-definition anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) images were included, of which 340 images were used to build the machine learning (ML) model. Images used to build the ML model included 170 scans of primary congenital glaucoma (16 patients), juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma (62 patients), and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma eyes (37 patients); the rest were controls (n = 85). The genetic validation dataset consisted of another 393 images of patients with known mutations that were compared with 320 images of healthy controls. Methods: ADoA was defined as the absence of Schlemm's canal, the presence of hyperreflectivity over the region of the trabecular meshwork, or a hyperreflective membrane. DL was used to classify a given AS-OCT image as either having angle dysgenesis or not. ADoA was then specifically looked for on AS-OCT images of patients with mutations in the known genes for glaucoma. Results: The final prediction, which was a consensus-based outcome from the three optimized DL models, had an accuracy of >95%, a specificity of >97%, and a sensitivity of >96% in detecting ADoA in the internal test dataset. Among the patients with known gene mutations, (MYOC, CYP1B1, FOXC1, and LTBP2) ADoA was observed among all the patients in the majority of the images, compared to only 5% of the healthy controls. Conclusion: ADoA can be objectively identified using models built with DL.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PODIATRIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
KW  - EXOSTOSIS
AB  - Bony outgrowths of the distal phalanx of the great toe have been described in the literature but rarely. These subungual bony outgrowths can be caused by subungual exostosis or subungual osteochondromas. Both of these abnormalities are bony outgrowths with differences in the cartilage cap wherein the exostoses have fibrocartilage, and osteochondromas have hyaline cartilage. The subungual exostosis and osteochondroma that are protruding present symptoms of pain, redness, and deformed nail bed, whereas the nonprotruding osteochondromas have only a lump as the presenting symptom. In both conditions, excision of the lesion and curettage of the base helps prevent a recurrence. Curettage at the end of the excision of the bony outgrowth is required to avoid recurrence. After excision, the specimen should be sent for histopathologic examination to differentiate between the exostosis and osteochondromas, which are underreported in subungual locations, and to rule out malignant transformation. We present a 13 -yearold girl with an isolated subungual nonprotruding exostosis of the great toe that was treated by excisional biopsy. The histopathologic examination confirmed it as osteochondroma, which is underreported.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to assess qualitative interpretability and quantitative precision and reproducibility of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) parametric images evaluated using novel IVIM analysis methods for diagnostic accuracy. Methods: Intravoxel incoherent motion datasets of 55 patients (male/female = 41:14; age = 17.8 +/- 5.5 years) with histopathology-proven osteosarcoma were analyzed. Intravoxel incoherent motion parameters-diffusion coefficient (D), perfusion fraction (f), and perfusion coefficient (D*)-were estimated using 5 IVIM analysis methods-(i) biexponential (BE) model, (ii) BE-segmented fitting 2-parameter (BESeg-2), (iii) BE-segmented fitting 1-parameter (BESeg-1), (iv) BE model with total variation penalty function (BE + TV), and (v) BE model with Huber penalty function (BE + HPF). Qualitative scoring in a 5-point Likert scale (uninterpretable: 1; poor: 2; fair: 3; good: 4; excellent: 5) was performed by 2 radiologists for 4 criteria: (a) tumor shape and margin, (b) morphologic correlation, (c) noise suppression, and (d) overall interpretability. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using Spearman rank-order correlation (rs). Precision and reproducibility were evaluated using within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) and between-subject coefficient of variation (bCV). Results: BE + TV and BE + HPF produced significantly (P < 10-3) higher qualitative scores for D (fair-good [3.3-3.8]) than BE (poor [2.3]) and for D* (poor-fair [2.2-2.7]) and f (fair-good [3.2-3.8]) than BE, BESeg-2, and BESeg-1 (D*: uninterpretable-poor [1.3-1.9] and f: poor-fair [1.5-3]). Interobserver agreement for qualitative scoring was rs = 0.48-0.59, P < 0.009. BE + TV and BE + HPF showed significantly (P < 0.05) improved reproducibility in estimating D (wCV: 24%-31%, bCV: 21%-31% improvement) than the BE method and D* (wCV: 4%-19%, bCV: 5%-19% improvement) and f (wCV: 25%-49%, bCV: 25%-47% improvement) than BE, BESeg-2, and BESeg-1 methods. Conclusions: BE + TV and BE + HPF demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively improved IVIM parameter estimation and may be considered for clinical use further.

AB  - Platelets are known for their indispensable role in hemostasis and thrombosis. However, alteration in platelet function due to oxidative stress is known to mediate various health complications, including cardiovascular diseases and other health complications. To date, several synthetic molecules have displayed antiplatelet activity; however, their uses are associated with bleeding and other adverse effects. The commercially available curcumin is generally a mixture of three curcuminoids: curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin. Although crude curcumin is known to inhibit platelet aggregation, the effect of purified curcumin on platelet apoptosis, activation, and aggregation remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, curcumin was purified from a crude curcumin mixture and the effects of this preparation on the oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis and activation was evaluated. 2,2 '-Azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH) compound was used as an inducer of oxidative stress. Purified curcumin restored AAPH-induced platelet apoptotic markers like reactive oxygen species, intracellular calcium level, mitochondrial membrane potential, cardiolipin peroxidation, cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, and phosphatidyl serine externalization. Further, it inhibited the agonist-induced platelet activation and aggregation, demonstrating its antiplatelet activity. Western blot analysis confirms protective effect of the purified curcumin against oxidative stress-induced platelet apoptosis and activation via downregulation of MAPKs protein activation, including ASK1, JNK, and p-38. Together, these results suggest that the purified curcumin could be a potential therapeutic bioactive molecule to treat the oxidative stress-induced platelet activation, apoptosis, and associated complications.

T2  - INDIAN PEDIATRICS
KW  - URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION

KW  - MANAGEMENT
AB  - In this multicentric, open label, randomized trial performed across 39 European centers, the investigators randomly assigned infants 1 to 5 months of age with grade III, IV, or V vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and no previous episode of urinary tract infection (UTI) to receive continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (prophylaxis group) or no treatment (untreated group) for 24 months. The primary outcome was the occurrence of the first UTI during the trial period. Secondary outcomes included new kidney scarring and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at 24 months. A total of 292 participants underwent randomization (146 per group). Approximately 75% of the participants were male; the median age was 3 months, and 235 participants (80.5%) had grade IV or V VUR. In the intention-to-treat analysis, a first UTI occurred in 31 participants (21.2%) in the prophylaxis group and in 52 participants (35.6%) in the untreated group [hazard ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 0.86; P = 0.008]; the number needed to treat for 2 years to prevent one UTI was 7 children (95% CI 4 to 29). Among untreated participants, 64.4% had no UTI during the trial. Pseudomonas species, other non-Escherichia coli organisms, and antibiotic resistance were more common in UTI isolates obtained from participants in the prophylaxis group than in isolates obtained from those in the untreated group. The investigators concluded that in infants with grade III, IV, or V VUR and no previous UTIs, continuous antibiotic prophylaxis provided a small but significant benefit in preventing a first UTI despite an increased occurrence of non-E.coli organisms and antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text.
   Background:Prospective evaluation of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCT-A) characteristics in different stages of papilledema in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).Methods:In this prospective, observational study patients of IIH with papilledema were recruited and divided into 3 groups-early/established (Group 1), chronic (Group 2), and atrophic papilledema (Group 3). Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) were recorded on OCT. Peripapillary and macular perfusion was documented at superficial retinal, deep retinal, and choriocapillary level using OCT-A. The investigations were repeated at 3 months.Results:RNFL showed significant thinning in all groups on follow-up with the atrophic group showing maximum thinning (P = 0.01-Group 3). GC-IPL was significantly reduced in all stages of papilledema at baseline compared with the controls. Thinnest GC-IPL was noted in the atrophic group (52.75 +/- 7.44 mu m; P = 0.00 in Group 3 vs controls) that showed further deterioration on follow-up. On Image J analysis, significant decrease was noted at various levels in the peripapillary and macular perfusion at baseline especially in the atrophic group which showed further deterioration noted on follow-up. The final visual acuity showed a statistically significant weak negative correlation with baseline RNFL (r = -0.306) and GC-IPL (r = -0.384) and moderately negative correlation with baseline superficial peripapillary retinal perfusion (r = -0.553). A significant negative correlation was seen between increasing grade of papilledema and superficial peripapillary retinal perfusion with both Image J and automated indices (r = -0.46; r = -0.61), respectively.Conclusions:GC-IPL may help identify early damage in papilledema even in the presence of thicker RNFL. Significant vascular changes can be observed on OCT-A that may help predict the final visual outcome in papilledema due to IIH.

AB  - Background & objectives: Injuries profoundly impact global health, with substantial deaths and disabilities, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This paper presents strategic consensus from the Transdisciplinary Research, Advocacy, and Implementation Network for Trauma in India (TRAIN Trauma India) symposium, advocating for enhanced, system-level trauma care to address this challenge. Methods: Five working groups conducted separate literature reviews on pre-hospital trauma care, in- hospital trauma resuscitation and training, trauma systems, trauma registries, and India's Towards Improving Trauma Care Outcomes (TITCO) registry. Using a Delphi approach, the TRAIN Trauma India Symposium generated consensus statements and recommendations for interventions to streamline trauma care and reduce preventable trauma mortality in India and LMICs. Experts prioritized interventions based on cost and difficulty. Results: An expert panel agreed on four pre-hospital consensus statements, eight hospital resuscitation consensus statements, six system-level consensus statements, and six trauma registry consensus statements. The expert panel recommended six pre-hospital interventions, four hospital resuscitation interventions, nine system-level interventions, and seven trauma registry interventions applicable to the Indian context. Of these, 14 interventions were ranked as low cost/low difficulty, five high cost/low difficulty, five low cost/high difficulty, and three high cost/high difficulty. Interpretation & conclusions: This consensus underscores the urgent need for integrated and efficient trauma systems to reduce preventable mortality, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive care that includes community engagement and robust pre-hospital and acute hospital trauma care pathways. It highlights the critical role of inclusive, system-wide approaches, from enhancing pre-hospital care and in-hospital resuscitation to implementing effective trauma registries to improve outcomes and streamline care across contexts.

AB  - Purpose:To analyze primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) anterior chamber and angle anomalies over 360 degrees as possible biomarkers of severity and prognosis. Methods:A cross-sectional observational study was conducted analyzing anterior segment anomalies of PCG patients over 4 years of age who underwent trabeculectomy combined with trabeculotomy and age-matched controls using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT), CASIA-2. Anterior iridotrabecular adhesions or anterior iris insertion was identified and quantified from the scleral spur using the iridotrabecular contact (ITC) index parameter as a surrogate. Results:There was a variable but significantly increased anterior iridotrabecular adhesion on ITC index, ITC area, corneal volume, anterior chamber volume, iris volume, anterior chamber depth, and small/absent trabecular meshwork in PCG eyes compared to control eyes. In PCG eyes, anterior iridotrabecular adhesion had a positive correlation with pre-operative central corneal thickness (CCT) (r = 0.53, P = 0.02), review iris thickness (r = 0.4, P = 0.04), and ITC area (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). Review iris thickness had a negative correlation with pre-operative vertical cup-disc ratio (r = -0.51, P = 0.008). Iris hypoplasia with fewer or absent folds, collarette, pupillary ruff, and pupillary ruff to collarette distance was significantly different from controls. Conclusion:ASOCT in PCG eyes has shown that they have variable anterior iridotrabecular tissue adhesions, anomalous tissue/membranes in the angle, and iris hypoplasia correlating with pre-operative cup-disc ratio. These features could be used as gonioscopic and clinical biomarkers to assess the severity and prognosis of the disease. The presence of abnormal iris morphology and iridotrabecular tissue anomalies in PCG suggests that it is more than just isolated trabeculodysgenesis and is probably best considered as part of the anterior segment dysgenesis spectrum.

AB  - BackgroundPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly disease due to the lack of early detection. Because chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients are a high-risk group for pancreatic cancer, this study aimed to assess the differential miRNA profile in pancreatic tissue of patients with CP and pancreatic cancer.MethodsMiRNAs were isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue of 22 PDAC patients, 18 CP patients, and 10 normal pancreatic tissues from autopsy (C) cases and processed for next-generation sequencing. Known and novel miRNAs were identified and analyzed for differential miRNA expression, target prediction, and pathway enrichment between groups.ResultsAmong the miRNAs identified, 166 known and 17 novel miRNAs were found exclusively in PDAC tissues, while 106 known and 10 novel miRNAs were found specifically in CP tissues. The pathways targeted by PDAC-specific miRNAs and differentially expressed miRNAs between PDAC versus CP tissues and PDAC versus control tissues were the proteoglycans pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, adherens junction, and transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway.ConclusionsThis study resulted in a set of exclusive and differentially expressed miRNAs in PDAC and CP can be assessed for their diagnostic value. In addition, studying the role of miRNA-target gene interactions in carcinogenesis may open new therapeutic avenues.

AB  - Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are slow-growing tumors that express high levels of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs). Recent studies have shown the superiority of radiolabeled SSTR antagonists in theranostics compared to agonists. In this prospective study, we compared the diagnostic efficacy between [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC and [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 in the detection of primary and metastatic lesions in patients with well differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs. Histologically proven GEP-NET patients underwent [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC & [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 PET/CT scans, which were analyzed. The qualitative analysis involved the visual judgment of radiotracer uptake validated by the morphological findings using CT, which was considered as the reference standard. Quantitative comparisons were presented as the standardized uptake value (SUV) corrected for lean body mass: SULpeak, SULavg, and tumor-to-background ratios (TBR). In total, 490 lesions were confirmed via diagnostic CT. The lesion-based sensitivity of [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 PET/CT was 94.28% (462/490) and 83.46% (409/490) for [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT (p < 0.0001). [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 had statistical significance over [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC in liver metastases [100% vs. 89.4%; p < 0.0001 (292 vs. 253 {283 lesions on CT})] and bone metastases [100% vs. 82.9%; p = 0.005 (45 vs. 34 {41 lesions on CT})]. Statistical significance was also noted for the TBR SULpeak of the primary and liver lesions. [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 showed better sensitivity and a higher target-to-background ratio than [Ga-68]Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT. [Ga-68]Ga-DATA(5m)-LM4 PET/CT can be used to quantify the extent of skeletal and liver metastases for better planning of SSTR agonist- or antagonist-based therapy.

AB  - A tumor microenvironment often presents altered physicochemical characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) including changes in matrix composition, stiffness, protein expression, pH, temperature, or the presence of certain stromal and immune cells. Of these, overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and extracellular acidosis are the two major hallmarks of cancer that can be exploited for tumor detection. The change in matrix stiffness and the release of certain cytokines (TNF-alpha) in the tumor microenvironment play major roles in inducing MMP-9 expression in cancerous cells. This study highlights the role of mechanical cues in upregulating MMP-9 expression in cancerous cells using stiffness-tunable matrix compositions and dual-sensitive fluorescent nanoprobes. Ionically cross-linked 3D alginate/gelatin (AG) scaffolds with three stiffnesses were chosen to reflect the ECM stiffnesses corresponding to healthy and pathological tissues. Moreover, a dual-sensitive nanoprobe, an MMP-sensitive peptide conjugated to carbon nanoparticles with intrinsic pH fluorescence properties, was utilized for in situ monitoring of the two cancer hallmarks in the 3D scaffolds. This platform was further utilized for designing a 3D core-shell platform for spatially mapping tumor margins and for visualizing TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 expression in cancerous cells.

AB  - Introduction: Frailty, characterized by ageing-related vulnerability, influences outcomes in older adults. Our study aimed to investigate the relationship between frailty and clinical outcomes in older Indian patients with cancer. Materials and Methods: Our observational single-centre study, conducted at Tata Memorial Hospital from February 2020 to July 2022, enrolled participants aged 60 years and above with cancer. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), G8, and Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)-13. The primary objective was to explore the correlation between baseline frailty and overall survival. Statistical analyses include Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards, and Harrell's C test. Results: A total of 1,177 patients (median age 68, 76.9% male) were evaluated in the geriatric oncology clinic. Common malignancies included lung (40.0%), gastrointestinal (35.8%), urological (11.9%), and head and neck (9.0%), with 56.5% having metastatic disease. Using CFS, G8, and VES-13 scales, 28.5%, 86.4%, and 38.0% were identified as frail, respectively. Median follow-up was 11.6 months, with 43.3% deaths. Patients fit on CFS (CFS 1-2) had a median survival of 28.02 months, pre-frail (CFS 3-4) 13.24 months, and frail (CFS >= 5) 7.79 months (p < 0.001). Abnormal G8 (<= 14) and VES-13 (>= 3) were associated with significantly lower median survival (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed CFS's predictive power for mortality (p < 0.001), with hazard ratios [HRs] for pre-frail at 1.61(95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25 to 2.06) and frail at 2.31 (95%CI 1.74 to 3.05). G8 <= 14 had HR 2.00 (95%CI 1.42 to 2.83), and abnormal VES-13 had HR 1.36 (95%CI 1.11-1.67). In the likelihood ratio test, CFS significantly improved the model fit (p < 0.001). Harrell's C index for survival prediction was 0.62 for CFS, 0.54 for G8, and 0.58 for VES-13. Discussion: In conclusion, our study highlights varying frailty prevalence and prognostic implications in older Indian patients with cancer, emphasizing the need for personalized care in oncology for this aging population. We would recommend using CFS as a tool to screen for frailty for older Indian patients with cancer.

AB  - Cancer remains a major global health concern with high mortality rates mainly due to late diagnosis and poor prognosis. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of gene expression in human cancer, functioning through various mechanisms including as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) and indirectly regulating miRNA expression. LncRNAs have been found to have both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in cancer, with the former promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and poor prognosis. Recent research has shown that lncRNAs are expressed in various immune cells and are involved in cancer cell immune escape and the modulation of the tumor microenvironment, thus highlighting their potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy. Targeting lncRNAs in cancer or immune cells could enhance the anti-tumor immune response and improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, further research is required to fully understand the functional roles of lncRNAs in cancer and the immune system and their potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy. This review offers a comprehensive examination of the multifaceted roles of lncRNAs in human cancers, with a focus on their potential as targets for cancer immunotherapy. By exploring the intricate mechanisms underlying lncRNA-mediated regulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and immune evasion, we provide insights into the diverse therapeutic applications of these molecules.

AB  - Background: Minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is the smallest change in an outcome measure that is considered clinically meaningful. Using validated MCID thresholds for outcomes powers trials adequately to detect meaningful treatment effects, aids in their interpretation and guides development of new outcome measures. Objectives: To provide a comprehensive summary of MCID thresholds of various symptom severity scales reported in movement disorder. Methods: We conducted systematic review of the literature and included studies of one or more movement disorders, and reporting MCID scales. Results: 2763 reports were screened. Final review included 32 studies. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment showed most studies were of good quality. Most commonly evaluated scale was Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (11 out of 32). Four studies assessing MDSUPDRS had assessed its different sub-parts, reporting a change of 2.64,3.05,3.25 and 0.9 points to detect clinically meaningful improvement and 2.45,2.51,4.63 and 0.8 points to detect clinically meaningful worsening, for the Part I, II, III and IV, respectively. For Parts II + III, I + II + III and I + II + III + IV, MCID thresholds reported for clinically meaningful improvement were 5.73, 4.9, 6.7 and 7.1 points respectively; while those for clinically meaningful worsening were 4.7, 4.2, 5.2 and 6.3 points, respectively. MCID thresholds reported for other scales included Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSRS), and Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Scale (BFMD). Conclusion: This review summarizes all the MCID thresholds currently reported in Movement disorders research and provides a comprehensive resource for future trials, highlighting the need for standardized and validated MCID scales in movement disorder research.

AB  - Pathologies of the vagina are important causes of symptoms related to the genital tract in women. They can be missed on transabdominal ultrasonography (USG), which is the baseline modality used for evaluation of gynaecological complaints. Transperineal USG and MRI are the imaging modalities of choice for evaluation of the vagina. Diseases of the vagina can be grouped depending upon the age group in which they occur. In children and young adults, congenital anomalies like longitudinal or transverse vaginal septum, imperforate hymen, vaginal aplasia or atresia, and rectovaginal fistula can be seen. Malignant tumours can rarely occur in children, rhabdomyosarcoma being the most common one. Common diseases affecting adults include benign lesions like epidermoid, Gartner duct, and Bartholin cysts, and urogenital fistulas involving the vagina. Endometriosis and other benign tumours of vagina including leiomyoma, fibroepithelial polyp, and angiomyxoma are occasionally seen. Malignant tumours can be primary, the most common one being squamous cell carcinoma, or secondary, due to direct extension from cancers involving the adjacent organs. Characteristic morphological changes occur in the vagina after radiotherapy, which can be identified on imaging. Knowledge about the imaging appearances of these diseases is crucial in guiding appropriate management.

AB  - Breast conservation surgery is the standard of care for patients with early breast cancer. Although most surgeons perform oncoplasty for closure of defect, there is no randomised evidence for its favour as compared to simple closure of breast defect. We compared the cosmetic outcomes of patients treated by oncoplasty versus simple closure with 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. One hundred and four patients with breast cancer were randomised to four groups: excision with 1-cm margin with simple closure or excision with 2-cm margin with simple closure; excision with 1-cm margin and oncoplasty; and excision with 2-cm margin oncoplasty. Fifty-two patients underwent oncoplasty and 52 patients had simple closure of breast defect. There was no significant difference in the cosmetic outcomes in patients undergoing oncoplasty compared to simple closure. Excision with 2-cm margin compared to 1 cm did not worsen the cosmetic outcome. The margin positivity and re-excision rates were higher with 1-cm margin and oncoplastic closure group (p-value 0.018). There was no significant difference in complications between oncoplasty compared to simple closure, and 1-cm vs. 2-cm margin of excision. Simple closure demonstrated similar cosmesis as compared to oncoplasty.

AB  - Primary CNS Vasculitis (PCNSV) is a rare, diverse, and polymorphic CNS blood vessel inflammatory condition. Due to its rarity, clinical variability, heterogeneous imaging results, and lack of definitive laboratory markers, PCNSV diagnosis is challenging. This retrospective cohort analysis identified patients with histological diagnosis of PCNSV. Demographic data, clinical presentation, neuroimaging studies, and histopathologic findings were recorded. We enrolled 56 patients with a positive biopsy of CNS vasculitis. Most patients had cerebral hemisphere or brainstem symptoms. Most brain MRI lesions were bilateral, diffuse discrete to confluent white matter lesions. Frontal lobe lesions predominated, followed by inferior cerebellar lesions. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) hemorrhages in 96.4% (54/56) of patients, either solitary microhemorrhages or a combination of micro and macrohemorrhages. Contrast-enhanced T1-WIs revealed parenchymal enhancement in 96.3% (52/54 patients). The most prevalent pattern of enhancement observed was dot-linear (87%), followed by nodular (61.1%), perivascular (25.9%), and patchy (16.7%). Venulitis was found in 19 of 20 individuals in cerebral DSA. Hemorrhages in SWI and dot-linear enhancement pattern should be incorporated as MINOR diagnostic criteria to diagnose PCNSV accurately within an appropriate clinical context. Microhemorrhages in SWI and venulitis in DSA, should be regarded as a potential marker for PCNSV.

AB  - Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) ankylosis leads to mandibular micrognathia that severely collapses the upper airway causing obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), resulting in deterioration and compromise in the quality of life (QoL) of patients. In this study, we aimed to calculate airway volume changes, apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), and improvement in quality of life before and after distraction osteogenesis (DO). Fourteen Patients with OSA secondary to TMJ ankylosis at a mean (SD) age of 17.5 (5.43) years were enrolled in this prospective study. Multivector mandibular distractors were used in all patients following the standard Ilizarov distraction protocol with a mean (SD) anteroposterior distraction of 16.21 (4.37) mm and a consolidation period of 116.92 (14.35) days. The patients were followed up for six months. A polysomnography test (PSG) was done to quantify AHI and a low-dose computed tomographic scan was done to calculate airway volume using Dolphin medical imaging software pre and post -DO. The QoL of the patients was calculated using the OSA -18 questionnaire. Results analysis depicted that the mean (SD) preoperative AHI was 51.44 (37.99)/h which was improved to 9.57 (9.74)/h (p = 0.001) after DO. Airway volume was calculated on Dolphin software before and after DO showed a significant improvement in airway volume by 121.12% (98.30)%. Similarly, the OSA -18 questionnaire showed significant improvement in QoL from severe to normal. This study suggested that DO increases the corpus length of the mandible, leading to an increment in airway volume, which improves the QoL.

AB  - Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma is a grade 1 tumor that arises in a sellar/suprasellar location. Despite being a grade 1 tumor, there is high recurrence and endocrinal insufficiency. Malignancy arising in craniopharyngioma is extremely rare, has a dismal prognosis, and is currently not included as a separate entity in the World Health Organization Classification of Central Nervous System 5th edition. Here we describe a case of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma and its malignant counterpart. The malignant part had unique histomorphology and basaloid cells with pseudoglandular architecture and a myxoid background. It bore a striking resemblance to adenoid cystic carcinoma. Both the benign and malignant counterparts were beta-catenin and SOX-2 positive, providing proof of the malignant part arising from the benign part. Tumors like squamous cell carcinoma and odontogenic ghost cell carcinoma have been described in cranipharyngioma. This case study is the first to describe this unique morphology of adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features. The possibility of adenoid cystic carcinoma was excluded by immunohistochemistry.

TI  - Child Neurology: Allgrove Syndrome
T2  - NEUROLOGY
KW  - TRIPLE
AB  - Motor neuron diseases are a rare group of neurodegenerative disorders with considerable phenotypic heterogeneity and a multitude of etiologies in the pediatric population. In this study, we report 2 unrelated adolescents (a boy and a girl) who presented with 4-6 years of progressive difficulty in walking, thinning of limbs, and gradually progressive darkening of the skin. Examination revealed generalized hyperpigmentation of skin and features suggestive of motor neuron involvement such as tongue atrophy, wasting of distal extremities, and brisk deep tendon reflexes. On detailed exploration for systemic involvement, history of dysphagia, inability to produce tears, and Addisonian crises were evident. An etiologic diagnosis of Allgrove syndrome, which is characterized by a triad of achalasia, alacrimia, and adrenal insufficiency was considered. Next-generation sequencing revealed pathogenic variants in the AAAS gene, confirming the diagnosis. Steroid replacement therapy was initiated along with relevant multidisciplinary referrals. The disease stabilized in the boy and a significant improvement was noted in the girl. These cases highlight the value of non-neurologic cues in navigating the etiologic complexities of motor neuron diseases in children and adolescents. It is imperative for neurologists to develop awareness of the diverse neurologic manifestations associated with Allgrove syndrome because they are often the first to be approached. A multidisciplinary team of experts including neurologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, ophthalmologists, and dermatologists is essential for planning comprehensive care for these patients.

AB  - The multi-parametric flow cytometry (MFC) is technically the most valuable tool in characterization and quantification of clonal plasma cells (PCs). The MFC has a well-defined role in monitoring measurable residual disease (MRD) in MM, in estimating risks of progression in MGUS and SMM and predicting treatment outcomes. The ability of MFC to measure low levels of circulating clonal PCs has enabled non-invasive monitoring of treatment responses and risk assessment in PCPDs. The study of changes in the tumor microenvironment makes it an attractive platform to understand impact of new therapies, especially, the immunotherapy. Diagnosis of plasma cell proliferative disorders (PCPDs) is pr imar ily based on the demonstration of monoclonal protein (M-Protein) in blood and/ or urine which often precedes clinical manifestations of the disease. The basic pathophysiology behind the M-protein presence is the proliferation of clonal plasma cells (PCs) in bone marrow or extramedullary sites and is assessed using cytomorphology and immunophenotyping. The role of multiparametric flow cytometry (MFC) for PC identification is technically the most valuable tool in this context as it characterizes as well as quantifies the clonal PCs based on differential expression of various immunophenotypic (IPT) markers. From a diagnostic perspective, MFC is critical in the definite identification of the clonal PCs and delineates benign and borderline entities at one end of the spectrum (MGUS, SMM) with lower clonal PC% and, malignant diseases at the other end (MM and PCL) with higher clonal PC fraction. The role of MFC in assessment of measurable residual disease (MRD) and monitoring of progression in MM and various PCPDs has been validated in multiple clinical studies and is probably one of the most promising tools for predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, MFC also plays a crucial role in disease prognostication based on specific IPT profiles. An additional role of MFC in the current clinical scenario is the evaluation of tumor microenvironment based on immune cell repertoire, which is reflecting encouraging results across. Thus, in the current review we concisely describe the role of MFC as a reliable and essential modality in PCPDs, from diagnosis to prediction of treatment outcome and disease monitoring.

AB  - MYCN (master regulator of cell cycle entry and proliferative metabolism) gene amplification defines a molecular subgroup of spinal cord ependymomas that show high-grade morphology and aggressive behavior. Demonstration of MYCN amplification by DNA methylation or fluorescence-in situ hybridization (FISH) is required for diagnosis. We aimed to (i) assess prevalence and clinicopathological features of MYCN-amplified spinal ependymomas and (ii) evaluate utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MYCN protein as a surrogate for molecular testing. A combined retrospective-prospective study spanning 8 years was designed during which all spinal cord ependymomas with adequate tissue were subjected to MYCN FISH and MYCN IHC. Among 77 spinal cord ependymomas included, MYCN amplification was identified in 4 samples from 3 patients (3/74, 4%) including two (1st and 2nd recurrences) from the same patient. All patients were adults (median age at diagnosis of 32 years) including two females and one male. The index tumors were located in thoracic (n = 2) and lumbar (n = 1) spinal cord. One of the female patients had neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). All four tumors showed anaplastic histology. Diffuse expression of MYCN protein was seen in all four MYCN-amplified samples but in none of the non-amplified cases, thus showing 100% concordance with FISH results. On follow-up, the NF2 patient developed widespread spinal dissemination while another developed recurrence proximal to the site of previous excision. To conclude, MYCN-amplified spinal ependymomas are rare tumors, accounting for similar to 4% of spinal cord ependymomas. Within the limitation of small sample size, MYCN IHC showed excellent concordance with MYCN gene amplification.

AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The occurrence of CRC is associated with various genetic and epigenetic mutations in intestinal epithelial cells that transform them into adenocarcinomas. There is increasing evidence indicating the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the regulation of host physiological processes. Alterations in gut microbiota composition are responsible for initiating carcinogenesis through diverse epigenetic modifications, including histone modifications, ncRNAs and DNA methylation. This work was designed to comprehensively review recent findings to provide insight into the associations between the gut microbiota and CRC at an epigenetic level. These scientific insights can be used in the future to develop effective strategies for early detection and treatment of CRC.
   Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. It happens when certain changes occur in the cells lining the intestine, turning them into cancerous growths. Recent studies suggest the collection of microbes in our gut, called the gut microbiota, plays a big role in how our body works. Dysregulation in gut microbiota composition is responsible for the development of colorectal cancer. This work provides a closer look at these recent discoveries to better understand how gut microbes might influence the development of colorectal cancer by affecting gene function. Understanding this connection may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer.
   The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the regulation of host physiological processes, and an imbalance in microbiota composition is linked to the initiation of colorectal cancer. The gut microbiota regulates the initiation of colorectal cancer through various epigenetic modifications.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Sepsis is a leading cause of death among children worldwide. Current pediatric-specific criteria for sepsis were published in 2005 based on expert opinion. In 2016, the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) defined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but it excluded children.
   OBJECTIVE To update and evaluate criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) convened a task force of 35 pediatric experts in critical care, emergency medicine, infectious diseases, general pediatrics, nursing, public health, and neonatology from 6 continents. Using evidence from an international survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and a new organ dysfunction score developed based on more than 3 million electronic health record encounters from 10 sites on 4 continents, a modified Delphi consensus process was employed to develop criteria.
   FINDINGS Based on survey data, most pediatric clinicians used sepsis to refer to infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction, which differed from prior pediatric sepsis criteria that used systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, which have poor predictive properties, and included the redundant term, severe sepsis. The SCCM task force recommends that sepsis in children be identified by a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points in children with suspected infection, which indicates potentially life-threatening dysfunction of the respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological systems. Children with a Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 points had in-hospital mortality of 7.1% in higher-resource settings and 28.5% in lower-resource settings, more than 8 times that of children with suspected infection not meeting these criteria. Mortality was higher in children who had organ dysfunction in at least 1 of 4-respiratory, cardiovascular, coagulation, and/or neurological-organ systems that was not the primary site of infection. Septic shock was defined as children with sepsis who had cardiovascular dysfunction, indicated by at least 1 cardiovascular point in the Phoenix Sepsis Score, which included severe hypotension for age, blood lactate exceeding 5 mmol/L, or need for vasoactive medication. Children with septic shock had an in-hospital mortality rate of 10.8% and 33.5% in higher- and lower-resource settings, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock in children were derived and validated by the international SCCM Pediatric Sepsis Definition Task Force using a large international database and survey, systematic review and meta-analysis, and modified Delphi consensus approach. A Phoenix Sepsis Score of at least 2 identified potentially life-threatening organ dysfunction in children younger than 18 years with infection, and its use has the potential to improve clinical care, epidemiological assessment, and research in pediatric sepsis and septic shock around the world.

AB  - External hemostatic agents play a crucial role in stabilizing an impaired process during pathological conditions. The idea is to stabilize the in vivo system as soon as possible. This study uses a class I hemostatic drug tranexamic acid as a reducing and capping agent for synthesizing the gold nanoparticles (Tr-AuNPs). Being the synthetic analogue of lysine and a biologically inspired alkylamine molecule, the chemistry can be fine-tuned for stable material that can simultaneously target the intrinsic and extrinsic hemostatic pathway, making it promising for hemostatic applications. The Tr-AuNPs of hydrodynamic diameter similar to 46 nm were synthesized and evaluated physio-chemically using various analytical techniques wherein they showed hemocompatibility and increased thrombus weight compared to the native drug. The decrease in prothrombin time (PT) and international normalized ratio supported by the dynamic thromboelastography (TEG) study indicates the prepared nano-conjugate's potential in reducing time for attaining hemostasis as compared to the native tranexamic acid drug. At a 9 mu g ml-1 concentration, Tr-AuNPs had a procoagulant effect, shown by decreased reaction time (R) and coagulation time (K) with improved alpha angle and MA. There was a significant increase in the rate of coagulation in vivo by Tr-AuNPs, i.e. (52 s) compared to the native tranexamic acid (360 s). Radiolabelling studies ascertained the in vivo biocompatibility (non-invasive distribution, residence, clearance, and stability) of the Tr-AuNPs. The short-term toxicity studies were conducted to establish a proof of concept for the biomedical application of the material. The results highlighted the use of biologically alkyl amine molecules as capping and reducing agents for the synthesis of nanoparticles, which have shown a synergistic effect on the coagulation cascade while holding the potential for also acting as potential theranostic agents.

AB  - Astroblastoma is an uncommon circumscribed glial tumor mostly involving the cerebral hemisphere. The characteristic molecular alteration is meningioma (disrupted in balanced translocation) 1 (MN1) rearrangement. No definite World Health Organization grade has been assigned as both low- and high-grade tumors are known to occur. Tumors in the spine are extremely rare; to date only three cases have been reported in the literature. A vigilant microscopy and ancillary testing aid in diagnosis when the tumors present in unusual locations, as in our case. The prompt differentiation of this tumor from its mimickers is a mandate as modalities of management are different and not clearly established.

AB  - Background: Activated platelets secrete platelet factor 4 (PF4), which contributes to viral pathogenesis. Recently, we reported the proviral role of PF4 in replication of closely related flaviviruses, Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and dengue virus (DENV). Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the detailed mechanism of PF4-mediated virus replication. Methods: PF4-/- or wild-type (WT) mice were infected with JEV, and host defense mechanisms, including autophagic/interferon (IFN) responses, were assessed. WT mice were pretreated with the CXCR3 antagonist AMG487 that inhibits PF4:CXCR3 pathway. This pathway was tested in PF4-/- monocytes infected with DENV or in monocytes isolated from patients with DENV infection. Results: PF4-/- mice infected with JEV showed reduced viral load and improved brain inflammation and survival. PF4-/- mice synthesized more IFN-alpha/13 with higher expression of phosphorylated IRF3 in the brain. PF4 treatment decreased IRF-3/7/9 and IFN alpha/13 expression and suppressed autophagic LC3-II flux and lysosomal degradation of viral proteins in JEV-infected cells. PF4 increased the expression of P-mTOR, P -p38, and P-ULK1Ser757 and decreased expression of LC3-II. Decreased autophagosomelysosome fusion in turn promoted DENV2 replication. The above processes were reversed by AMG487. Uninfected PF4-/- monocytes showed elevated LC3-II and autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Microglia of JEV-infected PF4-/- mice exhibited elevated LC3-II inversely related to viral load. Similarly, monocytes from PF4-/- mice showed reduced infection by DENV2. In patients with DENV infection, higher plasma PF4 and viral load were inversely correlated with LC3-II, LAMP-1, and lysosomal degradation of DENV-NS1 in monocytes during the febrile phase. Conclusion: These studies suggest that PF4 deficiency or inhibition of the PF4:CXCR3 pathway prevents JEV and DENV infection. The studies also highlight the PF4:CXCR3 axis as a potential target to develop treatment regimens against flaviviruses.

AB  - Background: Genome-wide association studies identify SORT1 gene associated with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Sortilin protein enhances LDL absorption, form cell development, and atherosclerosis in macrophages. Aim: We therefore explored SORT1 expression in CAD patients and its gene expression's predictive usefulness for the severity of the disease. Methodology: This is a case control study and Quantitative real-time PCR; Sandwich ELISA and western blotting were used to determine the expression of SORT1 gene at the mRNA and protein level in two hundred healthy controls and two hundred patients with various CAD syndromes. Results: CAD patients exhibit higher SORT1 gene expression in CAD patients, a higher concentration of sortilin in their plasma, and distinct expression patterns in various CAD syndromes. The study reveals a positive correlation between gene expression and the severity of coronary artery stenosis, the number of diseased vessels, and the presence of diabetes. ROC curve analysis of SORT1 gene expression both at mRNA and protein level showed strong discrimination between significant CAD and control subjects. Conclusion: Therefore, elevated SORT1 gene expression in various CAD syndromes may be a potential biomarker for the disease.

AB  - ObjectiveBenchmarking has been proposed to reflect surgical quality and represents the highest standard reference values for desirable results. We sought to determine benchmark outcomes in patients after surgery for drug-resistant mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE).MethodsThis retrospective multicenter study included patients who underwent MTLE surgery at 19 expert centers on five continents. Benchmarks were defined for 15 endpoints covering surgery and epilepsy outcome at discharge, 1 year after surgery, and the last available follow-up. Patients were risk-stratified by applying outcome-relevant comorbidities, and benchmarks were calculated for low-risk ("benchmark") cases. Respective measures were derived from the median value at each center, and the 75th percentile was considered the benchmark cutoff.ResultsA total of 1119 patients with a mean age (range) of 36.7 (1-74) years and a male-to-female ratio of 1:1.1 were included. Most patients (59.2%) underwent anterior temporal lobe resection with amygdalohippocampectomy. The overall rate of complications or neurological deficits was 14.4%, with no in-hospital death. After risk stratification, 377 (33.7%) benchmark cases of 1119 patients were identified, representing 13.6%-72.9% of cases per center and leaving 742 patients in the high-risk cohort. Benchmark cutoffs for any complication, clinically apparent stroke, and reoperation rate at discharge were <= 24.6%, <=.5%, and <= 3.9%, respectively. A favorable seizure outcome (defined as International League Against Epilepsy class I and II) was reached in 83.6% at 1 year and 79.0% at the last follow-up in benchmark cases, leading to benchmark cutoffs of >= 75.2% (1-year follow-up) and >= 69.5% (mean follow-up of 39.0 months).SignificanceThis study presents internationally applicable benchmark outcomes for the efficacy and safety of MTLE surgery. It may allow for comparison between centers, patient registries, and novel surgical and interventional techniques.

AB  - Introduction: The predominant reason for the discontinuation of low glycemic index therapy (LGIT) in children with epilepsy is the dietary restrictions imposed therein. This trial intended to compare the efficacy of daily and intermittent LGIT in children with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Methods: This study was performed between February 2018 and January 2019 to compare the efficacy of daily and intermittent LGIT in children aged 1-15 years with DRE following 24 weeks of dietary therapy. Compliance, the difficulty faced by caregivers, adverse effects, impact on behaviour, and social quotient in both arms were compared. Children in the intermittent LGIT arm received a liberalized diet for two days every week (Saturday and Sunday), which also allowed medium glycemic index foods. Carbohydrate calories were allowed up to 20% of the total caloric requirement in the liberalized diet, as compared to only 10% in standard LGIT. Results: Out of 132 children randomized (66 in each group), 122 completed 24 weeks follow up. Mean weekly seizure frequency reduction at 24 weeks in the intermittent LGIT group was comparable with that of the daily LGIT group in both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analysis (-50.95%+/- 22.34% vs -47.16%+/- 23.41%, p=0.36 in ITT and -53.88%+/- 20.54% vs -49.20%+/- 21.87%, p=0.23) in per-protocol analysis for intermittent and daily LGIT group respectively). The proportion with >= 50% reduction in seizure frequency was also comparable between both groups (p=0.73 and 0.56 in ITT and per protocol analysis respectively). The proportion of patients with adverse events and satisfactory compliance rate also had a trend towards favoring intermittent LGIT (p=0.06 and 0.51, respectively), while caregiver difficulty was lower with intermittent LGIT (p=0.001). Conclusions: Intermittent LGIT is comparable to daily LGIT in terms of seizure frequency reduction after 24 weeks of dietary therapy.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to examine the postoperative outcomes and follow-up QOL of patients after AWR at a level-1 trauma centre in India.MethodsThe study cohort included AWR patients treated between January 2011 and July 2022. The Activities Assessment Scale (AAS) was used to measure QOL, and the Ventral Hernia Recurrence Inventory (VHRI) was used to determine the occurrence of recurrence. In patients suspected of having recurrence, thorough clinical examination and relevant imaging were performed to confirm or rule out recurrence.ResultsOut of 89 patients, 35 patients whose complete perioperative and follow-up data were available were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 28 (SD, 9) years. The mean defect size was 14. 9 (SD, 7) cm. The mean time from laparotomy to AWR surgery was 21 months. During the postoperative course, 37% of patients developed complications, such as SSI and seroma. The mean follow-up time was 53 (SD, 43) months.Upon comparing procedures involving the mesh placed in the sublay position with procedures involving the mesh placed in other positions, no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate (one in each group, p = 0.99), surgical complication rate (33% v/s 66%, p = 0.6), or mean AAS QOL score (94.7 v/s 98, p = 0.4) was observed. The specificity of the VHRI for diagnosing recurrence was 79%.ResultsOut of 89 patients, 35 patients whose complete perioperative and follow-up data were available were enrolled.

The specificity of the VHRI for diagnosing recurrence was 79%.ConclusionOverall, the recurrence rate was low in these patients despite the presence of large hernia defects. Long-term QOL was not affected by the specific procedure used. Timely planning and execution are more important than the specific repair approach for post-trauma laparotomy ventral hernia.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesNucleic acid amplification testing (NAT), in blood services context, is used for the detection of viral and parasite nucleic acids to reduce transfusion-transmitted infections. This project reviewed NAT for screening blood donations globally.Materials and MethodsA survey on NAT usage, developed by the International Society of Blood Transfusion Working Party on Transfusion-transmitted Infectious Diseases (ISBT WP-TTID), was distributed through ISBT WP-TTID members. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultsForty-three responses were received from 32 countries. Increased adoption of blood donation viral screening by NAT was observed over the past decade. NAT-positive donations were detected for all viruses tested in 2019 (proportion of donations positive by NAT were 0.0099% for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV], 0.0063% for hepatitis C virus [HCV], 0.0247% for hepatitis B virus [HBV], 0.0323% for hepatitis E virus [HEV], 0.0014% for West Nile virus [WNV] and 0.00005% for Zika virus [ZIKV]). Globally, over 3100 NAT-positive donations were identified as NAT yield or solely by NAT in 2019 and over 22,000 since the introduction of NAT, with HBV accounting for over half. NAT-positivity rate was higher in first-time donors for all viruses tested except WNV. During 2019, a small number of participants performed NAT for parasites (Trypanosoma cruzi, Babesia spp., Plasmodium spp.).ConclusionThis survey captures current use of blood donation NAT globally. There has been increased NAT usage over the last decade. It is clear that NAT contributes to improving blood transfusion safety globally; however, there is a need to overcome economic barriers for regions/countries not performing NAT.

AB  - Hypophosphatemic rickets/osteomalacia caused by FGF23 excess is conventionally treated with multiple doses of inorganic phosphate salts and active vitamin D analogs. However, conventional therapy targets the consequences of elevated FGF23 and not the elevated FGF23 itself and is associated with poor adherence and long-term complications such as nephrocalcinosis and secondary/tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Burosumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralises FGF-23, thereby leading to improvement in phosphate homeostasis and healing of rickets and osteomalacia. Data from phase 2 and 3 trials report overall safety and efficacy and Burosumab is now FDA approved for treatment of XLH and TIO in children and adults. Cost and absence of long-term data are major issues with Burosumab which should be addressed in near future. At present, experts recommend Burosumab use in patients with severe disease or those with mild -moderate disease and a failed response to a trial of conventional therapy. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Current treatment options available for prostate cancer (PCa) patients have many adverse side effects and hence, new alternative therapies need to be explored. Anticancer potential of various phytochemicals derived from Calotropis procera has been studied in many cancers but no study has investigated the effect of leaf extract of C. procera on PCa cells. Hence, we investigated the effect of C. procera leaf extract (CPE) on cellular properties of androgen-independent PC-3 and androgen-sensitive 22Rv1 cells. A hydroalcoholic extract of C. procera was prepared and MTT assay was performed to study the effect of CPE on viability of PCa cells. The effect of CPE on cell division ability, migration capability and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was studied using colony formation assay, wound-healing assay and 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay, respectively. Caspase activity assay and LDH assay were performed to study the involvement of apoptosis and necrosis in CPE-mediated cell death. Protein levels of cell cycle, antioxidant, autophagy and apoptosis markers were measured by western blot. The composition of CPE was identified using untargeted LC-MS analysis. Results showed that CPE decreased the viability of both the PCa cells, PC-3 and 22Rv1, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Also, CPE significantly inhibited the colony-forming ability, migration and endogenous ROS production in both the cell lines. Furthermore, CPE significantly decreased NF-kappa B protein levels and increased the protein levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27. A significant increase in expression of autophagy markers was observed in CPE-treated PC-3 cells while autophagy markers were downregulated in 22Rv1 cells after CPE exposure. Hence, it can be concluded that CPE inhibits PCa cell viability possibly by regulating the autophagy pathway and/or altering the ROS levels. Thus, CPE can be explored as a possible alternative therapeutic agent for PCa.

AB  - Over the last decade, High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) gained recognition in various sectors (nuclear, aerospace, marine, and biomedical) due to their excellent strength, thermal stability, biocompatibility, wear and corrosion characteristics. This study deals with the development of a novel HEA through a microwave-assisted powder metallurgy, which is an economical approach and overcome the limitations of conventional fabrication techniques. A series of multi-principal alloys are developed, and noted that the HEA is developed through 15 h of ball milling of metallic powders followed by compaction and microwave sintering at 1400 degrees C at controlled heating and cooling rates. Thus, developed alloys were further examined to record their mechanical properties, tribological, and corrosion responses. The microstructural and metallurgical changes were recorded using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, the tribological and corrosive responses were recorded using a multifunctional tribometer and a potentiostat (potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)). It is observed that the 1400 degrees C sintered HEA exhibited superior mechanical, tribological, and corrosive properties. It is worth hypothesizing that the transformation of dual phases (BCC and FCC) to the single BCC phase was responsible for the exceptional properties. Hence, this affordable fabrication approach can be used to develop bulk HEAs to explore other functional characteristics in the future.

AB  - Aurora kinase B (AURK-B) is a serine/threonine kinase protein that plays an essential role in chromosomal separation during the cell cycle event. AURK-B is highly expressed in various types of cancer such as human seminoma, thyroid carcinoma, non -small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), oral carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Hence, it is a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of various cancers. The structure of AURK-B in complex with one of its substrate inner centromeric protein (INCENP) is present, but the structural and functional characterization of native AURK-B at different pH environment is still unexplored.This study determines the effect of different pH milieu on the structure and function of AURK-B protein wherein the influence of pH on the protein conformation was probed using Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The structural studies were further combined with functional activity assay to observe the change in kinase activity at various pH milieu (2.0-11.0). CD and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments dictate that at high acidic conditions (pH 2.0 - 5.0), the secondary and tertiary structures of AURK-B become distorted, leading to diminished activity. The protein, however, was observed to stabilize towards pH 7.0 - 8.0 with minimal structure alteration over the basic pH range (pH 9.0 -11.0). The measured spectroscopic structural features were found to be in -line with obtained experimental kinase activity assays. Further, in -vitro experiments indicate that the enzyme is maximally active at pH 8.0. More ordered conformation and compact structure was observed at this pH (pH 8.0) as compared to other pH values through molecular dynamics simulation studies (MDS). As AURK-B localizes itself in the intracellular compartment, this study may provide a clue about the role of different pH environments in enhancing cancer growth, proliferation, and invasion.

TI  - Seasonal variations in social contact patterns in a rural population in north India: Implications for pandemic control
T2  - PLOS ONE
KW  - SPREAD
AB  - Social contact mixing patterns are critical to model the transmission of communicable diseases, and have been employed to model disease outbreaks including COVID-19. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of studies on contact mixing in low and middle-income countries such as India. Furthermore, mathematical models of disease outbreaks do not account for the temporal nature of social contacts. We conducted a longitudinal study of social contacts in rural north India across three seasons and analysed the temporal differences in contact patterns. A contact diary survey was performed across three seasons from October 2015-16, in which participants were queried on the number, duration, and characteristics of contacts that occurred on the previous day. A total of 8,421 responses from 3,052 respondents (49% females) recorded characteristics of 180,073 contacts. Respondents reported a significantly higher number and duration of contacts in the winter, followed by the summer and the monsoon season (Nemenyi post-hoc, p<0.001). Participants aged 0-9 years and 10-19 years of age reported the highest median number of contacts (16 (IQR 12-21), 17 (IQR 13-24) respectively) and were found to have the highest node centrality in the social network of the region (pageranks = 0.20, 0.17). A large proportion (>80%) of contacts that were reported in schools or on public transport involved physical contact. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first from India to show that contact mixing patterns vary by the time of the year and provides useful implications for pandemic control. We compared the differences in the number, duration and location of contacts by age-group and gender, and studied the impact of the season, age-group, employment and day of the week on the number and duration of contacts using multivariate negative binomial regression. We created a social network to further understand the age and gender-specific contact patterns, and used the contact matrices in each season to parameterise a nine-compartment agent-based model for simulating a COVID-19 epidemic in each season. Our results can be used to parameterize more accurate mathematical models for prediction of epidemiological trends of infections in rural India.

AB  - Background: Despite the acknowledged diagnostic detection rate of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in prostate cancer, little is known about the quality of evidence, particularly focusing on prospective studies. Most systematic reviews are based on retrospective reports. Rationale and Objectives: To conduct systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies reporting the diagnostic detection rate of PSMA PET (computed tomography (CT) and MR) for the detection of biochemically recurrent metastatic prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus, from database until March 1, 2023 for randomized controlled trials and prospective studies using PSMA PET imaging in prostate cancer. The primary endpoint was to assess diagnostic detection rate of PSMA PET imaging in the detection of recurrent prostate cancer in men with biochemical relapse following radical treatment. We calculated the pooled overall diagnostic detection rate with 95% CI using a random-effects model and assessed the heterogeneity between the studies including risk of biases estimation. Results: A total of 6800 patients from 32 articles were included in this study. The overall detection rate of PSMA PET for prostate cancer was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.63, 0.71). For histologically confirmed lymph nodes, the PPV from 13 prospective studies containing 1496 patients was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93, 0.99). We performed a subgroup analysis of PSMA PET detection rates according to categorically grouped Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) values of 0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-2.0, and > 2.0 ng/ml and obtained detection rates of 0.44, 0.63, 0.82, and 0.94, respectively. The detection rate of 18F PSMA was better in men with a PSA between 1 ng/ml and 2 ng/ml in comparison to 68Ga PSMA (0.91 with 95% CI 0.81-0.99 vs. 0.79 with 95% CI 0.73, 0.85). Conclusion: PSMA PET imaging provides a good detection rate for the metastatic recurrence of prostate cancer in men with biochemical relapse following radical treatment. The detection rate improves significantly above a serum PSA value of 1 ng/ml. The diagnostic detection rate of 18F-PSMA is best at PSA values between 1 and 2 ng/ml, in comparison to 68Ga PSMA. This conclusion is heavily biased, further research needs to focus on better methodology to minimize the risk of biases.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the effect of weight reduction on the structural and functional parameters of the optic nerve in established cases of papilledema in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH).Methods A prospective observational study in early and established cases of papilledema in IIH presenting from December 2019 to February 2021. Functional parameters (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, mean deviation, VER), structural parameters (RNFL, GCL-IPL, and optic disc height), and clinical grading of papilledema were measured at baseline and every 6 weeks for 6 months. All patients underwent medical (oral acetazolamide) and diet therapy.Results Mean body mass index (BMI) at presentation was 26.32 +/- 3.52 kg/m(2) and the mean change in BMI over 6 months was 1.27 +/- 0.50 kg/m(2). 67% of eyes had papilledema of grades 2-3 at the presentation. At the end of 6 months, 75% of eyes had grade 1 papilledema while 13% showed complete resolution. A reduction of 5.32 +/- 3.58 in mean deviation (r = 0.316; p-value 0.01) and gain in VER P100 amplitude of 4.2 +/- 2.7 mu V (r = 0.40; p-value 0.003) were noted over 6 months with reduction in BMI over 6 months. A statistically significant reduction in optic disc height (ODH) was noticed with BMI reduction over 6 months (p = 0.0007; r = 0.45). A reduction of 1.72 +/- 0.90 kg/m(2) (equivalent to 6.53% weight loss) in BMI was associated with a four-grade change in clinical grading of papilledema.Results Mean body mass index (BMI) at presentation was 26.32 +/- 3.52 kg/m(2) and the mean change in BMI over 6 months was 1.27 +/- 0.50 kg/m(2). 67% of eyes had papilledema of grades 2-3 at the presentation. At the end of 6 months, 75% of eyes had grade 1 papilledema while 13% showed complete resolution. A reduction of 5.32 +/- 3.58 in mean deviation (r = 0.316; p-value 0.01) and gain in VER P100 amplitude of 4.2 +/- 2.7 mu V (r = 0.40; p-value 0.003) were noted over 6 months with reduction in BMI over 6 months. A statistically significant reduction in optic disc height (ODH) was noticed with BMI reduction over 6 months (p = 0.0007; r = 0.45). A reduction of 1.72 +/- 0.90 kg/m(2) (equivalent to 6.53% weight loss) in BMI was associated with a four-grade change in clinical grading of papilledema.Conclusion Reduction in BMI had a significant impact on both structural and functional parameters of the optic nerve in IIH. The involvement of a well-certified dietician should be an integral part of treatment in IIH.

AB  - The rising incidence of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) after cyanoacrylate adhesive use necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its clinical presentations, risk factors, and management. In this systematic review, we conducted an exhaustive search following PRISMA guidelines within Medline and PubMed databases to identify studies reporting cases of ACD resulting from cyanoacrylate adhesive application in wound closure. A total of 47 studies, covering 193 ACD cases, were included in our analysis. These cases involved 35 male, 120 female patients, and 38 cases without gender information (M:F ratio = 1:3.43), with ages ranging from 7 to 92 years (mean age 43.9 years). The majority of cases (n = 140) were part of 6 orthopedic studies, focusing on joint replacements (n = 68), orthopedic surgeries (n = 38), and breast surgeries (n = 29). The remaining 58 cases encompassed various surgical procedures. Common clinical manifestations included swelling, pruritic rash, erythema, vesicles, and itching around the surgical sites, typically appearing around 10 days post-adhesive application (within a range of 6 hours to 6 weeks). Patients with prior exposure to 2-octyl cyanoacrylate tended to exhibit earlier symptoms. Similar rates of dermatitis were observed across different adhesive brands, suggesting brand independence. Treatment strategies involved adhesive removal, administration of steroids and antihistamines, meticulous wound care, and, in some cases, surgical intervention. Notably, 3.1% of the 193 cases required surgical intervention. Risk factors, including a history of atopic dermatitis, high body mass index, diabetes, prior adhesive exposure, and surgical history, were identified in the studies. Patch tests confirmed 2-octyl cyanoacrylate as the allergen in 21 studies. Our review aims to enhance health care professionals' understanding of ACD resulting from the use of cyanoacrylate adhesive, facilitating improved postsurgical management and prevention strategies. Recognizing diverse risk factors, understanding varying clinical presentations, distinguishing ACD from infection, and employing appropriate treatment approaches are essential for achieving optimal outcomes in such cases.

AB  - This case study delineates the proficient creation of a silicone finger prosthesis, tailored for a patient contending with partial digit amputation. The prosthesis was devised with the overarching goal of reinstating not only the physiological dexterity of the hand but also its aesthetic integrity and the patient's psychological equilibrium. The crafting process entailed a meticulous technique to replicate the intricate texture of the skin in order to guarantee a near normal appearance. Post-prosthesis integration, the patient exhibited enhancements in manual functionality and articulated a heightened self-assuredness because of the indiscernible prosthesis. This illustrative case underscores the efficacy of silicone finger prosthetics in conferring both functional and aesthetic restitution to those afflicted with partial digit amputations.

AB  - Background: Adult soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare and diverse. Current management is based on limited literature from the West. Therefore, data from different geographical regions is required, including the low-middle-income countries. This is our experience managing adult sarcomas in the tertiary cancer center of North India. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective analysis of the structured sarcoma database of patients treated in the surgical oncology department between 1992 and 2020. The descriptive analysis includes demography, site distribution, diagnosis, histopathology variations, prior surgical interventions, and stage. Results: A total of 1106 soft tissue sarcoma patients were treated in three decades. Age distribution was 13%, 43%, 31%, and 11% in <20, 21-40, and 41-60 and >60 years, respectively. The male-to-female ratio was 1.73. The anatomical distribution was 17%, 42%, 23%, 7%, 7%, and 3% in upper extremity, lower extremity, trunk, retroperitoneum, head and neck, and viscera, respectively. Overall, 49% of patients had undergone prior suboptimal surgeries at community hospitals. Common histology subtypes were synovial sarcoma (18%), undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) (13%), dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (12%), and liposarcoma (9%). A pathological discordance of 13% was identified between the initial and the final histologies. Overall, 61% of tumors were high-grade. Memorial Sloan Kettering Stages II and III were present in 33% and 35% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: This is one of the largest single institutional experiences of STS from the Asian population. Mostly young adults were affected with male preponderance. The lower extremity and trunk were common subsites. Frequent histologies were synovial sarcoma and UPS. A high rate of suboptimal surgical intervention at the community level and pathological discordance was noted. This study highlights the need to establish prospective structured databases for capturing quality information related to rare malignancies and providing insights for future research.

AB  - Introduction: As individuals age, their sleep patterns change, and sleep disturbances can increase the risk of dementia. Poor sleep quality can be a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. Epidemiological studies show a connection between sleep quality and cognitive changes, with brain imaging revealing grey matter volume reduction and amyloid beta accumulation in Alzheimer's disease. However, most research has focused on Europeans, with little attention to other ethnic groups. Methods: This is a cross sectional study comparing effects across countries and ethnicities. Group 1 (n = 193) will be Indians residing in India (new participant recruitment), Group 2 will be South Asians residing in UK and group 3 will be Europeans residing in the UK. For group 2 and 3 (n = 193), data already collected by UK-based Southall and Brent REvisited (SABRE) tri-ethnic study will be used. For group 1, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI) will be used for assessment of sleep quality, Indian Council of Medical Research (Neurocognitive ToolBox) (ICMR-NCTB) for cognition testing and a 3 T MRI cerebral scan for brain morphometry. The data will be compared to sleep, cognitive function and brain MRI parameters from SABRE. Discussion: Racial and ethnic differences can impact the relationships of cognitive function, sleep quality and brain structure in older adults. Earlier studies have highlighted higher prevalence of poor sleep among black individuals compared to white individuals. Genetic or epigenetic mechanisms may contribute to these variations. Socio-cultural and environmental factors, such as neighbourhood, migration, lifestyle, stress and perceived discrimination may influence sleep patterns. The aim of the study is to examine the ethnogeographic variations in sleep quality, cognitive performance and brain morphometry among Indians living in India, and South Asians and Europeans residing in the UK.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of the P4 suicide screener in a multinational sample. The primary goal was to evaluate the reliability and validity of the scale and investigate its convergent validity by analyzing its correlation with depression, anxiety, and substance use. Study design: The study design is a cross-sectional self -report study conducted across 42 countries. Methods: A cross-sectional, self -report study was conducted in 42 countries, with a total of 82,243 participants included in the final data set. Results: The study provides an overview of suicide ideation rates across 42 countries and confirms the structural validity of the P4 screener. The findings indicated that sexual and gender minority individuals exhibited higher rates of suicidal ideation. The P4 screener showed adequate reliability, convergence, and discriminant validity, and a cutoff score of 1 is recommended to identify individuals at risk of suicidal behavior. Conclusions: The study supports the reliability and validity of the P4 suicide screener across 42 diverse countries, highlighting the importance of using a cross-cultural suicide risk assessment to standardize the identification of high -risk individuals and tailoring culturally sensitive suicide prevention strategies.

AB  - Focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) is 1 of the primary causes of nephrotic syndrome in both pediatric and adult patients, which can lead to end -stage kidney disease. Recurrence of FSGS after kidney transplantation significantly increases allograft loss, leading to morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are no consensus guidelines for identifying those patients who are at risk for recurrence or for the management of recurrent FSGS. Our work group performed a literature search on PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane, and recommendations were proposed and graded for strength of evidence. Of the 614 initially identified studies, 221 were found suitable to formulate consensus guidelines for recurrent FSGS. These guidelines focus on the definition, epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, and management of recurrent FSGS. We conclude that additional studies are required to strengthen the recommendations proposed in this review.

AB  - Urothelial Carcinoma of Bladder is complex disease with high mortality and recurrence rates. Current standard regimes have exhibited anti-tumor activity but still, a proportion of patients are non-responsive or in-eligible to receive such treatments. Immune checkpoints have emerged as potential class of therapeutics to be tested in UCB patients. Clinical trials targeting PD-1/PD-L1 axis have been tested in UCB but still a proportion of patients are non-responsive to it which stresses upon identifying new targets. New immune checkpoint B7-H4 has been shown to negatively regulate T cell activity in cancer and is a poor prognostic factor in various solid tumors. In this study we assessed the novel immune checkpoint B7-H4 status in UCB patients. We observed elevated expression of B7-H4 and PD-L1 on CD8+ T cells in circulation of UCB patients. Relative mRNA expression and immunohistochemistry displayed upregulation in bladder tumor tissue. Increased expression of B7-H4 along with PD-L1 in periphery and tumor of UCB patients highlights involvement of B7-H4 in disease progression. Combinatorial blocking of B7-H4 and PD-L1 enhanced IFN-gamma and granzyme B in CD8+ T cells functional T cell immune response in UCB patients. Also, B7-H4 was significantly associated with clinico-pathological parameters. Our findings highlight B7-H4 as potential therapeutic target for treatment of UCB patients in future after further validation.

AB  - In dry deciduous tropical forests, both seasons (winter and summer) offer habitats that are essential ecologically. How these seasonal changes affect soil properties and microbial communities is not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the influence of seasonal fluctuations on soil characteristics and microbial populations. The soil moisture content dramatically increases in the summer. However, the soil pH only gradually shifts from acidic to slightly neutral. During the summer, electrical conductivity (EC) values range from 0.62 to 1.03 ds m-1, in contrast to their decline in the winter. The levels of soil macronutrients and micronutrients increase during the summer, as does the quantity of soil organic carbon (SOC). A two-way ANOVA analysis reveals limited impacts of seasonal fluctuations and specific geographic locations on the amounts of accessible nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). Moreover, dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase, and urease activities rise in the summer, while chitinase, protease, and acid phosphatase activities are more pronounced in the winter. The soil microbes were identified in both seasons through 16S rRNA and ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) gene sequencing. Results revealed Proteobacteria and Ascomycota as predominant bacterial and fungal phyla. However, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia are dominant bacterial genera, and Aspergillus, Alternaria, and Trichoderma are dominant fungal genera in the forest soil samples. Dominant bacterial and fungal genera may play a role in essential ecosystem services such as soil health management and nutrient cycling. In both seasons, clear relationships exist between soil properties, including pH, moisture, iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and microbial diversity. Enzymatic activities and microbial shift relate positively with soil parameters. This study highlights robust soil-microbial interactions that persist mainly in the top layers of tropical dry deciduous forests in the summer and winter seasons. It provides insights into the responses of soil-microbial communities to seasonal changes, advancing our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity preservation.

TI  - Generation of two human induced pluripotent stem cell lines, IGIBi012-A and IGIBi013-A from Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients with homozygous GAA repeat expansion in<i> FXN</i> gene
T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the hyper expansion of (GAA-TTC)n triplet repeats in the first intron of the FXN gene. Here, we generated iPSC lines from two individuals with FRDA, both of whom have homozygous GAA repeat expansion in the first intron of FXN gene. Both iPSC lines demonstrated characteristics of pluripotency, including expression of pluripotency markers, stable karyotypes and ability to develop into all three germ layers, and presence of GAA repeat expansion with reduced FXN mRNA expression. These iPSC lines will serve as invaluable tools for investigating the pathophysiology and phenotypes of FRDA.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the utility of simple, cost-effective, and non-invasive strategies alternative to BIPSS and peripheral CRH stimulation in differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent CS. First, we performed ROC analysis to evaluate the performance of various tests for differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent CS in our cohort (CD, n=76 and EAS, n=23) and derived their optimal cut-offs. Subsequently, combining various demographic (gender), clinical (hypokalemia), biochemical (plasma ACTH, HDDST, peripheral CRH stimulation) and imaging (MRI pituitary) parameters, we derived non-invasive models with 100% PPV for CD. Patients with pituitary macroadenoma (n=14) were excluded from the analysis involving non-invasive models. Relative percent ACTH (AUC: 0.933) and cortisol (AUC: 0.975) increase on peripheral CRH stimulation demonstrated excellent accuracy in discriminating CD from EAS. Best cut-offs for CD were plasma ACTH<97.3 pg/ml, HDDST >= 57% cortisol suppression, CRH stimulation >= 77% ACTH increase and >= 11% cortisol increase. We derived six models that provided 100% PPV for CD and precluded the need for BIPPS in 35/85 (41.2%) patients with ACTH-dependent CS and no macroadenoma (in whom BIPSS would have otherwise been recommended). The first three models included basic parameters and avoided both peripheral CRH stimulation and BIPSS in 19 (22.4%) patients, while the next three models included peripheral CRH stimulation and avoided BIPSS in another 16 (18.8%) patients. Using simple and non-invasive alternative strategies, BIPSS can be avoided in 41% and peripheral CRH stimulation in 22% of patients with ACTH-dependent CS and no macroadenoma; such patients can be directly referred for a pituitary surgery.

AB  - IntroductionTrauma burden is one of the leading causes of young human life and economic loss in low- and middle-income countries. Improved emergency and trauma care systems may save up to 2 million lives in these countries.MethodThis is a comprehensive expert opinion participated by 4 experts analyzing 6 Asian countries compiling the most pressing trauma care issues in Asia as well as goal directed solutions for uplifting of trauma care in these countries.ResultLack of legislation, stable funding under a dedicated lead agency is a major deterrent to development and sustainment of trauma systems in most Asian countries. While advocating trauma, critical care as a specialty is a key event in the system establishment, Trauma specialized training is challenging in low resource settings and can be circumvented by regional cooperation in creating trauma specialized academic centers of excellence. Trauma quality improvement process is integral to the system maturity but acquisition and analysis of quality data through trauma specific registries is the least developed in the Asian setting.

AB  - IntroductionOsteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability and is a multi-factorial disease. Moreover, it is partly considered a mechanically driven disease in which higher abnormally disbursed forces play a prime role. With the progression of the disease, the gait function declines, so a comprehensive and objective evaluation of gait function would help in prognostic evaluation and management.Materials and MethodsThis study included two groups: patients with primary knee osteoarthritis and a control group of healthy volunteers. Gait analysis and functional knee scores were evaluated for all the subjects. The KOOS score, temporal parameters excluding the step length, and spatial parameters excluding the stance phase percentage were evaluated for an individual as a whole. The KSS score, kinetic parameters, kinematic parameters, step length, and stance phase percentage were calculated for each knee separately. Each knee of the patient and controls was taken as 1 sample and categorized as per Kellgren-Lawrence score. An asymptomatic control group of subjects were included in group A. Symptomatic patients with KL grades 1, 2 were included in group M, and those with KL grades 3, 4 were included in group S. The kinetic and kinematic parameters and KSS score were compared among the three groups.ResultsA total of 60 subjects were included of which 40 were patients and 20 were controls. In the control group, the age ranged from 22 to 48 years with a mean age of 28.6 years. In the patient group, the mean age was 60.3 years. Patients with knee osteoarthritis were significantly obese with slower walking speed, short stride length, longer stride time, and decreased cadence compared to the asymptomatic group. There was a significant difference in spatiotemporal parameters, functional scores, and kinetic and kinematic parameters among the groups.ConclusionVarious spatiotemporal, kinetic, and kinematic parameters like peak knee flexion angle, abduction/adduction angle, peak knee adduction moment, range of knee flexion, peak knee flexion, and gait deviation index along with functional scores varied significantly with the progression of the disease.

AB  - Differentiating BRAF V600E- and RAS-altered encapsulated follicular-patterned thyroid tumors based on morphology remains challenging. This study aimed to validate an 8-score scale nuclear scoring system and investigate the importance of nuclear pseudoinclusions (NPIs) in aiding this differentiation. A cohort of 44 encapsulated follicular-patterned tumors with varying degrees of nuclear atypia and confirmed BRAF V600E or RAS alterations was studied. Nuclear parameters (area, diameter, and optical density) were analyzed using a deep learning model. Twelve pathologists from eight Asian countries visually assessed 22 cases after excluding the cases with any papillae. Eight nuclear features were applied, yielding a semi-quantitative score from 0 to 24. A threshold score of 14 was used to distinguish between RAS- and BRAF V600E-altered tumors. BRAF V600E-altered tumors typically demonstrated higher nuclear scores and notable morphometric alterations. Specifically, the nuclear area and diameter were significantly larger, and nuclear optical density was much lower compared to RAS-altered tumors. Observer accuracy varied, with two pathologists correctly identifying genotype of all cases. Observers were categorized into proficiency groups, with the highest group maintaining consistent accuracy across both evaluation methods. The lower group showed a significant improvement in accuracy upon utilizing the 8-score scale nuclear scoring system, with notably increased sensitivity and negative predictive value in BRAF V600E tumor detection. BRAF V600E-altered tumors had higher median total nuclear scores. Detailed reevaluation revealed NPIs in all BRAF V600E-altered cases, but in only 2 of 14 RAS-altered cases. These results could significantly assist pathologists, particularly those not specializing in thyroid pathology, in making a more accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Introduction A limited subset of HIV-1 infected adult individuals typically after at least 2-3 years of chronic infection, develop broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), suggesting that highly conserved neutralizing epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein are difficult for B cell receptors to effectively target, during natural infection. Recent studies have shown the evolution of bnAbs in HIV-1 infected infants.Methods We used bulk BCR sequencing (BCR-seq) to profile the B cell receptors from longitudinal samples (3 time points) collected from a rare pair of antiretroviralnaive, HIV-1 infected pediatric monozygotic twins (AIIMS_329 and AIIMS_330) who displayed elite plasma neutralizing activity against HIV-1.Results BCR-seq of both twins revealed convergent antibody characteristics including V-gene use, CDRH3 lengths and somatic hypermutation (SHM). Further, antibody clonotypes with genetic features similar to highly potent bnAbs isolated from adults showed ongoing development in donor AIIMS_330 but not in AIIMS_329, corroborating our earlier findings based on plasma bnAbs responses. An increase in SHM was observed in sequences of the IgA isotype from AIIMS_330.Discussion This study suggests that children living with chronic HIV-1 can develop clonotypes of HIV-1 bnAbs against multiple envelope epitopes similar to those isolated from adults, highlighting that such B cells could be steered to elicit bnAbs responses through vaccines aimed to induce bnAbs against HIV-1 in a broad range of people including children.

AB  - Objectives: To compare COVID-19-associated pulmonary mucormycosis (CAPM) with COVID-19associated rhino-orbital mucormycosis (CAROM), ascertain factors associated with CAPM among patients with COVID-19, and identify factors associated with 12-week mortality in CAPM. Methods: We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study. All study participants had COVID-19. We enrolled CAPM, CAROM, and COVID-19 subjects without mucormycosis (controls; age-matched). We collected information on demography, predisposing factors, and details of COVID-19 illness. Univariable analysis was used to compare CAPM and CAROM. We used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with CAPM (with hypoxemia during COVID-19 as the primary exposure) and at 12-week mortality. Results: We included 1724 cases (CAPM [n = 122], CAROM [n = 1602]) and 3911 controls. Male sex, renal transplantation, multimorbidity, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, intensive care admission, and cumulative glucocorticoid dose for COVID-19 were significantly higher in CAPM than in CAROM. On multivariable analysis, COVID-19-related hypoxemia (aOR, 2.384; 95% CI, 1.209-4.70 0), male sex, rural residence, diabetes mellitus, serum C-reactive protein, glucocorticoid, and zinc use during COVID-19 were independently associated with CAPM. CAPM reported a higher 12-week mortality than CAROM (56 of the 107 [52.3%] vs. 413 of the 1356 [30.5%]; p = 0.0001). Hypoxemia during COVID-19 (aOR [95% CI], 3.70 [1.34 -10.25]) and Aspergillus co-infection (aOR [95% CI], 5.40 [1.23-23.64]) were independently associated with mortality in CAPM, whereas surgery was associated with better survival. Discussion: CAPM is a distinct entity with a higher mortality than CAROM. Hypoxemia during COVID-19 illness is associated with CAPM. COVID-19 hypoxemia and Aspergillus co-infection were associated with higher mortality in CAPM.

AB  - - BACKGROUND: Though currently considered a 'black box,' machine learning (ML) has a promising future to ameliorate the health-care burden of stroke which is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide. Through this study, we sought to review the most influential articles on the applications of ML in stroke. - METHODS: Web of Sciences database was searched, and a list of the top 50 most cited articles, assessing the application of ML in stroke, was prepared by 2 authors, independently. Subsequently, a detailed analysis was performed to characterize the most impactful studies. - RESULTS: The total number of citations to the top 50 articles were 2959 (range 35e243 citations) with a median of 47 citations. Highest number of articles were published in the journal Stroke and the United States was the major contributing country. The majority of the studies focused on the utilization of ML to improve stroke risk prediction, diagnosis, and outcome prediction. Statistical analysis revealed an insignificant association between the total and mean number of citations and the impact factor of the journal (P [ 0.516 and 0.987, respectively). - CONCLUSIONS: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the application of ML in stroke, with an enhancement in interest and funding over the years. ML has revolutionized the management of stroke and continues to aid in the neurosurgical decision-making and care in stroke patients.

AB  - IntroductionMany studies have demonstrated significant antibiotic resistance by commonly isolated organisms. This is an eye-opener for the clinicians, who prescribe antibiotics day in and out. This situation shifts our attention towards the usage of antiseptic measures, which can at times play an important role in preventing and treating various infections.MethodThis is a double-blinded randomized controlled study that compares the bundle approach to the conventional approach for the prevention of surgical site infections in patients of peritonitis undergoing midline laparotomy in emergency. The bundle approach includes three measures, namely, painting of surgical site with chlorhexidine, dabbing the wound with povidone-iodine after the closure of the rectus sheath, and application of chlorhexidine-impregnated gauze piece over the skin wound.ResultsThe total sample size was 64 (32 in each arm). The rate of surgical site infection was significantly lower in the test arm (21.8%) as compared to the conventional arm (46.8%). The mean length of hospital stay was shorter by one day in the test arm, although, not significant. The isolates from the peritoneal fluid culture and wound culture were mostly gram-negative organisms. Most of the organisms exhibited resistance toward third generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides.ConclusionAntibiotic resistance is a burning concern in today's world. Alternative methods of preventing infection in the form of using antiseptics should be sought. Although our study was limited to emergency cases, this bundle approach can be implemented in elective cases as well.

AB  - Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) is a diverse group of tumors arising from oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx squamous epithelium, posing significant morbidity. Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane proteins forming water channels, some associated with carcinomas. Chromobox (CBX) family is known to modulate physiological and oncological processes. In our study, we analyzed AQPs and CBXs having significant expression followed by their prognostic and mutational assessment. Next, we performed enrichment and tumor infiltration analysis followed by HPA validation. Lastly, we established a 3-node miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network and performed protein-protein docking of the highest-degree subnetwork motif between TF and mRNA. Significant upregulation of CBX3/2 and downregulation of AQP3/5/7 correlated with poor overall survival (OS) in HNSC patients. The most significant pathway, GO-BP, GO-MF, and GO-CC terms associated with AQP3 and CBX3 were passive transport by aquaporins, response to vitamin, glycerol channel activity, and condensed chromosome, centromeric region.

Three-node miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network revealed a highest-degree subnetwork motif comprising one TF (SMAD3), one miRNA (miR-423-5p), and one mRNA (AQP3). Protein-protein interaction studies suggested a direct interaction between AQP3 and Smad3 proteins. We concluded that AQP3 and CBX3 hold potential as treatment strategies and individual prognostic biomarkers, while further protein-protein interaction studies of AQP3 could offer insights into its interactions with Smad3 proteins.

AB  - Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a clinically and pathologically diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders, yet little work has quantified the unique phenotypic clinical presentations of FTD among post-9/11 era veterans. To identify phenotypes of FTD using natural language processing (NLP) aided medical chart reviews of post-9/11 era U.S. military Veterans diagnosed with FTD in Veterans Health Administration care.Methods A medical record chart review of clinician/provider notes was conducted using a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool, which extracted features related to cognitive dysfunction. NLP features were further organized into seven Research Domain Criteria Initiative (RDoC) domains, which were clustered to identify distinct phenotypes.Results Veterans with FTD were more likely to have notes that reflected the RDoC domains, with cognitive and positive valence domains showing the greatest difference across groups. Clustering of domains identified three symptom phenotypes agnostic to time of an individual having FTD, categorized as Low (16.4%), Moderate (69.2%), and High (14.5%) distress. Comparison across distress groups showed significant differences in physical and psychological characteristics, particularly prior history of head injury, insomnia, cardiac issues, anxiety, and alcohol misuse. The clustering result within the FTD group demonstrated a phenotype variant that exhibited a combination of language and behavioral symptoms. This phenotype presented with manifestations indicative of both language-related impairments and behavioral changes, showcasing the coexistence of features from both domains within the same individual.Discussion This study suggests FTD also presents across a continuum of severity and symptom distress, both within and across variants. The intensity of distress evident in clinical notes tends to cluster with more co-occurring conditions. This examination of phenotypic heterogeneity in clinical notes indicates that sensitivity to FTD diagnosis may be correlated to overall symptom distress, and future work incorporating NLP and phenotyping may help promote strategies for early detection of FTD.

AB  - Objectives: It is challenging to make diagnosis of non -celiac gluten sensitivity/non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCGS/NCWS) in clinical practice, since there is no biomarker and diagnosis is based on response to gluten -free -diet (GFD). We used anti-gliadin antibody (AGA) for screening patients with IBS for glutensensitivity. Methods: 492 Adult -patients with IBS underwent screening for celiac disease and gluten -sensitivity using IgA anti -tissue transglutaminase antibody and IgA-AGA and IgG-AGA, respectively. Patients with positive AGA (IgA and/or IgG) were invited to follow GFD, those willing were put on GFD for 6 -weeks. Responsive patients were given gluten re -challenge. Diagnosis of NCGS was confirmed if they had recurrence of symptoms. Results: Of 492 patients with IBS, AGA was positive in 61(12.4 %), hence suspected to have glutensensitivity. Of 31 who agreed to participate and followed GFD for 6 -weeks, 17 (54.8 %) had complete ( > 30 % improvement) and 10(32.2 %) had partial ( > 20 % improvement) response. All 17 completeresponders were given gluten re -challenge for 6 -weeks, symptoms recurred in all and hence were confirmed to have NCGS/NCWS. Significant decrease in AGA levels occurred almost in all GFD-responders. Conclusions: 12.4 % IBS patients have biological evidence of gluten/wheat-sensitivity. Almost 87 % patients with IBS having AGA responded to GFD. The value of AGA may further be explored as a biomarker for screening for the presence of NCGS, before recommending this test for the clinical practice.

AB  - PurposeWilms' tumor (WT) is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that cargo nucleic acids, proteins,etc. for cellular communication. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have utility as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. We hypothesize that expression of lncRNA, metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1(MALAT1), is dysregulated and possibly trafficked within exosomes to influence the tissue microenvironment for metastasis and recurrence of WT.MethodsWe investigated the expression of MALAT1 in thirty WT samples by qPCR. Exosomes were isolated using a precipitated and affinity-binding-based kit, and characterized using TEM, NTA, and DLS.ResultsMean number of exosomes was 9.01x108/mL in primary culture, 1.64x108/mL in urine, and 4.65x108/plasma:400 mu l. Average yield of total RNA was 1.28 mu g (primary-culture supernatant:1ml), 1.47 mu g (Urine:1ml), 1.65 mu g (Plasma:400 mu L). We quantified MALAT1 in exosomes derived from these sources in patients of WT. Expression of MALAT1 was significantly downregulated (p=0.008) in WT samples.ConclusionThis is the first study that demonstrated the presence of lncRNA MALAT1 in various invasive and non-invasive samples of patients with WT(primary tissue culture, urine, and plasma samples).

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has posed challenges for clinicians with respect to questions regarding vulnerability of patients with chronic autoimmune diseases like Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and other demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Objectives: We assessed outcomes of COVID-19 disease among patients with CNS demyelinating disorders and its effect on neurological disability. Methods: This was an electronic survey in which a structured questionnaire was distributed to patients registered with neuroimmunology and MS clinics at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. The patients were enquired for their primary disease characteristics, occurrence and course of COVID-19 infection and its effect on their underlying disability, if any. Patients visiting clinics in person were also assessed and data from both sources was pooled. Results: 61 patients with these disorders reported to have contracted COVID-19 infection (mean age35.60+10.28 years, females -75.4%, MS -85.2%). None of them suffered from severe/critical COVID-19 despite heterogeneity of disease modifying therapy (DMT) use. DMTs were not associated with increased risk of lymphopenia during illness. 3.3% patients reported fresh relapse and 16.4% had worsening of their neurological disability during/after COVID-19 infection with half of them not attaining their baseline status on follow-up. None of demographic or biochemical parameters were predictive of this neurological worsening. Conclusion: Our study suggests that patients with these disorders might not be at heightened risk of severe COVID-19. Adverse effect of COVID-19 infection on neurological disability needs further exploration.

AB  - Amyloid fibrils and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles are widely acceptable histological and biochemical pathogenic markers in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Detecting these markers at an early stage could be beneficial for differentiating AD from other neuronal anomalies. Herein, a series of rhodanine (acceptor) based dyes in conjugation with a coumarin or carbostyril (donor) were synthesized and tested their ability to detect these biomarkers. The lead probe 19 displayed staining affinity for A beta fibrils and tau tangles with little or no interaction with abundant plasma protein (BSA). Minimal cytotoxicity, brain accessibility, biocompatibility, and fluorescence sustainability across physiological pHs rendering it suitable for in -vivo imaging. Dual staining of histological samples validated affinity of probe 19 for A beta plaques and tau tangles in AD brain tissue specimens via immunofluorescence, ThT (aggregated A beta specific dye), and Tau -1 (tau filament -specific dye). Moreover, live invivo fluorescence imaging in mice and ocular labeling of A beta in AD Drosophila models extend the preclinical applicability of probe 19 for screening purposes. On behalf of the following data, we assume that probe 19 can successfully detect pathological AD biomarkers in investigational studies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a widespread neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory and cognitive decline, posing a formidable public health challenge. This review explores the intricate interplay between two pivotal players in AD pathogenesis: beta-amyloid (A beta) and tau protein. While the amyloid cascade theory has long dominated AD research, recent developments have ignited debates about its centrality. A beta plaques and tau NFTs are hallmark pathologies in AD. Aducanumab and lecanemab, monoclonal antibodies targeting A beta, have been approved, albeit amidst controversy, raising questions about the therapeutic efficacy of A beta-focused interventions. On the other hand, tau, specifically its hyperphosphorylation, disrupts microtubule stability and contributes to neuronal dysfunction. Various post-translational modifications of tau drive its aggregation into NFTs. Emerging treatments targeting tau, such as GSK-3 beta and CDK5 inhibitors, have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies. Restoring the equilibrium between protein kinases and phosphatases, notably protein phosphatase-2A (PP2A), is a promising avenue for AD therapy, as tau is primarily regulated by its phosphorylation state. Activation of tau-specific phosphatases offers potential for mitigating tau pathology. The evolving landscape of AD drug development emphasizes tau-centric therapies and reevaluation of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. Additionally, exploring the role of neuroinflammation and its interaction with tau pathology present promising research directions.

AB  - Background: Intraoperative fluid therapy maintains normovolemia, normal tissue perfusion, normal metabolic function, normal electrolytes, and acid-base status. Plethysmographic variability index has been shown to predict fluid responsiveness but its role in guiding intraoperative fluid therapy is still elusive. Aims: The aim of the present study was to compare intraoperative goal-directed fluid therapy based on plethysmographic variability index with liberal fluid therapy in term neonates undergoing abdominal surgeries. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in a tertiary care centre, over a period of 18 months. A total of 30 neonates completed the study out of 132 neonates screened. Neonates with tracheoesophageal fistula, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital heart disease, respiratory disorders, creatinine clearance <90 mL/min and who were hemodynamically unstable were excluded. Neonates were randomized to goal-directed fluid therapy group where the plethysmographic variability index was targeted at <18 or liberal fluid therapy group. Primary outcome was comparison of total amount of fluid infused intraoperatively in both the groups. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and postoperative arterial blood gas parameters, biochemical parameters, use of vasopressors, number of fluid boluses, complications and duration of hospital stay. Results: There was no significant difference in total intraoperative fluid infused [90 (84-117.5 mL) in goal-directed fluid therapy and 105 (85.5-144.5 mL) in liberal fluid therapy group (p = .406)], median difference (95% CI) -15 (-49.1 to 19.1). There was a decrease in serum lactate levels in both groups from preoperative to postoperative 24 h. The amount of fluid infused before dopamine administration was significantly higher in liberal fluid therapy group (58 [50.25-65 mL]) compared to goal-directed fluid therapy group (36 [22-44 mL], p = .008), median difference (95% CI) -22 (-46 to 2). In postoperative period, the total amount of fluid intake over 24 h was comparable in two groups (222 [204-253 mL] in goal-directed fluid therapy group and 224 [179.5-289.5 mL] in liberal fluid therapy group, p = .917) median difference (95% CI) cutoff -2 (-65.3 to 61.2). Conclusion: Intraoperative plethysmographic variability index-guided goal-directed fluid therapy was comparable to liberal fluid therapy in terms of total volume of fluid infused in neonates during perioperative period. More randomized controlled trials with higher sample size are required.

AB  - Metabolism results from enzymatic- and non-enzymatic interactions of several molecules, is easily parameterized with the dissociation constant and occurs via biochemical networks. The dissociation constant is an empirically determined parameter and cannot be used directly to investigate in silico models of biochemical networks. Here, we develop and present an algorithm to define, compute and assess the relevance of the probable dissociation constant for every reaction of a biochemical network. The reactants and reactions of this network are modelled by a stoichiometry number matrix. The algorithm computes the null space and then serially generates subspaces by combinatorially summing the spanning vectors that are non-trivial and unique. This is done until the terms of each row either monotonically diverge or form an alternating sequence whose terms can be partitioned into subsets with almost the same number of oppositely signed terms. For a selected null space-generated subspace the algorithm utilizes several statistical and mathematical descriptors to select and bin terms from each row into distinct outcome-specific subsets. The terms of each subset are summed, mapped to the real-valued open interval 0,infinity\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$\left(0,\infty \right)$$\end{document} and used to populate a reaction-specific outcome vector. The p1-norm for this vector is then the probable dissociation constant for this reaction. These steps are continued until every reaction of a modelled network is unambiguously annotated. The assertions presented are complemented by computational studies of a biochemical network for aerobic glycolysis. The fundamental premise of this work is that every row of a null space-generated subspace is a valid reaction and can therefore, be modelled as a reaction-specific sequence vector with a dimension that corresponds to the cardinality of the subspace after excluding all trivial- and redundant-vectors. A major finding of this study is that the row-wise sum or the sum of the terms contained in each reaction-specific sequence vector is mapped unambiguously to a positive real number. This means that the probable dissociation constants, for all reactions, can be directly computed from the stoichiometry number matrix and are suitable indicators of outcome for every reaction of the modelled biochemical network. Additionally, we find that the unambiguous annotation for a biochemical network will require a minimum number of iterations and will determine computational complexity.

AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a ubiquitous enzyme that regulates the biosynthesis of tetrahydrofolate among various species of Plasmodium parasite. It is a validated target of the antifolate drug pyrimethamine (Pyr) in Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), but its clinical efficacy has been hampered due to the emergence of drug resistance. This has made the attempt to screen Food & Drug Administration-approved drugs against wild- and mutant PfDHFR by employing an in-silico pipeline to identify potent candidates. The current study has followed a virtual screening approach for identifying potential DHFR inhibitors from DrugBank database, based on a structure similarity search of candidates, followed by absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion estimation. The screened drugs were subjected to various parameters like docking, molecular mechanics with generalized born and surface area solvation calculations, and molecular simulations. We have thus identified two potential drug candidates, duloxetine and guanethidine, which can be repurposed to be tested for their efficacy against wild type and drug resistant falciparum malaria.

AB  - Mucormycosis is a rare disease with scarce diagnostic methods for early intervention. Available strategies employing direct microscopy using calcofluor white-KOH, culture, radiologic, and histopathologic testing often are time-intensive and demand intricate protocols. Nucleic Acid Amplification Test holds promise due to its high sensitivity combined with rapid detection. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) based detection offers an ultrasensitive technique that does not require complicated thermocyclers like in polymerase chain reaction, offering a straight-forward means for improving diagnoses as a near-point-of-care test. The study introduces a novel magnetic nanoparticle-based LAMP assay for carryover contaminant capture to reduce false positives. Solving the main drawback of LAMP-based diagnosis techniques. The assay targets the cotH gene, which is invariably specific to Mucorales. The assay was tested with various species of Mucorales, and the limit of detections for Rhizopus microsporus, Lichtheimia corymbifera, Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus homothallicus, and Cunninghamella bertholletiae were 1 fg, 1 fg, 0.1 pg, 0.1 pg, and 0.01 ng, respectively. This was followed by a clinical blindfolded study using whole blood and urine samples from 30 patients diagnosed with Mucormycosis. The assay has a high degree of repeatability and had an overall sensitivity of > 83%. Early Mucormycosis detection is crucial, as current lab tests from blood and urine lack sensitivity and take days for confirmation despite rapid progression and severe complications. Our developed technique enables the confirmation of Mucormycosis infection in < 45 min, focusing specifically on the RT-LAMP process. Consequently, this research offers a viable technique for quickly identifying Mucormycosis from isolated DNA of blood and urine samples instead of invasive tissue samples.

AB  - Aims GDNF plays a crucial role in the stimulation of recovery, neuroplasticity and synaptic reorganization after spinal cord injury providing neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. Plasma GDNF levels are upregulated in cases of spina bifida owing to the intrauterine damage of the exposed spinal cord. Our aim was to compare the plasma GDNF levels in patients of spina bifida with non -spina bifida cases and assess the correlation with neurological impairment at one year of follow up. Methods Single centre prospective analysis of cases of spina bifida from 2020 to 2022 at presentation and after one year of follow up post-surgery. Cases with hernia and hydrocele without any other disorders were recruited into the control group. Plasma GDNF levels were assessed with immunoassay kits and compared with neurological involvement. Results 85 cases were included in the study. GDNF levels were elevated in cases compared to controls (mean 6.62 vs 1.76) with significant p value (<0.01). Same was observed for open and closed defects (mean 7.63 vs 4.86: p < 0.01). At follow up of 52 cases postsurgery cases with neurogenic bladder with abnormal urodynamic studies, sphincter involvement and motor impairment had significantly elevated baseline levels of GDNF compared with Discussion The neurotrophic factor up-regulation can reflect an endogenous attempt at neuroprotection against the biochemical and molecular cascades triggered by the spinal cord damage. This upregulation can be represented as important biochemical markers of severe spinal cord damage and can be associated with severity of spine injury in MMC patients. Our results are in keeping with these findings, that, there were increased levels of plasma GDNF levels in cases of spinal dysraphism compared to control population. Also, the type of lesion reflecting the severity whether a closed or an open dysraphism, showed significant difference in levels between them suggesting, yet again, more damage in open defect as expected. The levels were higher with involvement of bladder, sphincter and lower limb power. Conclusion There is significant elevation of plasma GDNF levels in cases of spina bifida and this elevation is proportional to the degree of spinal damage and hence the neurological impairment. GDNF levels are a good predictor for assessing the severity of the lesion and thus the outcome in these cases. Additional prospective and long -term studies with a larger cohort are needed for a better understanding of neurotrophin pattern modulation in MMC.

AB  - Introduction: In autoimmune dermatitis patients, a macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is widely used to determine the severity of the diseases with other clinical parameters. Moreover, in vitiligo, MIF has shown significant positive correlation with the VASI (Vitiligo Area Scoring Index) score of both generalized and localized vitiligo patients. MIF function as pro-inflammatory cytokine and inhibited random migration of macrophages from inflammation loci. Hence, activated macrophage infiltrates promote the diseases pathogenesis. Till date, macrophages and involvement of their secreted MIF in disease severity of vitiligo patients remains undetermined. Material and method: The frequency of both M1 and M2 macrophages was evaluated in active GV patients (n = 20) using flow cytometry in blood and in tissues by confocal microscopy (n = 10). Relative m -RNA expression and cytokine profiling of pro and anti-inflammatory mediators were estimated in PBMCs and in serum of patients. Lastly, concentration of nitric oxide and phagocytic activity from macrophages of active patients were calculated to understand the diseases pathology in detail. Result: Both in circulation as well as in tissues, the infiltration of M1 macrophages was increased in active GV patients, while the percentage of M2 macrophages was comparable to healthy tissues. Aberrant expression of pro and anti-inflammatory molecules including IL-1 beta, IL -6, TNF-alpha, IL -12 and MIF impair the cellular hemostasis and induce systematic inflammation. Elevated nitric oxide and higher phagocytic activity of macrophages enhanced the destruction and/or depigmentation of melanocytes causing vitiligo. Conclusion: Elevated macrophages in both tissue and blood enhanced the secretion of MIF and other inflammatory mediators that further enforce the production of nitric oxide, activation and phagocytic activity of macrophages against melanocytes and melanocytes antigens. As a result, destruction of melanocytes and melanin production occurred and caused the depigmentation and/or white macules on the skin.

T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - The PPP2R2B gene, expressed highly in the brain, harbours trinucleotide CAG repeats in the 5 ' UTR region, in the range of 7-42 repeats. Individuals carrying CAG repeats greater than 43 have been associated to manifest a neurodegenerative disease condition termed as Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 12 (SCA12). An iPSC line from an adult male diagnosed with SCA12 presenting symptoms of gait (Gait Dominance) was generated. It showed pluripotency and trilineage markers without any chromosomal abnormality. This line can be utilized as an essential resource in enhancing our understanding of the molecular pathogenic mechanisms underlying SCA12 by facilitating generation of various neuronal cell types.

AB  - Optically transparent novel metal-organic nonlinear optical single crystals of bismorpholinium mercury-(II) tribromo chloride (BMMC) were grown adopting a slow evaporation technique (SEST). The formation of a new crystalline structure and the morphology of the title material were revealed through single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD). The space group of the title compound is found to be P2(1)/c in the monoclinic crystal system. The unit cell has four molecules adduced into it (the unit cell parameters of a, b, and c are 6.8056(6), 14.0027(10), and 17.2152(14), respectively). The grown crystal's crystalline phase and crystalline quality were analyzed through a powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) study. The formation of new molecular structures and multifarious functional groups was unveiled through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectrum (FTIR) analyses, respectively. The title compound is found to have a lower cutoff wavelength of 328 nm with 75% in the visible region. The crucial thermal parameters such as thermal stability, decomposition, and melting characteristics of the BMMC crystal have been determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TG) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The laser damage threshold of the grown crystal was found to be 2.242 GW/cm(2) with the irradiation of nanosecond, 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser. Third-order nonlinearity of the BMMC crystal was evaluated by Z-scan measurements. The optical limiting (OL) property of the crystal grown has an amplitude of 532 mW and a threshold of 28 mW, respectively.

AB  - Human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) is an emerging, rickettsial tick-borne disease caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Sero-epidemiological data demonstrate that this pathogen has a worldwide distribution. The diagnosis of HGA requires a high index of clinical suspicion, even in endemic areas. In recent years, HGA has increasingly been reported from Asia and described in China, Japan, and Korea. We serologically and molecularly screened 467 patients with clinical suspicion of Anaplasmosis. The present study describes the epidemiology, clinical, and laboratory details of 6 confirmed and 43 probable cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. One of the HGA patients developed secondary invasive opportunistic Aspergillus fumigatus and Acinetobacter baumanii infection during the illness, which resulted in a fatal infection. The HGA patients without severe complications had excellent treatment responses to doxycycline. The emergence of this newly recognized tick-borne zoonotic HGA in North India is a significant concern for public health and is likely underdiagnosed, underreported, and untreated. Hence, it is also essential to establish a well-coordinated system for actively conducting tick surveillance, especially in the forested areas of the country.IMPORTANCEThe results of the present study show the clinical and laboratory evidence of autochthonous cases of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in North India. The results suggest the possibility of underdiagnosis of HGA in this geographical area. One of the HGA patients developed secondary invasive opportunistic Aspergillus fumigatus and Acinetobacter baumanii infection during the illness, which resulted in a fatal infection.

The aim is to decrease the risk of aspiration leading to pulmonary complications such as aspiration pneumonitis during anesthesia care. There are different guidelines for elective preoperative fasting in children. However, there is insufficient literature measuring gastric emptying time after breast milk or formula milk feeding in infants.ObjectiveThis study used gastric ultrasound to determine the gastric emptying time for breast milk and formula milk in children below 6 months of age. We also compared the calculated gastric volumes among breast-fed and formula milk-fed based on Schmitz's and Spencer's formula.Materials and methodsThis prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in India between November (2017-2019). A total of 52 infants less than 6 months of age were recruited. The study population was divided into two groups (breast-fed and formula milk-fed) of 26 patients each. Ultrasound was used to measure the antral cross-sectional area of the stomach and to calculate the gastric volume using the two classical formulas (Schmitz and Spencer's). Gastric emptying was reported when the bull's eye appearance of the gastric antrum was seen or when the antral cross-sectional area was less than 3.07 cm2.ResultsThe number of breast-fed children whose antral cross-sectional was greater than 3.07 cm2 (cut-off value for aspiration risk) beyond 1 h was 14/26 (53.84%) while none (0) children went beyond 3 h. The number of formula-fed children whose antral cross-sectional was greater than 3.07 cm2 beyond 1 h was 17/26 (65.38%) while one child (3.84%) went beyond 3 h. Using Schmitz's formula, mean (SD) gastric emptying times were 0.35 +/- 0.68 h (95% CI 0.35 +/- 0.185, range 0.165-0.535) for breast-fed patients and 0.35 +/- 0.69 h (95% CI 0.35 +/- 0.188, range 0.162-0.538) for formula-fed patients, and were thus neither clinically nor statistically different (p = .73) Using Spencer's formula, the mean gastric emptying times were 0.12 +/- 0.33 h (95% CI 0.12 +/- 0.09, range 0.03-0.21) for breast-fed patients and 0.04 +/- 0.20 h (95% CI 0.04 +/- 0.05, range -0.01 to 0.09) for formula-fed patients, and were also neither clinically nor statistically different p = .13.ConclusionIn our series, the gastric emptying times in breast-fed and formula-fed infants less than 6 months old were similar. Our results support the fasting guidelines of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care 2022, that is, 3 h for breastfeeding and 4 h for formula milk feeding. In addition, this shows that the Schmitz's and Spencer's formulae used to calculate the gastric volume based on ultrasound measurement of the antral cross-sectional area are not comparable in infants less than 6 months.

KW  - MODELS
AB  - Though significant advances have been made in developing therapeutic strategies for cancer, suitable in vitro models for mechanistically identifying relevant drug targets and understanding disease progression are still lacking. Most studies are generally performed using two-dimensional (2D) models, since these models can be readily established and allow high throughput assays. However, these models have also been reported as the reason for unreliable pre-clinical information. To avoid this discrepancy, three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models have been established and have demonstrated the potential to provide alternative ways to study tissue behavior. However, most of these models first require optimization and cell cultures with a certain density, thus adding a prepping step in the platform before it can be used for any studies. This limits their use in studies where the fundamental understanding of biological processes must be carried out in a short time frame. In this study, we developed a 3D cell culture system that tests a less explored cancer therapeutic target-the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin specific peptidase 37 (USP37)-in different cancer cell lines using sensitive carbon dot pH nanosensors, which provides a rapid model for studies compared to the parallel model available commercially. This enzyme is found to be elevated in different cancers and has been reported to play a role in cell cycle regulation, oncogenesis and metastasis. However, the confirmation of the role of USP37 downregulation in cellular proliferation via appropriate in vitro 3D models has not been demonstrated. To establish the applicability of the developed 3D platform in studying such oncogenes, classical 2D models have been used in this study for identifying the role of USP37 in tumor progression and metastasis. The data clearly suggests that this ingeniously developed 3D cell culture system is a better alternative to 2D models to study the growth and migration of different cancer cell lines on depletion of oncogenic proteins like USP37 and its effect on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers, and it can further be targeted as a viable therapeutic option.

TI  - Severe disease during both primary and secondary dengue virus infections in pediatric populations
T2  - NATURE MEDICINE
KW  - HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER
KW  - CAPTURE ELISA
AB  - Dengue is a global epidemic causing over 100 million cases annually. The clinical symptoms range from mild fever to severe hemorrhage and shock, including some fatalities. The current paradigm is that these severe dengue cases occur mostly during secondary infections due to antibody-dependent enhancement after infection with a different dengue virus serotype. India has the highest dengue burden worldwide, but little is known about disease severity and its association with primary and secondary dengue infections. To address this issue, we examined 619 children with febrile dengue-confirmed infection from three hospitals in different regions of India. We classified primary and secondary infections based on IgM:IgG ratios using a dengue-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the World Health Organization guidelines. We found that primary dengue infections accounted for more than half of total clinical cases (344 of 619), severe dengue cases (112 of 202) and fatalities (5 of 7). Consistent with the classification based on binding antibody data, dengue neutralizing antibody titers were also significantly lower in primary infections compared to secondary infections (P <= 0.0001). Our findings question the currently widely held belief that severe dengue is associated predominantly with secondary infections and emphasizes the importance of developing vaccines or treatments to protect dengue-naive populations.
   In an analysis of severe dengue cases in a cohort of children in India, more than half could be attributed to primary rather than secondary infection, suggesting that primary dengue infections might also contribute substantially to severe disease burden.

AB  - Climate change has led to an increase in high ambient temperatures, causing extreme heat events worldwide. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), July 2023 marked a historic milestone as the Earth reached its hottest recorded temperature, precisely hitting the critical threshold of 1.5 degree celsius set by the Paris Agreement. This distressing development led to a stark warning from the United Nations, signaling the dawn of what they call "an era of global boiling". The increasing global temperatures can result in high heat stress which leads to various physiological and biochemical alterations in the human body. Given that cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, heat events exacerbate this public health issue. While clinical and in-vitro studies have suggested a range of pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying the body's response to heat stress, the complex nature of organ-system level interactions makes precise investigation challenging. To address this knowledge gap effectively, the use of animal models exposed to acute or chronic heat stress can be invaluable. These models can closely replicate the multifaceted effects observed in humans during heat stress conditions. Despite extensive independent reviews, limited focus has been shed on the high heat-induced cardiovascular complications and their mechanisms, particularly utilizing animal models. Therefore, in this comprehensive review, we highlight the crucial biomarkers altered during heat stress, contributing significantly to various CVDs. We explore potential mechanisms underlying heat-induced cardiovascular dysfunction and damage, delving into various animal models. While traditional rodent models are commonly employed, we also examine less conventional models, including ruminants, broilers, canines, and primates. Furthermore, we delve into various potential therapeutic approaches and preventive measures. These insights hold significant promise for the development of more effective clinical interventions against the effects of heat stress on the human cardiovascular system.

AB  - Increasing evidence suggests the oncogenic role of missense mutation (AKT1-E17K) of AKT1 gene in meningiomas. Upon investigating the connection between the pro-tumorigenic role of AKT1-E17K and cellular metabolic adaptations, elevated levels of glycolytic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) was observed in meningioma patients with AKT1-E17K compared to patients harboring wild -type AKT1. In vitro experiments also suggested higher HK2 levels and its activity in AKT1-E17K cells. Treatment with the conventional drug of choice AZD5363 (a pan AKT inhibitor) enhanced cell death and diminished HK2 levels in AKT1 mutants. Given the role of AKT phosphorylation in eliciting inflammatory responses, we observed increased levels of inflammatory mediators (IL -10, IL6, IL8, and TLR4) in AKT1-E17K cells compared to AKT1-WT cells. Treatment with AKT or HK2 inhibitors dampened the heightened levels of inflammatory markers in AKT1-E17K cells. As AKT and HK2 regulates redox homeostasis, diminished ROS generation concomitant with increased levels of NF -E2- related factor 2 (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were observed in AKT1-E17K cells. Increased sensitivity of AKT1-E17K cells to AZD5363 in the presence of HK2 inhibitor Lonidamine was reversed upon treatment with ROS inhibitor NAC. By affecting metabolism, inflammation, and redox homeostasis AKT1-E17K confers a survival advantage in meningioma cells. Our findings suggest that targeting AKT-HK2 cross -talk to induce ROS-dependent cell death could be exploited as novel therapeutic approach in meningiomas.

AB  - AimsTo study the association of pro-inflammatory markers with incident diabetes in India.MethodsWe did a nested case-control study within the CARRS (Centre for Ardiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia) cohort. Of the 5739 diabetes-free individuals at the baseline, 216 participants with incident diabetes and 432 age-, gender- and city-matched controls at 2-year follow-up were included. We measured high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 ( MCP-1), adiponectin, leptin and fetuin-A in the stored baseline blood samples. We did multivariate conditional logistic regression to estimate association of inflammatory markers (as quartiles) and incident diabetes. Covariates were baseline fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and lipids, body mass index (BMI), family history of diabetes, smoking and alcohol use.ResultsBaseline hsCRP and TNF-alpha were higher, and IL-6 and adiponectin were lower among cases vs. controls. In multivariate conditional logistic regression models, only quartile-3 (odds ratio [OR]: 2.96 [95% CI:1.39, 6.30]) and quartile-4 (OR: 2.58 [95% CI: 1.15, 5.79]) of TNF-alpha and quartile-4 of MCP-1 (OR: 2.55 [95% CI: 1.06, 6.16]) were positively associated with diabetes after adjusting for baseline FPG and BMI. These associations did not remain after adjusting for family history. High level (quartile-4) of IL-6 was negatively associated with diabetes after adjusting for all factors (OR: 0.18 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.55]).ConclusionsHigher TNF-alpha and MCP-1 levels and lower IL-6 were associated with higher risk of developing diabetes. Better understanding and potential methods of addressing these biomarkers, especially in relation to family history, are needed to address diabetes in South Asians.

TI  - The performance of an artificial intelligence-based computer vision mobile application for the image diagnosis of genital dermatoses: a prospective cross-sectional study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
AB  - Background There is a huge demand-supply gap between the incidence of genital dermatoses (including sexually transmitted infections and non-venereal genital dermatoses) and physicians trained to manage them. Objectives To find out the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile application in the image diagnosis of genital dermatoses, and to compare it with primary care physicians (PCPs) and dermatologists. Methods Photos of the genital diseases of consecutive patients presenting to the STD and genital diseases clinic were included. The gold standard diagnosis was established by the consensus of two certified dermatologists after examination and one positive investigation. Image diagnoses by the DermaAId application, two PCPs, and two dermatologists were recorded and compared to the gold standard diagnosis and to each other. Results A total of 257 genital disease images, including 95 (37.0%) anogenital warts, 60 (22.2%) lichen sclerosus, 20 (7.8%) anogenital herpes, 15 (5.8%) tinea cruris, 14 (5.4%) molluscum contagiosum, 9 (3.5%) candidiasis, 8 (3.1%) scabies, 6 (2.3%) squamous cell carcinomas, were included. The top-1 correct diagnosis rate of the application was 68.9%, compared to the 50.4% of the PCPs and 73.2% of the dermatologists. The application significantly outperformed PCPs with regard to the correlation with the gold standard diagnosis (P < 0.0001), and matched that of the dermatologists. Conclusions AI-based image diagnosis platforms can potentially be a low-cost rapid decision support tool for PCPs, integrated with syndromic management programs and direct-to-consumer services, and address healthcare inequities in managing genital dermatoses.

AB  - Introduction: The Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations include a commitment to "leave no one behind" as a universal goal. To achieve this in geriatric oncology (GO) worldwide, it is important to understand the current state of GO at an international level. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) has several National Representatives (NRs) who act as SIOG's delegates in their respective countries. The NRs took part in this international survey exploring the state of GO practice, identifying barriers and solutions. Materials and Methods: The NRs answered open-ended questions by email from February 2020 to October 2022. The questionnaire domains included the demographic information of older adults for their countries, and the NRs' opinions on whether GO is developing, what the barriers are to developing GO, and proposed actions to remove these barriers. The demographic data of each country reported in the survey was adjusted using literature and database searches. Results: Twenty-one of thirty countries with NRs (70%) participated in this questionnaire study: 12 European, four Asian, two North American, two South American, and one Oceanian. The proportion of the population aged >= 75 years varied from 2.2% to 15.8%, and the average life expectancy also varied from 70 years to 86 years. All NRs reported that GO was developing in their country; four NRs (18%) reported that GO was well developed. Although all NRs agreed that geriatric assessment was useful, only three reported that it was used day-to-day in their countries' clinical practice (14%). The major barriers identified were the lack of (i) evidence to support GO use, (ii) awareness and interest in GO, and (iii) resources (time, manpower, and funding). The major proposed actions were to (i) provide new evidence through clinical trials specific for GO patients, (ii) stimulate awareness through networking, and (iii) deliver educational materials and information to healthcare providers and medical students. Discussion: This current survey has identified the barriers to GO and proposed actions that could remove them. Broader awareness seems to be essential to implementing GO. Additional actions are needed to develop GO within countries and can be supported through international partnerships.

AB  - Hydrolysis of pharmaceutically active molecules can be in control under a confined environment of water-in-oil microemulsion. Stability of model drug methotrexate (MTX) in a sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) and olive oil microemulsion system has been evaluated. The physicochemical properties of AOT-MTX-water-olive oil reverse microemulsion (MTX-RM) were examined by UV-vis, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray diffraction techniques, and the hydrodynamic size was determined by dynamic light scattering techniques and morphologies were characterized by a transmission electron microscope and atomic force microscope. In vitro permeation of MTX-RM through treated skin and its mechanism are evaluated by a UV-visible spectrophotometer, confocal laser scanning microscope, differential scanning calorimeter, and attenuated total reflecting infrared spectroscopy (ATR). The interaction of MTX with the AOT headgroup in confined environment RM enhanced the stability of MTX without affecting the molecular integrity at room temperature. Chemical stability of MTX in MTX-RM (W-0 = 5) is significantly higher (similar to 97%) at room temperature for the study period of 1 year than in MTX-RM (W-0 = 15) (similar to 72%). Interaction of MTX with the AOT headgroup is also visualized by a high-resolution transmission electron microscope and is in correlation with FT-IR data of MTX-RM. The skin fluxes of MTX are 15.1, 19.75, and 22.75 times higher at water content (W-0) of 5, 10, and 15, respectively, in MTX-RM in comparison to aqueous solution of MTX. The enhanced amounts of the MTX were detected using CLSM in hair follicles, sweat glands, and epidermis layer of the skin. Merging of T-2, T-3, and T-4 thermal peaks in one broad peak in treated skin endothermograph shows that carrier MTX-RM affects the lipid as well protein structure of the treated skin. ATR data of treated skin showed an increase in the intensity of the carbonyl peak at 1750 cm(-1) (lipid), shifting of the amide II peaks, and separation of peaks in the range of 1060 to 1000 cm(-1) (vibration mode of -CH2OH, C-O stretching, and C-OH bending peak of the carbohydrate) in comparison to control skin, which indicates that MTX-RM interacts with glycolipid and glycoprotein through carbohydrate hydroxy groups.

AB  - While breast carcinoma is the most feared pathology in women with breast lumps, infections continue to be an important aetiology, especially in countries with low to middle socio-economic status. The breast infections or mastitis can present as acute painful breast or recurrent episodes of breast lumps with or without pain. The common causes include puerperal, non-puerperal, and idiopathic mastitis whereas uncommon causes like tuberculosis, filariasis, hydatid and other parasitic infections are still seen in developing countries. Imaging with digital mammography may be difficult due to pain or inadequate due to increased breast density. Ultrasound serves as the modality of choice for detailed assessment in these patients. Since the imaging features are often overlapping with malignancy, biopsy is almost always indicated. However, there are certain imaging findings that may point to the diagnosis of mastitis and can help in accurate radiologic-pathologic correlation. This article aims to illustrate the varied clinico-radiological features of patients with tropical breast infections.

AB  - Breast conserving therapy is now considered the preferred option for early invasive and in situ ductal (DCIS) breast carcinoma. In an attempt to decrease positive margin and local recurrence, various methods for margin delineation have been described. Our team at AIIMS New Delhi have developed a new technique of injecting methylene blue at the sonographically determined margin of tumour to delineate the margin of excision for breast cancer. We perform this procedure after immobilization of tumour with a transparent Ioban/Opsite adhesive sheet applied over the breast. The injection of blue dye at sonographically determined margins facilitates the lumpectomy with free margins.

AB  - A substantial percentage of kidney transplant recipients show transplant failure due to BK virus-induced nephropathy. This can be clinically controlled by the rapid and timely detection of BK virus infection in immunecompromised patients. We report a rapid (two hours from sample collection, processing, and detection), costeffective (< 2$), highly sensitive and BKV-specific nanoLAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) diagnostic methodology using novel primers and gold nanoparticles complex-based visual detection. The standardized nanoLAMP showed an analytical sensitivity of 25 copies/mu l and did not cross-react with closely related JC and SV40 viruses. This nanoLAMP showed diagnostic sensitivity and specificity as 91% and 96%, respectively, taking 50 BK virus-negative (confirmed by qPCR from the plasma of healthy donors) and 57 positive BKV patient samples (confirmed by clinical parameters and qPCR assay). This simple two-step, low-cost, and quick (1-2 h/ test) detection would be advantageous over the currently used diagnostic methodology. It may change the paradigm for polyomavirus infection-based failure of renal transplant.

AB  - Background and Aims Inflammatory head mass of pancreas (IMP) developing in background of chronic pancreatitis (CP) is difficult to distinguish from carcinoma pancreas. We aimed to delineate natural course of IMP and predict their malignancy risk, avoiding unnecessary biopsies.
   Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study, clinical records of patients with CP with diagnosed pancreatic head mass were reviewed. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, endoscopic findings, and follow-up details were retrieved from prospectively maintained database. A diagnostic nomogram was developed combining serum cancer antigen 19-9 and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) findings to predict the risk of malignancy.
   Results We identified 107 patients with pancreatic head mass with CP of whom 87 (81.3%) were IMP and 20 (18.7%) were malignant. Patients with IMP were more frequently young males with alcohol-related CP and low CA 19-9 in comparison with those with malignancy (age IMP: 41.3 +/- 11.3 vs carcinoma: 49.3 +/- 14.5 years [P = 0.009]; males 89.7% vs 65% [P = 0.011]; alcoholic etiology: 71.3% vs 20% [P < 0.001]; median CA 19-9: 25.78 [interquartile range, 7.20120.60] vs 1034.50 [106.657808.25] [P < 0.001]). A diagnostic nomogram combining CA 19-9 and EUS findings could identify malignancy with an optimism-corrected c-statistic of 0.905, which was better than both CA 19-9 (0.80) and EUS alone (0.826). Patients with IMP had relatively benign disease course with 40.2% biliary obstruction, 20.7% portal venous thrombosis, 14.9% gastric outlet obstruction, and 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival being 97.3%, 92.7%, and 92.0%, respectively. Surgery was required in only 12 patients (13.8%) with IMP.
   Conclusions Combination of CA 19-9 and EUS best identifies malignancy risk in patients with IMP, who have otherwise benign course.

AB  - The emergence of antimicrobial resistance has become a major contributor to healthcare-associated infections. Recently, the cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (CAPJ) discharges have garnered attention of the researchers globally for their novel antimicrobial property. This research evaluated the effectiveness of an in-house developed CAPJ on the inactivation of multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli and S. aureus artificially inoculated over stainless steel and aluminium test surfaces. A greater than similar to 5 log10 reduction of E. coli, whereas reduction of similar to 3.4-4.6 log10 for S. aureus on the test surfaces was achieved on 180 s CAPJ exposure. Extremely low D- values (in the range of similar to 27-63 s) were recorded for both isolates. In addition, this study assessed the impact of repeated CAPJ exposure on surface property, by replicating the process of hospital surface decontamination. Surface properties such as wettability, roughness, and elemental composition varied non-linearly on repetitive Ar CAPJ exposure on test surfaces. It was observed that the identified gas-phase species such as excited atoms (Ar I, and O I), positive ions (NO+, O2 +, OH+, O+, N2 +, Ar+, etc), negative ions (N2O2 -, N2O3 -, NO3 -, NO2 -, etc), radical RONS (OH center dot), and non-radical RONS (O I, NO+, OH+, N2O3 -, NO3 -, NO2 -, etc) would contribute to bacterial load reduction on the test surface along with any alteration in surface characteristic. There may be chemical and physical processes involved in the above activity. This investigation into understanding the effects of CAPJ surface decontamination on surface properties would aid in determining its potential applications in healthcare settings.

AB  - Precis: This study evaluated the allostatic load (AL) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and reported that the AL score was significantly higher in glaucoma patients compared with age-matched controls.
   Purpose: To evaluate the AL in patients with POAG.
   Methods: This case-control study comprised 50 POAG (glaucoma patients) and 50 age-matched controls without glaucoma (controls). AL was estimated based on 13 variables: systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, homocysteine, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, body mass index, serum cortisol, glycosylated hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine clearance, and C-reactive protein. High-risk thresholds were determined based on biological cutoffs of each biomarker. One point was assigned for each biomarker reading above cutoff and were summated to obtain AL score; score =4 was considered high.
   Results: Mean age of glaucoma patients was 60.82+/-6.26 and 60.14+/-6.72 years in controls ( P =0.602). All components of AL score (except C-reactive protein) had higher values in glaucoma patients. There was a statistically significant difference in homocysteine ( P =0.001), total cholesterol ( P =0.037), high-density lipoprotein ( P =0.005), and glycosylated hemoglobin ( P =0.003). Mean AL score was 4.68+/-2.09 in glaucoma patients and 3.32+/-1.34 in controls ( P <0.001). There was significant association of high AL score with older age ( P =0.006), low socioeconomic status ( P =0.020), and glaucoma severity ( P =0.001). Negative correlation was seen between AL and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (Right Eye: r =-0.37, P <0.001; Left Eye: r =-0.298, P <0.001) and visual field mean deviation (Right Eye: r =-0.469, P <0.001; Left Eye: r =-0.520, P <0.001).
   Conclusions: Glaucoma patients exhibited allostatic overload indicating physiological dysregulation to chronic stress although additional research is required to establish causality. A holistic approach with lifestyle modifications to reduce chronic stress should be an integral part of managing glaucoma patients as it would serve both to possibly reduce or prevent disease progression and improve overall health outcomes.

AB  - Cortisol, a well-known psychological stress biomarker, produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system, tends to intensify with stressors. Prolonged overexpression of cortisol leads to chronic stress that causes disparities in the proper functioning of the human body. Thus, there is a huge demand for developing a rapid cortisol detection system. Several point-of-care diagnostic techniques are available for rapid cortisol detection, such as electrochemical sensing, which works on changes in the electrical properties due to the binding of an analyte with a biorecognition element. Researchers have used different electrochemical methodologies, such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and faradic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), for the detection of cortisol. Still, the usage of external redox active reagents, low sensitivity, limited dynamic range, and electrode fouling nature limits their use. Hence, we reported a label-free and noninvasive cortisol detection using non-faradic EIS. A novel multilayer immunosensor was fabricated on poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-coated indium-tin-oxide (ITO) glass by functionalizing with cortisol antibodies. Specific and rapid detection of cortisol was measured by monitoring the change in impedance in a dynamic range of 50-200ng/mL. A robust correlation of 0.97 was observed between impedance values and cortisol concentration, highlighting the linearity and repeatability of the sensor. We envision that the developed immunosensor has the potential for new developments in stress monitoring, disease prognosis, and personalized care.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Global disparity exists in the demographics, pathology, management, and outcomes of surgically treated traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the factors underlying these differences, including intervention effectiveness, remain unclear. Establishing a more accurate global picture of the burden of TBI represents a challenging task requiring systematic and ongoing data collection of patients with TBI across all management modalities. The objective of this study was to establish a global registry that would enable local service benchmarking against a global standard, identification of unmet need in TBI management, and its evidence-based prioritization in policymaking. METHODS: The registry was developed in an iterative consensus-based manner by a panel of neurotrauma professionals. Proposed registry objectives, structure, and data points were established in 2 international multidisciplinary neurotrauma meetings, after which a survey consisting of the same data points was circulated within the global neurotrauma community. The survey results were disseminated in a final meeting to reach a consensus on the most pertinent registry variables. RESULTS: A total of 156 professionals from 53 countries, including both high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries, responded to the survey. The final consensus-based registry includes patients with TBI who required neurosurgical admission, a neurosurgical procedure, or a critical care admission. The data set comprised clinically pertinent information on demographics, injury characteristics, imaging, treatments, and short-term outcomes. Based on the consensus, the Global Epidemiology and Outcomes following Traumatic Brain Injury (GEO-TBI) registry was established. CONCLUSION: The GEO-TBI registry will enable high-quality data collection, clinical auditing, and research activity, and it is supported by the World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies and the National Institute of Health Research Global Health Program. The GEO-TBI registry (https://geotbi.org) is now open for participant site recruitment. Any center involved in TBI management is welcome to join the collaboration to access the registry.

AB  - ObjectiveF-18 Fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (FDG-PET) is emerging as a useful imaging adjunct to MRI in the initial diagnostic evaluation of autoimmune encephalitis (AIE)-though presently it is not included in the diagnostic criteria.Materials and methodsIn this prospective study we enrolled a total of 52 patients with clinically diagnosed and treated AIE. MRI evaluation was done in each case along with CSF and EEG where feasible. FDG-PET was done for all and images were interpreted visually and using SPM.ResultsThe mean age group of patients included was 38.5 +/- 22.6 years with 31 females and 21 males. 23 antibody-positive cases underwent PET, the most common antibody detected was anti-NMDAR type followed by anti-LGI 1. Most common metabolic pattern in NMDARE was hypermetabolism in basal ganglia and hypometabolism in parieto-occipital cortices and ovarian teratoma was detected in two of these patients on whole-body PET. A metabolic pattern consistent with AIE was demonstrated in 22/29 (75.8%) antibody-negative patients with hypermetabolism in basal ganglia and mesial temporal cortices. The overall sensitivity of FDG PET was 86% (45/52). MRI abnormalities were detected in 22/52 (42%) cases, 10/23 antibody positive and 12/29 antibody negative cases. PET was positive in 23/30 (76%) MRI negative cases.ConclusionSensitivity of FDG PET for supporting a diagnosis of AIE was higher compared to MRI in both antibody-positive (definitive) and antibody-negative (presumed) AIE. Specific metabolic patterns can be demonstrated on FDG PET in AIE, prompting an early diagnosis so that timely treatment can be instituted.

AB  - Introduction The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in March 2020 disrupted the lives of families across India. The lockdown related restrictions brought forth a multitude of challenges including loss of employment, social isolation, school closures and financial burdens. Specifically, it also resulted in the restriction of health-care services for children with neurodevelopmental disabilities.Methods This qualitative study was conducted as a part of a larger trial in India to understand the experiences of families of young children with autism during the pandemic. In-depth interviews were carried out with 14 caregivers residing in New Delhi, India.Results Our findings identified pandemic and lockdown's universal impacts on family life and financial stability stemming from job loss, business closure, and salary deductions, affecting quality of life of families. Furthermore, COVID-19 pandemic's impact on autistic children was evident through limited access to essential services and financial challenges related service interruptions even after resumption of services. The lockdown's novelty also affected children's behavior, with both challenging behavioral changes and positive impacts. Primary caregivers, predominantly mothers, assumed additional responsibilities in household tasks, schooling, and therapy administration. While some these experiences were universally experienced, a few of these improved outcomes for autistic children. Despite challenges, parents expressed gratitude for their family's safety and well-being during the difficult time.Discussions These findings inform service provision for vulnerable families and offer implications for designing interventions such as credit schemes for families, guidance and resources for establishing and maintaining routines of children with autism, adopting flexible and adaptable approaches to service delivery, and special provisions for children with autism to be able to maintain their routines outside of home. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for comprehensive support, including educational resources and stress management counselling to empower parents in supporting essential care and routines for their children during such unprecedented times.

AB  - Background In a historic move to ensure comprehensive abortion care, India amended the 1971 Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act in 2021, creating an unprecedented opportunity for accelerating safe, respectful, and rights-based abortion services. The Federation of Obstetric and Gynecological Societies of India (FOGSI), together with World Health Organization (WHO) India and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, set up a flagship initiative "Respectful Abortion Care" (RAC) to provide training to obstetricians and gynecologists on the new Act, and also address their values and biases. Methods Virtual training sessions were organized during the COVID-19 pandemic to disseminate the amendments made under the MTP Act and address provider values and biases. The primary focus was on private providers as they account for more than half of all abortion services in India (52.9%). The RAC modules were systematically designed and delivered by 690 Master Trainers, trained by FOGSI and WHO. Results A total of 9051 FOGSI members (22%, with 50% from private clinics) completed the RAC trainings. Pretests and post-tests were conducted for impact assessment. Significant improvement was seen on knowledge of criteria for termination of pregnancy for significant birth defects (52%-83%). The post-training survey showed a high level of commitment to promote RAC: >95% were strongly motivated to perform or assist in abortion; 89% reported that the WHO value clarification exercises were helpful in facilitating open discussions on sensitive topics in a comfortable manner; 96% expressed a strong commitment to addressing the issue of respect and confidentiality in abortion care. Conclusion RAC was a unique initiative around the MTP Act amendment 2021 in India, which demonstrated that collaboration and leadership by professional associations can help motivate providers and lead to improved knowledge and commitment from public and private sector providers.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
KW  - Choroidal melanoma
KW  - macular choroidal melanoma
KW  - plaque brachytherapy
AB  - Background: Plaque brachytherapy is commonly used in the management of choroidal melanomas. The surgical steps usually involve creating a conjunctival peritomy, fixing the recti muscles, with or without disinserting them based on the location of the lesion, and placing the plaque. The inferior oblique muscle is attached close to the macula, and in cases of perimacular or peripapillary lesions, the muscle needs to be sacrificed. Purpose: The authors here demonstrate a novel technique of placing radioactive plaque without disinserting the inferior oblique muscle in cases of perimacular or peripapillary choroidal melanomas. Synopsis: The video demonstrates how the "disinsert, retract, and rotate technique" of brachytherapy plaque placement can be performed and what are the fundamentals behind this technique. The authors have performed this procedure multiple times and there has been no incidence of plaque tilt or migration. Highlights: In perimacular and peripapillary choroidal melanoma brachytherapy plaque placement, the inferior oblique muscle can be spared. The simple technique does not lead to any tilt or migration of the radioactive plaque. Video Link: https://youtu.be/YMIg3rYyp2o

AB  - Accurate diagnosis of Epithelioid glioblastoma (eGB) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is sometimes challenging owing to overlapping histologic and genetic features. There are limited reports on the immune profile of these tumors. In this study, we assessed 21 PXA [15 PXA Grade 2 (PXAG2); 6 PXA Grade 3 (PXAG3)] and 14 eGB for their histopathological and molecular association. Further, their immune profile was compared with GB, IDH1 wild-type (wt) (n-18). Morphologically, PXAG2 mostly differed from eGB; however, it was occasionally difficult to differentiate PXAG3 from eGB due to their epithelioid pattern and less obvious degenerative features. PXAG2 showed predominantly diffuse, whereas variable positivity for epithelial and glial markers was seen in PXAG3 and eGB. All cases showed retained nuclear ATRX and INI-1. H3K27M or IDH1 mutation was seen in none. P53 mutation was more common in eGB, followed by PXAG3, and least common in PXAG2. BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 66.67% PXAG2, 33.33% PXAG3, and 50% eGB, with 100% concordance between immunohistochemistry (IHC) and sequencing. Thirty-six percent eGB, 33% PXAG3, and 61% PXAG2 harbored CDKN2A homozygous deletion. EGFR amplification was observed in 14% eGB and 66% of GB, IDH wt. PDL1 and CTLA-4 expression was higher in eGB (71.4% and 57.1%), PXAG3 (66.6% and100%), and PXAG2 (60% & 66.7%) as compared with GB, IDH wt (38.8% and 16.7%). Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were also observed in a majority of eGB and PXA (90% to 100%) in contrast to GB, IDH wt (66%). This analysis highlights the homogenous molecular and immune profile of eGB and PXA, suggesting the possibility that histologically and molecularly, these two entities represent 2 ends of a continuous spectrum with PXAG3 lying in between. Higher upregulation of PDL1, CTLA-4, and increased tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in these tumors as compared with GB, IDH wt suggests potential candidature for immunotherapy.

AB  - Background: This study was conducted with the objective of measuring the neutralizing and anti-receptor binding domain antibody levels against SARS-CoV-2 among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and exploring its long-term kinetics over a period of 1 year. Methods: One hundred laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases were recruited. Serum samples of the participants were collected within three months from the date of the positive COVID-19 report. The participants were prospectively followed up every three months for symptoms and the collection of blood samples for three additional rounds. The presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgA, IgG, and IgM antibodies), anti-receptor binding domain antibodies (anti-RBD), and neutralizing antibodies were measured. Findings: Median plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titers showed a rising trend in the first three rounds of follow-up. The quantitative anti-receptor binding domain ELISA (QRBD) values showed a declining trend in the initial three rounds. However, both the PRNT titers and QRBD values showed significantly higher values for the fourth round of follow-up. Total antibody (WANTAI) levels showed an increasing trend in the initial three rounds (statistically significant). Interpretation: Neutralizing antibodies showed an increasing trend. The anti-receptor binding domain antibodies showed a decreasing trend. Neutralizing antibodies and anti-RBD antibodies persisted in the majority.

AB  - Objective:Although the prevalence of disordered eating is maximum in high-income countries, the most significant rise occurred in East Asia and South Asia over the last three decades. Body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) are more common than full-blown eating disorders. The cognitive distortion leading to these manifestations mainly occurs during adolescence and early adulthood. In this study, we assess the burden of DEBs in a cohort of Indian adolescents and determine their correlation with body dissatisfaction, calorie intake, and clinicosocial determinants.Methods:The study was conducted from November 2016 to November 2020 and enrolled 180 adolescents of 10-18 years attending the outpatient department of a tertiary-care hospital. Subjects were screened for DEBs, using a 15-item Screening Questionnaire for Eating Distress Syndromes, and for body dissatisfaction, using Photographic-Figure-Rating-Scale. Clinicosocial interviews, dietary and anthropometric evaluation, and psychiatric screening using a Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI-KIDS screen) were conducted.Results:DEB was present in 17.2% of adolescents, while 81.1% had body dissatisfaction and 32.2% had some psychiatric symptoms. The prevalence of DEBs in females was much higher than in males (OR = 7.89, 95%CI: 2.25-27.75, P = 0.001). More males (84.1%) reported body dissatisfaction than females (76.7%) [chi(2) =9.2, P = 0.010]. However, while females wished to lose weight, males desired weight gain, as measured by body dissatisfaction score (t = 2.9, P = 0.004). Apart from sex, other factors found significant in predicting DEBs in multivariate analysis were education, body dissatisfaction, BMI, and the number of siblings.Conclusion:We conclude that, unlike overt eating disorders, DEBs are common in Indian adolescents. The development of DEBs is influenced by gender, education, body dissatisfaction, BMI, and the number of siblings.

AB  - Background: Depression and anxiety are among the most prevalent mental health issues experienced worldwide. However, whereas cross-cultural studies utilize psychometrically valid and reliable scales, fewer can meaningfully compare these conditions across different groups. To address this gap, the current study aimed to psychometrically assess the Brief Symptomatology Index (BSI) in 42 countries. Methods: Using data from the International Sex Survey (N = 82,243; Mage = 32.39; SDage = 12.52; women: n = 46,874; 57 %), we examined the reliability of depression and anxiety symptom scores of the BSI -18, as well as evaluated evidence of construct, invariance, and criterion -related validity in predicting clinically relevant variables across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. Results: Results corroborated an invariant, two -factor structure across all groups tested, exhibiting excellent reliability estimates for both subscales. The 'caseness' criterion effectively discriminated among those at low and high risk of depression and anxiety, yielding differential effects on the clinical criteria examined. Limitations: The predictive validation was not made against a clinical diagnosis, and the full BSI -18 scale was not examined (excluding the somatization sub -dimension), limiting the validation scope of the BSI -18. Finally, the study was conducted online, mainly by advertisements through social media, ultimately skewing our sample towards women, younger, and highly educated populations. Conclusions: The results support that the BSI-12 is a valid and reliable assessment tool for assessing depression and anxiety symptoms across countries, languages, genders, and sexual orientations. Further, its caseness criterion can discriminate well between participants at high and low risk of depression and anxiety.

AB  - Problem: Increased oxidative stress (OS) and inflammatory responses are major underlying factors behind Chlamydia trachomatis-associated recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA). miRNAs are known to regulate inflammation and OS and their dysregulation has been associated with compromised pregnancies. Therefore, aim of this study was to investigate the expression/correlation of OS biomarkers, cytokines and miRNAs in C. trachomatis-associated RSA. Method of Study: Urine and non-heparinized blood samples were collected from RSA patients with history of >3 consecutive abortions (cases) and non-pregnant women with history of >2 successful deliveries (controls) attending Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Safdarjung hospital, New Delhi. C. trachomatis detection was done in urine by PCR. miRNA expression was studied by microarray analysis and validated by real time-PCR. Evaluation of cytokines and antioxidant genes expression were done by real-time PCR. Level of OS biomarkers 8-hydroxy guanosine (8-OHdG) and 8-isporostane (8-IP) were measured by ELISA. Results: Fifty circulating miRNAs were differentially expressed in infected patients compared with controls. Of these, four were overexpressed and 46 downregulated. Thirteen differentially expressed circulating miRNAs were selected to validate microarray results. miRs-8069, -3663-3p showed maximum upregulation/downregulation in infected versus control group. Expression of cytokines (IL-8, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma), antioxidant genes SOD2 and OS biomarkers (8-OHdG,8-IP) were increased while SOD1 was decreased in infected patients. miR-8069 showed significant positive correlation with cytokines, SOD2, 8-OHdG and 8-IP. miR-3663-3p showed significant positive correlation with SOD1. Conclusions: Overall results indicate circulating miRNAs are involved in pathogenesis of C. trachomatis-associated RSA and are potential modulators of cytokine signalling and OS in infected RSA.

KW  - SURGICAL-MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Negative Dysphotopsia (ND) Ring implantation for treating and preventing ND. Setting: Multicentric tertiary eye hospitals. Design: Prospective interventional cohort study. Methods: 22 patients with ND were enrolled. Eyes with other ocular structural pathologies (corneal, macular, optic nerve head, retinal, neuro-ophthalmological) were excluded. In 15 eyes, the ring was implanted to treat ND (therapeutic group), and in 7 eyes, it was implanted during cataract surgery of the fellow eye as a prophylactic measure (prophylactic group) to prevent the occurrence of ND. Preoperative evaluation included video recording of the patients' complaints aside complete eye examination. Postoperatively, patients were interviewed to confirm resolution of complaints related to ND. The intraoperative difficulties and postoperative adverse events were recorded. A minimum follow-up of 1 year was completed for all eyes. Results: In the therapeutic group, 14 of 15 eyes (93.3%) patients reported complete resolution of ND on the first postoperative day while 1 patient reported persistence of a smaller and lighter temporal shadow. No ND was reported by any patient in any of the 7 eyes treated prophylactically. No significant adverse intraoperative event was recorded; however, vitreous upthrust was noted in 2 of 22 eyes (9.0%). No permanent drop in visual acuity was recorded in the therapeutic group. Conclusions: ND Ring implantation was an easy, safe, and effective approach for both treating and preventing ND.

AB  - Purpose : Lu-177-PSMA-617 has been shown to improve survival outcomes in patients with end-stage metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, data in earlier lines remain limited. In this study, we intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in patients with synchronous high-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).Patients and Methods : Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients with synchronous high-volume metastases (defined as >= 4 skeletal metastases with >= 1 extra-axial site or any visceral metastasis) showing high PSMA expression on Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT and ineligible/unwilling for conventional chemohormonal treatment options were selected. Approximately, similar to 5.55-7.4 GBq of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was administered intravenously at 8-12 weeks intervals, up to 6 cycles. All patients underwent concomitant androgen deprivation therapy/orchiectomy. The outcome measures included the proportion of patients achieving an undetectable serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (ie, <= 0.2 ng/mL) at any time point after therapy, best PSA response rate, objective radiographic response rate, radiographic progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events.Results : Ten patients with high-volume mHSPC received a median cumulative activity of 32.4 GBq (range, 7.4-44.4) of Lu-177-PSMA-617 over 1-6 cycles. Five patients (50%) achieved an undetectable PSA with 9 patients (90%) showing a >= 50% decline in PSA from baseline. Nine patients underwent radiological follow-up, of which 7 (77.8%) had an objective response. The median radiographic progression-free survival was 24 months (95% confidence interval, 18-30), whereas the median overall survival was not reached. None of the patients had any grade 3/4 adverse event.Conclusions : Lu-177-PSMA-617 seems to be a promising efficacious and safe treatment option for patients with synchronous high-volume mHSPC.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to directly evaluate glucose, amino-acid and membrane metabolism in tumor cells for diagnosis and prognostication of recurrent gliomas.
   Methods Fifty-five patients (median age = 36 years; 33 men) with histologically proven gliomas and suspected recurrence were prospectively recruited and underwent 18F-FDG (Fluorodeoxyglucose), 18F-FDOPA (fluorodopa) and 18F-Fluorocholine-PET/CT. Images were evaluated by two physicians visually and quantitatively [lesion-SUVmax, tumor (T) to gray-matter (G) and metabolically-active tumor volumes (MTV)]. After median follow-up of 51.5 months, recurrence was diagnosed in 49 patients. Thirty-one patients died with a median survival of 14 months.
   Results Diagnostic-accuracies for 18F-FDOPA, 18F-Fluorocholine,18F-FDG and contrast-enhanced-MRI were 92.7% (95% CI 82.7-97.1), 81.8% (69.7-89.8), 45.5% (33.0-58.5) and 44.7% (30.2-60.3), respectively. Among the 20 lesions, missed by MRI; 18F-FDOPA, 18F-Fluorocholine and 18F-FDG were able to detect 19, 14 and 4 lesions. Corresponding area-under-the-curves (T/G ratios) were 0.817 (0.615-1.000), 0.850 (0.736-0.963) and 0.814 (0.658-0.969), when differentiating recurrence from treatment-induced changes. In univariate-survival-analysis, 18F-FDOPA-T/G, visually detectable recurrence in 18F-FDG, 18F-FDOPA-MTV, cell-lineage and treatment-type were significant parameters. In Multivariate-Cox-regression analysis, 18F-FDOPA-MTV [HR = 1.009 (1.001-1.017); P = 0.024 (similar to 0.9% increase in hazard for every mL increase of MTV)] and cell-lineage [3.578 (1.447-8.846); P = 0.006] remained significant. 18F-FDOPA-MTV cutoff <29.59 mL predicted survival higher than 2 years. At cutoff >= 29.59 mL, HR at 2 years was 2.759 (1.310-5.810).
   Conclusion 18F-FDOPA-PET/CT can diagnose recurrence with high accuracy and MTV predicts survival. 18F-Fluorocholine is a good alternative. Higher 18F-FDG uptake is an adverse prognostic indicator.

AB  - Background & objectives: Irrational prescribing practices have major consequences on patient safety and also increase the economic burden. Real-life examples of impact of irrational prescription have potential to improve prescribing practices. In this context, the present study aimed to capture and evaluate the prevalence of deviations from treatment guidelines in the prescriptions, potential consequence/s of the deviations and corrective actions recommended by clinicians. Methods: It was a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the outpatient departments of tertiary care hospitals in India wherein the 13 Indian Council of Medical Research Rational Use of Medicines Centres are located. Prescriptions not compliant with the standard treatment guidelines and incomplete prescriptions with respect to formulation, dose, duration and frequency were labelled as 'prescriptions having deviations'. A deviation that could result in a drug interaction, lack of response, increased cost, preventable adverse drug reaction (ADR) and/or antimicrobial resistance was labelled as an 'unacceptable deviation'. Results: Against all the prescriptions assessed, about one tenth of them (475/4838; 9.8%) had unacceptable deviations. However, in 2667/4838 (55.1%) prescriptions, the clinicians had adhered to the treatment guidelines. Two thousand one hundred and seventy-one prescriptions had deviations, of which 475 (21.9%) had unacceptable deviations with pantoprazole (n=54), rabeprazole+domperidone (n=35) and oral enzyme preparations (n=24) as the most frequently prescribed drugs and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and hypertension as most common diseases with unacceptable deviations. The potential consequences of deviations were increase in cost (n=301), ADRs (n=254), drug interactions (n=81), lack of therapeutic response (n=77) and antimicrobial resistance (n=72). Major corrective actions proposed for consideration were issuance of an administrative order (n=196) and conducting online training programme (n=108). Interpretation & conclusions: The overall prevalence of deviations found was 45 per cent of which unacceptable deviations was estimated to be 9.8 per cent. To minimize the deviations, clinicians recommended online training on rational prescribing and administrative directives as potential interventions.

AB  - Background: The characterization of inherited mild factor XIII deficiency is more imprecise than its rare, inherited severe forms. It is known that heterozygosity at FXIII genetic loci results in mild FXIII deficiency, characterized by circulating FXIII activity levels ranging from 20% to 60%. There exists a gap in information on 1) how genetic heterozygosity renders clinical bleeding manifestations among these individuals and 2) the reversal of unexplained bleeding upon FXIII administration in mild FXIII-deficient individuals. Objectives: To assess the prevalence and burden of mild FXIII deficiency among the apparently healthy German -Caucasian population and correlate it with genetic heterozygosity at FXIII and fibrinogen gene loci. Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 752 donors selected from the general population with essentially no bleeding complications to ensure asymptomatic predisposition. These were assessed for FXIII and fibrinogen activity, and FXIII and fibrinogen genes were resequenced using next -generation sequencing. For comparison, a retrospective analysis was performed on a cohort of mild inherited FXIII deficiency patients referred to us. Results: The prevalence of mild FXIII deficiency was high (-0.8%) among the screened German -Caucasian population compared with its rare -severe forms. Although no new heterozygous missense variants were found, certain combinations were relatively dominant/prevalent among the mild FXIII-deficient individuals. Conclusion: This extensive, population -based quasi -experimental approach revealed that the burden of heterozygosity in FXIII and fibrinogen gene loci causes the clinical manifestation of inherited mild FXIII deficiency, resulting in ''unexplained bleeding"upon provocation.

AB  - The Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) maintains the world's largest extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) registry by volume, center participation, and international scope. This 2022 ELSO Registry Report describes the program characteristics of ECMO centers, processes of ECMO care, and reported outcomes. Neonates (0-28 days), children (29 days-17 years), and adults (>= 18 years) supported with ECMO from 2009 through 2022 and reported to the ELSO Registry were included. This report describes adjunctive therapies, support modes, treatments, complications, and survival outcomes. Data are presented descriptively as counts and percent or median and interquartile range (IQR) by year, group, or level. Missing values were excluded before calculating descriptive statistics. Complications are reported per 1,000 ECMO hours. From 2009 to 2022, 154,568 ECMO runs were entered into the ELSO Registry. Seven hundred and eighty centers submitted data during this time (557 in 2022). Since 2009, the median annual number of adult ECMO runs per center per year increased from 4 to 15, whereas for pediatric and neonatal runs, the rate decreased from 12 to 7. Over 50% of patients were transferred to the reporting ECMO center; 20% of these patients were transported with ECMO. The use of prone positioning before respiratory ECMO increased from 15% (2019) to 44% (2021) for adults during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Survival to hospital discharge was greatest at 68.5% for neonatal respiratory support and lowest at 29.5% for ECPR delivered to adults. By 2022, the Registry had enrolled its 200,000th ECMO patient and 100,000th patient discharged alive. Since its inception, the ELSO Registry has helped centers measure and compare outcomes across its member centers and strategies of care. Continued growth and development of the Registry will aim to bolster its utility to patients and centers.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs), through their complex cargo, can reflect the state of their cell of origin and change the functions and phenotypes of other cells. These features indicate strong biomarker and therapeutic potential and have generated broad interest, as evidenced by the steady year-on-year increase in the numbers of scientific publications about EVs. Important advances have been made in EV metrology and in understanding and applying EV biology. However, hurdles remain to realising the potential of EVs in domains ranging from basic biology to clinical applications due to challenges in EV nomenclature, separation from non-vesicular extracellular particles, characterisation and functional studies. To address the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field, the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) updates its 'Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles', which was first published in 2014 and then in 2018 as MISEV2014 and MISEV2018, respectively. The goal of the current document, MISEV2023, is to provide researchers with an updated snapshot of available approaches and their advantages and limitations for production, separation and characterisation of EVs from multiple sources, including cell culture, body fluids and solid tissues. In addition to presenting the latest state of the art in basic principles of EV research, this document also covers advanced techniques and approaches that are currently expanding the boundaries of the field. MISEV2023 also includes new sections on EV release and uptake and a brief discussion of in vivo approaches to study EVs. Compiling feedback from ISEV expert task forces and more than 1000 researchers, this document conveys the current state of EV research to facilitate robust scientific discoveries and move the field forward even more rapidly.

AB  - The study investigates morphometric changes using surface -based measures and logistic regression in Major depressive -disorder (MDD) and Manic -disorder patients as compared to controls. MDD (n = 21) and manic (n = 20) subjects were recruited from psychiatric clinics, along with 19 healthycontrols from local population, after structured and semi -structured clinical interview (DSM-IV, brief Psychotic -Rating Scale (BPRS), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS), cognitive function by postgraduate Institute Battery of Brain Dysfunction (PGIBBD)). Using 3D T1 -weighted images, gray matter (GM) cortical thickness and GM -based morphometric signatures (using logistic regression) were compared among MDD, manic disorder and controls using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). No significant difference was found between the MDD and manic disorder patients. When compared to controls, cortical thinning was observed in bilateral rostral middle frontal gyrus and parsopercularis, right lateral occipital cortex, right lingual gyrus in MDD; and bilateral rostral middle frontal and superior frontal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left supramarginal and left precentral gyrus in Manic disorders. Logistic regression analysis exhibited GM cortical thinning in the bilateral parsopercularis, right lateral occipital cortex and lingual gyrus in MDD; and bilateral rostral middle, superior frontal gyri, right middle temporal gyrus in Manic with a sensitivity and specificity of 85.7 % and 94.7 % and 90.0 % and 94.7 %, respectively in comparison with controls. Both groups exhibited GM loss in bilateral rostral middle frontal gyrus brain regions compared to controls. Multivariate analysis revealed common changes in GM in MDD and manic disorders associated with mood temperament, but differences when compared to controls.

AB  - Background: Nomophobia is a situational phobia evoked by unavailability of smart phone or the thought of the possibility of not having it, not being able to use it and losing it. Currently used instruments for assessment of severity of nomophobia offers challenges of administration and have limited applicability in the Indian setting. Therefore, this study was aimed to depict and understand the lived experience of college students with nomophobia and making sense of it.Methods: This interpretative phenomenological analysis research design study was carried out on 17 undergraduate students belonging to different academic streams including Science, Social science and Commerce from the three study sites situated in different locations of India. An in-depth interview guide was prepared. The students who scored more than 90 on nomophobia questionnaire (NMP-Q Questionnaire) were included in the study. The data was recorded in audio and video format, it was transcribed, and translated from Hindi to English language. Coding was done and the theme were extracted.Results: The findings identified six superordinate themes: Digital Obsession, Digital Compulsion, Approval Motivation, Digital Intensement, Digital Well-being and Insight.Conclusion: The lived experiences of the students with nomophobia had explicitly shown a strong inclination towards the smartphone. They also focused on some of the significant aids provided by the smartphone. Further the intensive use of the smartphone was posing major challenges to the students when they were away from it.

AB  - Dengue virus infection in humans ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe infection, with similar to 2.5 % overall disease fatality rate. Evidence of neurological manifestations is seen in the severe form of the disease, which might be due to the direct invasion of the viruses into the CNS system but is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that the aged AG129 mice are highly susceptible to dengue serotypes 1-4, and following the adaptation, this resulted in the generation of neurovirulent strains that showed enhanced replication, aggravated disease severity, increased neuropathogenesis, and high lethality in both adult and aged AG129 mice. The infected mice had endothelial dysfunction, elicited pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, and exhibited 100 % mortality. Further analysis revealed that aged-adapted DENV strains induced measurable alterations in TLR expression in the aged mice as compared to the adult mice. In addition, metabolomics analysis of the serum samples from the infected adult mice revealed dysregulation of 18 metabolites and upregulation of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, phosphocreatine, and taurocholic acid. These metabolites may serve as key biomarkers to decipher and comprehend the severity of dengue-associated severe neuro-pathogenesis.

AB  - Background: Obesity is associated with greater oxytocin requirement during labor induction or augmentation. There are scant data exploring the intra-operative requirement during cesarean delivery in patients with obesity, and none comparing it with those without obesity. We evaluated the minimum effective dose (ED90) of an oxytocin infusion to achieve adequate uterine tone during cesarean delivery in patients with and without obesity. Methods: Patients (body mass index >= 30 kg/m2 represented patients with obesity) undergoing cesarean delivery using subarachnoid block were included. This prospective dual-arm dose-finding study used a 9:1 biased sequential allocation design. Oxytocin infusion was initiated at 13 IU/h at cord clamping in the first patient of each group. Uterine tone was graded as satisfactory or unsatisfactory by the obstetrician four minutes after initiation of the infusion. The dose of oxytocin infusion for subsequent patients was determined according to the response of the previous patient in the group. Oxytocin-associated side effects were evaluated. Doseresponse data for the groups was evaluated using log-logistic function and ED90 estimates derived from fitted equations using the delta method. Results: The ED90 of oxytocin was significantly higher for patients with obesity (n = 40) compared with those without obesity (n = 40) [25.7 IU/h, 95% CI 18.6 to 32.9) vs. 16.6 IU/h, 95% CI 14.9 to 18.3)]; relative ratio 1.55 [95% CI 1.09 to 2.01] (P = 0.019). Conclusions: Patients with obesity require a higher intra-operative oxytocin infusion dose rate to achieve a satisfactorily contracted uterus after fetal delivery when compared with patients without obesity.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of low-dose atropine 0.01% in controlling myopia progression among Indian children over a 2-year period. Methods This retrospective study, conducted across 20 centres in India, monitored the progression of myopia over 2 years after initiating treatment with 0.01% atropine eye drops. This included children between 6 and 14 years with baseline myopia ranging from -0.5 D to -6 D, astigmatism <=-1.5 D, anisometropia <= -1 D and documented myopia progression of >= 0.5 D in the year prior to starting atropine. Subjects with any other ocular pathologies were excluded. Results A total of 732 children were included in the data analysis. The mean age of the subjects was 9.3 +/- 2.7 years. The mean myopia progression at baseline (1 year before starting atropine) was -0.75 +/- 0.31 D. The rate of myopia progression was higher in younger subjects and those with higher baseline myopic error. After initiating atropine, myopia progression significantly decreased to -0.27 +/- 0.14 D at the end of the first year and -0.24 +/- 0.15 D at the end of the second year (p<0.001). Younger children (p<0.001) and higher baseline myopia (p<0.001) was associated with greater myopia progression and poor treatment response (p<0.001 for both). Conclusion Low-dose atropine (0.01%) effectively reduces myopia progression over 2 years in Indian children.

AB  - Hyperleukocytosis in leukemic patients may cause tumour lysis syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and leukostasis, resulting in decreased tissue perfusion and increasing the risk of mortality. Since the myeloid blasts are larger than lymphoid blasts and are less deformable, complications of leukostasis are seen more frequently in myeloid leukemia. Priapism is a less common complication associated with leukostasis in leukaemia patients that should be treated as soon as possible to avoid ischemic injuries. Although chemotherapeutic drugs such as hydroxyurea and imatinib are used to treat hyperleukocytosis in CML patients, leukocytapheresis (LCP) can achieve rapid cytoreduction. Prophylactic LCP could not offer any advantage over aggressive chemotherapy, but therapeutic leukocyte depletion has a proven role in patients having symptomatic leukostasis due to high tumour burden. Three patients with ischaemic priapism were reported at our institute's emergency department, where detumescence could not be achieved by distal shunting or aspiration with phenylephrine instillation. The procedure of therapeutic LCP was performed in all three patients on an emergency basis, which resolved painful priapism by rapid cytoreduction.

AB  - While there is a renewed interest in the use of infrared imaging in the medical field owing to improvements in image acquisition and processing technologies, its utility in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus on a large scale has not been adequately evaluated in previous studies. This was a multicenter, double-blind case-control trial across three centers in India which enrolled a total of 1095 adults in two groups-590 participants with diabetes and 505 healthy controls. The primary outcome was the difference in thermography readings between the two groups. The secondary outcomes included the correlation of thermography readings with HbA1C, considered the gold standard. The thermography readings at all seven sites were lower in people with diabetes as compared to the control group. However, this attained statistical significance across four sites-forehead (Delta mean difference = 0.34, 95% CI [0.14-0.53], medial canthus of both eyes (Delta mean difference = 0.48, 95% CI [0.31-0.66], pinna of both ears (Delta mean difference = 0.53, 95% CI [0.28-0.73]) and palmar surface of both hands (Delta mean difference = 0.28, 95% CI [0.02-0.53]). In addition, thermography readings showed a significant negative correlation with HbA1C values across these four sites, although the strength of the correlation was weak. This study sheds light on the utility of thermography for large-scale noninvasive diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Future research should focus on large-scale community screening of early asymptomatic disease as well as micro- and macrovascular complications to define its exact role in the overall disease management pathway.

AB  - Background and AimStroke represents a significant public health challenge, necessitating the exploration of preventive measures. This network meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of different vitamin treatments compared to a placebo in preventing stroke.MethodsA systematic electronic search in databases including PubMed, EmBASE, Web of Science, , and Google Scholar until 31 May 2023 was conducted, to identify published studies investigating the association between vitamin intake and the risk of stroke. Pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was calculated using a frequentist network meta-analysis. Furthermore, we ranked vitamins based on p-scores, facilitating a comparative assessment of their effectiveness in preventing stroke.ResultsA total of 56 studies, including 17 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 39 cohort studies were analyzed. Direct estimates obtained from network meta-analysis, we found that vitamin A (RR: .81 [.72-.91]), vitamin B-complex (RR: .85 [.74-.97]), vitamin B6 (RR: 79 [.68-.92]), folate (RR: .86 [.75-.97]), vitamin C (RR: .77 [.70-.85]) and vitamin D (RR: .73 [.64-.83]) were significantly associated with a decreased stroke risk. However, no significant association was observed for vitamin B2, vitamin B12, and vitamin E. Subsequent to network meta-analysis, vitamins were ranked in decreasing order of their efficacy in stroke prevention based on p-score, with vitamin D (p-score = .91), vitamin C (p-score = .79), vitamin B6 (p-score = .70), vitamin A (p-score = .65), vitamin B-complex (p-score = .53), folate (p-score = .49), vitamin B2 (p-score = .39), vitamin E (p-score = .28), vitamin B12 (.13) and placebo (.10).ConclusionOur study has established noteworthy connections between vitamin A, vitamin B-complex, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin C, and vitamin D in the realm of stroke prevention. These findings add substantial weight to the accumulating evidence supporting the potential advantages of vitamin interventions in mitigating the risk of stroke. However, to solidify and validate these observations, additional research is imperative. Well-designed clinical trials or cohort studies are needed to further explore these associations and formulate clear guidelines for incorporating vitamin supplementation into effective stroke prevention strategies.

AB  - BackgroundBacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common clinical manifestation of a perturbed vaginal ecology associated with adverse sexual and reproductive health outcomes if left untreated. The existing diagnostic modalities are either cumbersome or require skilled expertise, warranting alternate tests. Application of machine-learning tools to heterogeneous and high-dimensional multi-omics datasets finds promising potential in data integration and may aid biomarker discovery.ObjectivesThe present study aimed to evaluate the potential of the microbiome and metabolome-derived biomarkers in BV diagnosis. Interpretable machine-learning algorithms were used to evaluate the utility of an integrated-omics-derived classification model.MethodsVaginal samples obtained from reproductive-age group women with (n = 40) and without BV (n = 40) were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and LC-MS-based metabolomics. The vaginal microbiome and metabolome were characterized, and machine-learning analysis was performed to build a classification model using biomarkers with the highest diagnostic accuracy.ResultsMicrobiome-based diagnostic model exhibited a ROC-AUC (10-fold CV) of 0.84 +/- 0.21 and accuracy of 0.79 +/- 0.18, and important features were Aerococcus spp., Mycoplasma hominis, Sneathia spp., Lactobacillus spp., Prevotella spp., Gardnerella spp. and Fannyhessea vaginae. The metabolome-derived model displayed superior performance with a ROC-AUC of 0.97 +/- 0.07 and an accuracy of 0.92 +/- 0.08. Beta-leucine, methylimidazole acetaldehyde, dimethylethanolamine, L-arginine and beta cortol were among key predictive metabolites for BV. A predictive model combining both microbial and metabolite features exhibited a high ROC-AUC of 0.97 +/- 0.07 and accuracy of 0.94 +/- 0.08 with diagnostic performance only slightly superior to the metabolite-based model.ConclusionApplication of machine-learning tools to multi-omics datasets aid biomarker discovery with high predictive performance. Metabolome-derived classification models were observed to have superior diagnostic performance in predicting BV than microbiome-based biomarkers.

KW  - Trichilemmal carcinoma
AB  - Trichilemmal carcinoma is a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal neoplasm arising from the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. Majority of cases occur on sun-exposed sites such as the face, scalp and neck, making them easily amenable to being biopsied and subjected to histological examination for definitive diagnosis. Thus, cytological features of trichilemmal carcinoma have not been described till date. Trichilemmal carcinoma is a low-grade malignancy, albeit with potential to metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. We report the case of trichilemmal carcinoma of scalp that metastasized to cervical lymph nodes and parotid gland and underwent fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the parotid lesion. The aspirate showed tightly cohesive cell clusters with sharp borders. Tumour cells ranged from basaloid with scant cytoplasm to those with abundant cytoplasm. Nuclei were vesicular, with inconspicuous to prominent nuclei. Intercellular bridges, masses of keratin, and fragments of desmoplastic stroma were present, closely recapitulating histological features of trichilemmal carcinoma, which enabled diagnosis as metastasis. Cell block showed similar tumour fragments with evidence of differentiation towards outer root sheath. FNAC is the first-line investigation to obtain a tissue diagnosis of masses in the head and neck region. Although rarely encountered, the lack of knowledge of cytological features of trichilemmal carcinoma may hamper its FNAC diagnosis at metastatic sites. When intraparotid metastases occur, they may be mistaken as primary salivary gland carcinoma. Thus, awareness of the cytological features of this tumour must be raised among cytopathologists to enable accurate diagnosis and further management.

AB  - Background Actinium -225 (225Ac) prostate -specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) is a novel therapy for metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We aimed to report the safety and antitumour activity of 225Ac-PSMA RLT of mCRPC in a large cohort of patients treated at multiple centres across the world. Methods This retrospective study included patients treated at seven centres in Australia, India, Germany, and South Africa. We pooled data of consecutive patients of any age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status with histopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate who were treated with one or more cycles of 8 MBq 225Ac-PSMA RLT administered intravenously for mCRPC. Previous lines of mCRPC treatment included taxane-based chemotherapy, androgen -receptor -axis inhibitors, lutetium -177 (177Lu) PSMA RLT, and radium -223 dichloride. The primary outcomes were overall survival and progression -free survival. Findings Between Jan 1, 2016, and May 31, 2023, 488 men with mCRPC received 1174 cycles of 225Ac-PSMA RLT (median two cycles, IQR 2-4). The mean age of the patients was 68 center dot 1 years (SD 8 center dot 8), and the median baseline prostate -specific antigen was 169 center dot 5 ng/mL (IQR 34 center dot 6-519 center dot 8). Previous lines of treatment were docetaxel in 324 (66%) patients, cabazitaxel in 103 (21%) patients, abiraterone in 191 (39%) patients, enzalutamide in 188 (39%) patients, 177Lu-PSMA RLT in 154 (32%) patients, and radium -223 dichloride in 18 (4%) patients. The median follow-up duration was 9 center dot 0 months (IQR 5 center dot 0-17 center dot 5). The median overall survival was 15 center dot 5 months (95% CI 13 center dot 4-18 center dot 3) and median progression -free survival was 7 center dot 9 months (6 center dot 8-8 center dot 9). In 347 (71%) of 488 patients, information regarding treatmentinduced xerostomia was available, and 236 (68%) of the 347 patients reported xerostomia after the first cycle of 225Ac- PSMA RLT. All patients who received more than seven cycles of 225Ac-PSMA RLT reported xerostomia. Grade 3 or higher anaemia occurred in 64 (13%) of 488 patients, leukopenia in 19 (4%), thrombocytopenia in 32 (7%), and renal toxicity in 22 (5%). No serious adverse events or treatment -related deaths were recorded. Interpretation 225Ac-PSMA RLT shows a substantial antitumour effect in mCRPC and represents a viable therapy option in patients treated with previous lines of approved agents. Xerostomia is a common side -effect. Severe bone marrow and renal toxicity are less common adverse events. Funding None. Copyright (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: A heavy burden of cardiometabolic conditions on low- and middle-income countries like India that are rapidly undergoing urbanization remains unaddressed. Indians are known to have high levels of triglycerides and low levels of HDL-C along with moderately higher levels of LDL-C. The genome-wide findings from Western populations need to be validated in an Indian context for a better understanding of the underlying etiology of dyslipidemia in India. Objective: We aim to validate 12 genetic variants associated with lipid levels among rural and urban Indian populations and derive unweighted and weighted genetic risk scores (uGRS and wGRS) for lipid levels among the Indian population. Methods: Assuming an additive model of inheritance, linear regression models adjusted for all the possible covariates were run to examine the association between 12 genetic variants and total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, and VLDL-C among 2,117 rural and urban Indian participants. The combined effect of validated loci was estimated by allelic risk scores, unweighted and weighted by their effect sizes. Results: The wGRS for triglycerides and VLDL-C was derived based on five associated variants (rs174546 at FADS1, rs17482753 at LPL, rs2293889 at TRPS1, rs4148005 at ABCA8, and rs4420638 at APOC1), which was associated with 36.31 mg/dL of elevated triglyceride and VLDL-C levels (beta = 0.95, SE = 0.16, p < 0.001). Similarly, every unit of combined risk score (rs2293889 at TRPS1 and rs4147536 at ADH1B) was associated with 40.62 mg/dL of higher total cholesterol (beta = 1.01, SE = 0.23, p < 0.001) and 33.97 mg/dL of higher LDL-C (beta = 1.03, SE = 0.19, p < 0.001) based on its wGRS (rs2293889 at TRPS1, rs4147536 at ADH1B, rs4420638 at APOC1, and rs660240 at CELSR2). The wGRS derived from five associated variants (rs174546 at FADS1, rs17482753 at LPL, rs4148005 at ABCA8, rs4420638 at APOC1, and rs7832643 at PLEC) was associated with 10.64 mg/dL of lower HDL-C (beta = -0.87, SE = 0.14, p < 0.001). Conclusion: We confirm the role of eight genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci related to different lipid levels in the Indian population and demonstrate the combined effect of variants for lipid traits among Indians by deriving the polygenic risk scores. Similar studies among different populations are required to validate the GWAS loci and effect modification of these loci by lifestyle and environmental factors related to urbanization.

AB  - Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is vital for understanding dental traumatology (DT) biomechanics, aiding diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. This review explores FEA applications in DT research, evaluates their quality and outcomes, and assesses methodological aspects. Accordingly, recommendations for future researchers are provided. The study adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for scoping reviews and registered in Open Science framework. A comprehensive search using relevant text-words and MeSH terms was performed in established databases. The inclusion criteria encompassed all Finite element analysis (FEA)-based Dental traumatology (DT) studies without language or publication year restrictions. Risk of bias was assessed with the Risk of bias tool for the use of finite element analysis in dentistry (ROBFEAD) tool. Forty-six studies published from 2001 to 2023 were included in the qualitative synthesis. The studies were categorized into five domains and six subdomains based on objectives. Maxillary central incisors and surrounding structures were commonly modelled (n = 27). Most studies utilized Computed tomography (CT), Cone Beam CT, or micro CT. Traumatic injury forces ranged from 100 N to 2000 N, and occlusal forces ranged from 150 N to 350 N. All studies were rated as high risk of bias. Fory-six studies were categorized, with most focusing on stress distribution and fracture patterns in dento-alveolar structures under various conditions, while few assessed displacements. Methodological quality lacked robustness in model development and substructure properties. Future studies should address these limitations and enhance reporting practices.

AB  - Background/AimsThe recommendations for splinting are well established for the injuries of permanent dentition; however, ambiguity still exists for the injuries in primary dentition. Hence, this study aimed to determine the most appropriate dimensions of stainless steel wire and its extent, for achieving the physiologic mobility in primary dentition.Material and MethodsThis study was designed as an in vitro experiment by using a typodont model of primary dentition. The baseline mobility of primary maxillary incisors was calibrated to the physiologic mobility of natural primary incisors by using a Teflon tape wrapped around the roots of resin teeth. Splinting was done using a stainless steel wire of 0.2 mm (Group I), 0.3 mm (Group II), and 0.4 mm (Group III). These groups were subdivided (a, b, and c) on the basis of the extent of the splint, and pre splint mobility (Pre-PV) and post-splint mobility (Post-PV) were tested by Periotest M. The splint effect was calculated by subtracting Post-PVs and Pre-PVs.ResultsThe normal values of mobility in healthy human volunteers ranged from 10.5 to 13. The overall splint effect was higher in Group III irrespective of the extent of the splint, whereas it was found to be the lowest in Group I (b and c). The splint effect increased with the extent of the splint in all the groups. Among all the groups, the splint effect on the anchor teeth was observed to increase with the extent of the splint and the diameter of the wire.ConclusionThe mobility of the injured and anchor teeth splinted with 0.2-mm stainless steel wire was similar to the pre-splint and physiologic mobility. The most favorable extension was one tooth adjacent to the injured tooth on each side for both 0.2- and 0.3-mm wires.

AB  - ObjectivesTo explore the magnitude of sex bias and determinants of treatment abandonment (TA) in childhood cancer in India.MethodsIndividual data of children (0-19 y) registered between January 1, 2017 and July 31, 2022, was compiled. TA was defined as defaulting curative intent treatment >= 4 wk. Defaulting treatment irrespective of intent >= 4 wk was defined as Treatment Default (TD). The primary outcome was the proportion of male-to-female children with TA. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of male-to-female children with upfront TA, TA at relapse, TD, TD-p (TD only in the palliative setting). The impact of clinico-demographic factors on TA was analysed using multivariable regression and propensity score matching (PSM).ResultsThree thousand two hundred eighty four patients were analysed. The overall male-to-female ratio (MFR) was 2.08 (95% CI 1.94-2.24). Of 2906 patients treated with curative intent, 415 (14 center dot 3%) abandoned treatment. TA was higher in females than males (16 center dot 4% vs. 13 center dot 3%; p = 0 center dot 022) with adjusted MFR of 0 center dot 81 (0 center dot 66-0 center dot 98). The adjusted MFR of TA for treatment-naive and relapsed patients and TD were 0 center dot 73 (0 center dot 59-0 center dot 91), 1 center dot 13 (0 center dot 65-1 center dot 96) and 0 center dot 84 (0 center dot 71-1 center dot 00) respectively. Sex independently predicted TA on multivariable analysis. However, on PSM analysis including socio-economic variables, lower maternal education predicted higher TA in children with cancer (10 center dot 1% vs. 6%, p = 0 center dot 015).ConclusionsChild sex predicted TA in childhood cancer in India with more females abandoning treatment. Maternal education is a more crucial factor predicting TA over child sex, when socio-economic factors were considered. Hence, policies promoting female education and gender equality may mitigate sex-based gaps in childhood cancer care.

AB  - The intracellular bacteria, Salmonella Typhi adapts to acidic conditions in the host cell by resetting the chromosomal DNA topology majorly controlled by DNA Gyrase, a Type II topoisomerase. DNA Gyrase forms a heterodimer A2B2 complex, which manages the DNA supercoiling and relaxation in the cell. DNA relaxation forms a part of the regulatory mechanism to activate the transcription of genes required to survive under hostile conditions. Acid -induced stress attenuates the supercoiling activity of the DNA Gyrase, resulting in DNA relaxation. Salmonella DNA becomes relaxed as the bacteria adapt to the acidified intracellular environment. Despite comprehensive studies on DNA Gyrase, the mechanism to control supercoiling activity needs to be better understood. A loss in supercoiling activity in E. coli was observed upon deletion of the non -conserved acidic C -tail of Gyrase A subunit. Salmonella Gyrase also contains an acidic tail at the C -terminus of Gyrase A, where its deletion resulted in reduced supercoiling activity compared to wild -type Gyrase. Interestingly, we also found that wildtype Gyrase compromises supercoiling activity at acidic pH 2-3, thereby causing DNA relaxation. The absence of a C -tail displayed DNA supercoiling to some extent between pH 2-9. Hence, the C -tail of Gyrase A might be one of the controlling factors that cause DNA relaxation in Salmonella at acidic pH conditions. We propose that the presence of the C -tail of GyraseA causes acid -mediated inhibition of the negative supercoiling activity of Gyrase, resulting in relaxed DNA that attracts DNA -binding proteins for controlling the transcriptional response.

AB  - Persistent activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the injured liver leads to the progression of liver injury from fibrosis to detrimental cirrhosis. In a previous study, we have shown that survivin protein is upregulated during the early activation of HSCs, which triggers the onset of liver fibrosis. However, the therapeutic potential of targeting survivin in a fully established fibrotic liver needs to be investigated. In this study, we chemically induced hepatic fibrosis in mice using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 6 weeks, which was followed by treatment with a survivin suppressant (YM155). We also evaluated survivin expression in fibrotic human liver tissues, primary HSCs, and HSC cell line by histological analysis. alpha SMA+ HSCs in human and mice fibrotic liver tissues showed enhanced survivin expression, whereas the hepatocytes and quiescent (qHSCs) displayed minimal expression. Alternatively, activated M2 macrophage subtype induced survivin expression in HSCs through the TGF-beta-TGF-beta receptor-I/II signaling. Inhibition of survivin in HSCs promoted cell cycle arrest and senescence, which eventually suppressed their activation. In vivo, YM155 treatment increased the expression of cell senescence makers in HSCs around fibrotic septa such as p53, p21, and beta-galactosidase. YM155 treatment in vivo also reduced the hepatic macrophage population and inflammatory cytokine expression in the liver. In conclusion, downregulation of survivin in the fibrotic liver decreases HSC activation by inducing cellular senescence and modulating macrophage cytokine expression that collectively ameliorates liver fibrosis.

KW  - Thrombotic microangiopathy
AB  - Background Plasma exchanges (PEX) and immunosuppression are the cornerstone of management of anti-factor H (FH) antibody-associated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), particularly if access to eculizumab is limited. The duration of therapy with PEX for anti-FH aHUS is empirical. Methods We compared the efficacy of abbreviated PEX protocol (10-12 sessions) in a prospective cohort of patients diagnosed with anti-FH aHUS (2020-2022), to standard PEX protocol (20-22 sessions) in a historical cohort (2016-2019; n = 65). Efficacy was defined as 70% decline in anti-FH titers or fall to <= 1300 AU/ml at 4 weeks. Patients in both cohorts received similar immunosuppression with oral prednisolone, IV cyclophosphamide (5 doses) and mycophenolate mofetil. Outcomes included efficacy, rates of hematological remission and adverse kidney outcomes at 1, 3 and 6 months. Results Of 23 patients, 8.2 +/- 2.1 years old enrolled prospectively, two were excluded for significant protocol deviation. PEX was abbreviated in 18/21 (86%) patients to 11.5 +/- 3.3 sessions. Abbreviation failed for lack of hematological remission by day 14 (n = 2) and persistent neurological manifestations (n = 1). All patients in whom PEX was abbreviated achieved > 70% reduction in anti-FH titers at day 28. The percentage fall in anti-FH titers was similar for the abbreviated vs. standard PEX protocols at 1, 3 and 6 months. At last follow-up, at median 50 months and 25 months for standard and abbreviated cohorts, the estimated GFR was similar at 104.8 +/- 29.1 vs. 93.7 +/- 53.4, respectively (P = 0.42). Conclusion Abbreviation of the duration of PEX is feasible and efficacious in reducing anti-FH titers. Short-term outcomes were comparable in patients managed by abbreviated and standard PEX protocols.

AB  - Background Fibromyalgia syndrome is a widespread chronic pain condition identified by body-wide pain, fatigue, cognitive fogginess, and sleep issues. In the past decade, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a potential management tool.. In the present study, we enquired whether repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation could modify pain, corticomotor excitability, cognition, and sleep.Methods Study is a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, clinical trial; wherein after randomizing thirty-four fibromyalgia patients into active or sham therapy (n = 17 each), each participant received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy. In active therapy was given at 1 Hz for 20 sessions were delivered on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (1200 pulses, 150 pulses per train for 8 trains); while in sham therapy coil was placed at right angle to the scalp with same frequency. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to identify the therapeutic site. Pain intensity, corticomotor excitability, cognition, and sleep were examined before and after therapy.Results Baseline demographic and clinical parameters for both active and sham groups were comparable. In comparison to sham, active repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation showed significant difference in pain intensity (P < 0.001, effect size = 0.29, large effect) after intervention. Other parameters of pain perception, cognition, and sleep quality also showed a significant improvement after the therapy in active therapy group only, as compared to sham.Conclusions Findings suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation intervention is effective in managing pain alongside cognition and sleep disturbances in patients of fibromyalgia. It may prove to be an important tool in relieving fibromyalgia-associated morbidity.

AB  - Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections like tuberculosis (TB) is one of the complications of type 2 diabetes, however the underlying mechanisms remains poorly characterized. To explore how chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes affects progression of active TB, we examined mRNA expression of M1 (proinflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) cytokines/markers, in monocyte-derived macrophages obtained from patients with PTB + DM (pulmonary TB + diabetes mellitus type 2), patients with DM alone, patients with PTB alone, and healthy individuals (controls). Our findings indicate a dysregulated cytokine response in patients with both PTB and DM, characterized by decreased expression levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), along with increased expression levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and CD206. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation of IL-1 beta and CD206 expression with levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in both PTB + DM and DM groups, while IFN-gamma showed a positive correlation with HbA1c levels, specifically in the PTB + DM group. Additionally, M1 cytokines/markers, IL-1 beta and iNOS were found to be significantly associated with the extent of sputum positivity in both PTB and PTB + DM groups, suggesting it to be a function of increased bacterial load and hence severity of infection. Our data demonstrates that tuberculosis in individuals with PTB + DM is characterized by altered M1/M2 cytokine responses, indicating that chronic inflammation associated with type 2 diabetes may contribute to increased immune pathology and inadequate control of tuberculosis infection.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an emerging global health problem and a potential risk factor for metabolic diseases. The bidirectional interactions between liver and gut made dysbiotic gut microbiome one of the key risk factors for NAFLD. In this study, we reported an increased abundance of Collinsella aerofaciens in the gut of obese and NASH patients living in India. We isolated C. aerofaciens from the fecal samples of biopsy -proven NASH patients and observed that their genome is enriched with carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and pro -inflammatory functions and have the potency to increase ethanol level in blood. An animal study indicated that mice supplemented with C. aerofaciens had increased levels of circulatory ethanol, high levels of hepatic hydroxyproline, triglyceride, and inflammation in the liver. The present findings indicate that perturbation in the gut microbiome composition is a key risk factor for NAFLD.

AB  - Genomic investigations on an infant who presented with a putative mitochondrial disorder led to identification of compound heterozygous deletion with an overlapping region of similar to 142 kb encompassing two nuclear encoded genes namely ERCC8 and NDUFAF2. Investigations on fetal-derived fibroblast culture demonstrated impaired bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction, which explains the phenotype and observed infant mortality in the present study. The genetic findings from this study extended the utility of whole-genome sequencing as it led to development of a MLPA-based assay for carrier screening in the extended family and the prenatal testing aiding in the birth of two healthy children.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the delivery of cardiovascular care, including noninvasive testing protocols and test selection for the evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD). Trends in test selection in traditional versus advanced noninvasive tests for CAD during the pandemic and in countries of varying income status have not been well studied. The International Atomic Energy Agency conducted a global survey to assess the pandemic-related changes in the practice of cardiovascular diagnostic testing. Site procedural volumes for noninvasive tests to evaluate CAD from March 2019 (prepandemic), April 2020 (onset), and April 2021 (initial recovery) were collected. We considered traditional testing modalities, such as exercise electrocardiography, stress echocardiography, and stress single-photon emission computed tomography, and advanced testing modalities, such as stress cardiac magnetic resonance, coronary computed tomography angiography, and stress positron emission tomography. Survey data were obtained from 669 centers in 107 countries, reporting the performance of 367,933 studies for CAD during the study period. Compared with 2019, traditional tests were performed 14% less frequently (recovery rate 82%) in 2021 versus advanced tests, which were performed 15% more frequently (128% recovery rate). Coronary computed tomography angiography, stress cardiac magnetic resonance, and stress positron emission tomography showed 14%, 25%, and 25% increases in volumes from 2019 to 2021, respectively. The increase in advanced testing was isolated to high- and upper middle-income countries, with 132% recovery in advanced tests by 2021 compared with 55% in lower income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated economic disparities in CAD testing practice between wealthy and poorer countries. Greater recovery rates and even new growth were observed for advanced imaging modalities; however, this growth was restricted to wealthy countries. Efforts to reduce practice variations in CAD testing because of economic status are warranted. (c) 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Role of non-contrast CT component of prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT scan in the detection of peripheral zone prostate cancer
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to look for feasibility of non-contrast CT (NCCT) in detecting peripheral zone prostate cancer (PCa).
   Methods: A retrospective analysis included 50 biopsy-proven PCa patients between April 2019 and March 2022 who underwent staging whole body prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)/CT prior to treatment. The control subjects were 50 randomly selected adult male patients who underwent PET/CT for non-prostate malignancy during the same time period. Two readers independently calculated the Hounsfield unit (HU) of normal peripheral zone, central zone, and corresponding PSMA avid focus in cases.
   Results: No significant difference was seen in the mean HU value of normal peripheral zone between cases and controls. Significant difference in the mean HU was seen between the PSMA avid focus in cases (40.1 +/- 6.2) and normal peripheral zone of cases (28.2 +/- 7.0) and controls (27.7 +/- 5.8). No significant difference was found between the mean HU values of high-grade PCa and non-high-grade PCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed a mean HU cut-off of >= 35 for detecting PCa with a sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 90%, respectively, between cases and controls (AUC 0.88).
   Conclusion: Detection of clinically significant PCa is possible on routinely performed NCCT scans. Radiologists should routinely look for and convey these findings to facilitate further work-up and early detection of PCa.
   Advances in knowledge: Our study adds to the knowledge that NCCT scans performed for unrelated indications can serve as a screening tool for clinically significant PCa.

AB  - Port site infection causes significant morbidity in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The umbilicus, the most common location for creating pneumoperitoneum, frequently harbours resident microflora, which can render a patient susceptible to subsequent port site infections. Umbilical hygiene and its role in preventing surgical site infections have not yet been studied. Our study aimed to bridge this gap by proposing a method for umbilical hygiene. Five hundred two patients planned for laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomised. In the intervention arm, the umbilicus was cleaned with 2-3 drops of coconut oil and patients were instructed to take a bath, with an emphasis on umbilicus cleaning. Patients in the control group were asked to bathe before surgery, without applying coconut oil. In both arms, the abdomen was painted using chlorhexidine, and a standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done with the gall bladder being extracted through the epigastric port. Eight (or 1.5%) of the 480 patients had port site infections. Five of them had infections at the umbilical port site, of which four (p=0.200) belonged to the control group. Our study showed no statistically significant association between preoperative umbilical hygiene and port site infection. This might be due to the fact that patients in both arms bathed prior to the surgery and had their abdomen painted and deep cleaned with chlorhexidine. Hence, we would like to emphasise the significance of deep cleaning of the umbilicus with chlorhexidine during the painting of the abdomen. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed.

AB  - Background and aims: Lumbar vertebral bone attenuation, measured in Hounsfield units (HU) can indirectly indicate the bone mineral density (BMD). The aim of this study is to determine the optimal HU threshold on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans to detect osteopathy in patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP). Methods: This cross-sectional study included patients with CP who underwent CT scans to measure HU at L1 to L4 vertebrae. The mean lumbar vertebral attenuation of female renal transplant donors, aged 20 -30 years was utilized to calculate the T-scoreHU of all patients at each vertebral level. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine the HU and T-score(HU) for diagnosis of osteopathy in patients with CP. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry value was used to categorize osteopenia and osteoporosis. Results: A total of 175 patients (mean age, 34.5 +/- 10.9 years; 72 % males) and 33 female renal transplant donors (mean age, 28 +/- 2.4 years) were included. A threshold HU value 212 or T score(HU) of -1.80 at L1 vertebra was found to have a 78 % sensitivity and 70 % specificity for differentiating between osteoporosis and non-osteoporosis (osteopenia and normal BMD). Similarly, a threshold HU value of 254 or a TscoreHU of -0.46 at L1 vertebra had 78 % sensitivity and 71 % specificity for distinguishing between normal and low BMD (osteoporosis and osteopenia). Conclusion: Abdominal CT images, which are routinely performed in chronic pancreatitis, can be used for opportunistic screening of osteoporosis and osteopenia without additional cost or radiation exposure.

AB  - Background The etiology of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is unknown in 30-40% of patients. Anti-factor B (FB) antibodies are reported in C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) and immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN), though not in aHUS. Methods We screened patients < 18-year-old from cohorts of aHUS and C3G/idiopathic IC-MPGN. Anti-FB IgG antibodies were measured by ELISA and confirmed by Western blot. Normative levels were based on antibody levels in 103 healthy blood donors. Results Prevalence of anti-FB antibodies was 9.7% (95% CI 6.1-14.5%; n = 21) in 216 patients with aHUS, including 11.5% (95% CI 6.4-18.5%; n = 14) in anti-FH associated aHUS and 11.8% (95% CI 4.4-23.9%; n = 6) in patients without a definitive genetic or autoimmune etiology. Patients with significant genetic variants did not show anti-FB antibodies. In patients with concomitant anti-FB and anti-FH antibodies, median anti-FH titers were higher (11,312 AU/mL vs. 4920 AU/mL; P = 0.04). Anti-FB antibody titer correlated with disease severity (hemoglobin and platelets; P < 0.05), declined following plasma exchange and increased during relapse. While 4/64 patients with C3G (6.3%) and 1/17 with IC-MPGN showed anti-FB antibodies, titers were higher in aHUS (544.8 AU/mL vs. 1028.8 AU/mL; P = 0.003). Conclusion Anti-FB antibodies are present in 6-10% of patients with aHUS and C3G/IC-MPGN, with higher titers in the former. The diagnostic and therapeutic implication of anti-FB antibodies in aHUS needs confirmation and further studies. The study shows propensity for autoantibody generation and co-existence of multiple risk factors for aHUS in Indian children.

AB  - Palisaded encapsulated neuroma (PEN) is a benign circumscribed nerve sheath tumor usually seen as a solitary painless papule on the face in middle-aged adults. We report a 22-year-old male with multiple adolescent-onset PENs distributed extensively, including the oral cavity and palms, contrary to the typical presentations. The lesions formed cobblestoned plaques and were confirmed through a skin biopsy, showing characteristic nodules of wavy spindle cells forming interlacing fascicles with interspersed clefts, and positive staining for specific markers, including markers for axons and perineurium. Notably, this case deviates from the usual presentation, shedding light on atypical manifestations of PEN in a young individual without any features suggestive of a neurocutaneous syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.

AB  - IntroductionNutrition plays an important role in management of acute pancreatitis (AP) and decreases its severity and infectious complications. Various formulations of enteral nutrition (EN) are available and are costly. For developing countries, cost and availability is a major issue and kitchen-based diet should be explored in patients with AP.AimComparison of kitchen-based diet with a commercially available polymeric formulation in terms of various outcomes in patients with AP within 14 days after the onset of pain.MethodsSixty patients (39 male, mean age 36.1 +/- 12.7 years) of moderately severe and severe AP of any etiology were randomized (30 in each group) to either kitchen-based diet or commercial polymeric formulation group. Outcome measures were refeeding pain, tolerability, infectious complications, mortality, total hospital/intensive care unit stay; and change in serum C-reactive protein (CRP), transferrin and pre albumin.ResultsThere was no significant difference in baseline demographic and biochemical parameters in both groups. No difference was observed in refeeding pain (7.1% vs 8%, p = 0.99), tolerability (28.6% vs 12%, p = 0.17), infectious complications (57.14% vs 36%, p = 0.12), mortality (31.7% vs 20%, p = 0.69), hospital stay (19.5 vs 23.5 days, p = 0.86), CRP (74.4 vs 59 mg/L, p = 0.97), transferrin levels (23.6 vs 25.6 mg/dL, p = 0.75) and pre albumin (9.45 vs 13.09 mg/dL, p = 0.68) in both groups.ConclusionKitchen-based diet is comparable to commercial polymeric formulation for the early initiation of enteral nutrition in patients with severe or moderately severe acute pancreatitis.Clinical trial registrationTrial registered with the Clinical Trials registry-India (CTRI/2018/01/011188).

AB  - Aim: Periampullary adenocarcinoma (PAC) is a malignant tumor originating at the ampulla of Vater, distal common bile duct, head of the pancreas, ampulla and duodenum. The levels of circulating Th17 cells and Th17-related cytokines in patients with PAC remain unreported. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the levels of circulating Th17 cells and Th17-related cytokines in patients with PAC. Materials and methods: Flow cytometry was used to measure Th17 cell proportions in PBMCs from 60 PAC patients and 30 healthy controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to quantify IL-17A and IL-23 levels in serum samples, while quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR) assessed IL-17A mRNA expression and Th17-related transcription factors (ROR gamma t and STAT3) in tissue samples. Results: The findings showed a substantial increase in Th17 cell percentages, elevated concentrations of IL-17A and IL-23, and higher mRNA expression levels of IL-17A, ROR gamma t, and STAT3 in patients with PAC when compared to healthy controls (HCs). Conclusion: Th17 cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of PAC and may represent potential therapeutic targets.

AB  - BackgroundAdolescents are vulnerable to stressors because of the rapid physical and mental changes that they go through during this life period. Young people residing in slum communities experience additional stressors due to living conditions, financial stress, and limited access to healthcare and social support services. The Adolescents' Resilience and Treatment nEeds for Mental Health in Indian Slums (ARTEMIS) study, is testing an intervention intended to improve mental health outcomes for adolescents living in urban slums in India combining an anti-stigma campaign with a digital health intervention to identify and manage depression, self-harm/suicide risk or other significant emotional complaints.MethodsIn the formative phase, we developed tools and processes for the ARTEMIS intervention. The two intervention components (anti-stigma and digital health) were implemented in purposively selected slums from the two study sites of New Delhi and Vijayawada. A mixed methods formative evaluation was undertaken to improve the understanding of site-specific context, assess feasibility and acceptability of the two components and identify required improvements to be made in the intervention. In-depth interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders (adolescents, parents, community health workers, doctors, and peer leaders), along with quantitative data from the digital health platform, were analysed.ResultsThe anti-stigma campaign methods and materials were found to be acceptable and received overall positive feedback from adolescents. A total of 2752 adolescents were screened using the PHQ9 embedded into a digital application, 133 (4.8%) of whom were identified as at high-risk of depression and/or suicide. 57% (n = 75) of those at high risk were diagnosed and treated by primary health care (PHC) doctors, who were guided by an electronic decision support tool based on WHO's mhGAP algorithm, built into the digital health application.ConclusionThe formative evaluation of the intervention strategy led to enhanced understanding of the context, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention. Feedback from stakeholders helped to identify key areas for improvement in the intervention; strategies to improve implementation included engaging with parents, organising health camps in the sites and formation of peer groups.Trial RegistrationThe trial has been registered in the Clinical Trial Registry India, which is included in the WHO list of Registries, Reference number: CTRI/2022/02/040307.

AB  - Background Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common structural deformity of the spine affecting adolescent individuals globally. The disorder is polygenic and is accompanied by the association of various genetic loci. Genetic studies in Chinese and Japanese populations have shown the association of genetic variants of SOX9 with AIS curve severity. However, no genetic study evaluating the association of SRY-Box Transcription Factor 9 (SOX9) variants with AIS predisposition has been conducted in any Indian population. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association of the genetic variants of the SOX9 along with 0.88 Mb upstream region with AIS susceptibility in the population of Northwest India.Methods In total, 113 AIS cases and 500 non-AIS controls were recruited from the population of Northwest India in the study and screened for 155 genetic variants across the SOX9 gene and 0.88 Mb upstream region of the gene using Global Screening Array-24 v3.0 chip (Illumina). The statistical significance of the Bonferroni threshold was set at 0.000322.Result The results showed the association of 11 newly identified variants; rs9302936, rs7210997, rs77736349, rs12940821, rs9302937, rs77447012, rs8071904, rs74898711, rs9900249, rs2430514, and rs1042667 with the AIS susceptibility in the studied population. Only one variant, rs2430514, was inversely associated with AIS in the population, while the ten variants were associated with the AIS risk. Moreover, 47 variants clustered in the gene desert region of the SOX9 gene were associated at a p-value <= 0.05.Conclusion The present study is the first to demonstrate the association of SOX9 enhancer locus variants with AIS in any South Asian Indian population. The results are interesting as rs1042667, a 3' untranslated region (UTR) variant in the exon 3 and upstream variants of the SOX9 gene, were associated with AIS susceptibility in the Northwest Indian population. This provides evidence that the variants in the enhancer region of SOX9 might regulate its gene expression, thus leading to AIS pathology and might act as an important gene for AIS susceptibility.

AB  - In recent years, cancer has become one of the primary causes of mortality, approximately 10 million deaths worldwide each year. The most advanced, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapy has turned out as a promising treatment for cancer. CAR-T cell therapy involves the genetic modification of T cells obtained from the patient's blood, and infusion back to the patients. CAR-T cell immunotherapy has led to a significant improvement in the remission rates of hematological cancers. CAR-T cell therapy presently limited to hematological cancers, there are ongoing efforts to develop additional CAR constructs such as bispecific CAR, tandem CAR, inhibitory CAR, combined antigens, CRISPR gene-editing, and nanoparticle delivery.

AB  - The current research aims to develop a carrier system for the delivery of a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor along with a bioceramic agent to the periodontal pocket. It is proposed that the present system, if given along with a systemic antibiotic, would be a fruitful approach for periodontitis amelioration. To fulfill the aforementioned objective, a doxycycline hyclate- and hydroxyapatite-adsorbed composite was prepared by a physical adsorption method and successfully loaded inside sodium alginate-chitosan nanoparticles and optimized based on particle size and drug content. Optimized formulation was then subjected to different evaluation parameters like encapsulation efficiency, hydroxyapatite content, zeta potential, surface morphology, in vitro drug release, cell line studies, and stability studies. For the optimized formulation, particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), entrapment efficiency, zeta potential, and drug content were found to be 336.50 nm, 0.23, 41.77%, -13.85 mV, and 14.00%, respectively. The surface morphology of the placebo and adsorbed composite-loaded nanoparticles as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed the spherical shape and rough surface of the particles. In gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) 7.6, a sustained drug release profile was obtained up to 36 h. In vitro % viability studies performed on murine fibroblast cells (NIH3T3) and human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cell lines confirmed the proliferative nature of the formulation. Also, when subjected to stability studies for 4 weeks, particle size, PDI, and drug content did not vary considerably, thereby ensuring the stable nature of nanoparticles. Henceforth, sodium alginate-chitosan nanoparticles appeared to be a good carrier system for doxycycline hyclate and hydroxyapatite for periodontal therapy. If given along with a system antibiotic, the system will serve as a fruitful tool for infection-mediated periodontal regeneration and healing.

AB  - Background The early management of polytrauma patients with traumatic spinal cord injury (tSCI) is a major challenge. Sparse data is available to provide optimal care in this scenario and worldwide variability in clinical practice has been documented in recent studies.
   Methods A multidisciplinary consensus panel of physicians selected for their established clinical and scientific expertise in the acute management of tSCI polytrauma patients with different specializations was established. The World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies (EANS) endorsed the consensus, and a modified Delphi approach was adopted.
   Results A total of 17 statements were proposed and discussed. A consensus was reached generating 17 recommendations (16 strong and 1 weak).
   Conclusions This consensus provides practical recommendations to support a clinician's decision making in the management of tSCI polytrauma patients.

AB  - Biomedical grade cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) alloys are extensively used for load-bearing biomedical applications such as hip and knee implants due to their exceptional biocompatible and biomechanical properties. However, the strain-induced martensite epsilon-phase development during contact loading results in thin oxide layers that are prone to fracture leading to corrosion. The formation of thin oxide layers is undesirable for long-term deployment. We employed laser-texturing to enhance the corrosion resistance of the material in simulated body fluid by the formation of hcp epsilon-phase martensite and via the formation of oxide layers. However, partial formation of hcp epsilon-phase martensite was observed. By means of central composite design-based response surface methodology, three laser parameters such as average laser power, texture density and the number of passes were optimised for maximal open circuit potential, an indicator for minimal corrosion. The textured surfaces were found to assist in the cellular proliferation of fibroblasts and inhibit bacterial growth.

AB  - Oligodendrocytes (OL) are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system that mediate nerve conduction. Loss of oligodendrocytes results in demyelination, triggering neurological deficits. Developing a better understanding of the cell signaling pathways influencing OL development may aid in the development of therapeutic strategies. The primary focus of this study was to investigate and elucidate the cell signaling pathways implicated in the developmental maturation of oligodendrocytes using human fetal neural stem cells (hFNSCs)-derived primary OL and MO3.13 cell line. Successful differentiation into OL was established by examining morphological changes, increased expression of mature OL markers MBP, MOG and decreased expression of pre-OL markers CSPG4 and O4. Analyzing transcriptional datasets (using RNA sequencing) in pre-OL and mature OL derived from hFNSCs revealed the novel and critical involvement of the JAK-STAT cell signaling pathway in terminal OL maturation. The finding was validated in MO3.13 cell line whose differentiation was accompanied by upregulation of IL-6 and the transcription factor STAT3. Increased phosphorylated STAT3 (pY705) levels were demonstrated by western blotting in hFNSCs-derived primary OL as well as terminal maturation in MO3.13 cells, thus validating the involvement of the JAK-STAT pathway in OL maturation. Pharmacological suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation (confirmed by western blotting) was able to prevent the increase of MBP-positive cells as demonstrated by flow cytometry. These novel findings highlight the involvement of the JAK-STAT pathway in OL maturation and raise the possibility of using this as a therapeutic strategy in demyelinating diseases.

Previous reports have suggested that the SIGLEC12 gene, which encodes the Siglec-XII protein, is expressed in the epithelial tissues and upregulated in carcinomas. However, studies deciphering the role of Siglec-XII in renal cancer (RC) are still unavailable, and here we provide insights on this question. We conducted expression analysis using the Human Protein Atlas and UALCAN databases. The impact of SIGLEC12 on RC prognosis was determined using the KM plotter, and an assessment of immune infiltration with SIGLEC12 was performed using the TIMER database. GSEA was conducted to identify the pathways affected by SIGLEC12. Finally, using GeneMania, we identified Siglec-XII interacting proteins. Our findings indicated that macrophages express SIGLEC12 in the kidney. Furthermore, we hypothesize that Siglec-XII expression might be involved in the increase of primary RC, but this effect may not be dependent on the age of the patient. In the tumour microenvironment, oncogenic pathways appeared to be upregulated by SIGLEC12. Similarly, our analysis suggested that SIGLEC12-related kidney renal papillary cell carcinomas may be more suitable for targeted immunotherapy, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. These preliminary results suggested that high expression of SIGLEC12 is associated with poor prognosis for RC. Future studies to assess its clinical utility are necessitated.

AB  - The human embryo derives from fusion of oocyte and sperm, undergoes growth and differentiation, resulting in a blastocyst. To initiate implantation, the blastocyst hatches from the zona pellucida, allowing access from external inputs. Modelling of uterine sperm distribution indicates that 200-5000 sperm cells may reach the implantation-stage blastocyst following natural coitus. We show ultrastructural evidence of sperm cells intruding into trophectoderm cells of zona-free blastocysts obtained from the uterus of rhesus monkeys. Interaction between additional sperm and zona-free blastocyst could be an evolutionary feature yielding adaptive processes influencing the developmental fate of embryos. This process bears potential implications in pregnancy success, sperm competition and human health.

AB  - Despite advances in breast cancer care, breast cancer in young women (BCYW) faces unique challenges, diagnostic delays, and limited awareness in many countries. Here, we discuss the challenges and consequences associated with the delayed diagnosis of BCYW. The consequences of delayed diagnosis in young women - which generally varies among developed, developing, or underdeveloped countries - are severe due to a faster breast tumor growth rate than tumors in older women, also contributing to advanced cancer stages and poorer outcomes. Though there are many underlying reasons for diagnostic delays due to age, the article delves explicitly deep into the diagnostic delay of BCYW, focusing on healthcare providers, potential contributing factors, its consequences, and the urgent need to start minimizing such incidences. The article suggests several strategies to address these issues, including increasing awareness, developing educational programs for healthcare providers to identify signs and symptoms in young women, developing clear diagnostic guidelines, and improving screening strategies.

AB  - Introduction: Targeting IL-17A using Secukinumab, a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)/kappa against IL-17A is a therapeutic option for immune-mediated disorders such as psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency have approved it for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and non-radiographic axial spondylarthritis. Recently it has also been approved for use in children with severe plaque psoriasis, active psoriatic arthritis, and enthesitis-related arthritis.Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of Secukinumab in the management of children and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. We discuss the salient findings of pivotal RCTs and other studies supporting the use of Secukinumab in adults and children, in particular, focusing on its safety and efficacy.Expert opinion: Secukinumab is a therapeutic target for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and spondyloarthropathies in both adults and children. No major safety signals are observed with its use in short-term follow-up. Thus far, Secukinumab has not been found to significantly increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB).

AB  - Background: The optimal cumulative activity (CA) of I-131 therapy for patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (mDTC) remains contentious. This study aimed to determine the maximum CA of I-131 that could be administered without a significant increase in adverse events (AEs) by analyzing a long-term cohort of patients. Methods: Data from patients with mDTC treated with I-131 therapy and followed for at least 2 years from 1967 to 2019 were reviewed. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on the received CA: group A (<= 600 mCi), group B (>600-1000 mCi), and group C (>1000 mCi). The study assessed long-term AEs and survival outcomes. Results: The study included 671 adult patients with mDTC (mean age, 48 years; range, 19-81) with a median follow-up of 122 months (interquartile range: 82-180). Group A, group B, and group C comprised 269 (40.0%), 212 (31.6%), and 190 (28.4%) patients, respectively. Ten-year survival rates were 72%, 42.7%, and 29% in groups A, B, and C, respectively. A total of 40/671 (6%) AEs were observed in 38 patients: 3 (1.1%), 12 (5.7%), and 25 (13.2%) in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Five patients developed second primary malignancy: 3 in group A and 1 each in group B and C. However, CA >1000 mCi of I-131 was associated with significant increase in bone marrow suppression, decreased pulmonary function, and xerostomia (P < .001). Conclusion: The study suggests that a maximum CA of up to 1000 mCi strikes a favorable balance between keeping AEs low and benefiting a subset of patients with extensive metastases showing intense I-131 concentration.

KW  - AVAILABILITY
AB  - Introduction: While lifelong and strict adherence to gluten-free diet (GFD) is essential for the successful treatment of celiac disease (CeD), only 30-50% of patients are able to maintain a good adherence to GFD. We determined factors influencing the adherence to GFD at various ecological levels including intra-personal, inter-personal, organizational, community and system-based levels in adult patients with CeD.Methods: A questionnaire to assess the adherence was developed and it was administered in the CeD clinic to patients with CeD on GFD for >1 year. Adherence to GFD was assessed in a subset of patients (n = 320) using Celiac Disease Adherence Test (CDAT).Results: Overall, 978 patients [median age: 29 years; females: 592] with CeD on GFD were recruited. They reported many barriers to adherence to GFD including intra-personal barriers such as lack of knowledge about GFD (19%), inadequate financial resources (27.2%) and lack of self-motivation/confidence (55.3%); inter-personal barriers such as intake of gluten-containing food upon forceful insistence of friends/family (23.4%); organizational barriers such as high cost (70.8%) and non-availability of GF-food products (48.6%); community-based barriers like consumption of gluten-containing food at religious occasions/festivals (11.1%) and social occasions (27.2%); and system-based barriers such as non-referral to dietitian for counseling (21.9%). As per CDAT, 204 (63.7%), 73(22.8%) and 43(13.4%) patients had good, average, and poor adherence to GFD, respectively. On multivariable analysis, occasional consumption of gluten, non-availability of GF-food while dining out and coercing by family and friends for consumption of GC-food were found to have highest odds for poor adherence to GFD.Conclusions: Non-referral to a dietitian for counseling, irregular follow-up visits, unavailability of flour mill, non-supportive family/friends, high cost and limited availability of GF-food are the most common barriers to adherence to GFD. There is a need to create infrastructure and develop strategies to overcome these diverse barriers at various levels of ecosystem and thereby facilitate better adherence to GFD.

AB  - Airway ultrasound (US) is an easily available, portable, radiation-free imaging modality for quick, non-invasive, dynamic evaluation of the airway without sedation. This is useful in children with stridor, which is an emergency due to upper airway obstruction requiring immediate management. Several causes of stridor including laryngomalacia, laryngeal cyst, subglottic hemangioma, vocal cord palsy, and lymphatic malformations can be evaluated accurately. Thin musculature and unossified cartilages in children provide a good acoustic window. Thus, airway US is valuable, but underutilized for the evaluation of children with stridor. In this case-based review, we describe the technique, indications, anatomy, and pathologies on airway US.

AB  - There is a pressing clinical need for thrombolytic agents that can effectively disaggregate arterial thrombi in acute ischemic stroke without significantly increasing the risk of bleeding. This pilot study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) as an adjunctive therapy to intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA or alteplase). A randomized, open-label, blinded assessor pilot study was conducted. Patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 h from onset were randomized into two groups: intravenous NAC and rtPA or rtPA alone. Primary outcomes included intracerebral hemorrhage, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, extracranial bleeding, and adverse reactions. Secondary outcomes comprised major neurological improvement assessed by (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) NIHSS at 24 h, recanalization on first run of angiography in patients who underwent thrombectomy or on repeat vascular imaging at 24 h, modified Rankin scale, and three-month mortality. Forty patients were enrolled, with 21 receiving only rtPA and 19 receiving NAC with rtPA. Baseline characteristics were comparable among groups. No significant differences were observed in adverse events (p = 0.99), intracranial hemorrhage (p = 0.21), symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (p = 0.47), or extracranial bleeding (p = 0.21). Median NIHSS at 24 h was significantly lower in the intervention group (p = 0.03). Functional outcomes and three-month mortality were similar between groups (p = 0.85 and p = 0.99 respectively). The co-administration of N-acetylcysteine with alteplase did not significantly alter safety profiles, morbidity, or mortality at 3 months. While no substantial differences were noted, a slightly improved early neurological outcome was observed in the intervention arm. The study's findings were constrained by a small sample size, emphasizing the necessity for future large-scale trials to comprehensively evaluate the safety and efficacy of N-acetylcysteine as a thrombolytic agent in acute ischemic stroke.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Moyamoya disease (MMD) is characterized by supraclinoid internal carotid artery narrowing causing cerebral parenchyma to starve. Direct and indirect revascularisation techniques are the treatment norm. We provide a clinicoradiological comparison of single and double barrel superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass for MMD. The perfusion in cerebral hemispheres and vessel density in digital subtraction angiography (DSA) have been evaluated using novel algorithms. METHODS: DSA, arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging methods and Suzuki, Matsushima, Angiographic Outcome Score scales were used to quantify perfusion parameters; modified Rankin Score was used for clinical evaluation. A novel image processing algorithm was designed to perform analysis of arterial spin labeling sequences and compare perfusion. Vessel density was calculated using connected component analysis on thresholded DSA images. RESULTS: Fifty-four hemispheres with MMD underwent STA-MCA bypass 42(77.8%) single barrel and 12 (22.2%) double barrel. Clinical outcome-modified Rankin Score was significant with P < 0.001 in single barrel and P = 0.001 in double barrel groups. The overall Angiographic Outcome Score showed improvement postoperatively (P = 0.032). Perfusion analysis was performed in 20 hemispheres (13 single barrel; 7 double barrel). MCA territories showed significant improvement in single barrel (2.72%, P = 0.0294) and double barrel groups (12.89%, P = 0.025). Vessel density calculated in MCA territory, showed an overall postoperative improvement (P = 1.75 3 10e8). CONCLUSION: Double barrel STA-MCA bypass clinically as well as radiologically improves perfusion in the ACA as well as MCA territories in MMD. The novel image processing algorithm is an accurate, objective tool to evaluate perfusion in magnetic resonance images and vessel density in DSA images of MMD.

AB  - IntroductionThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused widespread morbidity, mortality, and socio-economic disruptions worldwide. Vaccination has proven to be a crucial strategy in controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact.ObjectiveThe study focuses on assessing the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccination in reducing the incidence of positive cases, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions. The presented study is focused on the COVID-19 fully vaccinated population by considering the data from the first positive case reported until 20 September 2021.MethodsUsing data from multiple countries, time series analysis is deployed to investigate the variations in the COVID-19 positivity rates, hospitalization rates, and ICU requirements after successful vaccination campaigns at the country scale.ResultsAnalysis of the COVID-19 positivity rates revealed a substantial decline in countries with high pre-vaccination rates. Within 1-3 months of vaccination campaigns, these rates decreased by 20-44%. However, certain countries experienced an increase in positivity rates with the emergence of the new Delta variant, emphasizing the importance of ongoing monitoring and adaptable vaccination strategies. Similarly, the analysis of hospitalization rates demonstrated a steady decline as vaccination drive rates rose in various countries. Within 90 days of vaccination, several countries achieved hospitalization rates below 200 per million. However, a slight increase in hospitalizations was observed in some countries after 180 days of vaccination, underscoring the need for continued vigilance. Furthermore, the ICU patient rates decreased as vaccination rates increased across most countries. Within 120 days, several countries achieved an ICU patient rate of 20 per million, highlighting the effectiveness of vaccination in preventing severe cases requiring intensive care.ConclusionCOVID-19 vaccination has proven to be very much effective in reducing the incidence of cases, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions. However, ongoing surveillance, variant monitoring, and adaptive vaccination strategies are crucial for maximizing the benefits of vaccination and effectively controlling the spread of the virus.

AB  - BackgroundRetention of participants is a challenge in community-based longitudinal cohort studies. We aim to evaluate the factors associated with loss to follow-up and estimate attrition bias.MethodsData are from an ongoing cohort study, Center for cArdiometabolic Risk Reduction in South Asia (CARRS) in India (Delhi and Chennai). Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify sociodemographic factors associated with partial (at least one follow-up) or no follow-up (loss to follow-up). We also examined the impact of participant attrition on the magnitude of observed associations using relative ORs (RORs) of hypertension and diabetes (prevalent cases) with baseline sociodemographic factors.ResultsThere were 12 270 CARRS cohort members enrolled in Chennai and Delhi at baseline in 2010, and subsequently six follow-ups were conducted between 2011 and 2022. The median follow-up time was 9.5 years (IQR: 9.3-9.8) and 1048 deaths occurred. Approximately 3.1% of participants had no follow-up after the baseline visit. Younger (relative risk ratio (RRR): 1.14; 1.04 to 1.24), unmarried participants (RRR: 1.75; 1.45 to 2.11) and those with low household assets (RRR: 1.63; 1.44 to 1.85) had higher odds of being lost to follow-up. The RORs of sociodemographic factors with diabetes and hypertension did not statistically differ between baseline and sixth follow-up, suggesting minimal potential for bias in inference at follow-up.ConclusionIn this representative cohort of urban Indians, we found low attrition and minimal bias due to the loss to follow-up. Our cohort's inconsistent participation bias shows our retention strategies like open communication, providing health profiles, etc have potential benefits.

AB  - Rare diseases form the bulk of the financial expenditure of any developing or developed economy. Among the various rare diseases, paediatric neuromuscular disorders form a major portion, with a worldwide survey estimating a prevalence of 1 in 3500 individuals. In a lower middle-income country (LMIC) like India, malnutrition still accounts for most of the under-5 mortality. However, the economic burden of rare paediatric neuromuscular disorders cannot be underestimated. The treating physician should have a basic understanding of how to approach a child presenting with weakness and how to utilise the available tests which are affordable in an LMIC setting. History and examination still form the core, and with new diagnostic methods like next-generation sequencing, more and more rare disorders are getting diagnosed. It is important for the treating physician to know about basic supportive care, recent advancements, and available treatment options for these conditions. With exciting new treatment options being available for these disorders, the perception of these diseases as being not treatable is gradually changing. This review aims to be of guidance to clinicians from an LMIC setting like India and to empower them to manage such rare paediatric neuromuscular disorders.

AB  - IntroductionWith the escalating burden of chronic disease and multimorbidity in India, owing to its ageing population and overwhelming health needs, the Indian Health care delivery System (HDS) is under constant pressure due to rising public expectations and ambitious new health goals. The three tired HDS should work in coherence to ensure continuity of care, which needs a coordinated referral system. This calls for optimising health care through Integrated care (IC). The existing IC models have been primarily developed and adopted in High-Income Countries. The present study attempts to review the applicability of existing IC models and frame a customised model for resource-constrained settings.MethodsA two-stage methodology was used. Firstly, a narrative literature review was done to identify gaps in existing IC models, as per the World Health Organization framework approach. The literature search was done from electronic journal article databases, and relevant literature that reported conceptual and theoretical concepts of IC. Secondly, we conceptualised an IC concept according to India's existing HDS, validated by multiple rounds of brainstorming among co-authors. Further senior co-authors independently reviewed the conceptualised IC model as per national relevance.ResultsExisting IC models were categorised as individual, group and disease-specific, and population-based models. The limitations of having prolonged delivery time, focusing only on chronic diseases and being economically expensive to implement, along with requirement of completely restructuring and reorganising the existing HDS makes the adoption of existing IC models not feasible for India. The Indian Model of Integrated Healthcare (IMIH) model proposes three levels of integration: Macro, Meso, and Micro levels, using the existing HDS. The core components include a Central Gateway Control Room, using existing digital platforms at macro levels, a bucket overflow model at the meso level, a Triple-layered Concentric Circle outpatient department (OPD) design, and a three-door OPD concept at the micro level.ConclusionIMIH offers features that consider resource constraints and local context of LMICs while being economically viable. It envisages a step toward UHC by optimising existing resources and ensuring a continuum of care. However, health being a state subject, various socio-political and legal/administrative issues warrant further discussion before implementation.

AB  - Poly(4-(1-ethoxyethoxy)styrene) was synthesized by living anionic polymerization under high vacuum conditions. Amphiphilic derivatives, poly(4-hydroxystyrene) (PHS) and poly(4-(4-bromophenyloxy)styrene) (PBPOS) were synthesized by post-polymerization reactions of poly(4-(1-ethoxyethoxy)styrene). For comparison of hydrogen bonding and halogen bonding, the self-assembly behaviors of both homopolymers, PHS and PBPOS, were evaluated by dynamic/static light scattering (DLS/SLS) in a mixed solvent of water : tetrahydrofuran and water : methanol, respectively. The morphologies of aggregates were recorded using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). PHS forms the hollow micelles in the water : THF mixed solvent and the vesicles in the water : methanol mixed solvent. Also, PBPOS forms the open-mouth vesicles in the water : methanol mixed solvent. PHS vesicles show potential as a template for forming gold nanoparticles and can act as a reservoir of the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin. The release of doxorubicin from PHS vesicles depends on the pH of the release media. The rate of drug release is higher at basic pH. The viability of the colon cancer cell line HCT-116 decreased by 27% compared to an untreated cell line when treated with doxorubicin loaded PHS vesicles.

AB  - Mastalgia is the most common presenting symptom for patients attending breast clinic. The etiology behind breast pain has been described because of the responsiveness of the terminal ducto-lobular unit to the estrogen and progesterone fluctuations in the body. There is a poor understanding of the nature of the disease and its management with medical therapy (antiestrogen drugs like centchroman or tamoxifen). Hence, this study was carried out to observe the outcome of medical therapy in patients suffering from cyclical mastalgia. In this ambispective cohort study, all women (aged > 14 years) having moderate to severe cyclical mastalgia with a pain score >= 5 on the visual analog scale were included. Patients were given medical treatment and followed up for 1 year. The effectiveness of the treatment was defined by a reduction in the severity of breast pain score < 3 following medical therapy. In this study, 100 patients with cyclical mastalgia were included and analyzed. The mean baseline pain score for all patients was found to be 6.5 ranging from 5 to 9. After 12 months of therapy with different modalities, the mean pain score reduced to 0.5 with 96% of patients showing treatment response. However, 8 out of 31 patients who were given centchroman experienced side effects like delayed menstruation, scanty menstruation, menorrhagia, and secondary amenorrhea. Among patients who took danazol, four of them experienced side effects like hirsutism (1/7, i.e., 14.2%), delayed menstruation (1/7, i.e., 14.2%), hot flushes (1/7, i.e., 14.2%), and nausea and vomiting (1/7, i.e., 14.2%). Few patients (2/7) discontinued treatment due to acne, hirsutism, and nausea and vomiting. Cyclical mastalgia can be managed safely and effectively with first-line therapy using reassurance, physical support, flax seeds, and oral and topical NSAIDs. Tamoxifen and centchroman therapy can be used as a safe alternative to non-responders of first-line therapy.

AB  - BackgroundIn cirrhosis patients with acute variceal bleeding (AVB), the optimal duration of vasoconstrictor therapy after endoscopic haemostasis is unclear.AimsWe aimed to compare efficacy of 1-day versus 3-day terlipressin therapy in cirrhosis patients with AVB post-endoscopic intervention. The primary objective was to compare rebleeding at 5 days between the two arms. Secondary objectives included rebleeding and mortality rates at 6 weeks.MethodsIn this open-label, randomised controlled trial, cirrhosis patients with AVB were randomised to either 1-day or 3-day terlipressin therapy.ResultsA total of 150 cirrhosis patients with AVB were recruited to receive either 1 day (n = 75) or 3 days (n = 75) of terlipressin therapy. One patient from 1-day arm was excluded. Modified intention-to-treat analysis included 149 patients. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Rebleeding at 5 days: 3 (4.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.4-9.0) versus 4 (5.3%; 95% CI: 2.0-10.0), risk difference (RD) p = 0.726 and 5-day mortality rates: 1 (1.4%; 95% CI: 0-7.3) versus 1 (1.3%; 95% CI: 0.2-7.0), RD p = 0.960 were similar. Rebleeding at 42 days: 9 (12.2%; 95% CI: 7.0-20.0) versus 10 (13.3%; 95% CI: 7.0-20.0), RD p = 0.842 and mortality at 42 days: 5 (6.8%; 95% CI: 3.0-10.0) versus 4 (5.3%; 95% CI: 2.0-10.0), RD p = 0.704 were also similar. Patients in the 1-day terlipressin therapy arm experienced significantly fewer adverse effects compared with those receiving 3 days of terlipressin therapy: 28 (37.8%) versus 42 (56%), p = 0.026.ConclusionsOur results suggest that 1 day of terlipressin therapy is associated with similar 5-day and 42-day rebleeding rates, 42-day mortality and an overall superior safety profile compared with 3-day of terlipressin therapy. These findings require to be validated in double-blinded, larger, multiethnic and multicentre studies across the various stages of cirrhosis (CTRI/2019/10/021771).
   Similar clinical outcomes with improved safety profile when using an abbreviated course of terlipressin in comparison to standard duration of therapyimage

AB  - Objective: We analyzed adult ADHD symptoms in a cross-cultural context, including investigating the occurrence and potential correlates of adult ADHD and psychometric examination of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener. Method: Our analysis is based on a large-scale research project involving 42 countries (International Sex Survey, N=72,627, 57% women, Mage=32.84; SDage=12.57). Results: The ASRS Screener demonstrated good reliability and validity, along with partial invariance across different languages, countries, and genders. The occurrence of being at risk for adult ADHD was relatively high (21.4% for women, 18.1% for men). The highest scores were obtained in the US, Canada, and other English-speaking Western countries, with significantly lower scores among East Asian and non-English-speaking European countries. Moreover, ADHD symptom severity and occurrence were especially high among gender-diverse individuals. Significant associations between adult ADHD symptoms and age, mental and sexual health, and socioeconomic status were observed. Conclusions: Present results show significant cross-cultural variability in adult ADHD occurrence as well as highlight important factors related to adult ADHD. Moreover, the importance of further research on adult ADHD in previously understudied populations (non-Western countries) and minority groups (gender-diverse individuals) is stressed. Lastly, the present analysis is consistent with previous evidence showing low specificity of adult ADHD screening instruments and contributes to the current discussion on accurate adult ADHD screening and diagnosis.

TI  - Comparison of HASTE versus EPI-Based DWI for Retinoblastoma and Correlation with Prognostic Histopathologic Parameters
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY
KW  - APPARENT DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT
KW  - EYES
KW  - MRI
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Non-EPI-based DWI has shown better performance in head and neck pathologies owing to lesser susceptibility artifacts compared with EPI-DWI. However, only sporadic studies have investigated the feasibility of non-EPI-based DWI in retinoblastoma (RB). We qualitatively and quantitively compared EPI-DWI and HASTE-DWI in RB and correlated the tumor ADC values obtained from these 2 techniques with histopathologic markers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one treatment-naive patients with RB underwent 1.5T orbital MR imaging. EPI-DWI and HASTE-DWI were acquired at 3 b-values (0, 500, and 1000 s/mm(2)). All patients subsequently underwent surgical enucleation. For qualitative image assessment, scoring of overall image quality, artifacts, tumor sharpness, and tumor conspicuity was done by using a 5-point Likert scale. Quantitative assessment included calculations of SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), geometric distortion, and ADC. Qualitative scores were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and quantitative parameters were analyzed with a t test.RESULTS: All 21 patients had unilateral RB; 15 were male and 6 were female with a median age of 36 months (range, 9-72 months). On histopathology, patients had either poorly differentiated (n = 13/21) or moderately differentiated (n = 8/21) RB. Other poor prognostic markers evaluated were optic nerve invasion (n = 10/21), choroidal invasion (n = 12/21), and anterior eye segment enhancement on MRI (n = 6/21). HASTE-DWI demonstrated higher image quality scores than EPI-DWI (P < .01), except for tumor conspicuity score, which was higher for EPI-DWI (P < .001). HASTE-DWI showed lower SNR, CNR, and geometric distortion than EPI-DWI (P < .001). The average acquisition times of EPI-DWI and HASTE-DWI were similar to 1 and 14 minutes, respectively. The mean tumor ADC value on EPI-DWI was 0.62 +/- 0.14 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and on HASTE-DWI was 0.83 +/- 0.17 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s. A significant correlation between EPI-DWI and HASTE-DWI ADC values (r = 0.8; P = .01) was found. Lower ADC values were found in tumors with poor prognostic markers, but none reached a statistically significant difference.CONCLUSIONS: HASTE-DWI shows improved overall image quality; however, it lacks in terms of tumor conspicuity, SNR, CNR, and longer acquisition time compared with EPI-DWI. ADC values derived from HASTE-DWI show no advantage over EPI-DWI in correlation with histopathologic prognostic markers.

AB  - Endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET) and its various approaches are widely used for benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Objective of our review is to compare endoscopic thyroidectomy (ET) and its various approaches with open thyroidectomy (OT) regarding safety and benefits. Electronic search was performed on MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), well-designed cohorts, or case-controlled studies were included. Participants of any age and gender with a diagnosis of a thyroid nodule/goiter were included. We assessed the included trials using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to determine the methodological quality. Nineteen studies were included in this review. The risk of postoperative transient vocal cord palsy in ET was found to be higher than in OT (OR 4.47, 95% CI 2.92 to 6.86). Swallowing discomfort in ET was found to be much lower than OT (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.31). No statistically significant difference was found in the risk of transient hypocalcemia, permanent hypocalcemia, permanent vocal cord palsy, hematoma/postoperative bleeding, seroma formation, and total complications. The operative time for ET was higher than for OT. The drain output after ET was higher than OT. Less number of lymph nodes were removed during ET compared to OT. No statistically significant difference was found in the length of hospital stay. ET can be used as a comparable replacement to OT in selected patients. ET is a safe technique with comparable long-term complications to OT.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare outcomes of patients with and without use of systemic post-operative anti-coagulation (SPAC) having undergone end to end medium-sized arterial repair following trauma. A prospective, single-blinded, pilot randomized control trial was conducted at a level 1 trauma center from April 2019 through August 2020. Patients between 14 and 65 years having medium size vessel injury and undergoing end to end arterial repair were included. Patients were randomized into two groups-SPAC and no SPAC. Primary outcome measure was vessel patency measured clinically and/or by Doppler at 48 h and at the time of discharge. Secondary outcome measures included post-operative bleeding, re-exploration, ongoing blood product transfusion, limb salvage, duration of ICU stay, and hospital stay. A total of 32 patients were randomized. There was no difference in vessel patency at 48 h. (93.7% vs. 93.7%, p value 0.572) or at discharge (93.7% vs. 87.5%, p value 0.654). Incidence of post-operative hemorrhage (5 patients vs. 0, p value 0.030), need for additional vascular procedures (37.5% vs. 18.75, p value 0.030), need for further post-operative transfusions (50% vs. 12.5%, p value 0.040), and additional operative procedures (30 vs. 18, p value 0.024) were more in the SPAC group. There was no difference in limb salvage rates (93.7% vs. 87.5%, p value 0.513), rates of fasciotomy (68% vs. 56.3%, p value 0.412), hospital stay (mean 20.12 vs. 16.28 days, p value 0.663), and ICU stay (mean 0.81 vs. 2.7 days, p value 0.358). SPAC does not seem to improve post-operative vessel patency following end to end arterial repair of injured medium-sized vessels. An increase in adverse events following use of SPAC was noted. An adequately powered randomized trial is needed to conclusively bridge the lacunae on the use of anticoagulation in these groups of patients.

AB  - BackgroundThis review analyzed the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and in India and the measures to counter its effect using natural and innate immune booster molecules. The study focuses on two phases: the first focuses on the magnitude, and the second on the effect of antioxidants (natural compounds) on SARS-CoV-2.MethodsThe magnitude of the prevalence, mortality, and comorbidities was acquired from the World Health Organization (WHO) report, media, a report from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), newspapers, and the National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC). Research articles from PubMed as well as other sites/journals and databases were accessed to gather literature on the effect of antioxidants.ResultsIn the elderly and any chronic diseases, the declined level of antioxidant molecules enhanced the reactive oxygen species, which in turn deprived the immune system.ConclusionInnate antioxidant proteins like sirtuin and sestrin play a vital role in enhancing immunity. Herbal products and holistic approaches can also be alternative solutions for everyday life to boost the immune system by improving the redox balance in COVID-19 attack. This review analyzed the counteractive effect of alternative therapy to boost the immune system against the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Evaluation of a quality improvement intervention to reduce anastomotic leak following right colectomy (EAGLE): pragmatic, batched stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial in 64 countries
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
KW  - CLINICAL-TRIALS
AB  - Background: Anastomotic leak affects 8 per cent of patients after right colectomy with a 10-fold increased risk of postoperative death. The EAGLE study aimed to develop and test whether an international, standardized quality improvement intervention could reduce anastomotic leaks.
   Methods: The internationally intended protocol, iteratively co-developed by a multistage Delphi process, comprised an online educational module introducing risk stratification, an intraoperative checklist, and harmonized surgical techniques. Clusters (hospital teams) were randomized to one of three arms with varied sequences of intervention/data collection by a derived stepped-wedge batch design (at least 18 hospital teams per batch). Patients were blinded to the study allocation. Low- and middle-income country enrolment was encouraged. The primary outcome (assessed by intention to treat) was anastomotic leak rate, and subgroup analyses by module completion (at least 80 per cent of surgeons, high engagement; less than 50 per cent, low engagement) were preplanned.
   Results: A total 355 hospital teams registered, with 332 from 64 countries (39.2 per cent low and middle income) included in the final analysis. The online modules were completed by half of the surgeons (2143 of 4411). The primary analysis included 3039 of the 3268 patients recruited (206 patients had no anastomosis and 23 were lost to follow-up), with anastomotic leaks arising before and after the intervention in 10.1 and 9.6 per cent respectively (adjusted OR 0.87, 95 per cent c.i. 0.59 to 1.30; P = 0.498). The proportion of surgeons completing the educational modules was an influence: the leak rate decreased from 12.2 per cent (61 of 500) before intervention to 5.1 per cent (24 of 473) after intervention in high-engagement centres (adjusted OR 0.36, 0.20 to 0.64; P < 0.001), but this was not observed in low-engagement hospitals (8.3 per cent (59 of 714) and 13.8 per cent (61 of 443) respectively; adjusted OR 2.09, 1.31 to 3.31).
   Conclusion: Completion of globally available digital training by engaged teams can alter anastomotic leak rates. Registration number: NCT04270721 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov).

AB  - The process of ferroptosis, a recently identified form of regulated cell death (RCD) is associated with the overloading of iron species and lipid -derived ROS accumulation. Ferroptosis is induced by various mechanisms such as inhibiting system Xc, glutathione depletion, targeting excess iron, and directly inhibiting GPX4 enzyme. Also, ferroptosis inhibition is achieved by blocking excessive lipid peroxidation by targeting different pathways. These mechanisms are often related to the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. Fundamentally distinct from other forms of cell death, such as necrosis and apoptosis, ferroptosis differs in terms of biochemistry, functions, and morphology. The mechanism by which ferroptosis acts as a regulatory factor in many diseases remains elusive. Studying the activation and inhibition of ferroptosis as a means to mitigate the progression of various diseases is a highly intriguing and actively researched topic. It has emerged as a focal point in etiological research and treatment strategies. This review systematically summarizes the different mechanisms involved in the inhibition and induction of ferroptosis. We have extensively explored different agents that can induce or inhibit ferroptosis. This review offers current perspectives on recent developments in ferroptosis research, highlighting the disease's etiology and presenting references to enhance its understanding. It also explores new targets for the treatment of cancer and Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses is crucial to understanding an individual's immunity to COVID-19. However, high inter- and intra-assay variability make it difficult to define T cells as a correlate of protection against COVID-19. To address this, we performed systematic review and meta-analysis of 495 datasets from 94 original articles evaluating SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses using three assays - Activation Induced Marker (AIM), Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS), and Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISPOT), and defined each assay's quantitative range. We validated these ranges using samples from 193 SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals. Although IFN gamma ELISPOT was the preferred assay, our experimental validation suggested that it under-represented the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell repertoire. Our data indicate that a combination of AIM and ICS or FluoroSpot assay would better represent the frequency, polyfunctionality, and compartmentalization of the antigen-specific T cell responses. Taken together, our results contribute to defining the ranges of antigen-specific T cell assays and propose a choice of assay that can be employed to better understand the cellular immune response against viral diseases.

AB  - Background: Serum adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) are dysregulated before the onset of metabolic syndrome and hence may be useful biomarkers for screening of cardiometabolic late effects in childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (cALL) survivors.Methods: We compared serum adipokine levels between 40 cALL survivors (aged 10-18 years, >2 years from treatment completion) with similar controls. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was then done to assess the association of metabolic syndrome in cALL survivors with variables including adipokines and other metabolic parameters, demographic and treatment details, and Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan-derived variables.Results: Compared to controls, cALL survivors had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (8/40 vs. 2/40, P = .044) and central obesity (11/40 vs. 4/40, P = 0.042). Median Serum Leptin (7.39 vs. 4.23 ng/ml, P = 0.207) levels and derived Leptin-Adiponectin Ratio (1.44 vs. 0.80, P = 0.598), were higher but not statistically different in our survivors compared to controls; Adiponectin levels were similar (6.07 vs. 5.01 mu g/ml, P = 0.283). In the cALL survivors, overweight/obesity (odds ratio [OR] 21.9, P = 0.020) or higher Leptin levels (OR 1.11, P = 0.047), were independently associated with metabolic syndrome.Conclusions: Serum Leptin, independently predictive of metabolic syndrome in our cALL survivors, may be tested in larger studies to assess its utility in surveillance and initiation of early preventive measures.

AB  - IntroductionVasovagal reaction (VVR) is a frequently encountered generalised donor adverse reaction, associated with donor deterrence towards future donation. Several mitigation strategies for prevention of VVR were tried but still not standardised. This quadri-armed randomised study evaluated the utility of water ingestion, applied muscle tension (AMT) and combination of both in preventing the VVR among blood donors.MethodsA quadri-armed randomised controlled trial was performed on 4320 whole blood donors. Blood donors of 18-65 years of age were randomised into four groups based on the interventions performed i.e., control with no intervention (Group 1, n = 1081), water ingestion (Group 2, n = 1082), AMT (Group 3, n = 1070) and combined intervention (Group 4, n = 1087). VVR during and immediately after blood donation were observed along with assessment of risk factors in blood donors and the effectiveness of interventions were analysed.ResultsThe incidence of VVR observed 1.6% in our study, with the highest occurrence in the control group (2.5%) and the lowest in the combined intervention group (0.9%). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the control group donors faced a 1.38-fold greater risk of VVR compared to those receiving interventions (OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.10-1.75). Other risk factors included younger age (OR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.05-2.17), first-time donation (OR: 5.7, 95% CI: 1.66-5.74), prior history of VVR (OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 10.4-101.52).Discussion/ConclusionThe combined approach of water ingestion and AMT proved significantly more effective in VVR prevention compared to individual interventions.

AB  - Identifying biomarkers for diagnosing Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), assessing its severity, and guiding treatment is crucial. We conducted whole genome transcriptomic study in North Indian population, and analyzed biochemical parameters. Our longitudinal study investigated gene-expression profiles from 72 drug-free MDD patients and 50 healthy controls(HCs) at baseline and 24 patients after 12-weeks of treatment. Gene expression analyses identified differentially expressed genes(DEGs) associated with MDD susceptibility, symptom severity and treatment response, independently validated by qPCR. Hierarchical clustering revealed distinct expression patterns between MDD and HCs, also between mild and severe cases. Enrichment analyses of significant DEGs revealed inflammatory, apoptosis, and immune-related pathways in MDD susceptibility, severity, and treatment response. Simultaneously, we assessed thirty biochemical parameters in the same cohort, showed significant differences between MDD and HCs in 13 parameters with monocytes, eosinophils, creatinine, SGPT, and total protein remained independent predictors of MDD in a multivariate-regression model. Our study supports the role of altered immune/inflammatory signaling in MDD pathophysiology, offering clinically relevant biochemical parameters and insights into transcriptomic gene regulation in MDD pathogenesis and treatment response.

AB  - Background: Comprehensive session summaries enable effective continuity in mental health counseling, facilitating informedtherapy planning. However, manual summarization presents a significant challenge, diverting experts'attention from the corecounseling process. Leveraging advances in automatic summarization to streamline the summarization process addresses thisissue because this enables mental health professionals to access concise summaries of lengthy therapy sessions, thereby increasingtheir efficiency. However, existing approaches often overlook the nuanced intricacies inherent in counseling interactions. Objective: This study evaluates the effectiveness of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in selectively summarizingvarious components of therapy sessions through aspect-based summarization, aiming to benchmark their performance.Methods: We first created Mental Health Counseling-Component-Guided Dialogue Summaries, a benchmarking data set thatconsists of 191 counseling sessions with summaries focused on 3 distinct counseling components (also known as counselingaspects). Next, we assessed the capabilities of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs in addressing the task of counseling-component-guidedsummarization. The generated summaries were evaluated quantitatively using standard summarization metrics and verifiedqualitatively by mental health professionals. Results: Our findings demonstrated the superior performance of task-specific LLMs such as MentalLlama, Mistral, andMentalBART evaluated using standard quantitative metrics such as Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE)-1,ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers Score across all aspects of the counselingcomponents. Furthermore, expert evaluation revealed that Mistral superseded both MentalLlama and MentalBART across 6parameters: affective attitude, burden, ethicality, coherence, opportunity costs, and perceived effectiveness. However, thesemodels exhibit a common weakness in terms of room for improvement in the opportunity costs and perceived effectivenessmetrics. Conclusions: While LLMs fine-tuned specifically on mental health domain data display better performance based on automaticevaluation scores, expert assessments indicate that these models are not yet reliable for clinical application. Further refinementand validation are necessary before their implementation in practice

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aftermath left an alarming surge in syphilis cases, contradicting the previously stable trajectory of the infection. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also reported a 38% increase in primary and secondary syphilis in 2021 compared to 2019 in the United States, prompting a retrospective analysis at our tertiary care centre in New Delhi, India. There was a persistent linear rise, surpassing pre-COVID levels. Male clinic attendees, exhibit a pronounced increase, likely due to the influence of MSM. Online sexual activity during lockdowns and redirected healthcare resources have possibly contributed to this trend. Urgent measures include strengthened surveillance data collection and public health response, awareness promotion, and early, free treatment. The syphilis surge may signify a broader, undiagnosed STI pandemic, necessitating comprehensive intervention and surveillance.

AB  - Background: Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) galactomannan (GM) is commonly used to diagnose Aspergillus-related lung diseases. However, unlike serum GM, which is measured in undiluted blood, BAL-GM is estimated using variable aliquots and cumulative volume of instillates during bronchoscopy.Objective: Since different studies have reported varying diagnostic accuracy and cut-offs for BAL-GM in CPA, we hypothesized that the total volume of instillate and 'order/label' of aliquots significantly affects the BAL-GM values, which was evaluated as part of this study.Patients & Methods: We obtained 250 BAL samples from 50 patients (five from each) with suspected chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. BAL fluid was collected after instilling sequential volumes of 40 mL of normal saline each for the first four labels and a fifth label was prepared by mixing 1 mL from each of the previous labels. The GM level of each label was measured by PLATELIA (TM) ASPERGILLUS Ag enzyme immunoassay. This study measured the discordance, level of agreement, diagnostic characteristics (sensitivity, specificity and AUROC) and best cut-offs for BAL-GM in the different aliquots of lavage fluid.Results: The study population, classified into CPA (28%) and non-CPA (72%) groups, based on ERS/ESCMID criteria (excluding BAL-GM) were not different with respect to clinico-radiological characteristics. The discordance of BAL-GM positivity (using a cut-off of >1) between the serial labels for the same patient ranged between 10% and 22%, while the discordance between classification using BAL-GM positivity (using a cut-off of >= 1) and clinic-radio-microbiological classification ranged between 18% and 30%. The level of agreement for serial labels was at best fair (<0.6 for all except one 'label'). The AUROC for the serial samples ranged between 0.595 and 0.702, with the '40 mL and the 'mix' samples performing the best. The best BAL-GM cut-off also showed significant variation between serial labels of varying dilutions (Range:1.01 - 4.26).Interpretation: This study highlights the variation in BAL-GM measured and the 'positivity' between different 'labels' of aliquots of BAL, with the first aliquot and the mixed sample showing the best performances for diagnosis of CPA. Future studies should attempt to 'standardise' the instilled volume for BAL-GM estimation to standardise the diagnostic yield.

AB  - Background: Microparticles (MPs) have been implicated in thrombosis and endothelial dysfunction. Their involvement in early coagulopathy and in worsening of outcomes in isolated severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) patients remains ill defined.
   Objective: We sought to quantify the circulatory MP subtypes derived from platelets (PMPs; CD42), endothelial cells (EMPs; CD62E), and those bearing tissue factor (TFMP; CD142) and analyze their correlation with early coagulopathy, thrombin generation, and in-hospital mortality.
   Materials and Methods: Prospective screening of sTBI patients was done. Blood samples were collected before blood and fluid transfusion. MP enumeration and characterization were performed using flow cytometry, and thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Circulating levels of procoagulant MPs were compared between isolated sTBI patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). Patients were stratified according to their PMP, EMP, and TFMP levels, respectively (high >= HC median and low < HC median).
   Results: Isolated sTBI resulted in an increased generation of PMPs (456.6 [228-919] vs. 249.1 [198.9-404.5]; P = 0.01) and EMPs (301.5 [118.8-586.7] vs. 140.9 [124.9-286]; P = 0.09) compared to HCs. Also, 5.3% of MPs expressed TF (380 [301-710]) in HCs, compared to 6.6% MPs (484 [159-484]; P = 0.87) in isolated sTBI patients. Early TBI-associated coagulopathy (TBI-AC) was seen in 50 (41.6%) patients. PMP (380 [139-779] vs. 523.9 [334-927]; P = 0.19) and EMP (242 [86-483] vs. 344 [168-605]; P = 0.81) counts were low in patients with TBI-AC, compared to patients without TBI-AC.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest that enhanced cellular activation and procoagulant MP generation are predominant after isolated sTBI. TBI-AC was associated with low plasma PMPs count compared to the count in patients without TBI-AC. Low PMPs may be involved with the development of TBI-AC.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels either due to insufficient insulin production, defective insulin action, or both. It affects nearly 537 million individuals worldwide. Pharmacological treatment involves the use of oral anti-diabetic agents as mono or combination therapy that effectively aids in controlling hyperglycemia. Despite providing therapeutic benefits, these medications limit their use owing to adverse side effects. Certain natural products, including essential oils, have promising anti-diabetic properties. Objectives: The present study explores the effectiveness of two polyherbal oils and their compound towards the treatment of DM based on an In-silico approach to drug investigations. Methods: Compounds present in the polyherbal oil formulation were identified using GC-MS/MS analysis. Selected compounds undergo molecular docking with the receptor, and proteins play an important role in DM. The potential compounds showing higher interactions than the known inhibitors or inducers were evaluated using molecular dynamic simulations RMSD values. Results: The compounds identified through GC-MS analysis possess anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory properties. With the aid of in silico prediction methods, compounds such as geraniol, cinnamaldehyde, anethole, caryophyllene, terpinyl acetate, cymene, linalool, menthol, Phenol,2-methoxy-3-(2-propenyl), and 2,6- octadienal,3,7-dimethyl were identified as strong binders of GLUT4 and insulin receptor proteins. Geraniol and Phenol,2-methoxy-3-(2-propenyl) interaction with GLUT4 were of particular importance owing to their conformational stability. Conclusion: Our data suggest an agonistic effect of compounds on target proteins aiding in enhanced insulin activity and could serve as a potential anti-diabetic agent.

AB  - Background: Hemispherotomy (HS) is an effective treatment for unilateral hemispheric onset epilepsy. There are few publications for HS in adults, and there is no series comparing adults and pediatric patients of HS. Objective: To compare the hemispherotomies done in adult patients with pediatric ones in terms of efficacy and safety. Methods: Data was prospectively collected for HS patients (up to 18 years and more) from Aug 2014 to Aug 2018. Comparison between the groups was made for seizure onset, duration of epilepsy, frequency of seizures, number of drugs, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative seizure control, postoperative stay, postoperative motor functions, and preoperative and postoperative intelligence quotient. Follow-up was one year. Results: A total of 61 pediatric and 11 adults underwent HS. The seizure onset was earlier in children, and the duration of epilepsy was longer in adults. The frequency of seizures per day was more in children being 14.62 +/- 26.34 in children, and 7.71 +/- 5.21 per day in adults (P - 0.49). The mean number of drugs was similar in the preoperative and postoperative periods in both. Class I seizure outcome was similar in both the groups being 85.24% in children and 90.9% in adults (P - 0.56). Blood loss, postoperative stay, was similar in both the groups. No patient had a new permanent motor deficit. Power worsened transiently in 1 pediatric patient and in 4 adult patients. The visual word reading and object naming improved in both the groups (no intergroup difference), and IQ remained the same in both groups. One adult patient had meningitis, and another had hydrocephalus requiring shunt placement. Conclusion: Hemispherotomy is a safe and effective procedure in adults as in children in appropriately selected patients.

AB  - Myoelectric indices forecasting is important for muscle fatigue monitoring in wearable technologies, adaptive control of assistive devices like exoskeletons and prostheses, functional electrical stimulation (FES)-based Neuro prostheses, and more. Non-stationary temporal development of these indices in dynamic contractions makes forecasting difficult. This study aims at incorporating transfer learning into a deep learning model, Myoelectric Fatigue Forecasting Network (MEFFNet), to forecast myoelectric indices of fatigue (both time and frequency domain) obtained during voluntary and FES-induced dynamic contractions in healthy and post-stroke subjects respectively. Different state-of-the-art deep learning models along with the novel MEFFNet architecture were tested on myoelectric indices of fatigue obtained during a) voluntary elbow flexion and extension with four different weights(1 kg, 2 kg, 3 kg, and 4 kg) in sixteen healthy subjects, and b) FES-induced elbow flexion in sixteen healthy and seventeen post-stroke subjects under three different stimulation patterns (customized rectangular, trapezoidal, and muscle synergy-based). A version of MEFFNet, named as pretrained MEFFNet, was trained on a dataset of sixty thou-sand synthetic time series to transfer its learning on realtime series of myoelectric indices of fatigue. The pretrained MEFFNet could forecast up to 22.62 seconds, 60 time steps, in future with a mean absolute percentage error of 15.99 +/- 6.48% in voluntary and 11.93 +/- 4.77% in FES-induced contractions, outperforming the MEFFNet and other models under consideration. The results suggest combining the proposed model with wearable technology, prosthetics, robotics, stimulation devices, etc. to improve performance. Transfer learning in time series forecasting has potential to improve wearable sensor predictions

AB  - PurposeInherited deficiencies of CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) reflect the crucial immunological functions of CD40-CD40L interaction/signaling. Although numerous studies have provided a detailed description of CD40L deficiency, reports of CD40 deficiency are scarce. Herein, we describe the characteristics of all reported patients with CD40 deficiency.MethodsThe PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant literature published till 7th August 2023. Study deduplication and identification of relevant reports was performed using the online PICO Portal. The data were extracted using a pre-designed data extraction form and the SPSS software was used for analysis.ResultsSystematic literature review revealed 40 unique patients with CD40 deficiency. Respiratory tract and gastrointestinal infections were the predominant clinical manifestations (observed in 93% and 57% patients, respectively). Sclerosing cholangitis has been reported in nearly one-third of patients. Cryptosporidium sp. (29%) and Pneumocystis jirovecii (21%) were the most common microbes identified. Very low to undetectable IgG levels and severely reduced/absent switch memory B cells were observed in all patients tested/reported. Elevated IgM levels were observed in 69% patients. Overall, splice-site and missense variants were the most common (36% and 32%, respectively) molecular defects identified. All patients were managed with immunoglobulin replacement therapy and antimicrobial prophylaxis was utilized in a subset. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been performed in 45% patients (curative outcome observed in 73% of these patients). Overall, a fatal outcome was reported in 21% patients.ConclusionsWe provide a comprehensive description of all important aspects of CD40 deficiency. HSCT is a promising curative treatment option for CD40 deficiency.

AB  - Urinary albumin is an excellent marker for the diagnosis of chronic kidney disease. Smartphone assisted accessory-free analyzers are gaining popularity in the quantification of urinary albumin in point-of-care settings, though, presently, they are widely used as a screening tool. Application of smartphone-based colorimetry systems are limited because they suffer from several operating problems such as camera settings and illumination conditions, that can change the colorimetric values. In addition, they suffer from the problem of domain shift i.e. extreme performance degradation when tested data (source) was captured in a setting different from that of the training (target) data. In this work, the problem introduced due to smartphone camera settings and illumination conditions, has been addressed by applying a domain adaptation deep learning method. It is the amalgamation of a generative model and convolutional neural network. Images captured using an iPhone under 3500K light conditions were used as the target dataset and other domains including different smartphones and light conditions were utilized as source datasets. Given test data from the source, its 'closest clone' was derived using generative model-based Pix2pixGAN and mapped to the target data. Further, a customized CNN model was used for the classification of the closest clone data. The proposed method yields an accuracy of similar to 88% for inter-phone repeatability on test data. The efficacy of the proposed model was also evaluated under different illumination conditions.

AB  - The presence of albumin in the urine is indicative of kidney damage and can occur due to several underlying conditions, such as diabetes. The concentration of albumin in urine is used for the diagnosis and staging of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In clinical samples, the detection of albumin at lower concentrations is crucial for the early diagnosis and monitoring of CKD. Current urine analyzers precisely quantify albumin but are expensive and difficult to use in point-of-care (PoC) settings. Here, we demonstrate the quantification of albumin concentration in a urine sample using colorimetry. This model presents an accessory-free urine analyzer that uses a smartphone and customized machine-learning algorithms. Here, a urine sample is introduced onto a chemically impregnated dipstick that exhibits a change in color with the amount of albumin. Images of the urine dipsticks are captured using a smartphone camera under different illumination/experimental conditions and are processed to extract changes in the color values arising due to changes in the concentration of urinary albumin. Albumin concentrations are estimated from changes in color values. We used customized machine-learning algorithms to classify albumin concentrations and mitigate the effect of ambient light conditions. The k-nearest neighbor algorithm yielded an average classification accuracy of 96% with a detection limit of 4 mg l-1. The proposed scheme can be extensively used to monitor albumin concentration in PoC settings.

TI  - Cortical versus nuclear lenticular fluid
T2  - NATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL OF INDIA
AB  - Crystalline lens is like a dustbin where older lens fibres keep accumulating in the centre on account of continuous influx of fresh fibres from the anterior equator, thereby causing central sclerosis. Lenticular fluid accumulation1 1 is a form of cataract that behaves differently in the cortex and in the nucleus on account of differential compactness of fibres. We document the same in a 50-year-old woman with diabetes who, in her right eye had amoeboid and milky fluid pocket (anterior subcapsular region) (Figs 1a,b--red circle; Fig.1c--red arrow), whereas in the left eye, she had compact clear vesicles (nucleus) (Fig.1d- -green circle; Fig.1e--green arrow).The two have unique implications. It is always the milky superficial fluid that seeps out in the anterior chamber during anterior capsulorhexis opening. Though it opacifies the field of rhexis view, it decompresses the lenticular volume, thereby reducing chances of rhexis runoff/extension. A calculated nick over the same area to begin rhexis can help the surgeon take a chance of Argentinian flag sign in intumescent cataracts. Nuclear fluid pockets, on the other hand, are sources of optical distortions and may warrant surgery in the absence of any gross lenticular opacity or sclerosis.

AB  - Clinically, hemorrhages at the vitreoretinal interface have been termed as 'pre-retinal' in location. However, there is a careful distinction to be made between sub-hyaloid and sub-internal limiting membrane (ILM) planes of blood collection. In the past half-century, a body of literature has accrued on sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhage. We characterize the etiopathological, clinical, anatomical, and imaging characteristics of this entity (often misconstrued as sub-hyaloid hemorrhage). Management decisions are briefly described, and a unifying term of sub-internal limiting membrane macular hemorrhage is proposed to aid in further research.

AB  - The current Medical Education system of India, with its enormous workload and academic demands tend to cause the medical students stress. There is evidence showing medical students at a higher risk of depression, anxiety and burnout compared to other Indian students. Despite, the huge reported numbers, the proportion of students and doctors who seek help for their problems is alarmingly low. One of the reasons provided for the same is stigma towards mental health and an apprehension regarding labels and treatment history on the careers of the students. Increased awareness and with a National Health Programme catered towards mental health, there has been a boost in the utilization and provision of mental health services but it rarely translates into better mental health facilities for the healthcare providers. The special set of challenges faced by a medical students are gradually being recognized and efforts are being made to address them. Curriculum guidelines, teaching methods, student welfare centres and helplines have been the areas of intervention. There should also be changes in approaches towards the students who face problems and providing a safe environment for them to discuss their problems, including encouraging peer support. Thus, a fine balance needs to be present between ensuring the protection of the mental health of a medical student and ensuring a quality medical education for them. Further exploration to address stigma and building empathy among the students and evaluation of the intervention methods devised to address the same becomes very necessary to ensure fruitful interventions. It is the need of the hour to help Indian Medical students overcome their struggles with mental health.

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) is not well understood because of its enormous biological heterogeneity and unreliable progression. We conducted this retrospective analysis to examine the variables predicting early and late progression to castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) for better management of this disease.<br /> Methods: This single institutional retrospective study was conducted from January 2018 to January 2022. A total of 98 consecutive men meeting with the diagnosis of CRPC as per the inclusion criteria were included in the study and were stratified in four quartiles on the basis of time to CRPC (time to castration resistance [TTCR]) development. Early CRPC (1(st) quartile, TTCR = 6- 12 months) and late CRPC (4(th) quartile, TTCR = 38- 120 months) were then compared on the basis of different clinical, pathological and AR-LBD sequence to find the correlation with response duration.<br /> Results: Median time to develop castration resistance was 25 +/- 26.44 months. The mean age of the patients was 66.8 +/- 9.20 years and median baseline PSA was calculated 100 +/- 685.06 ng/mL respectively. Higher Gleason score (>= 7- 10) was found to be significantly associated with early development of CRPC (p< 0.001) and lower nadir PSA was significantly indicating late CRPC progression (p< 0.005). No mutations were found in androgen receptor exon-5, 6, 7 except a homozygous mutation in the 7(th) intronic region, which is involved in splice variants formation playing noteworthy role in CRPC development.<br /> Conclusion: Time for metastatic PCa to CRPC ranges from 6- 120 months revealing its heterogeneous nature. Early age presentation in the clinic and high initial PSA and high grade (GS> 7) at diagnosis were positively associated with early CRPC while lower nadir PSA was correlated with late CRPC progression. No remarkable genomic mutations were discovered. Therefore, more data are needed and further research is required with large no. of patients to discover the predictive prognostic biomarkers for better patients' management.

AB  - BackgroundCross contamination and biosafety are concerns with the microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay. To address these issues, we modified the MODS technique in the current study.Methodology/Principal findingsTwo hundred and seventy-five samples were processed on LJ media and drug susceptibility was performed by the Indirect agar proportion method. A modified MODS test was done in tissue culture bottles. GenoType MTBDRplus assay was performed to detect the resistance and mutational pattern associated with the resistances. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the detection of tuberculosis by modified MODS were 97.44%, 80.00%, 97.44%, and 80.00% respectively. The perfect agreement was seen between modified MODS and the Indirect agar proportion method for drug susceptibility testing of isoniazid (kappa = 0.923) and rifampicin (kappa = 1). The contamination rate, cost and TAT for modified MODS were less as compared to the solid media.In the case of MDR-TB isolates S531L (66.66%) was the most prevalent mutation in the rpoB gene followed by S315T2 mutation (58.33%) and T8C (41.66%) in katG and inhA gene respectively. In hetero-resistant strains, C-15T mutation (37.50%) was the most common followed by A-16G (12.50%) in the inhA gene. In INH mono-resistant strains only two mutations were observed i.e., S-315T1(50%) and C-15T (50%) in the katG and inhA genes respectively.Methodology/Principal findingsTwo hundred and seventy-five samples were processed on LJ media and drug susceptibility was performed by the Indirect agar proportion method.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the perceived need among surgical residents to revisit their anatomical knowledge and evaluate their attitude towards integrating clinical anatomists into surgical residency program curriculum. BACKGROUND: While medical students learn human anatomy during undergraduate years, the practical application of clinically oriented anatomy becomes vital in surgical specialties. However, this aspect has not been adequately addressed in Indian surgical residency programs. METHODS: An 11-item questionnaire, including closed-ended and Likert-scale questions, was administered to 153 surgical residents. Consent was obtained, and responses were collected via Google Forms. RESULTS: Half of the respondents (50%) felt confident in their self-directed anatomy learning, but 87% believed integrating clinical anatomists would enhance their surgical expertise. Additionally, 88% saw value in revisiting cadaveric dissection. Third-year residents showed a significantly higher inclination towards cadaveric dissection. Deficiencies in the curriculum and time constraints were identified as major barriers. CONCLUSION: The study highlights a perceived need among surgical residents to augment their anatomical knowledge, advocating for the integration of clinical anatomists and cadaveric dissection into training. A collaborative approach, emphasizing both horizontal and vertical integration of anatomy, is recommended to enhance surgical education and practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to analyze the potential and convenience of using mixed reality as a teaching tool for craniovertebral junction (CVJ) anomaly pathoanatomy. METHODS CT and CT angiography images of 2 patients with CVJ anomalies were used to construct mixed reality models in the HoloMedicine application on the HoloLens 2 headset, resulting in four viewing stations. Twenty-two participants were randomly allocated into two groups, with each participant rotating through all stations for 90 seconds, each in a different order based on their group. At every station, objective questions evaluating the understanding of CVJ pathoanatomy were answered. At the end, subjective opinion on the user experience of mixed reality was provided using a 5-point Likert scale. The objective performance of the two viewing modes was compared, and a correlation between performance and participant experience was sought. Subjective feedback was compiled and correlated with experience. RESULTS In both groups, there was a significant improvement in median (interquartile range [IQR]) objective performance with mixed reality compared with DICOM: 1) group A: case 1, median 6 (IQR 6-7) versus 5 (IQR 3-6), p = 0.009; case 2, median 6 (IQR 6-7) versus 5 (IQR 3-6), p = 0.02; 2) group B: case 1, median 6 (IQR 5-7) versus 4 (IQR 2-5), p = 0.04; case 2, median 6 (IQR 6-7) versus 5 (IQR 3-7), p = 0.03. There was significantly higher improvement in less experienced participants in both groups for both cases: 1) group A: case 1, r = -0.8665, p = 0.0005; case 2, r = -0.8002, p = 0.03; 2) group B: case 1, r = -0.6977, p = 0.01; case 2, r = -0.7417, p = 0.009. Subjectively, mixed reality was easy to use, with less disorientation due to the visible background, and it was believed to be a useful teaching tool. CONCLUSIONS Mixed reality is an effective teaching tool for CVJ pathoanatomy, particularly for young neurosurgeons and trainees. The versatility of mixed reality and the intuitiveness of the user experience offer many potential applications, including training, intraoperative guidance, patient counseling, and individualized medicine; consequently, mixed reality has the potential to transform neurosurgery.

AB  - Thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system and accounts for nearly 1.5% of all new cancer cases in India. The incidence of thyroid cancers is on the rise secondary to multiple factors including the widespread use of radiological imaging. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment, and radioactive iodine therapy plays a pivotal role in differentiated thyroid cancer. Radiation therapy appears to be an underutilized treatment modality. In this review, we have summarized the role of radiation in the treatment of thyroid cancer.

AB  - The emergence of adrenergic beta 2-receptor (ADRB2) blockers has revolutionized glaucoma treatment, while the discovery of prostaglandin analogs has further expanded therapeutic options. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 2A1 (OATP2A1/SLCO2A1) facilitates the corneal transport of topical prostaglandins into anterior segment of eye. Our study aims to elucidate the prevalence of genetic polymorphisms in the ADRB2 and OATP2A1 to address variations in therapeutic responses among glaucoma patients. The study cohort comprised primary open-angle glaucoma patients (POAG, n = 77), compared to non-glaucomatous controls (n = 60) to identify polymorphisms rs1042713 (Arg16Gly, A > G) and rs1042714 (Gln27Glu, C > G) in the ADRB2 gene and rs34550074 (Ala396Thr, A > G) in OATP2A1 gene, using Sanger sequencing. Among the enrolled subjects (n = 137), the POAG group exhibited significantly elevated intraocular pressure (P < 0.001) and cup-to-disc ratio (P < 0.0001). The GA genotype of rs1042713 (P < 0.01) and the GG genotype of rs1042714 (P < 0.05) were positively associated with POAG, while rs34550074 (P > 0.05) showed no significant correlation with the disease. This study reveals the association of the ADRB2 gene polymorphisms with POAG, whereas OATP2A1 polymorphism did not show significant correlation.

AB  - Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major global health problem that disproportionally affects low- and middle-income countries. The needs for patients with TBI therefore may differ between levels of national development. We aimed to describe differences in epidemiology and acute care provision of TBI between India and Europe.
   Methods We used data from two prospective observational registry studies - the Collaborative Indian NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CINTER-TBI) and the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI), which included TBI patients with an indication for brain CT-scan presenting to 65 centres across Europe and Israel and two trauma centres in India. We performed descriptive analyses of demographic, injury, and treatment characteristics and used random-effects logistic regression with covariate adjustment to examine the likelihood of acute neurosurgical interventions and in-hospital mortality.
   Results We included 22 849 patients from CENTER-TBI and 3904 from CINTER-TBI. The median age in Europe was 55 years (IQR = 3276) compared to 27 years (IQR = 18-40) in India. The most common cause of TBI in Europe were falls (n = 12150 (53%), while traffic incidents predominated in India (n = 2130 (55%)). The proportion of patients with severe TBI was higher in India (n = 867 (22%)) than in Europe (n = 1661 (7%). Professional pre-hospital care involving ambulance service was utilised by three-fourths (n = 17203 (75%)) of European and less than a one-tenth (n = 224 (6%)) of Indian patients in our sample. Patients with severe TBI were more likely to undergo surgical contusion/ haematoma evacuation in India compared to Europe (OR = 2.0; 95% CI = 1.7-2.5) and Indian patients had higher odds of undergoing intracranial pressure monitor placement (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 2.0-2.7). A primary decompressive craniectomy was likewise more often performed in the Indian cohort (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 3.5-7.5). Discharge destinations in Europe included rehabilitation centres (n = 1261 (6%)) or nursing homes (n = 1208 (5%)), which was rarely the case in India (n = 13 (0%) and n = 9 (0%), respectively).
   Conclusions Substantial disparities between India and Europe exist along the neurotrauma care chain, with both systems being likely to face unique features and challenges in the future.

AB  - Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) requires treatment with fluoroquinolone (FLQ) drugs, however, the excessive use of FLQ has led to the rise of extensively drug-resistant TB. In 2019, similar to 20% of total MDR-TB cases were estimated to be resistant to FLQ drugs. In the present study, we developed and evaluated the utility of high-resolution melt curve analysis (HRM) for the rapid detection of FLQ-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis for the first time directly from sputum samples. A reference plasmid library was generated for the most frequently observed mutations of gyrA gene and was used to discriminate between mutant and wild-type samples in the FLQ-HRM assay. The developed assay was evaluated on n = 25 MDR M. tuberculosis clinical isolates followed by validation on archived sputum DNA (n = 88) using DNA sequencing as a gold standard. The FLQ-HRM assay showed a 100% sensitivity [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 71.5 to 100] and specificity (95% CI: 39.7 to 100) in smear-positive category, and a sensitivity of 88.9% (95% CI: 77.3 to 95.8) with 84.2% (95% CI: 60.4 to 96.6) specificity in smear-negative category. The assay showed a high level of concordance of similar to 90% (kappa = 0.74) with DNA sequencing, however, we were limited by the absence of phenotypic drug susceptibility testing data. In conclusion, HRM is a rapid, cost-effective (INR 150/USD 1.83) and closed-tube method for direct detection of FLQ resistance in sputum samples including direct smear-negative samples.

AB  - The authors report a rare case of pediatric tuberculous dactylitis of the thumb with flexor tendon involvement in a child with multiple failed treatment attempts. The patient was diagnosed, treated and the outcome of the one-year follow-up was excellent. Extra pulmonary tuberculosis frequently surprises clinicians with aberrant presentations, which may be missed during radiographic studies, if not considered in differential diagnosis amid its rare location in the appendicular skeleton. This has been highlighted in this rare case of a girl in her mid-childhood with a spindle-shaped swelling with discharging sinuses at the right thumb proximal phalanx. Scenarios mimicking similar presentations such as Enchondromatosis, Chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis, Brodie's abscess and Actinomycosis, can be misleading. Several researchers have proffered up such rare cases, but after the anti-tubercular therapy era, the incidence has been exceptionally reduced. Still, a high index of suspicion can be helpful to avoid missing the diagnosis.

AB  - High-precision biometry and accurate intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation have become essential components of cataract surgery. In clinical practice, IOL power calculation involves measuring parameters such as corneal power and axial length and then applying a power calculation formula. The importance of posterior corneal curvature in determining the true power of the cornea is increasingly being recognized, and newer investigative modalities that can estimate both the anterior and posterior corneal power are becoming the standard of care. Optical biometry, especially using swept-source biometers, with an accuracy of 0.01-0.02 mm, has become the state-of-the-art method in biometry. With the evolution of IOL formulas, the ultimate goal of achieving a given target refraction has also moved closer to accuracy. However, despite these technological efforts to standardize and calibrate methods of IOL power calculation, achieving a mean absolute error of zero for every patient undergoing cataract surgery may not be possible. This is due to inherent consistent bias and systematic errors in the measurement devices, IOL formulas, and the individual bias of the surgeon. Optimization and personalization of lens constants allow for the incorporation of these systematic errors as well as individual bias, thereby further improving IOL power prediction accuracy. Our review provides a comprehensive overview of parameters for accurate biometry, along with considerations to enhance IOL power prediction accuracy through optimization and personalization. We conducted a detailed search in PubMed and Google Scholar by using a combination of MeSH terms and specific keywords such as "ocular biometry," "IOL power calculations," "prediction accuracy of refractive outcome in cataract surgery," "effective lens position," "intraocular lens calculation formulas," and "optimization of A-constants" to find relevant literature. We identified and analyzed 121 relevant articles, and their findings were included.

AB  - Purpose Wrist reconstruction after distal radial tumor resection poses a challenge to the orthopedic oncologist. We evaluated the functional outcomes of centralization of the ulna with ulnocarpal arthrodesis as a method of reconstruction following resection of distal radius tumors, using impairment measures and patient-reported outcomes. Methods Evaluation of functional outcome was performed using the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 scoring system and Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire. We also determined hand grip strength on the affected side, time to radiologic union at the ulnocarpal junction and reduction in wrist circumference. Local complications and oncologic outcomes were recorded. Results The study included 26 patients with Campanacci grade 3 giant cell tumor of the distal radius. Mean follow-up period in the study was 32.8 +/- 12 months. Mean resection length was 10.3 +/- 2.5 cm. Radiologic union at the ulnocarpal junction was achieved in 38.5%, 77% and 96% of the patients by 4, 5, and 6 months respectively. Mean hand grip strength was 74 +/- 3.9% of the contralateral side whereas mean reduction in wrist circumference was 16.9 +/- 6.4%. A good functional outcome with a mean the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 score of 26 +/- 1.4 and mean Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score of 10.5 +/- 6.3 was observed. Fracture of the ulna, hardware loosening, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy were each noted in 1 patient, with an overall complication rate of 10.7% (3/28). No patient had nonunion, infection, or local recurrence. Conclusions This is a simple and effective modality of reconstruction after resection of distal radial tumors. It provides good functional outcome and preservation of good hand grip strength, with low complication rates. (J Hand Surg Am. 2024;49(1):63.e1-e9.

AB  - A well-structured digital database is essential for any national priority project as it can provide real-time data analysis and facilitate quick decision making. In recent times, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) have emerged as a significant public health challenge in India, affecting vulnerable population, including immunocompromised individuals. The lack of comprehensive and well-structured data on IFIs has hindered efforts to understand their true burden and optimize patient care. To address this critical knowledge gap, the ICMR has undertaken a Pan-India pioneer initiative to develop a network of Advanced Mycology Diagnostic research centres in different geographical zones of the country (ICMR-MycoNet). Under the aegis of this project, a clinical registry on IFIs in the ICUs is initiated. This process paper presents a detailed account of the steps involved in the establishment of a web-based data entering and monitoring platform to capture data electronically, ensuring robust and secure data collection and management. This system not only allows participating ICMR-MycoNet centres to enter patient information directly into the database using standardized Case Report Form (CRF) but also includes data validation checks to ensure the accuracy and completeness of entered data. It is complemented by a real-time, web-based, and adaptable data visualization platform. This registry aims to provide crucial epidemiological insights, promote evidence-based hospital infection control programs, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in the face of this formidable healthcare challenge.

AB  - Background: Toll -like receptors (TLRs) are identified as one of the key components of the innate immune system. The objective of this study was to explore the influence of genetic variability in these TLRs on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression with and without tuberculosis (TB) co -infection. Materials and Methods: This prospective, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study included 373 HIV -positive patients without TB infection. This study aimed to examine the genetic variation in TLRs (TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9) between patients with HIV -1 infection and those who progressed to active TB during the two years of follow-up. Results: During the two year follow-up of 373 positive patients, 98 patients progressed to active TB/AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). When comparing 98 HIV patients who developed active TB/AIDS to 275 HIV patients who did not, it was discovered that the frequency of the A allele in TLR9 was considerably higher (p <0.001) in HIV patients progressed to active TB/ AIDS. Ninety eight HIV individuals who advanced to active TB/AIDS showed a significantly higher frequency of the AA genotype in TLR9 than did in HIV patients who had no TB/AIDS (p <0.001). Conclusion: The increased association of the AA genotype of TLR9 in HIV patients who progressed to active TB during follow-up suggests that HIV -positive patients with the AA genotype of TLR9 have increased susceptibility towards TB during the disease progression.

AB  - Background Cancer remains the major cause of morbidity and mortality. The nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappa B) plays an indispensable role in cancer cell proliferation and drug resistance. The role of NF-kappa B is not only limited to tumor cell proliferation and suppression of apoptotic genes but it also induces EMT transition responsible for metastasis. Inhibition of the NF-kappa B pathway in cancer cells by herbal derivatives makes it a favorable yet promising target for cancer therapeutics.Aim The purpose of the study is to explore the inhibition potential of Nimbin and its analogs against NF-kappa B subunits p50 and p65.Methods In the present study, an herbal compound Nimbin and its derivative analogs were investigated to examine their impact on the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway using in silico tools, namely molecular docking and simulation.Results The molecular docking analysis revealed that Nimbin and its analogs may bind to p50 and p65 subunits with dG bind values ranging from -33.23 to -50.49 Kcal/mol. Interestingly, molecular dynamic simulation for the NO5-p65 complex displayed a stable conformation and convergence when compared to the NO4-p50 complex.Conclusion These results indicate that NO5 may have a potential inhibitory effect against NF-kappa B subunit p65, which needs to be further validated in in vitro and in vivo systems. Also, the results obtained emphasize and pave the way for exploring the Nimbin scaffold against NF-kappa B inhibition for cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Bimanual phacoemulsification has been established as a safe and efficacious means of nuclear emulsification in the past. This case report presents the use of this technique in a man in his early forties, who had subluxated cataractous lenses in both eyes. The technique allowed for effective nuclear emulsification within a closed chamber, providing better control over intraocular events. The report emphasizes the safety and effectiveness of bimanual phacoemulsification in cataract extraction, even in challenging cases like a subluxated lens.

AB  - Background: Secondary bacterial infections during COVID-19 hospitalization have been reported in about 6-15% of patients. Aims: To study the secondary bacterial infections that affected the COVID-19 patients during their hospitalisation and to unearth the bacteriological profile of samples obtained after their demise.Settings and Design: This prospective study was carried out at a COVID-19 dedicated, apex tertiary care centre in North India from July 2020 to April 2021.Methods and Materials: Samples of 268 patients were considered for the study. Nasopharyngeal swab specimen, blood, and tissue (lung) were collected from the deceased body as early as possible and processed. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 11.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Results: A total of 170 samples were received from patients before their death, which included blood, urine, respiratory samples, pus, and cerebrospinal fluid. Forty-four pathogens were isolated, which consisted of Acinetobacter baumannii (43.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (36.3%), Escherichia coli (11.3%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.5%), Enterococcus faecium (4.5%). Two hundred fifty-eight samples were collected from the deceased bodies wherein the nasopharyngeal sample was highest, followed by tissue and blood. A total of 43 pathogens were isolated among them which included A. baumannii (44.1%), followed by K. pneumoniae (25.5%), E. coli (20.9%), P. aeruginosa (6.97%) and Enterobacter cloacae (2.3%). All these isolates were highly resistant to antimicrobials. Conclusions: In our study, bacterial profiles in antemortem and postmortem samples were found to be similar, suggesting that resistant pathogens may be the cause of mortality in COVID-19 infected hospitalised patients.

AB  - Background Different statistical approaches for estimating excess deaths due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have led to varying estimates. In this study, we developed and validated a covariate-based model (CBM) with imputation for prediction of district-level excess deaths in India.
   Methods We used data extracted from deaths registered under the Civil Registration System for 2015-19 for 684 of 713 districts in India to estimate expected deaths for 2020 through a negative binomial regression model (NBRM) and to calculate excess observed deaths. Specifically, we used 15 covariates across four domains (state, health system, population, COVID-19) in a zero inflated NBRM to identify covariates significantly (P < 0.05) associated with excess deaths estimate in 460 districts. We then validated this CBM in 140 districts by comparing predicted and estimated excess. For 84 districts with missing covariates, we validated the imputation with CBM by comparing estimated with predicted excess deaths. We imputed covariate data to predict excess deaths for 29 districts which did not have data on deaths.
   Results The share of elderly and urban population, the under-five mortality rate, prevalence of diabetes, and bed availability were significantly associated with estimated excess deaths and were used for CBM. The mean of the CBM-predicted excess deaths per district (<(x)over bar> = 989, standard deviation (SD) = 1588) was not significantly different from the estimated one ((x) over bar = 1448, SD = 3062) (P = 0.25). The estimated excess deaths (n = 67 540; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 35 431, 99 648) were similar to the predicted excess death (n = 64 570; 95% CI = 54 140, 75 000) by CBM with imputation. The total national estimate of excess deaths for all 713 districts was 794 989 (95% CI = 664 895, 925 082).
   Conclusions A CBM with imputation can be used to predict excess deaths in an appropriate context.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and symptoms develop gradually over many years. The current direction for medication development in AD is focused on neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress. Amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition activates microglia leading to neuro-inflammation and neurodegeneration induced by activation of COX-2 via NF kappa B p50 in glioblastoma cells.
   Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the concentration of COX-2 and NF kappa B p50 in serum of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and geriatric control (GC) and to establish a blood-based biomarker for early diagnosis and its therapeutic implications.
   Methods: Proteins and their mRNA level in blood of study groups were measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), respectively. The level of protein was further validated by western blot. The binding study of designed peptide against COX-2 by molecular docking was verified by SPR. The rescue of neurotoxicity by peptide was also checked by MTT assay on SH-SY5Y cells (neuroblastoma cell line).
   Results: Proteins and mRNA were highly expressed in AD and MCI compared to GC. However, COX-2 decreases with disease duration. The peptide showed binding affinity with COX-2 with low dissociation constant in SPR and rescued the neurotoxicity of SH-SY5Y cells by decreasing the level of A beta, tau, and pTau proteins.
   Conclusions: It can be concluded that COX-2 protein can serve as a potential blood-based biomarker for early detection and can be a good platform for therapeutic intervention for AD.

Stroke severity scales serve as reliable means to track a patient's neurological deficit, predict outcome, and guide treatment decisions in clinical practice. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was introduced over 30 years ago, marking a significant milestone in the field of stroke. Over the years, there have been notable advancements in acute stroke care. Despite several modifications made to NIHSS, none has yet succeeded in effectively capturing all the complex effects of a stroke. This review focuses on the pitfalls of NIHSS and emphasizes the need for a quick and comprehensive clinical and upgraded version of the stroke severity rating scale.

AB  - There is a growing awareness of the significance of using minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) in stroke research. An MCID is the smallest change in an outcome measure that is considered clinically meaningful. This review is the first to provide a comprehensive summary of various scales and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) used in stroke research and their MCID values reported in the literature, including a concise overview of the concept of and methods for determining MCIDs in stroke research. Despite the controversies and limitations surrounding the estimation of MCIDs, their importance in modern clinical trials cannot be overstated. Anchor-based and distribution-based methods are recommended for estimating MCIDs, with patient self-evaluation being a crucial component in capturing the patient's perspective on their health. A combination of methods can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical relevance of treatment effects, and incorporating the patient's perspective can enhance the care of stroke patients.

AB  - Background: In traumatic brain injuries (TBI), cerebral microdialysis (CMD)-derived parameters, especially the lactate to pyruvate ratio (LP ratio), have been utilized for cerebral perfusion optimization. The objectives were to identify cerebral ischemia as measured by CMD in TBI patients requiring decompressive craniectomy and to observe the correlation between cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), intracranial pressure (ICP), and CMD variables in these patients. Our secondary aim was to observe the effect of CPP augmentation on ischemia biomarkers. Methods: After the Institute Ethics Committee approvals, seven adult patients requiring decompressive craniectomy following TBI were enrolled and CMD data were obtained prospectively for 72 h. CPP was augmented by 20% with noradrenaline infusion if LP ratio >40. Correlations were done with bootstrapping (n = 500) to obtain the confidence intervals (CI) due to the small sample size. Results: One patient had cerebral ischemia (median LP ratio of 265.5 and median pyruvate of 38 mu mol/L), while another patient had non-ischemic mitochondrial dysfunction (median LP ratio 40.7 and median pyruvate 278.5). The coefficients of correlation between the LP ratio with CPP and ICP were r = -0.05 (CI = -0.14-0.03) and r = 0.09 (CI = -0.03-0.24), respectively. The coefficient of correlation between cerebral and blood glucose was r = 0.38, (CI - 0.35-0.14). Only two patients needed CPP augmentation, however, postaugmentation cerebral biochemistry did not change appreciably. Conclusion: CMD can identify cerebral ischemia, however, no correlations were observed between the LP ratio and CPP or ICP. CPP augmentation did not improve cerebral biochemistry. More studies are required to understand and treat cerebral metabolism in TBI.

AB  - Infantile central palsy (CP) is caused due to damage to the immature developing brain usually before birth, leading to altered topography and biochemical milieu. CP is a life-limiting disorder, which causes changes in sensory, motor, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. Understanding its pathophysiology is complex, and current therapeutic modalities, oral medication, surgical treatment, physical therapy, and rehabilitation provide minimal relief. As the brain is plastic, it has an inherent capacity to adapt to altered activity; thus, non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) strategies, like repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, which can modulate the neuronal activity and its function, may lead to recovery in CP patients. Further, in recent years, nanomedicine has shown a promising approach in pre-clinical studies for the treatment of central nervous system disorder because it can cross the blood-brain barrier, improve penetration, and provide sustained release of the drug. The review focuses on the principles and mechanisms of various NIBS techniques used in CP. We have also contemplated the effect of rehabilitation and nanomedicine in CP children, which will definitely lead to advancing our diagnostic as well as therapeutic abilities, in a vulnerable group of little ones.

AB  - Acinar cystic transformation (ACT) is a rare benign cystic lesion of the pancreas reported in elderly women. ACT can be easily confused with other cystic lesions of the pancreas, such as intraductal papillary neoplasm and serous and mucinous neoplasms, on imaging, especially when detected radiologically in a male patient as the index case. A preoperative histological examination can establish a diagnosis and avoid extensive surgical resection. We hereby report a case of ACT in a 69-year-old male patient that affected the body and tail region of the pancreas.

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic had large impacts on mental health; however, most existing evidence is focused on the initial lockdown period and high-income contexts. By assessing trajectories of mental health symptoms in India over 2 years, we aim to understand the effect of later time periods and pandemic characteristics on mental health in a lower-middle income context. Methods We used data from the Real-Time Insights of COVID-19 in India cohort study (N=3709). We used covariate-adjusted linear regression models with generalised estimating equations to assess associations between mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) score; range 0-12) and pandemic periods as well as pandemic characteristics (COVID-19 cases and deaths, government stringency, self-reported financial impact, COVID-19 infection in the household) and explored effect modification by age, gender and rural/urban residence. Results Mental health symptoms dropped immediately following the lockdown period but rose again during the delta and omicron waves. Associations between mental health and later pandemic stages were stronger for adults 45 years of age and older (p<0.001). PHQ-4 scores were significantly associated with all pandemic characteristics considered, including estimated COVID-19 deaths (PHQ-4 difference of 0.10 units; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.13), government stringency index (0.14 units; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.18), self-reported major financial impacts (1.20 units; 95% CI 1.09 to 1.32) and COVID-19 infection in the household (0.36 units; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.50). Conclusion While the lockdown period and associated financial stress had the largest mental health impacts on Indian adults, the effects of the pandemic on mental health persisted over time, especially among middle-aged and older adults. Results highlight the importance of investments in mental health supports and services to address the consequences of cyclical waves of infections and disease burden due to COVID-19 or other emerging pandemics.

AB  - Background: Treatment inertia, non-adherence and non-persistence to medical treatment contribute to poor blood pressure (BP) control worldwide. Fixed dose combination (FDC) antihypertensive medicines simplify prescribing patterns and improve adherence. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with prescribing FDC antihypertensive medicines and to understand if these factors differ among doctors worldwide. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online from June 2023 to January 2024 to recruit doctors. We collaborated with an international network of researchers and clinicians identified through institutional connections. A passive snowballing recruitment strategy was employed, where network members forwarded the survey link to their clinical colleagues. The survey instrument, developed through a literature review, interviews with academic and clinical researchers, and pilot testing, assessed participants perspectives on prescribing FDC antihypertensive medicines for hypertension. Participants rated their level of agreement (5-point Likert scale) with statements representing six barriers and four facilitators to FDC use. Findings: Data from 191 surveys were available for analysis. 25% (n = 47) of participants worked in high-income countries, 38% (n = 73) in upper-middle income, 25% (n = 48) in lower-middle income, 6% (n = 10) in low-income countries. Forty percent (n = 70) of participants were between 36-45 years of age; two thirds were male. Cost was reported as a barrier to prescribing FDC antihypertensive medicines [51% (n = 87) agreeing or strongly agreeing], followed by doctors' confidence in BP measured in clinic [40%, (n = 70)], access [37%, (n = 67)], appointment duration [35%, (n = 61)], concerns about side-effects [(21%, n = 37)], and non-adherence [12%, (n = 21)]. Facilitators to FDC antihypertensive polypills prescribing were clinician facing, such as access to educational supports [79%, (n = 143)], more BP measurement data [67%, (n = 120)], a clinical nudge in health records [61%, (n = 109)] and patient-facing including improved patient health literacy [49%, (n = 88)]. The levels of agreement and strong agreement across all barriers and facilitators were similar for participants working in higher or lower income countries. Across all countries, participants rated FDC antihypertensive medications highly valuable for managing patients with non-adherence, (82% reported high or very high value), for patients with high pill burden (80%). Interpretation: Cost and access were the most common barriers to prescribing FDCs across high- and low-income countries. While greater educational support for clinicians was perceived as the leading potential facilitator of FDC use, this seems unlikely to be effective without addressing access.

AB  - Background:The conventional drug regimen of sedation for patients requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU) is propofol or midazolam. Dexmedetomidine is a newer drug for sedation with a better clinical profile. We conducted this study to compare the sedative efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus propofol in patients after head and neck cancer surgeries requiring mechanical ventilation.Methods:After ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 80 patients undergoing head and neck onco-surgery were recruited. The patients were randomly allocated to group I [1 mg/kg of bolus propofol over 15 minutes followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/hour titrated by increasing or decreasing the infusion dose to Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) 2-4] or group II (a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 1 mcg/kg over 15 minutes followed by a maintenance dose of 0.4 mu g/kg/hour titrated to desired sedation level). The RSS, behavioral pain scale (BPS), heart rate, blood pressure, fentanyl consumption, additional sedative agent, extubation time, length of ICU stays, mechanical ventilation duration, side effects, and patient's satisfaction were noted.Results:Total fentanyl required was 0.56 +/- 0.13 mu g/kg/hour in group II and 0.58 +/- 0.18 mu g/kg/hour in group I (P = 0.75). Extubation time, RSS, BPS, patient satisfaction, and ICU duration were similar in both the groups. The incidence of hemodynamic-related adverse effects were 41.67% in group II and 11.11% in group I (P = 0.006).Conclusion:The fentanyl requirement was comparable in both the groups in the postoperative period. Dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased incidence of bradycardia and hypotension as compared to the propofol group. Propofol should be the preferred sedative for postoperative mechanical ventilation after head and neck onco-surgeries.

AB  - Background: In neurosurgical practice, continuous care after discharge and the ability to detect subtle indicators of clinical deterioration are mandatory to prevent the progression of a disease. The care of 'unknown' patients discharged to rehabilitation homes may not have this privilege, especially in resource-poor countries such as India.
   Objective: We have attempted to study the causes and outcomes of re-admissions of 'unknown' patients with previous traumatic brain injury (TBI) to estimate the quality of nursing care in our rehabilitation centers.
   Material and Methods: The electronic hospital records of all consecutive 'unknown' TBI patients with unplanned re-admissions at our institute from January 2014 to December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed for the factors determining the risk and outcomes of re-admission.
   Results: Out of 245 patients sent to rehabilitation homes at discharge, 47 patients (19.18%) were re-admitted. A total of 33 patients (70%) were re-admitted between 1 month and 1 year. Out of these, 38 patients (80.9%) were re-admitted because of preventable causes. Fifteen patients (31.9%) died during the hospital stay. The rest of the 32 (68%) patients were discharged after the management of the concerned condition with an average hospital stay of 9 +/- 11.1 days. The average Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at re-admission of the patients who died was 6 (range 3-11). Two patients were brought in the brain dead status, whereas 20 patients (42.6%) had a GCS of 5 or below at the time of re-admission. The risk of mortality among patients with non-preventable causes was 88.9% (8/9) compared to preventable causes 18.4% (7/38). However, preventable causes for re-admission are much more common, resulting in nearly a similar overall contribution to mortality.
   Conclusions: There is a high rate of mortality and morbidity in 'unknown' patients with TBI because of poor post-discharge care in developing countries. Because preventable causes are the major contributor to re-admissions, the re-admission rate is a good indicator of a lack of adequate rehabilitative services. The need for improving the post-discharge management of 'unknown' patients with TBI in resource-poor countries cannot be over-emphasized.

AB  - Background: Successful post -knee replacement rehabilitation requires adequate access to health information, social support, and periodic monitoring by a health professional. Mobile health (mHealth) and computer -based technologies are used for rehabilitation and remote monitoring. The extent of technology use and its function in post -knee replacement rehabilitation care in low and middle -income settings are unknown. Objective: To inform future mHealth intervention development, we conducted a scoping review to map the features and functionality of existing technologies and determine users' perspectives on telerehabilitation and technology for self -management. Methods: We followed the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. We searched the Embase, Medline, PsycINFO via OVID, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases for manuscripts published from 2001 onward. We included original research articles reporting the use of mobile or computer -based technologies by patients, health care providers, researchers, or family members. Studies were divided into the following 3 categories based on the purpose: validation studies, clinical evaluation, and end user feedback. We extracted general information on study design, technology features, proposed function, and perspectives of health care providers and patients. The protocol for this review is accessible in the Open Science Framework. Results: Of the 5960 articles, 158 that reported from high -income settings contributed to the qualitative summary (64 studies on mHealth or telerehabilitation programs, 28 validation studies, 38 studies describing users' perceptions). The highest numbers of studies were from Europe or the United Kingdom and North America regarding the use of a mobile app with or without wearables and reported mainly in the last decade. No studies were from low and middle -income settings. The primary functions of technology for remote rehabilitation were education to aid recovery and enable regular, appropriate exercises; monitoring progress of pain (n=19), activity (n=20), and exercise adherence (n=30); 1 or 2 -way communication with health care professionals to facilitate the continuum of care (n=51); and goal setting (n=23). Assessment of range of motion (n=16) and gait analysis (n=10) were the commonly validated technologies developed to incorporate into a future rehabilitation program. Few studies (n=14) reported end user involvement during the development stage. We summarized the reasons for satisfaction and dissatisfaction among users across various technologies. Conclusions: Several existing mobile and computer -based technologies facilitate post -knee replacement rehabilitation care for patients and health care providers. However, they are limited to high -income settings and may not be extrapolated to low-income settings. A systematic needs assessment of patients undergoing knee replacement and health care providers involved in rehabilitation, involving end users at all stages of development and evaluation, with clear reporting of the development and clinical evaluation can make post-knee replacement rehabilitation care in resource-poor settings accessible and cost-effective.

KW  - RESECTION
AB  - Introduction:
   Staging laparoscopy (SL) plays an important role in avoiding unnecessary non-therapeutic laparotomy in radiologically resectable hepatopancreaticobiliary (HPB) malignancy patients. The limitation of SL is to detect deep-seated malignancy. The addition of laparoscopic ultrasonography for identifying metastatic lesions or locally unresectable disease improves the diagnostic yield of SL.
   Patients and Methods:
   This prospective, observational study was conducted in a single unit of the tertiary care centre between 2017 and 2019. All the patients of HPB malignancy who were radiologically resectable underwent SL and laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasonography. Metastatic disease patients were either underwent palliative bypass procedures or abandoned depending on the condition of the patient. Patients who had resectable disease underwent standard surgical procedures.
   Results:
   Forty patients of HPB malignancy with potentially resectable on radiological imaging underwent SL and diagnostic ultrasonography. Out of 40, 21 patients had periampullary, 14 had carcinoma gallbladder and 5 patients had distal cholangiocarcinoma. Metastatic lesions were identified on laparoscopy in eight patients and the diagnostic yield of SL is 20%. Addition of laparoscopic ultrasonography identified one haemangioma which was false positive on laparoscopy and underwent the radical standard procedure. Four patients were unresectable so the procedure was abandoned and another three patients underwent a bypass procedure.
   Conclusion:
   Laparoscopic ultrasonography during SL can detect deep-seated metastatic lesions and decide the management in resectable disease.

AB  - Background: Currently, clinical assessment is the main tool for the evaluation of brachial plexus injury, complemented by electrophysiologic studies (EPS), and imaging studies whenever available. Imaging plays an important role as it enables the differentiation of pre-ganglionic and postganglionic injuries, and adds objectivity to presurgical evaluation.
   Objectives: The primary objective was to evaluate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution ultrasonography (USG) in the localization and characterization of brachial plexus injury in infants.
   Materials and Methods: In this prospective study, 34 infants with signs and symptoms of brachial plexus injury were evaluated by clinical examination, EPS, MRI, and USG. Imaging findings were correlated with intraoperative findings in infants who underwent surgical management. The association between EPS and MRI findings, and USG and MRI findings were assessed using Fisher's exact test. Semi-quantitative subjective analysis of various MRI sequences was done as well.
   Results: The most common findings of preganglionic injury and postganglionic injury, in our study, were pseudomeningocele and nerve thickening, respectively. MRI detection of injuries had a significant association with EPS findings. All MRI-detected injuries had a muscle power of grade 3 or less. muscle. Three-dimensional (3D) short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequence was found to be superior for detecting postganglionic injuries (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Imaging studies enable localization of the site of injury, determining the extent, and nature/morphology of injury. The gamut of findings obtained from MRI is far wider compared to that from USG. USG can be used as the first-line screening investigation.

AB  - Background Accurate assessment of gestational age (GA) and identification of preterm birth (PTB) at delivery is essential to guide appropriate post-natal clinical care. Undoubtedly, dating ultrasound sonography (USG) is the gold standard to ascertain GA, but is not accessible to the majority of pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in rural areas and small secondary care hospitals. Conventional methods of post-natal GA assessment are not reliable at delivery and are further compounded by a lack of trained personnel to conduct them. We aimed to develop a population-specific GA model using integrated clinical and biochemical variables measured at delivery. Methods We acquired metabolic profiles on paired neonatal heel prick (nHP) and umbilical cord blood (uCB) dried blood spot (DBS) samples (n = 1278). The master data set consists of 31 predictors from nHP and 24 from uCB after feature selection. These selected predictors including biochemical analytes, birth weight, and placental weight were considered for the development of population-specific GA estimation and birth outcome classification models using eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. Results The nHP and uCB full model revealed root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.82-1.18) and of 1.26 (95% CI = 0.88-1.32) to estimate the GA as compared to actual GA, respectively. In addition, these models correctly estimated 87.9 to 92.5% of the infants within +/- 2 weeks of the actual GA. The classification models also performed as the best fit to discriminate the PTB from term birth (TB) infants with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.84-0.94) for nHP and an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.85-0.95) for uCB. Conclusion The biochemical analytes along with clinical variables in the nHP and uCB data sets provide higher accuracy in predicting GA. These models also performed as the best fit to identify PTB infants at delivery.

AB  - Background and Aim
   Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the lethal malignancies worldwide characterized by poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as the key regulators in carcinogenesis and may act as noninvasive biomarkers in various malignancies including PDAC. The present study aimed to elucidate the role of miR-326, a known modulator of hedgehog (Hh) pathway in PDAC.
   Materials and Methods
   miR-326 circulating levels were assessed in 105 PDAC patients, 31 with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 36 healthy controls by quantitative Polymerase chain reaction. The expression of miR-326 and smoothened (SMO) was checked in surgical PDAC tissue. SMO protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in different groups. Finally, the role of miR-326 as a modulator of Hh pathway was assessed in vitro.
   Results
   Our results demonstrate that miR-326 is downregulated in both blood and tissue of PDAC patients as compared with controls. In contrast, the target gene/protein expression of SMO is upregulated in PDAC. Moreover, the tumor stromal expression of SMO was found to be clinically associated with lymph-node metastasis and vascular encasement in PDAC. Overexpression of miR-326 in Panc1 cell line was found to induce downregulation of SMO suggesting the tumor suppressor role of miR-326 in PDAC.
   Conclusions
   Taken together, miR-326 acts as a tumor suppressor in PDAC by modulating Hh pathway. It may be a promising target for the development of efficient drug therapies for the treatment of PDAC. Copyright (C) 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - HYPERTHERMIC INTRAPERITONEAL CHEMOTHERAPY
KW  - SURVIVAL
AB  - Background:Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary represent the most common sex-cord stromal tumors. Though characterized by an indolent course and a good five-year survival rate, they tend to have late recurrences and subsequent poorer survival. The role of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in women with recurrent granulosa cell tumors with peritoneal dissemination has not been well defined.Methods:All patients with adult or juvenile type granulosa cell tumors who underwent cytoreductive surgery with HIPEC with 70 mg/m2 of cisplatin for 60 minutes over a period of four years were retrospectively evaluated. We also performed a review of the literature on similar cases reported.Results:We identified eight patients with recurrent adult granulosa cell tumors (AGCT) who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The mean operative duration was 340 minutes, inclusive of the duration of HIPEC. Fifty percent of patients suffered from postoperative morbidity. Grade 4 morbidity was observed in one patient. At a median follow-up of 35 months, four patients experienced disease recurrence. The median disease-free survival was 10 months (range: 6-31 months) and the median overall survival was 11.5 months (range: 7-40 months).Conclusion:Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and HIPEC provides a unique opportunity for treating peritoneal dissemination in patients with recurrent ovarian AGCTs. This procedure is well tolerated with acceptable morbidity. Prospective studies are warranted to further elucidate the efficacy of this novel therapeutic approach in recurrent ovarian granulosa cell tumors.

KW  - PREVIA
AB  - Background. We assessed the efficacy and safety of management of morbidly adherent placenta by the transfundal uterine incision approach. As a secondary outcome measure, we compared ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the diagnosis of adherent placenta. Methods. We retrospectively analysed the records of 5 years of women with adherent placenta. Twenty-five women with an antenatal diagnosis of placenta increta and percreta operated by transfundal uterine incision were included. Blood loss, transfusion requirements, operative injuries, and maternal and neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) stay were compared among three different types of adherent placenta. Surgical and other outcome measures were also analysed. Results. On antenatal screening with ultrasound, an accurate diagnosis could be achieved in all cases of increta and two-thirds of percreta. Antenatal diagnosis by MRI detected 93.3% of increta and all percreta cases. The mean (SD) gestation at delivery was 34 (4.9) weeks in accreta, 34.9 (2.7) weeks in increta and 31 (4.8) weeks in percreta patients. The mean blood loss encountered intraoperatively was 1012.5 (193.1) ml, 1566.67 (566.52) ml and 1591.67 (629.61) ml in accreta, increta and percreta patients, respectively. Inadvertent bladder injury occurred in 3 women who had placenta percreta invading the bladder. There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. Conclusion. Transfundal incision for delivery of baby is associated with the advantage of avoiding the placenta thereby minimizing blood loss.

AB  - Cochlear implantation has become a standard of care for a child diagnosed with bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss with a structured surgical standard operating procedure. A 3-year-old boy with bilateral profound prelingual sensorineural deafness underwent a Med-EL Sonata Ti100 implant. We faced a peculiar situation intraoperatively after inserting the electrodes and closing the wound. The impedance recording indicated high ground path impedance with short-circuiting of few electrodes. As a bionic implant, its electronic components may at times malfunction both intraoperatively and/or postoperatively; therefore, neural response telemetry (NRT) was invented to check it. By using NRT and a few milliliters of normal saline, we were able to diagnose as well as rectify the malfunctioning of the implant.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) ranks number one among cancers affecting women globally. Serious concerns include delayed diagnosis, poor prognosis, and adverse side effects of conventional treatment, leading to residual morbidity. Therefore, an alternative treatment approach that is safe and effective has become the need of the hour. In this regard, plant-based medicines via a combination of conventional drugs are gaining increasing acceptance worldwide, playing a pivotal role in cancer management as proven by their efficacy evaluation studies. This review aims to fill the knowledge gaps by providing the preclinical evidence of cellular and molecular mechanisms of Indian phytomedicines in targeting varied pathways of breast cancer progression. A comprehensive search was performed on different platforms, followed by screening of relevant studies for review. In this article, the in-depth of various botanical drugs covering their nomenclature, dosage, toxicity, and modus operandi in BC cells have been extensively discussed. Various signaling pathways like Notch signaling, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, Wnt signaling, etc. regulated by herbal medicine treatment in BC are also highlighted to understand the drug mechanism better. This will guide the researchers to plan future strategies and generate more robust integrated evidence of plant-based drugs or botanical formulations for their potential role in the management of BC.

AB  - Kinematic parameter (KP) estimation from early electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is essential for positive augmentation using wearable robots. However, surface EEG-based early KP estimation studies are sparse in the literature. In this study, simultaneous surface EEG and kinematics data of five participants is collected during the biceps-curl motor task. The feasibility of early estimation of KPs is demonstrated using brain source imaging (BSI). Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is utilized for subband extraction from preprocessed EEG signals. Further, spherical and head harmonics domain features are extracted from subbands of the EEG signals. A deep-learning-based decoding model, BiCurNet, is proposed for early KP estimation using spatial and harmonics domain EEG features during the biceps-curl task. The proposed model utilizes lightweight architecture with depthwise separable convolution layers and a customized attention module (CAM). The best Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the estimated and actual trajectory of 0.7 is achieved when combined EEG features (spatial and harmonics domain) in the delta band are utilized. Intra- and intersubject performance analyses are performed to evaluate the subject-adaptability of the proposed decoding model. The performance of the proposed BiCurNet is compared with the existing multilinear regression (mLR) counterpart. The robustness of the proposed model is additionally illustrated using an ablation study. The robust performance and lightweight architecture will facilitate the real-time implementation of the model with deployment on a microcontroller to control BCI-based wearable robots.

AB  - Background: Cancer is growing concern for every country. Reliable data is a source to define the magnitude of the problem, which then helps to plan for necessary action. This epidemiological study involves the collection and analysis of hospital registry data to assess the quantum of the problem of cancer over a five-year period from 2012-16 and to plan priority action. Materials and Methods: Hospital-based data for five years from 2012-2016 was retrieved from the department of radiotherapy at M. P. Shah Government Medical College, Jamnagar, Gujarat, India, and analysed to define the magnitude of the problem. All data was studied using Microsoft Excel 2016. Results: A total of 7355 patients were registered between 2012 and 2016, out of which 62 percent were male. Cancers of the cervix and uterus were discernibly less common in the Saurashtra region and accounted for only 12.37% of all cancers in females. Lung cancer was the leading cancer as a single site in males (24.13% of all cancers in males) and breast cancer in females (37.36% of all cancers in females). Head and neck cancer, all sites clubbed, was most common in males (42%). Jamnagar taluka represented around 50% of all cases at the study center. Conclusion: Tobacco-related cancers were most common in the male population, and stringent implementation of a national tobacco control program is the most appropriate measure to curtail incidences and hence mortality in this male population. Non-modifiable risk factors like gender-related cancer were more common in the female population, and resource-appropriate screening is a suitable option for these diseases. A population-based cancer registry is required to further define the pattern pertinently, or an epidemiological study is required to find causes of the noticeably lower incidence of cancer of the cervix,.

AB  - Background: Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are the earliest preneoplastic lesions in human colon, identifiable on chromoendoscopic screening. Our objective was to evaluate the %methylation of APC, CDKN2A, MLH1, RASSF1, MGMT, and WIF1 tumor suppressor genes (TSG) in ACF, corresponding colorectal carcinomas (CRC), and normal colonic mucosal controls.<br /> Methods: In this study, macroscopically normal-appearing mucosal flaps were sampled 5-10 cm away from the tumor mass from 302 fresh colectomy specimens to identify ACF-like lesions. Thirty-five cases with multiple ACFs were selected (n 35) as the main study group, with corresponding sections from CRC (n 35) as disease controls, and mucosal tissue blocks from 20 colectomy specimens (normal controls), operated for non-neoplastic pathologies. Genomic DNA was extracted, and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on a customized methylation array model. %Methylation data were compared among the groups and with clinicopathological parameters. Selected target mRNA and protein expression studies were performed.<br /> Results: %Methylation of TSGs in ACF was intermediate between normal colon and CRC, although a statistically significant difference was observed only for the WIF1 gene (P < 0.01). Also, there was increased nuclear beta-catenin expression and upregulation of CD44-positive cancer-stem cells in ACF and CRCs than in controls. Right-sided ACFs and dysplastic ACFs had a higher %methylation of CDKN2A (P < 0.01), whereas hyperplastic ACFs had a higher %methylation of RASSF1 (P 0.04). The topographic characteristics of ACFs did not correlate with TSG %methylation.<br /> Conclusions: Early epigenetic methylation of WIF1 gene is one of the mechanisms for ACF development in human colon.

AB  - Background: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory autoimmune disease of the synovial joint with unknown etiology. In our previous study, we identified Alpha-Taxilin (alpha-Taxilin) as one of the upregulated proteins in RA and validated it in different biological samples such as tissue, synovial fluid, and blood cells. Here we further investigated its mechanistic role in RA pathophysiology. Methods: The alpha-Taxilin was validated in a larger cohort (n = 106) of RA plasma by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Interacting proteins were identified by co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, and in silico analyses were done to identify protein-protein interactions and involved pathways. The in vitro knockdown studies were performed on SW982 cells and Rheumatoid Arthritis Fibroblast-like Synoviocyte (RAFLS) to investigate the molecular mechanism of alpha-Taxilin involved in RA via Western Blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and confocal microscopy, which was further validated by in vivo studies via collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. Results: The plasma level of alpha-Taxilin was found to be significantly increased in plasma samples from patients with RA compared to osteoarthritis (OA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and healthy controls (HC). The alpha-Taxilin was found to be positively correlated with anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA) levels and DAS score in patients with RA. Seventeen interacting proteins were identified with alpha-Taxilin, and in silico study suggested that glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways are the most affected pathways regulated by alpha-Taxilin. The in vitro knockdown studies of alpha-Taxilin resulted in decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, p65, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and toll-like receptors (TLRs). It also improved macroscopic arthritic score, paw edema, and inflammation in CIA rats. Conclusion: alpha-Taxilin has been found to be associated with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. This may lead to a metabolic shift in synovial cells, ROS generation, and TLR activation. Therefore, alpha-Taxilin can be targeted for its diagnostic and therapeutic potential in RA along with other parameters.

AB  - A gap exists in published data on psychiatric emergencies presenting to Indian centers over the entire pandemic. We assessed 2,048 consecutive adult psychiatric emergencies for the period April 2019-September 2021 to compare 18 months following the onset of the pandemic, with the pre pandemic year as the control. Mean age was 33.8 +/- 13.6 years, with 55% females. The proportion with ICD-10 schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (18.9% vs 15.3%; P = 0.031), mood disorders (21.8% vs 18.1%; P = 0.038), and personality disorders (3.8% vs 2%; P = 0.018) showed a significant increase during a pandemic, while those with no diagnosable illness reduced (28.6% vs 34.3%; P = 0.006). Suicidality was the reason for referral in 43%, comparable to pre pandemic year. Those with stay >= 24 hours increased (14% vs 11%; P = 0.034). Benzodiazepines remained the commonly prescribed medication, but a notable rise was seen in mood stabilizer prescriptions.

AB  - Purpose: This consensus statement of Indian Brachytherapy Society (IBS) aims to generate practical and reproducible guidelines allowing for direct implementation in the Indian scenario. Material and methods: IBS board of directors appointed a panel of physicians with expertise in breast cancer and, in particular, breast brachytherapy, to develop a consensus statement. First, a literature review on breast brachytherapy was conducted, focusing on randomized trials, prospective studies, and multi-institutional series. Then, guidelines were drafted based on authors' consensus according to Indian scenario. Results: IBS advocate accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with brachytherapy following breast conservation surgery (BCS) for suitable groups of patients. Also, IBS recommends brachytherapy as the preferred technique for patients requiring tumor bed boost. Multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy (MIB) is suitable in most situations, except for a large tumor to breast ratio, and type 2 oncoplasty or higher performed. For best cosmesis, IBS recommends a minimum 3-week gap between chemotherapy and APBI. Conclusions: Brachytherapy continues to be an established technique for APBI as well as boost in appropriately selected patients with early breast cancer (EBC). As breast brachytherapy is an underutilized therapy in the Indian context, this article will hopefully encourage the readers to use its clinical potential in the suitable groups of patients.

AB  - Purpose: For cervical cancer patients, intra-cavitary brachytherapy (ICBT) is utilized with various dose-rate systems, such as low-dose-rate (LDR), high-dose-rate (HDR), and pulsed-dose-rate (PDR). This retrospective analysis aimed to compare the therapeutic outcomes of cervical cancer patients treated with either LDR-, HDR-, or PDR-ICBT. Material and methods: A total of 613 patients were treated with pelvic external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), followed by either LDR- (271 patients), HDR- (259 patients), or PDR- (83 patients) ICBT. Point-based planning was performed according to orthogonal radiographs in LDR patients, and computed tomography (CT) imaging in HDR and PDR patients. ICBT prescribed dose was as follows: for LDR treatment, 30 Gy in a single-session; for HDR: 7 Gy x 3 fractions (once a week fraction); and for PDR: 27 Gy in an hourly pulse of 70 cGy, with all the doses prescribed at point A. Radioactive source used was cesium-137 for LDR, and iridium-192 for HDR and PDR treatments. Results: Loco-regional control (LRC) rate was 74%, 75%, and 77% in LDR, HDR, and PDR groups, respectively (p p = 0.80). The 5-year overall survival (OS) in the three groups, i.e., LDR, HDR, and PDR was 63%, 64%, and 68%, respectively (p p = 0.77). Severe late toxicity (RTOG grade >= 3) rate in the three groups was comparable (LDR, 12%; HDR, 8%; and PDR, 8.9%, p = 0.36). Conclusions: Our study revealed comparable LRC, 5-year OS, and late toxicity rates using three dose-rate systems. Lower OS rates were observed in LDR group for stage III patients compared with patients in HDR and PDR groups. Therefore, we suggest that LDR should be used with caution while treating stage III patients.

AB  - Background:
   Abdominopelvic tuberculosis (TB) is a variant of extrapulmonary TB causing significant morbidity, including infertility.
   Materials and Methods:
   Results of 87 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of abdominopelvic TB diagnosed on composite reference standard (CRS) for demonstration of new laparoscopic white cotton ball sign are presented.
   Results:
   Mean age, parity and duration of infertility were 27.2 years, 0.21 and 3.1 years, respectively. Oligomenorrhoea and hypomenorrhea were seen in 35 (40.22%) and 32 (36.78%) cases, while infertility was seen in all 87 (100%) cases while abdominal mass was seen in 27 (31.03%) cases and pelvic mass in 37 (42.58%) cases. Positive acid fast bacilli on microscopy and culture of endometrial biopsy was seen in 3.34% and 6.89% cases while epithelioid granuloma was seen in 12.64% cases on endometrial biopsy and in 13.79% cases on peritoneal biopsy. Positive polymerase chain reaction was seen in all cases while definitive abdominal pelvic TB was seen in 35 (40.1%) cases and probable findings in 42 (48.27%) cases. A new laparoscopic white cotton ball sign (resembling a large white cotton ball) was observed in 5 (5.74%) cases and biopsy from 3 showed it to be epithelioid granulomas positive.
   Conclusion:
   Demonstration of a new white cotton ball sign on laparoscopy seems to be a useful finding in abdominal pelvic TB.

AB  - Background and Objective:Female genital tuberculosis (FGTB) is an important type of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) associated with morbidity especially infertility in developing countries. Laparoscopy may be difficult and hazardous in FGTB. The aim of the study was to observe the difficulties and complications of laparoscopy in FGTB cases.Materials and Methods:It was a prospective study over 12 years' period on 412 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy performed on FGTB cases with infertility. All patients underwent history taking and clinical examination and endometrial sampling for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) microscopy, culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gene Xpert (last 212 cases) and histopathological evidence of epithelioid granuloma. Another 412 cases of diagnostic laparoscopy in the absence of FGTB performed during same time were taken as controls from the pool of non-TB cases. Various difficulties and complications were noted in both groups and statistical analysis was done.Results:Mean age, parity, body mass index and duration of infertility were 26.8 versus 25.4 years, 0.32 versus 0.28, 23.15 versus 25.28 Kg/m2 and 4.15 versus 5.12 years, respectively. Primary and secondary infertility was seen in 78.6% and 20.38% of cases in the study group and 74.75% and 25.24% in the control group, respectively. Endometrial biopsy showed AFB microscopy in 5.3%, culture in 6.3%, epithelioid granuloma in 15.77% and on peritoneal biopsy granuloma in 6.55%, positive PCR in 368 (89.32%) and positive gene Xpert in 38 out of 212 (17.92%, out of last 212 cases). Definite findings of FGTB were seen in 171 (41.50%) cases. Probable findings of FGTB were seen in 241 (58.49%) cases. Various complications were difficulty in the creation of pneumoperitoneum or insertion of trocar and cannula in 16.74% and 13.10% of cases as compared to 1.94% and 1.69% in the control group. Excessive bleeding was seen in 5.09% versus 0.97% cases, respectively.

AB  - Rathke's Cleft Cysts (RCCs) and Craniopharyngiomas (CPs) may represent disease entities on the same etio-pathological spectrum. We report the case of a 36-year-old female presenting with vision loss and menstrual irregularities, imaging shows a predominantly cystic lesion in the sellar region with suprasellar extension. She underwent a microscopic transnasal resection of the lesion. She later presented with recurrent symptoms and increased residual lesion size on imaging, a transcranial excision of the lesion was performed. Histopathology from the initial operative specimen revealed RCC with squamous metaplasia which was BRAF negative, while the specimen from the second surgery revealed BRAF positive papillary stratified squamous architecture suggestive of Papillary CP. This case adds to the evidence that both RCCs and papillary CPs may be the spectrum of the same disease. Further, papillary CPs may be an evolution from the RCCs.

AB  - The United Nations Organizations observe various global public health days (GPHDs) (also known as world days) throughout the year. We aimed to assess the impact of GPSDs on online health information-seeking behavior related to substance use in the Indian context. We used the Google Trends data for this study using standard guidelines. We conducted a topic search for the query "Substance abuse" to capture online information-seeking behavior (OHISB) for substance use disorder-related searches. The data were analyzed using the Joinpoint Regression software. Joinpoint regression model analysis was conducted to determine the statistically significant daily percent change (DPC) in the RSV trend. We found that there were significant changes in OHISB for substance use-related disorders on the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking over the last five years. The increase in the pattern of online search for substance use-related information was not observed around the World No Tobacco Day, World Mental Health Day, and World Suicide Prevention Day. Since most of these world health days are likely to continue to be observed in the coming years, it is important to regularly assess their impact as well as make the necessary modifications to make them more effective in achieving the desired objectives.

AB  - Airwriting recognition is a task that involves identifying letters written in free space using finger movement. It is a special case of gesture recognition, where gestures correspond to letters in a specific language. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a noninvasive technique for recording brain activity and has been widely used in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. Leveraging EEG signals for airwriting recognition offers a promising alternative input method for human-computer interaction. One key advantage of airwriting recognition is that users do not need to learn new gestures. By concatenating recognized letters, a wide range of words can be formed, making it applicable to a broader population. However, there has been limited research in the recognition of airwriting using EEG signals, which forms the core focus of this study. The NeuroAiR dataset comprising EEG signals recorded during writing English uppercase alphabets is first constructed. Various features are then explored in conjunction with different deep learning models to achieve accurate airwriting recognition. These features include processed EEG data, independent component analysis (ICA) components, source-domain-based scout time series, and spherical and head harmonic decomposition (HHD)-based features. Furthermore, the impact of different EEG frequency bands on system performance is comprehensively investigated. The highest accuracy achieved in this study is 44.04% using ICA components and the EEGNet classification model. The results highlight the potential of EEG-based airwriting recognition as a user-friendly modality for alternative input methods in human-computer interaction applications. This research sets a strong baseline for future advancements and demonstrates the viability and utility of EEG-based airwriting recognition.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders, which affect millions worldwide, are marked by a steady decline of neurons that are selectively susceptible. Due to the complex pathological processes underlying neurodegeneration, at present, there is no viable therapy available for neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, the establishment of a novel therapeutic approach for such conditions is a clinical void that remains. The potential significance of various peptides as neuroprotective interventions for neurodegenerative disorders is gaining increasing attention. In the past few years, there has been growing scientific interest in glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists due to their claimed neuroprotective effects. Exendin-4 is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that is known to possess anti-diabetic effects and does not degrade for hours, making it a superior candidate for such disorders. Moreov(e)r, exendin-4's neuroprotective effects have been reported in several preclinical studies. Exendin-4's diverse therapeutic targets suggest its potential therapeutic uses in neurodegenerative ailments like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease and have garnered an increasing amount of attention. Given the substantial body of evidence supporting the neuroprotective potential of exendin-4 in various research models, this article is dedicated to exploring the promising role of exendin-4 as a therapeutic agent for the treatment and management of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This review draws insights from the findings of numerous preclinical and clinical studies to highlight the collective neuroprotective advantages of exendin-4 and the potential mechanisms that underlie its neuroprotective effects.

AB  - Toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) is an acute, sterile, postoperative inflammatory reaction of the anterior segment without vitreous involvement, following an uncomplicated and uneventful ocular surgery, having broad and multiple etiologies. The symptoms of decreased visual acuity and ocular discomfort generally occur within the first 12-48 h after intraocular surgery. The clinical signs include prominent limbus-to-limbus corneal edema, anterior chamber cells, aqueous flare, fibrinous inflammation, and/or keratic precipitates. There can be sight-threatening complications of TASS, such as permanent corneal decompensation, intractable glaucoma, and cystoid macular edema. The causes of TASS are emerging and being reported, so are the newer treatment options for managing the inflammation and its complications. Prevention guidelines for TASS are being updated, and a traceability system for surgical instruments and intraocular fluids used during the surgery is being perpetually developed. It is important to recognize TASS and start treatment on an immediate effect. Hereby, we review the literature on TASS, emphasizing its etiology, pathophysiology, management, prognosis, complications, and the importance of prevention as well as prompt recognition.

AB  - Importance Metastases to the submandibular gland (SMG) from oral cavity primaries are very rare. Hence, a gland-preserving level IB dissection technique is a feasible option without compromising the lymph node yield (LNY). Objective To assess the feasibility and noninferiority of the SMG-preserving dissection technique to the conventional en bloc removal of level IB in terms of LNY in patients with cN0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) undergoing elective neck dissection. Design Parallel-design, single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial. Setting Tertiary care health care center-Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, AIIMS Rishikesh. Participants Thirty-eight (n = 38) participants with 46 (n = 46) neck dissection specimens of OSCC were randomly allocated (1:1) into gland-preserving (n(1) = 23) and en bloc (n(2) = 23) dissection groups. Intervention Elective neck dissection comparing SMG-sparing level IB dissection technique versus en bloc level IB dissection. Main Outcome Measures LNY, lymph node density, and level IB operative time in both groups were compared between groups (alpha < .05). Results Median LNY (P = .543) and lymph node density (P = 1.000) in level IB did not show significant differences between the groups. LNY in level IB by gland-preserving technique is also not inferior to the conventional en bloc dissection technique (mean difference = 0.217; 95% CI: [-0.597, 1.032]; P = .593). The mean level IB operative time is significantly longer in the gland-preserving group (P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance None of the examined SMGs were involved by the tumor. SMG-preserving technique is noninferior to the traditional technique of level IB clearance and can be used in elective neck dissections without compromising the LNY. Functional neck dissection has greatly evolved to decrease patient morbidity, and this method can be adopted in case-specific situations. Trial registration The trial was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2022/05/042344) on May 2, 2023, https://ctri.nic.in/.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this matched-pair cohort study was to evaluate the potential of intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) for sparring of the pelvic bone marrow and thus reduction of hematotoxicity compared to intensity-modulated photon radiotherapy (IMRT) in the setting of postoperative irradiation of gynaecological malignancies. Secondary endpoint was the assessment of predictive parameters for the occurrence of sacral insufficiency fractures (SIF) when applying IMPT. Materials and Methods: Two cohorts were analyzed consisting of 25 patients each. Patients were treated with IMPT compared with IMRT and had uterine cervical (n = 8) or endometrial cancer (n = 17). Dose prescription, patient age, and diagnosis were matched. Dosimetric parameters delivered to the whole pelvic skeleton and subsites (ilium, lumbosacral, sacral, and lower pelvis) and hematological toxicity were evaluated. MRI follow-up for evaluation of SIF was only available for the IMPT group. Results: In the IMPT group, integral dose to the pelvic skeleton was significantly lower (23.4GyRBE vs 34.3Gy; p < 0.001), the average V-5Gy, V-10Gy, and V-20Gy were reduced by 40%, 41%, and 28%, respectively, compared to the IMRT group (p < 0.001). In particular, for subsites ilium and lower pelvis, the low dose volume was significantly lower. Hematotoxicity was significantly more common in the IMRT group (80% vs 32%; p = 0009), especially hematotoxicity >= CTCAE II (36% vs 8%; p = 0.037). No patient in the IMPT group experienced hematotoxicity > CTCAE II. In the IMPT cohort, 32% of patients experienced SIF. Overall SIF occurred more frequently with a total dose of 50.4 GyRBE (37.5%) compared to 45 GyRBE (22%). No significant predictive dose parameters regarding SIF could be detected aside from a trend regarding V50Gy to the lumbosacral subsite. Conclusion: Low-dose exposure to the pelvic skeleton and thus hematotoxicity can be significantly reduced by using IMPT compared to a matched photon cohort. Sacral insufficiency fracture rates appear similar to reported rates for IMRT in the literature.

AB  - The gut microbiome (GM) has been identified as a crucial factor in the development and progression of various diseases, including cancer. In the case of prostate cancer, commensal bacteria and other microbes are found to be associated with its development. Recent studies have demonstrated that the human GM, including Bacteroides , Streptococcus , Bacteroides massiliensis , Faecalibacterium prausnitzii , Eubacterium rectale , and Mycoplasma genitalium , are involved in prostate cancer development through both direct and indirect interactions. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these interactions are yet to be fully understood. Moreover, the microbiota influences systemic hormone levels and contributes to prostate cancer pathogenesis. Currently, it has been shown that supplementation of prebiotics or probiotics can modify the composition of GM and prevent the onset of prostate cancer. The microbiota can also affect drug metabolism and toxicity, which may improve the response to cancer treatment. The composition of the microbiome is crucial for therapeutic efficacy and a potential target for modulating treatment response. However, their clinical application is still limited. Additionally, GM -based cancer therapies face limitations due to the complexity and diversity of microbial composition, and the lack of standardized protocols for manipulating gut microbiota, such as optimal probiotic selection, treatment duration, and administration timing, hindering widespread use. Therefore, this review provides a comprehensive exploration of the GM's involvement in prostate cancer pathogenesis. We delve into the underlying mechanisms and discuss their potential implications for both therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in managing prostate cancer. Through this analysis, we offer valuable insights into the pivotal role of the microbiome in prostate cancer and its promising application in future clinical settings.

AB  - We present a case involving a 9-year-old boy diagnosed with metastatic carotid body paraganglioma. The metastases were detected in cervical lymph nodes and lungs using Ga-68-DOTANOC PET/CT imaging. The patient received peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with Lu-177-DOTATATE. Following 3 treatment cycles, a significant improvement was observed in the metastatic lesions. After 4 cycles, the patient achieved a complete response, with a cumulative administered activity of 16.65 GBq during the therapy. This case underscores the effectiveness of using Lu-177-DOTATATE in managing metastatic carotid body paraganglioma, offering promising results in terms of tumor regression and overall therapeutic response.

AB  - Background: Despite the possible clinical benefit of high intraoperative oxygen therapy on surgical site infection, the effect on postoperative respiratory function is debatable. However, it remains yet to be elucidated whether hyperoxia due to a high fraction of inspired oxygen used in conjunction with lung protective ventilation can lead to increased incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. Methods: In this noninferiority randomized trial, an intraoperative high fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.8 (group H) was compared to a standard fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3 to 0.4 (group S) in adult patients undergoing major elective or emergency surgery. A lung protective ventilation strategy was employed in all patients, including volume control ventilation with a tidal volume of 6 to 8 mL/kg of predicted body weight, respiratory rate of 12 beats per minute, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 to 8 cm H2O. Postoperative pulmonary complications were assessed on postoperative days 3 and 5 by the Melbourne group scale. Results: In this trial, n = 226 patients were randomized; among them, 130 patients underwent routine surgery, and 96 patients underwent emergency surgery. The median (interquartile range) of the pa-tients was 48 (35-58) years, and 47.3% were female. Melbourne group scale scores at postoperative day 3 (median [interquartile range] 2 [1-4] in group S vs 2 [1-3] in group H; the difference in median [95% confidence interval] 0 [0,-1]; P = .13) and day 5 (median [interquartile range] 1 (0-3) in group S vs 1 [0-3] in group H; the difference in median [95% confidence interval] 0 [0, 0.5]; P =.34) were statistically similar in both the groups and the upper margin was within the predefined margin of 1. Incidence of surgical site infection (P = .46), postoperative hospital stay (P = .29), and days alive without antibiotic therapy at postoperative day 28 (P =.95) were similar in both groups. Conclusion: High intraoperative fiO2 was noninferior to standard fiO2 in postoperative pulmonary complications in adult patients undergoing major surgery. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Urinary small extracellular vesicles or exosomes (uEVs) source could be an emerging trove of biomarkers in coronary artery disease (CAD). It is a chronic inflammatory disease having a long asymptomatic phase of fatty-fibrous development in arteries leading to angina, myocardial infarction, and death. Our study was aimed at identifying differential protein expression profiling of uEVs in CAD. We collected urine samples of CAD patients (n = 41) age 18-65 years and gender matched healthy controls (n = 41). We isolated uEVs using differential ultracentrifugation. Further, uEV samples were characterized by western blotting exosome markers (Flotillin, TSG, CD63, and CD9), nano tracking analysis, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy. A total of 508 proteins were identified by iTRAQ-based mass spectrometry. We observed protein expression levels of AZGP1, SEMG1/2, ORM1, IGL, SERPINA5, HSPG2, prosaposin, gelsolin, and CD59 were upregulated, and UMOD, KNG1, AMBP, prothrombin, and TF were downregulated. Protein-protein interactions, gene ontology and pathway analysis were performed to functionally annotate identified uEVs proteins. A novel uEVs differential protein signature is shown. On validating UMOD protein by ELISA in two clinically different CAD, stable-CAD patients had lower levels than healthy controls whereas recent myocardial infarction patients had lowest. Our findings suggest UMOD importance as early diagnostic biomarker. Significance: Coronary artery disease is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by gradual deposition of choles-terol and fat along with other proteins to develop plaque inside arteries. This further leads to blockage of artery, heart attack and death. There are no identifiable early biomarkers to diagnose this. For the first time, we have identified the differentially expressed proteins isolated from non-invasive uEV of CAD patients compared to healthy controls by using MS Orbitrap and iTRAQ labelling of peptides. We have identified decreased levels of UMOD protein in CAD. These findings have been confirmed by ELISA. Furthermore, the levels of UMOD were observed as more highly decreased in recent myocardial infarction CAD patients, indicating the importance of this protein as an early diagnostic biomarker. Conclusively, our study represents a non-invasive urinary EVs trove of differentially expressed proteins in CAD. This will form a groundwork for understanding the pathophysiology of CAD and will help in future translational research utilizing uEVs.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the proportion of EEG recordings yielding diagnostic findings leading to a change in diagnosis beyond a 20 -minute recording window, striking a balance between diagnostic yield and clinical practicability. Methods: At a tertiary care teaching hospital in North India, 225 subjects aged 1 month to 18 years undergoing outpatient EEG were enrolled. Patients with epileptic encephalopathies, nonepileptic phenomena, and breakthrough seizures in the last 24 hours were excluded. Two recording protocols were employed: Category A (n=163, awake recording with activation procedures for 15 minutes followed by an attempt at sleep for 60 minutes) and Category B (n=62, sleep recording for 55 minutes followed by 5 minutes of awake recording for younger children and those with impaired cognition). EEGs were prospectively reported at 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 -minute time points, with no retrospective changes allowed. Results: Among abnormal EEGs, the final diagnosis was changed beyond 20 minutes in 38.9% and 20.4% in categories A and B, respectively. A significant change in the final diagnosis among abnormal EEGs beyond 20 minutes was seen in - those who achieved sleep compared to those who didn't (45% versus 19%, p=0.03) in category A, and - focal compared to generalised seizures (Category A: 26.1% versus 8.3%, p=0.01; Category B: 23.8% versus 0%, p=0.02). Conclusion: Forty minutes of awake EEGs with/without sleep and 30 minutes of sleep EEGs achieve a final diagnosis in nearly 90%. Prolonging awake records beyond 20 minutes, incorporating sleep, is particularly beneficial in focal epilepsies.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesNotifying blood donors of their reactive status for transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) plays a vital role in enabling early diagnosis and management while also preventing these donors from making future donation and transmission of the infectious agent. Given the limited data on donor notification processes in India, a narrative review was conducted to assess the existing notification process and identify areas requiring enhancement.Materials and MethodsWe conducted literature searches using PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus, employing various keywords. The review included data on the year of the study, study design, donor numbers, TTI screening methods, sero-reactive donor confirmation, notification frequency and methods, donor responses, post-test counselling and risk factor assessment.ResultsOut of the 29 identified articles, 16 studies were included in the analysis. Repeat testing for initially reactive results was conducted in nine studies for 24.3% reactive donors. Phone calls were the primary notification method in most studies (8; 50%), with letters sent in cases of no response. Only 12 studies provided data on notified donors, revealing a notification rate of 71.2%. Of all initially reactive donors, 33.3% sought post-test counselling. Data from six studies indicated that 74.3% of responsive donors had identifiable TTI risk factors.ConclusionOur review revealed significant variability in the notification processes across different studies. To enhance the management of TTI-reactive donor notifications and responses, we recommend the establishment of universal protocols encompassing pre-donation counselling, repeat/confirmatory testing, notification methods and comprehensive follow-up and treatment.

AB  - Although over 90 independent risk variants have been identified for Parkinson's disease using genome-wide association studies, most studies have been performed in just one population at a time. Here we performed a large-scale multi-ancestry meta-analysis of Parkinson's disease with 49,049 cases, 18,785 proxy cases and 2,458,063 controls including individuals of European, East Asian, Latin American and African ancestry. In a meta-analysis, we identified 78 independent genome-wide significant loci, including 12 potentially novel loci (MTF2, PIK3CA, ADD1, SYBU, IRS2, USP8, PIGL, FASN, MYLK2, USP25, EP300 and PPP6R2) and fine-mapped 6 putative causal variants at 6 known PD loci. By combining our results with publicly available eQTL data, we identified 25 putative risk genes in these novel loci whose expression is associated with PD risk. This work lays the groundwork for future efforts aimed at identifying PD loci in non-European populations.
   Multi-ancestry genome-wide association analyses identify new risk loci for Parkinson's disease, and fine-mapping and co-localization analyses implicate candidate genes whose expression is associated with disease susceptibility.

AB  - Background: There exists a lacuna in the structured reporting of swallowing dysfunction and quality of life (QoL) outcome following major glossectomy.Methods: Prospective cohort study to assess the swallowing dysfunction and QoL following STG (subtotal glossectomy) or NTG (near total glossectomy) over a 6-month period using FEES and PAS scale, MDADI, and FACT-HN.Results: Twenty-four patients were available for analysis. The pre- and post-adjuvant evaluation revealed a statistically significant improvement in the composite MDADI and FACT-HN scores. Subscale analysis of FACT-HN scores revealed maximum deficit in the head and neck cancer-specific score domain followed by functional domain and social well-being domain, with serial improvement noted in the post-adjuvant setting.Conclusion: This study showed serial improvement in terms of swallowing dysfunction although social and functional well-being domains related to QoL continued to reveal major deficits. Better outcomes were seen with preservation of bilateral base of tongue and mandible.

AB  - Introduction: Emicizumab is the initial subcutaneously administered bispecific antibody approved as a prophylactic treatment for patients with haemophilia A (PwHA).Aim: This study assessed the economic evaluation of emicizumab treatment for non-inhibitor severe haemophilia A (HA) patients in India.Methods: A Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of emicizumab prophylaxis compared to on-demand therapy (ODT), low-dose prophylaxis (LDP; 1565 IU/kg/year), intermediate-dose prophylaxis (IDP; 3915 IU/kg/year) and high-dose prophylaxis (HDP; 7125 IU/kg/year) for HA patients without factor VIII inhibitors. Inputs from HAVEN-1 and HAVEN-3 trials included transition probabilities of different bleeding types. Costs and benefits were discounted at a 3.5% annual rate.Results: In the base-case analysis, emicizumab was cost-effective compared to HDP, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of Indian rupees (INR) 27,869. Compared to IDP, ODT and LDP, emicizumab prophylaxis could be considered a cost-effective option if the paying threshold is >1 per capita gross domestic product (GDP) with ICER/QALY values of INR 264,592, INR 255,876 and INR 305,398, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis (OWSA) highlighted emicizumab cost as the parameter with the greatest impact on ICERs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) indicated that emicizumab had a 94.7% and 49.4% probability of being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of three and two-times per capita GDP.Conclusion: Emicizumab prophylaxis is cost-effective compared to HDP and provides value for money compared to ODT, IDP, and LDP for severe non-inhibitor PwHA in India. Its long-term humanistic, clinical and economic benefits outweigh alternative options, making it a valuable choice in resource-constrained settings.

AB  - The review centers on the scientific evidence underlying obesity, providing a detailed examination of the role of perilipin in this condition. It explores potential causes of obesity and delves into therapeutic approaches involving exercise, yoga, and herbal treatments. The paper discusses natural sources that can contribute to combating obesity and underscores the importance of exercise in a scientific context for overcoming obesity. Additionally, it includes information on herbal ingredients that aid in reducing obesity. The review also examines the impact of exercise type and intensity at various time intervals on muscle development. It elucidates triglyceride hydrolysis through different enzymes and the deposition of fatty acids in adipose tissue. The mechanisms by which alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 5 (ABHD5) and hormonesensitive lipase (HSL) target and activate their functions are detailed. The inflammatory response in obesity is explored, encompassing inflammatory markers, lipid storage diseases, and their classification with molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, the hormonal regulation of lipolysis is elaborated upon in the review.

TI  - Generation and characterization of two human iPSC lines, IGIBi014-A and IGIBi015-A, from Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) patients with pathogenic (GAA/TTC)n repeat expansion in first intron of the<i> Frataxin</i> (FXN) gene
T2  - STEM CELL RESEARCH
AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder caused by over expansion of GAA repeats in the first intron of FXN gene. Here, we generated two iPSC lines from FRDA patients with biallelic expansion of GAA repeats in the first intron of FXN gene. IGIBi014-A and IGIBi015-A both iPSC lines demonstrated characteristics of pluripotency, normal karyotypes (46, XY), the capacity to differentiate into all three germ layers, and the ability to sustain the GAA repeat expansion with decreased FXN mRNA expression. These cell lines will be utilized to comprehend the pathophysiology of the illness and the FRDA's predictive phenotypes.

AB  - Despite great efforts, intestinal protozoan infections remain a significant healthcare concern worldwide. Although many point-of-care (POC) tests are increasingly being used, microscopic examination of stool specimens remains the mainstay for their diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. We assessed the utility of rapid POC tests based on immunochromatography among patients from rural Northern India. A total of 78 patients were enrolled in the study. Out of nine specimens that tested positive for Giardia duodenalis on microscopy, an immunochromatographic test (ICT) could detect only five (55.55%). Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was demonstrated in two specimens on microscopy, both of which were missed by ICT. Its overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value were 50%, 98.5%, 83.3%, and 93%, respectively. Its performance was considered unsatisfactory. Although ICT-based tests provide a relatively rapid and less labor-intensive alternative, they should be used to supplement and not replace stool microscopy.

AB  - Importance Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis (PBKC) is a chronic, sight-threatening inflammatory ocular surface disease. Due to the lack of unified terminology and diagnostic criteria, nonspecific symptoms and signs, and the challenge of differentiation from similar ocular surface disorders, PBKC may be frequently unrecognized or diagnosed late.Objective To establish a consensus on the nomenclature, definition, and diagnostic criteria of PBKC.Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study used expert panel and agreement applying the non-RAND modified Delphi method and open discussions to identify unified nomenclature, definition, and definitive diagnostic criteria for PBKC. The study was conducted between September 1, 2021, and August 14, 2022. Consensus activities were carried out through electronic surveys via email and online virtual meetings.Results Of 16 expert international panelists (pediatric ophthalmologists or cornea and external diseases specialists) chosen by specific inclusion criteria, including their contribution to scientific leadership and research in PBKC, 14 (87.5%) participated in the consensus. The name proposed was "pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis," and the agreed-on definition was "Pediatric blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is a frequently underdiagnosed, sight-threatening, chronic, and recurrent inflammatory eyelid margin disease associated with ocular surface involvement affecting children and adolescents. Its clinical spectrum includes chronic blepharitis, meibomitis, conjunctivitis, and corneal involvement ranging from superficial punctate keratitis to corneal infiltrates with vascularization and scarring." The diagnostic criteria included 1 or more suggestive symptoms accompanied by clinical signs from 3 anatomical regions: the eyelid margin, conjunctiva, and cornea. For PBKC suspect, the same criteria were included except for corneal involvement.Conclusions and Relevance The agreements on the name, definition, and proposed diagnostic criteria of PBKC may help ophthalmologists avoid diagnostic confusion and recognize the disease early to establish adequate therapy and avoid sight-threatening complications. The diagnostic criteria rely on published evidence, analysis of simulated clinical cases, and the expert panel's clinical experience, requiring further validation with real patient data analysis.

AB  - Pulmonary and extrapulmonary acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening respiratory failure associated with high mortality. Despite progress in our understanding of the pathological mechanism causing the crippling illness, there are currently no targeted pharmaceutical treatments available for it. Recent discoveries have emphasized the existence of a potential nexus between gut and lung health fueling novel approaches including probiotics for the treatment of ARDS. We thus investigated the prophylactic-potential of Lactobacillus rhamnosus-(LR) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary and cecal ligation puncture (CLP) induced extrapulmonary ARDS mice. Our in-vivo findings revealed that pretreatment with LR significantly ameliorated vascular-permeability (edema) of the lungs via modulating the neutrophils along with significantly reducing the expression of inflammatory-cytokines in the BALF, lungs and serum in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary mice-models. Interestingly, our ex-vivo immunofluorescence and flow cytometric data suggested that mechanistically LR via short chain fatty acids (butyrate being the most potent and efficient in ameliorating the pathophysiology of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary ARDS) targets the phagocytic and neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) releasing potential of neutrophils. Moreover, our in-vivo data further corroborated our ex-vivo findings and suggested that butyrate exhibits enhanced potential in ameliorating the pathophysiology of ARDS via reducing the infiltration of neutrophils into the lungs. Altogether, our study establishes the prophylactic role of LR and its associated metabolites in the prevention and management of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary ARDS via targeting neutrophils.

AB  - Aim: To assess the safety and effectiveness of daratumumab monotherapy in Indian patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. Methods: In this prospective, multicenter, phase IV study, patients (aged >= 18 years) received intravenous daratumumab (16 mg/kg) in six cycles. Safety was the primary end point. Results: Of the 139 patients included, 121 (87.1%) experienced >= 1 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs; 53 [38.1%] drug-related), 32 (23%) had >= 1 serious TEAEs (five [3.6%] drug-related) and 16 (11.5%) deaths were reported (one death [0.7%] was drug-related). Overall response rate was 26.3%; 62.7% of patients had stable disease. Median time to first response and median progression-free survival were 5.2 and 5.9 months, respectively. Functional status and well-being were improved. Conclusion: Daratumumab showed an acceptable and expected safety profile with consistent efficacy, providing a novel therapeutic option for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma management in India.
   Daratumumab is a monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). This study evaluated the outcome of daratumumab single therapy in Indian patients who were not cured with other drugs used for the same disease. 139 adult patients were included in this study from 15 institutes across India. Daratumumab (16 mg/kg) was diluted with 500 or 1000 ml of saline solution and given slowly through the intravenous route 16-times within 6 months. The study examined whether the safety profile and benefits of daratumumab reported in Indian patients were similar to those reported in the RRMM populations of other countries. The study found that most of the adverse events were not severe and could be easily treated by the study physician. 16 patients died (one might have been due to daratumumab treatment). Daratumumab treatment provided life support and recovery benefits to many patients. Daratumumab single therapy provides an appropriate and acceptable safety profile with no new adverse events and consistent benefits in RRMM patients.Clinical Trial Registration: NCT03768960 (ClinicalTrials.gov), CTRI/2019/06/019546.
   This study demonstrated an acceptable and expected safety profile with consistent efficacy for daratumumab monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, providing a novel therapeutic option for myeloma management in India.

AB  - IntroductionOrthopaedic surgeons are among the most frequent users of radiation and are often exposed to X-Ray radiation regularly. There is an overall unsatisfactory level of knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the same among surgeons. This study aimed to assess the practices among orthopaedic surgeons regarding radiation and its hazards in India.MethodologyThis questionnaire-based survey was conducted between March and September 2022. The questionnaire broadly assessed the knowledge, awareness, and practices among orthopaedic surgeons regularly exposed to X-ray radiation. The questionnaire consisted of objective and Likert scale questions which were distributed to the respondents electronically using publicly available contact information. A qualitative review of interpretations obtained from the responses and available evidence in the literature was then performed.ResultsThe response rate for the survey was 36.4%. 65.9% reported using trunk protection all the time during procedures. 57.1% of respondents reported not using thyroid protection during procedures. 92.3% reported not using protective goggles and 100% did not use appropriate gloves. 76.9% were not issued dosimeters, and only 5.5% of those who had been issued one wore it during radiation procedures. 58.2% reported having a dedicated employee to operate the machine. 86.8% of respondents did not have formal training and 81.3% were not aware of institutes offering formal training.ConclusionThere is very high compliance with the use of protection aprons among the respondents however, the use of other apparel like thyroid shields, protection goggles and gloves was poor. The awareness regarding radiation exposure was also poor as most respondents were not issued dosimeters, however, those issued with one were well aware of their exposure. It is imperative to prioritize both surgeons' and patients' safety where radiation exposure is concerned.

AB  - Introduction: The use of Ti6Al4V for orthopedic implants though widely accepted, is 10X stiffer than bone, that leads to stress shielding and aseptic loosening. Further, oral delivery demands significantly large dosage of drugs. To address these twin challenges, we have fabricated open cell porous scaffolds capable of sustained dual drug delivery. Drug delivery from open cell porous Ti6Al4V implants is a promising approach for in situ delivery in orthopedic and dental implant applications.Methodology: In this study, selective laser melting technology was used to fabricate open cell porous Ti6Al4V ELI scaffolds of 50 % volume fractions with Neovius architecture (NOCL). Electrochemical anodization was used to create micro and nano scale surface features for efficient drug loading. The two payloads: an osteogenic agent (Baicalein) and an anti-cancerous drug (Paclitaxel) were then loaded to different levels for differential release. An osteogenic agent was loaded in the nano reservoirs while paclitaxel was mixed with poloxamer and coated over the scaffold.Results: The mechanical stiffness of the designed NOCL lattices is approximately 1.29 +/- 0.05 GPa, which is comparable to the human bone. This helps to reduce stress shielding effect. The scaffolds loaded with baicalein and paclitaxel yielded a sustained drug release profiles, releasing 57 % and 79 % of the pharmaceuticals over a 7 -day period, respectively. Additionally, the baicalein-loaded nano reservoirs promote osteoblast differentiation in mesenchymal stem cells. As a result, bio-inspired 3D-printed open cell porous titanium scaffolds loaded with dual drugs offer a workable solution to the problems associated with orthopedic implants.

AB  - This comprehensive review provides a thorough examination of inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), encompassing their classification, genetic underpinnings, and the promising landscape of gene therapy trials. IRDs, a diverse group of genetic conditions causing vision loss through photoreceptor cell death, are explored through various angles, including inheritance patterns, gene involvement, and associated systemic disorders. The focal point is gene therapy, which offers hope for halting or even reversing the progression of IRDs. The review highlights ongoing clinical trials spanning retinal cell replacement, neuroprotection, pharmacological interventions, and optogenetics. While these therapies hold tremendous potential, they face challenges like timing optimization, standardized assessment criteria, inflammation management, vector refinement, and raising awareness among vision scientists. Additionally, translating gene therapy success into widespread adoption and addressing cost-effectiveness are crucial challenges to address. Continued research and clinical trials are essential to fully harness gene therapy's potential in treating IRDs and enhancing the lives of affected individuals.

AB  - Emergence and spread of the hypervirulent pathotype of Klebsiella pneumoniae have significantly increased infection rates in community as well as healthcare settings. There is an increasing interest to identify discriminating features between classical K. pneumoniae (cKp) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) to facilitate our understanding of the rapid emergence and dissemination of the hypervirulent pathotype. Here, we sought to identify unique epigenetic signatures of hvKp pathotype that differ from its classical counterpart using single-base resolution methylome analysis of native DNA sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. The overall global adenine methylation in GATC motifs (i.e., Dam methylation motif) and cytosine methylation in CCWGG motifs (i.e., Dcm methylation motif) were significantly higher in hvKp isolates compared to that in cKp isolates, irrespective of their position in chromosomes or putative extra-chromosomal genetic elements. Notably, we observed significant enrichment of hypermethylated GATC and CCWGG motifs in the virulome of hvKp compared to hvKp genes not directly associated with virulence. We also observed increased methylation of GATC and CCWGG motifs in the capsule synthesis locus of hvKp isolates compared to cKp isolates. Furthermore, we identified several differentially methylated genes (DMGs) between the two pathotypes; interestingly, these DMGs include metal ion transporters, multidrug efflux pumps, transcriptional regulators of stress response, and genes associated with biofilm formation. Our results highlight hypermethylation of GATC and CCWGG motifs as unique epigenetic signatures of hvKp isolates.

AB  - Ewing sarcoma (ES) of the spine is a rare childhood cancer with sparse literature on treatment outcomes. We aimed to describe survival outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with spinal ES treated at a single institute in a resource-challenged setting. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with spinal ES registered at a tertiary care oncology center between 2003-2019. Clinical patient data was retrieved from hospital records. Cox regression analysis was used to identify the association of baseline clinical parameters with event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). A cohort of 85 patients was analyzed including 38 (45%) patients with metastatic disease. The median age was 15 years with 73% being male. Local therapy was administered in 62 (72.9%) patients with surgery alone in 8 (9.4%), radiotherapy alone in 36 (42.4%) and both in 18 (21.2%) patients. A higher proportion of males received local therapy than females (80.3% versus 59.1%; p = 0.049). The median EFS and OS were 20.1 and 28.6 months, respectively. On univariable analysis, age <= 15 years, female sex, serum albumin <= 3.5 g/dL and hemoglobin <= 11 g/dL were associated with inferior EFS while younger age, female sex, hypoalbuminemia and metastatic disease were associated with inferior OS. On multivariable analysis, only hypoalbuminemia was predictive for inferior EFS (HR:2.41; p = 0.005) while hypoalbuminemia (HR:2.06;p = 0.033) and female sex (HR:1.83; p = 0.046) were associated with inferior OS. We concluded that hypoalbuminemia confers poor prognosis in ES spine. Survival outcomes are poorer in females treated in our setting, possibly due to prevailing sex-based biases.

AB  - Introduction: The hijra and transgender (H/TG) population in India is vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. India had instituted a targeted intervention (TI) program to reduce this vulnerability. We aimed to measure the effectiveness of the TI program for H/TG.
   Materials and Methods: The National Integrated Behavioral and Biological Survey (IBBS) was carried out in 2014-15. H/ TG data from IBBS was analyzed. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval. Condom use during the last sexual intercourse, and the consistent condom use in the last one month were considered as indicators of program effectiveness. The Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method was used to assess the effectiveness.
   Results: We found that the participants who had received condoms from peer educator/outreach worker were 1.74 and 1.40 times more likely to use condoms in the last sexual intercourse (aOR: 1.74, CI: 1.35 - 2.26) and consistent condom use in the last one month (aOR: 1.40, CI: 1.12 - 1.74) respectively compared to the participants who did not receive the condom. The matched-samples estimate (i.e., average treatment effect on treated) for the condom use during the last sexual intercourse increased by 13.0%, i.e., 0.13 (CI; 0.08 - 0.18) and consistent condomuse in the last one month increased by 5.0%, i.e., 0.05 (CI; 0.00 - 0.10) among those who had received condoms from the peer educator/outreach worker compared with those who had not received condom, respectively.
   Conclusions: The TI program intervention for H/TG was effective in reducing HIV risk behavior as evidenced by increase in use of condom during last sexual intercourse, and consistent condom use in the last one month.

AB  - Bckground The Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) Framework, launched by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2023, emphasises assessing, strengthening, and scaling up services for the early detection and management of breast cancer. This study aims to determine the feasibility of monitoring the status of breast cancer control in the 21 Asian National Cancer Centers Alliance (ANCCA) countries based on the three GBCI Framework key performance indicators (KPIs): stage at diagnosis, time to diagnosis, and treatment completion.Methods We reviewed published literature on breast cancer control among 21 ANCCA countries from May to July 2023 to establish data availability and compiled the latest descriptive statistics and sources of the indicators using a standardised data collection form. We performed bivariate Pearson's correlation analysis to measure the strength of correlation between stage at diagnosis, mortality and survival rates, and universal health coverage.Findings Only 12 (57%) ANCCA member countries published national cancer registry reports on breast cancer age -standardised incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR). Indonesia, Myanmar, and Nepal had provincial data and others relied on WHO's Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBOCAN) estimates. GLOBOCAN data differed from the reported national statistics by 5-10% in Bhutan, Indonesia, Iran, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand and >10% in China, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Sri Lanka. The proportion of patients diagnosed in stages I and II strongly correlated with the five-year survival rate and with the universal health coverage (UHC) index. Three countries (14%) reported national data with >60% of invasive breast cancer patients diagnosed at stages I and II, and a five-year survival rate of >80%. Over 60% of the ANCCA countries had no published national data on breast cancer staging, the time interval from presentation to diagnosis, and diagnosis to treatment. Five (24%) countries reported data on treatment completion. The definition of delayed diagnosis and treatment completion varied across countries. Interpretation GBCI's Pillar 1 KPI correlates strongly with five-year survival rate and with the UHC index. Most ANCCA countries lacked national data on cancer staging, timely diagnosis, and treatment completion KPIs. While institutional-level data were available in some countries, they may not represent the nationwide status. Strengthening cancer surveillance is crucial for effective breast cancer control. The GBCI Framework indicators warrant more detailed definitions for standardised data collection. Surrogate indicators which are measurable and manageable in country-specific settings, could be considered for monitoring GBCI indicators. Ensuring UHC and addressing health inequalities are essential to early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

AB  - ObjectivesTo review whether the periodic rotation of nasal mask with binasal prongs is superior to continuous application of either of the interfaces in preterm infants on non-invasive positive pressure respiratory support.MethodThe authors searched Medline, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, and CENTRAL for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing periodic rotation of the two interfaces (mask or prongs) against the continuous application of either, in preterm infants on nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) or nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). They performed a random-effects meta-analysis using RevMan 5.4. The primary outcome was the incidence of moderate to severe nasal injury. Other outcomes included any nasal injury, need for invasive ventilation, duration of respiratory support, hospital stay, and mortality.ResultsFour RCTs (520 participants) were included. There was no difference in the incidence of moderate to severe nasal injury between periodic rotation vs. continuous nasal mask (3 RCTs, 293 participants; RR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.73-4.19), or periodic rotation vs. continuous binasal prongs (3 RCTs, 296 participants; RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.14-1.11). Periodic rotation lowered the incidence of any grade nasal injury compared to continuous binasal prongs (RR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.49-0.75) but not compared to continuous nasal mask (RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 0.92-2.06). Periodic rotation was associated with longer non-invasive respiratory support (compared to prongs) and prolonged hospital stay (compared to masks). There were no significant differences in other clinical outcomes.ConclusionsAmong preterm infants receiving non-invasive respiratory support, periodically rotating a nasal mask with short binasal prongs may not be superior to the continuous application of nasal masks.

AB  - Background: The current study estimated incident breakthrough seizures, serum matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters in five-to 18-year-olds with neu-rocysticercosis (NCC) from colloidal or vesicular through calcified stages over at least 24 months' follow-up. Methods: Single, colloidal, or vesicular parenchymal NCC cases were treated with albendazole and ste-roids and followed at a tertiary care north Indian hospital. Serum MMP-9 was estimated in colloidal or vesicular treatment-naive state and in a subset of calcified cases at six-month follow-up. The same subset of calcified cases also underwent perfusion MRI of the brain at six-month follow-up. Results: Among 70 cases, 70% calcified at six-month follow-up. Over a median follow-up of 30 months, the incidence of breakthrough seizures was 48.6% (61.2% in calcified and 19.2% in resolved, P = 0.001; 32.9% early [within six months] and 15.7% late [beyond six months], P = 0.02). Serum MMP-9 levels were higher in colloidal and vesicular compared with calcified stage (242.5 vs 159.8 ng/mL, P = 0.007); however, there was no significant association with breakthrough seizures and/ or calcification in follow-up. In a subgroup of calcified cases (n = 31), the median relative cerebral blood volume on perfusion MRI in and around the lesion was lower in those with seizures (n = 12) than in those without (n = 19) (10.7 vs 25.2 mL/100 g, P = 0.05). Conclusions: In post-treatment colloidal or vesicular NCC, incident breakthrough seizures decrease beyond six months. In calcified NCC with remote breakthrough seizures, significant perilesional hypo -perfusion is seen compared with those without seizures. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The incapability of cartilage to naturally regenerate and repair chronic muscular injuries urges the development of competent bionic rostrums. There is a need to explore faster strategies for chondrogenic engineering using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Along these lines, rapid chondrocyte differentiation would benefit the transplantation demand affecting osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. In this report, a de novo nanocomposite was constructed by integrating biogenic carbon quantum dot (CQD) filler into synthetic hydrogel prepared from dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and acrylic acid (AAc). The dominant structural integrity of synthetic hydrogel along with the chondrogenic differentiation potential of garlic peel derived CQDs led to faster chondrogenesis within 14 days. By means of extensive chemical and morphological characterization techniques, we illustrate that the hydrogel nanocomposite possesses lucrative features to influence rapid chondrogenesis. These results were further corroborated by bright field imaging, Alcian blue staining and Masson trichome staining. Thus, this stratagem of chondrogenic engineering conceptualizes to be a paragon in clinical wound care for the rapid manufacturing of chondrocytes.

AB  - Background and AimWhile European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition advocates a no-biopsy pathway for the diagnosis of celiac disease (CeD) in children if IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (anti-tTG ab) titer is >= 10-fold upper limit of normal (ULN) and have a positive IgA anti-endomysial antibody (EMA); the data for anti-tTG Ab titer-based diagnosis of CeD in adults is still emerging. We planned to validate if IgA anti-tTG Ab titer >= 10-fold predicts villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade >= 2 in Asian adult patients with CeD.MethodsWe recruited 937 adult patients with positive anti-tTG Ab from two databases, including AIIMS Celiac Clinic and Indian National Biorepository. The diagnosis of definite CeD was made on the basis of a positive anti-tTG Ab and the presence of villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade >= 2.ResultsOf 937 adult patients with positive anti-tTG Ab, 889 (91.2%) showed villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade >= 2. Only 47.6% of 889 adults with CeD had anti- tTG Ab titers of >= 10-fold. The positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity of anti tTG Ab titer >= 10-fold for predicting modified Marsh grade >= 2 were 99.8% and 98%, respectively. At anti-tTG Ab titer >= 11-fold, specificity and PPV were 100% for predicting villous abnormalities of modified Marsh grade >= 2.ConclusionsApproximately 50% of adults with CeD may benefit from the no biopsy pathway, reducing the health burden and risks of gastroscopy/anesthesia.

AB  - BackgroundThe merits of classifying the heterogeneous group of essential tremors into essential tremor (ET) and essential tremor plus (ETP) are debated.ObjectivesWe studied the electrophysiological and spiral characteristics of tremor in ET and ETP.MethodsWe reviewed standardized videos from a tremor database and clinically classified patients into ET, ETP, or dystonic tremor (DT). The following variables were derived from combined tri-axial accelerometry-surface electromyography (EMG)-peak frequency, total power, peak power, full width half maximum, tremor stability index and EMG-coherence. We analyzed hand-drawn spirals to derive mean deviation, tremor variability, inter-, and intra-loop widths. We compared these variables among the groups.ResultsWe recruited 72 participants (81.9% male) with mean age 47.7 +/- 16.1 years and Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale total score 31.1 +/- 14.1. Patients with ET were younger (P = 0.014) and had less severe tremor (P = 0.020) compared to ETP and DT. In ETP group, 48.6% had subtle dystonia. Peak frequency was greater in ETP (7.3 +/- 0.3 Hz) compared to DT (6.1 +/- 0.4 Hz; P = 0.024). Peak power was greater in ETP and DT for postural tremor. Rest tremor was recordable on accelerometry in 26.7% of ET. Other variables were similar among the groups.ConclusionElectrophysiological evaluation revealed postural tremor of frequency 6 to 7 Hz in ET, ETP, and DT with subtle differences more severe tremor in ETP and DT, and higher frequency in ETP compared to DT. Our findings suggest a similar tremor oscillator in these conditions, supporting the view that these entities are part of a spectrum of tremor disorders, rather than distinct etiological entities.

AB  - Some individuals exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis develop a latent infection and remain at a lifelong risk of developing tuberculosis (TB) disease, a state called as TB infection (TBI). TB preventive treatment (TPT) aims to treat TBI and prevent progression to active TB in an exposed or infected person. Currently, it is not possible to confirm TBI microbiologically, but can be identified indirectly by means of immune-based tests [Tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs)]. It is crucial to rule out active TB before initiating TPT. TPT regimens have evolved with time. The most widely used regimen is 6 mo of daily Isoniazid (INH) (6H). Another regime in pipeline for persons >2 y, but not yet widely available, is 3HP (3 mo of weekly Isoniazid and Rifapentine). TPT to contacts of drug resistant TB (DR-TB) patients needs to be tailored depending on the resistance pattern in the index case, and relies on a bacteriological confirmation of the same. Individuals receiving TPT should be closely monitored for emergence of any signs or symptoms suggestive of active TB disease while on TPT.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the patient-reported cognitive deficits and objective neuropsychological functions in younger adult (YA) sarcoma patients (16-40 years of age). Ninety patients and 30 age-matched healthy controls from a single tertiary healthcare hospital, were recruited into four groups: Pre-chemotherapy (Pre Cx), During chemotherapy (During Cx), Post-chemotherapy (Post Cx) and Controls. Neurocognitive functions were assessed subjectively using FACT-Cog v3 questionnaire; objectively using ACE-III and neuropsychological tests (NPT). FACT-Cog scores of During Cx (P = .041) and Post Cx (P = .008) groups were significantly lower than Pre Cx group. ACE-III scores of During Cx (P = .048) and Post Cx (P = .043) groups were lower as compared to Pre Cx group. In addition, reaction times and accuracies of the NPT (Flanker's, Sternberg's and Emotional Stroop tests) were worse (P < .05) in During Cx and Post Cx groups as compared to either Pre Cx or control groups. In the Post Cx group, the dose of chemotherapy showed significant negative correlation with the Sternberg reaction time (P = .040) as well as the scores of language (P = .047), and attention (P = .044) domains of ACE-III. Observations demonstrate that cancer/chemotherapy-related neurocognitive deficits fail to improve even after cessation of treatment, and high dosage of chemotherapy used, could be an underlying factor. This emphasizes the need for developing 'model of care' in these patients for monitoring the side effects, and possible titration in the therapeutic regimen for sarcoma in YA.

T2  - SLEEP MEDICINE
KW  - CHILDHOOD
KW  - PERSISTENT
AB  - Sleep related rhythmic movement disorders (SRRMD) are highly prevalent among infants and children and tend to disappear into adolescence and adulthood. However, few reports have identified patients who had rhythmic movements at wake-sleep transition persisting into adulthood. This is a case series of SRRMD diagnosed on video-polysomnography from retrospective chart review of patients, who were 6 years or older, seen in Sleep Neurology clinics in two centres by the senior author, over a 10 years period. In addition, an updated review of all papers published on the topic, since year 2000 is being reported. A total of nine patients (2 females) with SRRMD were included in this series with age ranging between 9 and 62 years. Five patients had comorbid primary sleep disorders and four others had associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Association with other primary sleep disorders like sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome and relief with treatment of the latter, has been highlighted.

AB  - Background: Minimally invasive autopsy (MIA) using post-mortem magnetic resonance imaging with ancillary investigations is reported as accurate as conventional autopsy. This study assesses MIA's feasibility and accuracy compared to conventional autopsy.Method: MIA and/or conventional autopsy were performed on malformed fetuses (14-20 weeks gestation) and stillbirths (>20 weeks gestation), with/without malformation. Concordance in diagnostic accuracy (95% confidence interval [CI]) and agreement (Kappa coefficient [k]) were assessed in malformed cases where both MIA and autopsy were conducted.Results: We enrolled 200 cases, including 100 malformed fetuses (<20 weeks) and 100 stillbirths (with/without malformations). Concordance of 97.3% was observed between MIA and autopsy in 156 malformed cases. The overall diagnostic accuracy of MIA was 96.04%.Conclusion: While conventional autopsy remains the gold standard, MIA is feasible in tertiary care settings. It can be considered a potential alternative for post-mortem assessment, particularly in settings with limited facility of conventional autopsy and parental refusal.

AB  - Peripheral intravenous cannulation (PIVC) is a routine procedure in perioperative, and critical care settings and nearly one-third of the patients may have difficult intravenous access (DIVA). PIVC is challenging in a prone position in an intraoperative setting when there is a need for emergency access. Point of care ultrasonography (POCUS) is becoming the standard for assisting DIVA and improving the success rate. The small saphenous vein (SSV) in the posterolateral side of the mid-calf is a consistent vein in the lower extremity that provides an acceptable diameter and optimal depth for POCUS-guided PIVC in the prone position. A successful SSV cannulation was performed with an 18-G peripheral intravenous catheter under POCUS guidance on a 34-year-old male polytrauma patient in the prone position during the intraoperative period scheduled for D2 spine fixation. The SSV can be a credible option for emergency DIVA in the prone position under POCUS guidance.

AB  - Antiphospholipid antibodies (APLA) are present in one-third of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients, and they are associated with both criteria and non-criteria manifestations. We studied the prevalence, clinical associations, and impact on mortality of APLA in SLE patients from India. Among the Indian SLE inception cohort (INSPIRE), patients who had data on all five routinely performed APLAs [lupus anticoagulant (LA), IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibody (aCL) and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I(beta 2GPI)] at enrolment were selected. Patients were divided into four categories based on the presence/absence of APLA associated manifestations and presence/absence of the APLA viz SLE-APS, SLE-APLA, SLE: events but no APLA, and SLE: no events, no APLA (reference group). 1035 SLE patients at least 1 APLA antibody was detected in 372 (35.9%). LA was present in 206 (19.9%), aCL in 126 (12.2%) and beta 2-GPI in 178 (17.2%). There were 88 thrombotic events in 83 patients (8.0%); 73 (82.9%) being arterial; APLA positivity was present in 37 (44.6%) [AOR 1.70 (1.054, 2.76)]. SLE-APS patients were younger and had higher mortality [AOR 4.11 (1.51, 11.3)], neuropsychiatric and hematologic disease. SLE-APLA also had a higher mortality rate [AOR 2.94 (1.06, 8.22)] than the reference group. The mortality was highest in the subset of patients with thrombotic events in the presence of APLA [AOR 7.67 (1.25, 46.9)]. The mere presence of APLA also conferred higher mortality even in the absence of thrombotic events [AOR 3.51 (1.43, 8.63)]. Hematologic manifestations (36.1%) were the most common non-criteria-manifestation. One-third of SLE patients have APLA and its presence is associated with non-criteria hematologic manifestations, arterial thrombosis and higher mortality rate.

AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy with progressive myoclonic epilepsy (SMA-PME) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in the ASAH1 gene. SMA-PME is characterized by progressive muscle weakness from three to seven years of age, drug refractory epilepsy, and variable degree of cognitive decline. Nearly 50 cases have been reported worldwide so far. Here the authors present a case of 9-y-old boy affected by SMA-PME characterized by progressive proximal weakness, and lower motor neuron disease, as proven by muscle biopsy, electro diagnostic studies and whole exome sequencing (WES). WES revealed compound heterozygous missense variant in exon 12 of ASAH1 gene (chr8: g.18059385G>C) and exon 2 of ASAH1 gene (chr8: g.18075542T>C). Patient did not have cognitive decline and epilepsy and EEG record obtained was normal. In addition to reporting a novel variant in the ASAH1 gene causing SMA-PME disease, this paper discusses previous reports and literature of the disease.

AB  - Background There is limited understanding of alteration of gut microbiota and metabolome in children with sepsis/septic shock.Methods In this prospective observational study carried out in a pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary care center from 2020 to 2022, patients aged <17 years with sepsis/septic shock and healthy children (HC) were enrolled. We characterized the gut bacterial compositions by metagenome sequencing and metabolomes by untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The primary outcome was to compare the gut microbiota and metabolome of children with sepsis/septic shock with that of HC. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio was compared between children with sepsis/septic shock and HC. Key secondary outcomes were to evaluate association of factors associated with a low F/B ratio in children with sepsis/septic shock.Results A total of 40 children (63% boys) (15 children with sepsis and septic shock and 10 healthy children) with a median (IQR) age of 5.5 (1.5, 10) years were enrolled. In the fecal microbiota, the alpha-diversity index including Shannon and Simpson indices of the sepsis/septic shock groups was significantly lower than that of the HC. The samples lacked bene?cial Bi?dobacterium spp. and were dominated by Bacteroides, Enterobacteriaceae, and Enterococcaceae. There was reduction in short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in patients with sepsis/septic shock as compared to healthy children. A lower F/B ratio (<= 1.57) of the gut microbiota discriminated well between children with sepsis/septic shock and HC. Factors associated with lower F/B ratio were male gender, clinical GI dysfunction, elevated inflammatory markers, and higher organ failure scores.Conclusion There were significant alterations in the gut microbiota and metabolome in children with sepsis/septic shock as compared to healthy children. Larger study is needed to confirm these exploratory findings and develop potential therapeutic targets that will improve outcomes in children with sepsis/septic shock.

AB  - The role of buccal fat pad (BFP) as interpositional material in the temporomandibular joint ankylosis (TMJA) have been well documented. The purpose of the present systematic review is to reinforce the role of buccal fat pad as interpositional material in preventing re-ankylosis.A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Semantic scholar and Cochrane library data-base from 1980 to 2022 following the PRISMA guidelines. The studies using BFP as interpositional material in TMJA with more than 10 patients with atleast a follow-up of 6-months were included. All the human studies {prospective, retrospective, case reports/series (with more than 10 subjects), randomized or non-randomized trial) reporting the outcome of BFP as interpositional material were included. The present systematic review included 11 studies (prospective=7, Retrospective=3 and ambispective=1) using BFP as interpositional mate-rial. The total number of patients were 205. The number of unilateral TMJA and bilateral TMJA were 153 and 52 respectively, making a number of joint to 257. The distribution of gender was almost equal (few studies did not report the gender distribution). The minimum follow-up was 6-months and extended up to 5.3 years. Out of 205 patients, no re-ankylosis was reported in patients. The authors concluded that the BFP is nearly ideal and a preferred interpositional material to prevent re-ankylosis in temporomandibular joint ankylosis. Its vicinity to TMJ, ease of harvesting through the same surgical site and avoiding other scar makes it a pre-ferred interpositional material in TMJA cases.(c) 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Glutamate induced damage to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) requires tight physiological regulation of the Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Previously, studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective abilities of antioxidants like coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and vitamin E analogs like alpha-tocopherol against neuropathies resulting from NMDA insult, but have failed to shed light on the effect of CoQ10 and trolox, a hydrophilic analog of vitamin E, on glaucomatous neurodegeneration. In the current study, we wanted to investigate whether the combined effect of trolox with CoQ10 could alleviate NMDA-induced death of retinal cells while also trying to elucidate the underlying mechanism in relation to the yet unexplained role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity. After successful NMDA-induced degeneration, we followed it up with the treatment of combination of Trolox and CoQ10. The structural damage by NMDA was repaired significantly and retina retained structural integrity comparable to levels of control in the treatment group of Trolox and CoQ10. Detection of ROS generation after NMDA insult showed that together, Trolox and CoQ10 could significantly bring down the high levels of free radicals while also rescuing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). A significant increase in NMDA receptor Grin2A by CoQ10 alone as well as by CoQ10 and trolox was accompanied by a lowered Grin2B receptor expression, suggesting neuroprotective action of Trolox and CoQ10. Subsequently, lowered VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 receptor expression by NMDA treatment also recovered when subjected to combined treatment of Trolox and CoQ10. Western blot analyses also indicated the same whereby Trolox and CoQ10 could increase the diminished levels of phosphorylated VEGFR2. Immunofluorescence studies also indicated a positive correlation between recovered VEGFR2 and NMDAR2A levels and diminished levels of NMDAR2D, confirming the results obtained by RT-PCR analysis. This is the first report in our knowledge that demonstrates the efficacy of trolox in combination with CoQ10 highlighting the importance of maintaining VEGF levels that are lowered in ocular diseases due to NMDA-related toxicities.

AB  - Fabrics act as fomites for microorganisms, thereby playing a significant role in infection transmission, especially in the healthcare and hospitality sectors. This study aimed to examine the biofilm formation ability of four nosocomial infection-causing bacteria (Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) on cotton, polyester, polyester-cotton blend, silk, wool, viscose, and nylon, used frequently in the healthcare sector, by qualitative and quantitative methods. The impact of temperature, pH, and relative humidity (RH) on biofilm formation was also assessed. P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were strong biofilm producers, while E. coli produced weak biofilm. Wool (maximum roughness) showed the highest bacterial load, while silk (lowest roughness) showed the least. P. aeruginosa exhibited a higher load on all fabrics, than other test bacteria. Extracellular polymeric substances were characterized by infrared spectroscopy. Roughness of biofilms was assessed by atomic force microscopy. For biofilm formation, optimum temperature, pH, and RH were 30 degrees C, 7.0, and 62%, respectively. MgCl2 and CaCl2 were the most effective in removing bacterial biofilm. In conclusion, biofilm formation was observed to be influenced by the type of fabric, bacteria, and environmental conditions. Implementing recommended guidelines for the effective disinfection of fabrics is crucial to curb the risk of nosocomial infections. In addition, designing modified healthcare fabrics that inhibit pathogen load could be an effective method to mitigate the transmission of infections.

AB  - To investigate the frequency, profile, and severity of COVID-19 breakthrough infections (BI) in patients with type I diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compared to healthy controls (HC) after vaccination. The second COVID-19 Vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD-2) survey is a multinational cross-sectional electronic survey which has collected data on patients suffering from various autoimmune diseases including T1DM. We performed a subgroup analysis on this cohort to investigate COVID-19 BI characteristics in patients with T1DM. Logistic regression with propensity score matching analysis was performed. A total of 9595 individuals were included in the analysis, with 100 patients having T1DM. Among the fully vaccinated cohort, 16 (16%) T1DM patients had one BI and 2 (2%) had two BIs. No morbidities or deaths were reported, except for one patient who required hospitalization with oxygen without admission to intensive care. The frequency, clinical features, and severity of BIs were not significantly different between T1DM patients and HCs after adjustment for confounding factors. Our study did not show any statistically significant differences in the frequency, symptoms, duration, or critical care requirements between T1DM and HCs after COVID-19 vaccination. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with inadequate vaccine response in patients with BIs, especially in patients with autoimmune diseases.

AB  - Introduction Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and poor sleep quality affect around one in ten people in India. We aimed to determine if OSA symptoms and poor sleep quality are independently associated with cognition in middle-aged and elderly urban Indian populations. Methods We studied the cross-sectional association between OSA symptoms (by Berlin Questionnaire), poor sleep quality (by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and cognitive function in adults >= 50 years. Using a standard neuropsychological battery for cognitive function, a G-factor was derived as the first rotated principal component assessing domains of information processing, memory, and executive function. The associations of exposures with cognitive measures were modeled using linear regression, adjusted for metabolic risk factors, lifestyle factors, and psychosocial problems, followed by stratified analysis by decadal age group. Results A total of 7505 adults were enrolled. Excluding those with MMSE < 26 (n 710), of 6795 individuals (49.2% women), mean (SD) age 64.2 (9.0) years, 38.3% had high risk of OSA symptoms, and 15.9% had poor sleep quality. OSA symptoms were negatively associated with cognitive domains of information processing (adjusted beta coefficient of z-score - 0.02, p-value 0.006), memory (- 0.03, 0.014), and G-factor (- 0.11, 0.014) in full-model. Stratified analysis by age group showed significant adverse effects of OSA symptoms on cognition for middle-aged people (50-60 years) (- 0.26, 0.001), but not in later age groups. Poor sleep quality was also associated with lower cognitive scores for G-factor (- 0.48, < 0.001), memory (- 0.08, 0.005), and executive domains (- 0.12, < 0.001), but not with information domain. Conclusion The findings suggest that both symptoms of OSA and poor sleep quality have a direct adverse impact on cognition in an Indian setting. A modest effect of age on the relationship of OSA and cognition was also observed.

AB  - Purpose To optimize real-time PCR assays for diagnosis of Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) and determine cut-off loads by ROC analysis for Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae and Lactobacillus spp. as compared to Nugent scoring (Gold standard) in clinical samples.Results Out of 125 women, 34 were positive, 26 intermediate and 65 negative for BV by Nugent scoring. All three real-time PCR assays were found to be highly sensitive & specific and AUC suggested excellent diagnostic accuracy. An optimal cut-off was >9.45 x 10(3) copies/ ml, >3.34 x 10(3) copies/ ml & <= 18.63 x 10(3) copies/ ml for G. vaginalis, A. vaginae and Lactobacillus spp. respectively, in BV positives. Gram staining and qPCR were discordant only in patients with intermediate scores (n = 26) where qPCR identified 15 (57.69%) as positive and 11 (42.3%) as negative.Conclusion PCR-based molecular BV diagnosis is more accurate and can be used for deciphering intermediate Nugent scores.

AB  - ObjectiveThe utility of radioiodine (RAI) therapy in intermediate-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) remains a topic of ongoing discussion. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to consolidate existing evidence on the impact of postoperative RAI therapy on recurrence and survival outcomes in intermediate-risk PTC.MethodsA literature search was performed using relevant keywords in PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE. Articles from January 2008 to March 2023 were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted from the individual articles, and pooled estimates were generated using meta-analysis.ResultsEleven articles comprising 56,266 intermediate-risk PTC patients were included. 41,530 (73.8%) patients underwent postoperative RAI therapy, while 14,736 (26.2%) patients were kept on no-RAI (NOI) follow-up. No significant reduction in rates of structural disease recurrence was noted with RAI therapy in comparison to NOI follow-up (pooled univariate OR, 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29-1.87, I2 = 75%). RAI therapy was not a significant predictor of better recurrence-free survival (pooled multivariate HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.01-3.74, I2 = 94%). Interestingly, RAI therapy was associated with an overall survival benefit compared to NOI follow-up (pooled multivariate HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.82, I2 = 79%).ConclusionsThis meta-analysis did not establish a conclusive benefit of RAI therapy in preventing structural disease recurrence or improving recurrence-free survival in intermediate-risk PTC. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution owing to significant heterogeneity in the existing literature. A prospective, randomised clinical trial is the need of the hour to better understand the effect of RAI therapy on long-term outcomes.

AB  - The development of liver scaffolds retaining their three-dimensional (3D) structure and extra-cellular matrix (ECM) composition is essential for the advancement of liver tissue engineering. We report the design and validation of an alginate-based platform using a combination of decellularized matrices and collagen to preserve the functionality of liver cells. The scaffolds were characterized using SEM and fluorescence microscopy techniques. The proliferation and functional behaviours of hepatocellular carcinoma HuH7 cells were observed. It was found that the decellularized skin scaffold with collagen was better for maintaining the growth of cells in comparison to other decellularized matrices. In addition, we observed a significant increase in the functional profile once exogenous collagen was added to the liver matrix. Our study also suggests that a cirrhotic liver model should have a different matrix composition as compared to a healthy liver model. When primary rat hepatocytes were used for developing a healthy liver model, the proliferation studies with hepatocytes showed a decellularized skin matrix as the better option, but the functionality was only maintained in a decellularized liver matrix with addition of exogenous collagen. We further checked if these platforms can be used for studying drug induced toxicity observed in the liver by studying the activation of cytochrome P450 upon drug exposure of the cells growing in our model. We observed a significant induction of the CYP1A1 gene on administering the drugs for 6 days. Thus, this platform could be used for drug-toxicity screening studies using primary hepatocytes in a short span of time. Being a microscaffold based system, this platform offers some advantages, such as smaller volumes of samples, analysing multiple samples simultaneously and a minimal amount of decellularized matrix in the matrix composition, making it an economical option compared to a completely dECM based platform.

AB  - Perturbations in the metabolism of ammonia, a cytotoxic endogenous metabolite, occur in a number of chronic diseases, with consequent hyperam-monemia. Increased skeletal muscle ammonia uptake causes metabolic, molecular, and phenotype alterations including cataplerosis of (loss of tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle intermediate) alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha KG), mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction, and senescence-associated molecular phenotype (SAMP). L-Isoleucine (Ile) is an essential, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) that simultaneously provides acetyl-CoA as an oxidative substrate and succinyl-CoA for anaplerosis (providing TCA cycle intermediates). Our multiomics analyses in myotubes and skeletal muscle from hyperammonemic mice and human patients with cirrhosis showed perturbations in BCAA transporters and catabolism. We, therefore, determined if Ile reverses hyperammonemia-induced im-paired mitochondrial oxidative function and SAMP. Studies were performed in differentiated murine C2C12 myotubes that were early passage, late passage (senescent), or those depleted of LAT1/SLC7A5 and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived myotubes (hiPSCM). Ile reverses hyperammonemia-induced reduction in the maximum respiratory capacity, complex I, II, and III functions in early passage murine myotubes and hiPSCM. Consistently, low ATP content and impaired global protein synthesis (high energy requiring cellular process) during hyperammonemia are reversed by Ile in murine myotubes and hiPSCM. Lower abundance of critical regulators of protein synthesis in mTORC1 signaling, and increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha are also reversed by Ile. Genetic depletion studies showed that Ile responses are independent of the amino acid transporter LAT1/SLC7A5. Our studies show that Ile reverses the hyperammonemia-induced impaired mitochondrial oxidative function, cataplerosis, and SAMP in a LAT1/SLC7A5 transporter-independent manner.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease. Major contributions of HLA genes have been reported; however, HLA typing-based diagnosis or risk prediction in GPA has not been estab-lished. We have performed a sequencing-based HLA genotyping in a north Indian GPA cohort and controls to identify clinically relevant novel associations. PR3-ANCA-positive 40 GPA patients and 40 healthy controls from north India were recruited for the study. Targeted sequencing of HLA-A,-B,-C,-DRB1,-DQB1, and-DPB1 was performed. Allelic and haplotypic associations were tested. Molecular docking of susceptibility HLA alleles with reported super-antigen epitopes was performed. The association of substituted amino acids located at the antigen-binding domain of HLA was evaluated. Genetic association of five HLA-alleles was identified in GPA. The novel association was identified for C*15:02 (p = 0.04; OR = 0.27(0.09-0.88)). The strongest association was observed for DPB1*04:01 (p < 0.0001; OR = 6.2(3.08-11.71)), previously reported in European studies. 35 of 40 GPA subjects had at least one DPB1*04:01 allele, and its significant risk was previously not reported from the Indian population. Significantly associated haplotypes DRB1*03:01-DQB1*02:01-DPB1*04:01 (p = 0.02; OR = 3.46(1.11-12.75)) and DRB1*07:01-DQB1*02:02-DPB1*04:01 (p = 0.04; OR = 3.35(0.95-14.84)) were the most frequent in GPA patients. Ranging from 89 % to 100 % of GPA patients with organ involvement can be explained by at least one DPB1*04:01 allele. A strong interaction between the HLA and three epitopes of the reported super antigen TSST-1 of Staphylococcus aureus was confirmed. Our study highlighted the potential applicability of HLA typing for screening and diagnosis of GPA. A large multi-centric study and genotype-phenotype correlation analysis among GPA patients will enable the establishment of HLA-typing based GPA diagnosis.

AB  - Management of pediatric epilepsies poses unique challenges around diagnosis, treatment options, comorbidities, and the potential for these factors to interact with processes in the developing brain. In pediatric patients, broad-spectrum antiseizure medications (ASMs) with minimal potential for adverse events (AEs) and limited impact on cognition and behavior are preferred. Perampanel is a first-in-class ASM with broad-spectrum efficacy, a tolerable safety profile, minimal negative impact on cognitive function, and other features that make it a viable treatment option in this patient population. However, evidence and experience of its use in pediatric patients are less extensive than in adult patients. Experts in pediatric epilepsy across the region convened at a series of meetings to discuss the use of perampanel in pediatric patients, including dose optimization, AE prevention and management, and considerations in particular groups.

AB  - This proposed work reports the development of in-house made conductive ink-based screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) for label-free detection of oral cancer biomarkers. Carbon ink synthesis includes graphite powder, gum arabic, and water. The selectivity test of the fabricated SPE involves immobilizing antibodies specific to biomarkers and challenges with redox-active interference, other serum molecules, and non-target biomarkers. Three different biomarkers, cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and tumor protein p53 (TP-53), act as target entities for the detection of oral cancer in patients' samples (serum, N = 28, and saliva, N = 16) at an early stage. The standard technique enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to estimate the concentration of the biomarkers in serum and saliva samples. SPEs contain amine (-NH2) functional groups involved in covalent bonding with the carboxyl (-COOH) groups of antibody molecules. These immunosensors exhibited remarkably lower detection limits of 829.5 pg mL-1, 0.543 pg mL-1, and 1.165 pg mL-1, and excellent sensitivity of 0.935 mu A mL pg-1 cm-1, 0.039 mu A mL pg-1 cm-1, and 0.008 mu A mL pg-1 cm-1 for CYFRA 21-1, IL-8, and TP-53 biomarkers, respectively. This sensing platform does not require any functionalization for biomolecule immobilization. Thus, it is a cost-effective, disposable, flexible, miniaturized, and sensitive strip to detect oral cancer biomarkers.

AB  - To evaluate the utility of CD43 and CD200 in differentiating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) from other mature B-cell neoplasms. This was a cross-sectional study on patients diagnosed with B-cell neoplasms on flowcytometry. The median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD43, CD200 expressing neoplastic B-cells were compared between the CLL and non-CLL B-cell neoplasms followed by receiver operating characreristic curve (ROC) analysis. In addition, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CD43 and CD200 in diagnosing CLL were analysed. A total of 137 patients were included. The CLL group consisted 87 patients and non-CLL group consisted 50 patients. The Mann-Whitney U test showed significant CD43 expression (U = 997.5, Z= - 5.265, p < 0.001) and CD200 expression (U = 932.0, Z = - 5.5, p < 0.01) in CLL patients compared to non-CLL patients. The area under the curve were 0.771 and 0.786 for MFI of CD43 and CD200 in differentiating CLL from non-CLL group respectively. The optimal cut-off of MFI for CD43 and CD200 were 1323 and 1775 respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of CD43 in diagnosing CLL cases were 97.7%, 66%, 83.3% and 94.2% respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of CD200 in diagnosing CLL cases were 100%, 32%, 71.9% and 100% respectively. CD43 and CD200 are useful markers in differentiating CLL from other mature B-cell neoplasms with higher MFI expression of both markers found in CLL.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy in adults occurring in a background of cirrhosis. Peritoneal dissemination of HCC is an unusual presentation with an incidence of 2%-16%. Peritoneal metastasis of an unruptured HCC is extremely uncommon. Despite low yield, ascitic fluid cytology serves as a valuable tool for diagnostic evaluation in a patient of cirrhosis with suspicion of malignant transformation. We present a rare case scenario in an elderly female with cirrhosis where the diagnosis of peritoneal metastasis was established on ascitic fluid cytology and confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This report illustrates the unique clinical presentation of an unruptured HCC with its cytological features and a brief review of literature.

AB  - Aims and Objective: To evaluate the attitudes of Indian nurses towards the importance of family involvement in nursing care and the association between nurse attitudes and sociodemographic characteristics.Background: Involving the family in the care process is crucial for delivering family- and patient-centred care and ensuring the best possible patient outcomes. Nevertheless, published literature revealed that the nurses may lack clarity regarding the role of family members in the patient's care, which in turn hinders families' participation in care.Design: Cross-sectional descriptive study. The STROBE checklist was used to report the present study.Methods: A total of 203 Nurses participated in a prospective cross-sectional study between May 2022 and August 2022. They were recruited through convenience sampling from two tertiary care centres in India. A two-part questionnaire was used to gather the data; the first section contained questions for gathering sociodemographic information, and the second part contained the standardized FINC-NA scale.Results: The mean age of the nurses was (28.08 +/- 4.722) years, and their median professional experience was 2.5 (1-5.5) years. Nurses' attitude regarding family's importance in patient care was found to be significantly associated (p <= .05) with education level, marital status, religion and hometown region.Conclusion: In several items Indian nurses have positive attitudes towards family involvement in care but some of the lower scoring items can present opportunities for focused improvement. Continuing development programmes about family-centered care can constitute important strategies to improve the positive attitudes of nurses towards families in practice.Patient and public contribution: No patient or public contribution.

AB  - Background: Recent studies have advanced our understanding of the genetic drivers of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rare variants in more than 20 genes are considered causal for PD, and the latest PD genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 90 independent risk loci. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of PD genetics outside of the European populations in which the vast majority of these studies were focused.Objective: The aim was to identify genetic risk factors for PD in a South Asian population.Methods: A total of 674 PD subjects predominantly with age of onset (AoO) <= 50 years (encompassing juvenile, young, or early-onset PD) were recruited from 10 specialty movement disorder centers across India over a 2-year period; 1376 control subjects were selected from the reference population GenomeAsia, Phase 2. We performed various case-only and case-control genetic analyses for PD diagnosis and AoO.Results: A genome-wide significant signal for PD diagnosis was identified in the SNCA region, strongly colocalizing with SNCA region signal from European PD GWAS. PD cases with pathogenic mutations in PD genes exhibited, on average, lower PD polygenic risk scores than PD cases lacking any PD gene mutations. Gene burden studies of rare, predicted deleterious variants identified BSN, encoding the presynaptic protein Bassoon that has been previously associated with neurodegenerative disease.Conclusions: This study constitutes the largest genetic investigation of PD in a South Asian population to date. Future work should seek to expand sample numbers in this population to enable improved statistical power to detect PD genes in this understudied group.

AB  - Objective: To report the utilisation of maternal healthcare services and factors associated with adequate antenatal care and institutional childbirths among mothers in the tribal communities from nine districts in India. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 2636 tribal women who had a childbirth experience in the past 12 months. Socio-demographic, maternal healthcare services and health system-related details were collected. Multiple logistic regression analyses were done to identify factors associated with adequate antenatal care (receiving at least four antenatal care visits, the first visit being in the first trimester and receiving a minimum of 100 iron-folic acid tablets) and institutional childbirth (mother giving birth in a health facility). Results: Only 23% of the mothers received adequate antenatal care. 82% were institutional childbirths. The logistic regression revealed that particularly vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs), those lacking all-weather roads, and women of advanced age were at risk of inadequate antenatal care. Mother's education, health worker's home visits during pregnancy and reception of advice on antenatal care were significantly associated with the reception of adequate antenatal care. Having all-weather roads, and education of the mother and head of the household were positively associated with institutional childbirths, whereas PVTGs, children of birth order three or above, and working mothers were more likely to give childbirth at home. Conclusion: PVTGs are at risk of foregoing adequate antenatal care and are more likely to give childbirth at home. Having all-weather roads is a strong correlate of adequate maternal care. Outreach activities by the health workers are to be strengthened as they are positively and significantly associated with the reception of adequate antenatal care. Investing in education and other social determinants and addressing certain socio-cultural practices is important to improve maternal health.

KW  - Rapid Sequence Induction and Intubation
AB  - BackgroundThe optimal way to hold an endotracheal tube (ETT) during intubation has not been studied. In this randomised clinical trial, we examined the effect of site-holding the ETT in two different positions on time and ease of intubation by anaesthesia trainees.MethodsA single-centre, randomised trial of intubations of stable patients with uncomplicated airways was conducted from 15 September 2019 to 31 May 2021 in the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Bhubaneswar, India. A previous pilot study performed in the unit determined the comparator positions for the ETT and the sample size for a 20% difference for the primary outcome of mean time to intubation (TTI). Patients were randomised at the time of the intubation; anaesthesia trainees held the ETT at 19 or 24 cm according to the patient's assignment. Video recordings of intubations were independently reviewed by two assessors blinded to the assignment. Secondary outcomes were intubation success, ease of intubation and complications. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed.Results360 adults were randomised (180/arm) and intubated by 19 trainees. In intention-to-treat analysis, there was no significant difference in TTI. Sixteen times, trainees assigned to hold the ETT at 24 cm moved their grip distally (closer to the cuff) during the procedure. In a per-protocol analysis, TTI for those whose grip remained at 24 cm was shorter than those holding at 19 cm: 6.6 (SD 3.0) vs 7.6 (SD 4.2) s (95% CI for the difference 0.2 to 1.7 s), p=0.01. In both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, there was no difference in first-pass success or ease of intubation between techniques. Eight patients assigned to 19 cm group and four assigned to 24 cm developed sore throats.ConclusionIn stable patients with uncomplicated airways, there was no significant difference in TTI based on the site at which trainees were assigned to hold the ETT. However, the shorter TTI at 24 cm in per-protocol analysis and fewer sore throat observed suggest this practice change warrants further investigation.Trial registration numberCTRI/ 2019/09/021201.

AB  - Objectives Sympathetic crashing acute pulmonary edema (SCAPE) is a subset of heart failure with a dramatic presentation. The unique physiology of this condition requires a different management strategy from the conventional practice. The trial objective was to compare the efficacy of high-dose and low-dose GTN in patients with SCAPE.Methods This was an open-label randomised control trial conducted in a tertiary care teaching hospital in India from 11 November 2021 to 30 November 2022. Consenting participants were randomised to high-dose GTN or conventional low-dose GTN. The primary outcome was symptom resolution at 6 hours and 12 hours. Secondary outcomes included intubation rates, admission rates, length of hospital stay, and any short-term adverse effects of GTN and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days.Results Fifty-four participants were included (26 high-dose GTN, 26 low-dose GTN). At 6 hours, symptom resolution was seen in 17 patients (65.4%) in the 'high-dose' group, compared with 3 (11.5%) in the 'low-dose' group (p<0.001). At 12 hours, 88.5% of patients had a clinical resolution in the 'high-dose' arm versus 19.5% in 'low-dose' arm . The low-dose group had longer median hospital stay (12 hours vs 72 hours), more frequent MACE (3.8% vs 26.9%, p=0.02) and a higher intubation rate (3.8% vs 19.2%, p=0.08). The only short-term adverse effect seen was a headache in both the groups.Conclusion In SCAPE, patients receiving high-dose GTN (>100 mcg/min) had earlier symptom resolution compared with the conventional 'low dose' GTN without any significant adverse effects.

AB  - Background: Caregivers have crucial role in the care of the children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF), but there is limited knowledge about their knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) regarding chronic disease. This pilot study aimed to validate a self-developed KAP questionnaire for caregivers of young children with CF in India and determine factors associated with KAP.Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 95 caregivers of children with CF attending the specialty clinic of the pediatric outpatient department (OPD) in Northern India. Participants possessing certain characteristics such as willingness to participate and ability to understand Hindi or English language were enrolled in the study. Caregivers of children reported to the OPD with acute exacerbation requiring immediate hospitalization were excluded from the study.Results: The self-developed KAP questionnaire had good content validity (CVI- 0.87-1.0) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.70, 0.71, 0.75 respectively). The majority of participants belonged to the Good KAP group (85.3%), while the remaining were in the Poor KAP group (14.7%). A chi(2) test showed that KAP clusters vary significantly with sociodemographic variables like gender, marital status, educational status and monthly family income (p < .05). A weak negative correlation was found between knowledge and attitude scores in the Good KAP group (p < .001). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the KAP of the caregivers was significantly influenced by knowledge related to clinical manifestation and complications, and attitude.Conclusion: All three sections of the KAP tool demonstrated good content validity and internal consistency. Caregivers had good knowledge, a positive attitude, and appropriate practices related to CF. However, targeted interventions are necessary to address specific areas for improvement, particularly for male caregivers with lower educational levels belonging to poor socioeconomic strata.

AB  - BackgroundLow-pressure pneumoperitoneum (LPP) is an attempt at improving laparoscopic surgery. However, it has the issue of poor working space for which deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) may be a solution. There is a lack of literature comparing LPP with deep NMB to standard pressure pneumoperitoneum (SPP) with moderate NMB.MethodologyThis was a single institutional prospective non-inferiority RCT, with permuted block randomization of subjects into group A and B [Group A: LPP; 8-10 mmHg with deep NMB [ Train of Four count (TOF): 0, Post Tetanic Count (PTC): 1-2] and Group B: SPP; 12-14 mmHg with moderate NMB]. The level of NMB was monitored with neuromuscular monitor with TOF count and PTC. Cisatracurium infusion was used for continuous deep NMB in group A. Primary outcome measures were the surgeon satisfaction score and the time for completion of the procedure. Secondarily important clinical outcomes were also reported.ResultsOf the 222 patients screened, 181 participants were enrolled [F: 138 (76.2%); M: 43 (23.8%); Group A n = 90, Group B n = 91]. Statistically similar surgeon satisfaction scores (26.1 +/- 3.7 vs 26.4 +/- 3.4; p = 0.52) and time for completion (55.2 +/- 23.4 vs 52.5 +/- 24.9 min; p = 0.46) were noted respectively in groups A and B. On both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis it was found that group A was non-inferior to group B in terms of total surgeon satisfaction score, however, non-inferiority was not proven for time for completion of surgery. Mean pain scores and incidence of shoulder pain were statistically similar up-to 7 days of follow-up in both groups. 4 (4.4%) patients in group B and 2 (2.2%) in group A had bradycardia (p = 0.4). Four (4.4%) cases of group A were converted to group B. One case of group B converted to open surgery. Bile spills and gallbladder perforations were comparable.ConclusionLPP with deep NMB is non-inferior to SPP with moderate NMB in terms of surgeon satisfaction score but not in terms of time required to complete the procedure. Clinical outcomes and safety profile are similar in both groups. However, it could be marginally costlier to use LPP with deep NMB.

AB  - Background Laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM) is an established treatment for achalasia cardia. Anti-reflux procedures (ARP) are recommended with LHM to reduce the post-operative reflux though the optimal anti-reflux procedure is still debatable. This study reports on the long-term outcomes of LHM with Angle-of-His accentuation (AOH) in patients of achalasia cardia.Methods One hundred thirty-six patients of achalasia cardia undergoing LHM with AOH between January 2010 to October 2021 with a minimum follow-up of one year were evaluated for symptomatic outcomes using Eckardt score (ES), DeMeester heartburn (DMH) score and achalasia disease specific quality of life (A-DsQoL) questionnaire. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, high resolution manometry (HRM) and timed barium esophagogram (TBE) were performed when feasible and rates of esophagitis and improvement in HRM and TBE parameters evaluated. Time dependent rates of success were calculated with respect to improvement in ES and dysphagia-, regurgitation- and heartburn-free survival using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results At a median follow-up of 65.5 months, the overall success (ES <= 3) was 94.1%. There was statistically significant improvement in ES, heartburn score and A-DsQoL score (p < 0.00001, p = 0.002 and p < 0.00001). Significant heartburn (score >= 2) was seen in 12.5% subjects with 9.5% patients reporting frequent PPI use (> 3 days per week). LA-B and above esophagitis was seen in 12.7%. HRM and TBE parameters also showed a significant improvement as compared to pre-operative values (IRP: p < 0.0001, column height: p < 0.0001, column width: p = 0.0002). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed dysphagia, regurgitation, and heartburn free survival of 75%, 96.2% and 72.3% respectively at 10 years.Conclusions LHM with AOH gives a lasting relief of symptoms in patients of achalasia cardia with heartburn rates similar to that reported in studies using Dor's or Toupet's fundoplication with LHM. Hence, LHM with AOH may be a preferred choice in patients of achalasia cardia given the simplicity of the procedure.

AB  - Antibiotics have substantially improved life expectancy in past decades through direct control or prevention of infections. However, emerging antibiotic resistance and lack of access to effective antibiotics have significantly increased the death toll from infectious diseases, making it one of the biggest threats to global health. Addressing the antibiotic crisis to meet future needs require considerable investment in both research and development along with ensuring a viable marketplace to encourage innovation. Fortunately, there has been some improvement in the number of antibiotics approved or in different phases of development through collective global efforts. However, the universal access to these essential novel and generic antibiotics, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), is challenged by poor economic incentives, regulatory hurdles and poor health infrastructure. Recently, the agenda of securing and expanding access has gained global attention. Several mechanisms are now being proposed and implemented to improve access to essential antibiotics. This review provides an insight into the major barriers to antibiotic access as well as the models proposed and implemented to mitigate accessibility issues. These models include but are not limited to market entry rewards, subscription models and transferable exclusivity vouchers. Further, global access programmes including, Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, Antimicrobial Resistance Action Fund and SECURE Platform are discussed. We also propose the way forward for improving access in LMICs with suggested measures to improve access to generic and novel antibiotics.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is emerging as a leading cause of death worldwide. Estimation of BNP levels is a routine diagnosis in these patients. However, in patients having high body-mass index (BMI), renal disease or in geriatric patients, BNP level is reported to be noisy and leads to incongruous conclusion. Thus, for better risk stratification among heart failure patients, it is imperative to look for a superior biomarker. In recent times, sST2 has shown promise as a biomarker. Identifying such biomarkers in peripheral blood of HF patients, need an affine and selective molecular recognition element. Thus, in the current study an aptamer (sS9_P) against sST2 was identified from an aptamer library. Systematic Evolution of Ligands through Exponential enrichment (SELEX) derived aptamer evinced role of its primer binding domains in maintaining its selectivity. This aptamer candidate demonstrated dissociation constant (Kd) in low nanomolar range, and the Limit of Detection (LOD) was -4 ng. Circular dichroism confirms the formation of complex stem-loop like structure. The well characterized sS9_P aptamer was used in an Aptamer Linked Immobilized Sorbent Assay (ALISA) to detect sST2 level in patients' serum (n = 99). Aptamer sS9_P has shown significant discrimination to differentiate HF patients and healthy volunteers with a reasonable specificity (-83 %) with a modest sensitivity of -64 %. While sST-2 antibody has shown poor specificity of -44% but good sensitivity (-87%). The insight obtained from this study indicates that a combination of aptamer and antibody-based assay can be used to design a point-of-care assay for the rapid detection of HF patients in emergency settings.

AB  - Background and Objective: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibits intrinsic molecular heterogeneity, primarily driven by the mutation of specific biomarkers. Identification of these biomarkers would assist not only in distinguishing NSCLC into its major subtypes - Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma, but also in developing targeted therapy. Medical practitioners use one or more types of omic data to identify these biomarkers, copy number variation (CNV) being one such type. CNV provides a measure of genomic instability, which is considered a hallmark of carcinoma. However, the CNV data has not received much attention for biomarker identification. This paper aims to identify biomarkers for NSCLC using CNV data.Methods: An eXplainable AI (XAI)-driven LI-regularized deep learning architecture, XL1R-Net, is proposed that introduces a novel modification of the standard LI-regularized gradient descent algorithm to arrive at an improved deep neural classifier for NSCLC subtyping. Further, XAI-based feature identification has been used to leverage the trained classifier to uncover a set of twenty NCSLC-relevant biomarkers. Results: The identified biomarkers are evaluated based on their classification performance and clinical relevance. Using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based model, a classification accuracy of 84.95% using 10-fold cross-validation is achieved. Moreover, the statistical significance test on the classification performance also revealed the superiority of the MLP model over the competitive machine learning models. Further, the publicly available Drug-Gene Interaction Database reveals twelve of the identified biomarkers as potentially druggable. The K-M Plotter tool was used to verify eighteen of the identified biomarkers with a high probability of predicting NSCLC patients' likelihood of survival. While nine of the identified biomarkers confirm the recent literature, five find mention in the OncoKB Gene List.Conclusion: A set of seven novel biomarkers that have not been reported in the literature could be investigated for their potential contribution towards NSCLC therapy. Given NSCLC's genetic diversity, using only one omics data type may not adequately capture the tumor's complexity. Multiomics data and its integration with other sources will be examined in the future to better understand NSCLC heterogeneity.

AB  - Interleukin (IL) 1B is an important candidate gene in glaucoma pathogenesis as it affects the survival of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the present study, -511T/C and +3953C/T polymorphisms in the IL1B were assessed as genetic risk factors for primary open angle (POAG) and angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in a North Indian Punjabi cohort comprising 867 samples (POAG cases = 307; PACG cases = 133 and controls = 427). Genetic association, diplotype and linkage disequilibrium (LD) analyses were performed. Corrections for confounding variables and multiple testing were applied. An updated meta-analysis was also performed. Pooled OR with 95% CI was calculated for dominant, over dominant, and recessive models. Level of heterozygosity among studies was tested using I-2 statistic with fixed or random effect model based on the extent of heterogeneity. For -511T > C polymorphism, a positive association was observed with PACG under dominant (p = 0.038; OR = 0.65; p(corr) (=) 0.011; OR = 0.55) and over dominant models (p = 0.010; OR = 0.59; p(corr) (=) 0.001; OR = 0.46). Significant association of +3953C > T was also observed with POAG under dominant (p = 0.011; OR = 1.46; p(corr) (=) 0.018; OR = 1.48) and PACG under recessive models (p < 0.0001; OR = 4.47; p(corr)<0.0001; OR = 4.06). While C-C diplotype provided protection against primary glaucoma (0.67-fold; p = 0.0004), T-T and T-C diplotypes predisposed individuals to higher risk (1.31-fold; p = 0.030 and 1.36-fold; p = 0.022 respectively). In meta-analysis, a significant association between +3453 C>T and POAG was observed under dominant (pooled OR = 1.33, p = 0.0046) and over dominant (pooled OR = 1.25; p = 0.0269) models with overall heterogeneity of 15% and 0% respectively. The study provides strong evidence of IL1B variants in modifying genetic susceptibility to primary glaucoma in the targeted North Indian Punjabi population. Replication of the present findings in other populations, and functional studies are warranted to further assess the relevance of IL1B variants in the pathogenesis of primary glaucoma.

AB  - The compound 4-(butan-2-ylideneamino)benzenesulfonamide (EMKNI) was subjected to spectroscopic investigations, both experimental and theoretical in nature. The research study was conducted at two distinct levels. The initial stage involved the acquisition of experimental data, including FT-IR, NMR (1H, 13C), absorption (UV) and fluorescence spectral data. The subsequent stage involved the execution of theoretical calculations (UV) at the TD-DFT/WB97XD/cc-pVDZ basis set. The vibrational analysis was done for each vibrational modes using potential energy vibrational analysis (PED). A comparison was made between the theoretical NMR and the corresponding experimental data. In NLO study the water solvent showed highest NLO property, due to solvent effect. The emission study was done and showed two different wavelengths. A TD-DFT was made between water, DMSO and gas phase and experimental absorption wavelengths (lambda) made in DMSO solvent. Furthermore, the FMO and MEP study were made using the different solvents such as water, DMSO and gas phase. The topological analysis studies were done such as ELF, LOL and RDG. The docking study was done and identify the highest binding energy score.

AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and devastating fibrotic lung disorder with unknown etiology. Although it is believed that genetic component is an important risk factor for IPF, a comprehensive understanding of its genetic landscape is lacking. Hence, we aimed to highlight the susceptibility genes and pathways implicated in IPF pathogenesis through a two-staged systematic literature search of genetic association studies on IPF, followed by meta-analysis and pathway enrichment analysis. Methods: This study was performed based on PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO, registration number: CRD42022297970). The first search was performed (using PubMed and Web of Science) retrieving a total of 5642 articles, of which 52 were eligible for inclusion in the first stage. The second search was performed (using PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus) for ten polymorphisms, identified from the first search, with 2 or more studies. Finally, seven polymorphisms, [rs35705950/MUC5B, rs2736100/TERT, rs2609255/FAM13A, rs2076295/DSP, rs12610495/DPP9, rs111521887/TOLLIP and rs1800470/TGF-beta 1] qualified for meta-analyses. The epidemiological credibility was evaluated using Venice criteria.Results: From the systematic review, 222 polymorphisms in 118 genes showed a significant association with IPF susceptibility. Meta-analyses findings revealed significant association of rs35705950/T [OR = 3.92(3.26-4.57)], rs2609255/G [OR = 1.50(1.18-1.82)], rs2076295/G [OR = 1.19(0.82-1.756)], rs12610495/G [OR = 1.28 (1.12-1.44)], rs2736100/C [OR = 0.68(0.54-0.82), rs111521887/G [OR = 1.34(1.06-1.61)] and suggestive evidence for rs1800470/T [OR = 1.08(0.82-1.34)] with IPF susceptibility. Four polymorphisms-rs35705950/ MUC5B, rs2736100/TERT, rs2076295/DSP and rs111521887/TOLLIP, exhibited substantial epidemiological evidence supporting their association with IPF risk. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis performed on IPF risk-associated genes identified a critical role of genes in mucin production, immune response and inflammation, host defence, cell-cell adhesion and telomere maintenance.Conclusions: Our findings present the most prominent IPF-associated genetic risk variants involved in alveolar epithelial injuries (MUC5B, TERT, FAM13A, DSP, DPP9) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (TOLLIP, TGF beta 1), providing genetic and biological insights into IPF pathogenesis. However, further experimental research and human studies with larger sample sizes, diverse ethnic representation, and rigorous design are warranted.

AB  - Vaccination against COVID-19 is vital for achieving herd immunity, and the Government of India has adopted several strategies to achieve coverage. Vaccine hesitancy was identified as a potential obstacle in combating COVID-19. This study aimed to review the COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and hesitancy, and factors associated with vaccine hesitancy based on studies conducted in Indian populations. The data sources (PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched by following PRISMA guidelines, and the search was done in September 2022. We performed a meta-analysis through a random effect model to estimate pooled hesitancy rate with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 3,339 records were searched, of which 46 studies were found to be eligible for inclusion in the review. The included studies covered 65,551 respondents, 55% were female. Studies reported COVID-19 vaccine acceptance rate of 65.7% in January-February 2021, which increased to 92.8% in May-August 2021. Likewise, the rate of vaccine hesitancy in December 2020 was 37%, dropping to 12.1% through November 2021. The estimated pooled COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 31% [95% CI: 27% - 36%, I2 = 99.3%]. Most studies highlighted that fear of the vaccine's side effects, efficacy, and safety were major barriers to vaccine acceptance. However, as the review indicates, it is important to consider and address all factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Introduction: Single-use medical devices (SUDs) are labeled for single use only, but rising health care costs along with the absence of visible deterioration in the quality of SUDs after one use have led to their reprocessing and reuse. In the past, SUDs mainly consisted of equipment such as guidewires and catheters. However, SUDs have now expanded to flexible endoscopes and energy devices that are much more expensive. Reuse of such devices raises concerns of infection transmission, safety, and lack of effectiveness. We reviewed the disinfection process, cost benefits, potential harms, and legal status of the reuse of SUDs in endourology.Materials and Methods: PUBMED, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published between 1970 and March 2023 that reported the reuse of SUDs using the search terms "reuse"; "single-use device"; "disposable medical devices"; "reprocessing of single-use device"; "endourology"; and keywords related to cost, safety, sterilization, and legal status. Online resources were found using Google search engines. Articles on cost savings, device malfunction, disinfection, or legal status in different countries were reviewed.Results and Conclusions: Reusing SUDs has financial, environmental, and practical advantages. The potential savings on medical expenses is the most compelling argument for reprocessing disposable devices. Reusing medical equipment also contributes to the reduction of toxic biodegradable waste. However, there is a scarcity of data on the safety and efficacy of reused SUDs. For patient safety and to avoid complications, the practice must be regulated with established reprocessing standards.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with an increased risk of Dementia. However, the association between catheter ablation (CA) in patients with atrial fibrillation and the risk of dementia is not well established, with conflicting results to date. We aimed to evaluate the association between CA patients and the risk of Dementia. We performed a systematic literature search using the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane libraries for relevant articles from inception until 10th May 2023. Hazard ratios (HR) were pooled using a random-effect model, and a P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A total of 5 studies with 125,649 patients (30,192 in the CA group and 95,457 in the non-CA group) were included. The mean age of patients among CA and non-CA groups was comparable (58.7 vs 58.18). The most common comorbidity among CA and non-CA groups was hypertension (18.49% vs 81.51%), respectively. Pooled analysis of primary outcome showed that CA was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of Dementia (HR, 0.63 [95% CI: 0.52-0.77], P < 0.001). Similarly, pooled analysis of secondary outcomes showed that the patients with CA had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease (HR, 0.78 [95% CI: 0.66-0.92], P < 0.001) compared with the non-CA group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of vascular dementia (HR, 0.63 [95% CI: 0.38-1.06], P = 0.08) between both groups of patients. Our study suggested that catheter ablation reduced the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease compared to the nonablation group of patients.

AB  - Background: India is the most populous country in the world with millions of births annually. Perinatal mental disorders (PMDs) are prevalent worldwide including in India. This study was undertaken to evaluate how mental health is addressed in national maternity and mental health policies and programs in India. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the national policies and programs in India related to maternity care and mental health. The identified policies and programs were analysed using health policy triangle framework. Results: Our search yielded 11 relevant documents and no peer reviewed publications. No specific national policy or program on maternal mental health could be identified. Universal access to health and mental health including for women and children was clearly articulated in both national mental health and maternity policies, which emphasised that access to mental health care and treatment is a fundamental right. There were few details about how the programs and policies were developed and no accounts of consultations with community members or service providers in their formation. Conclusion: National maternity and mental health policies and programs in India appear not to consider perinatal mental health. There are promising state -based initiatives, but, given the disease burden of PMDs in India, the absence of a national policy leads to unrecognized and unmet needs of women in the states without these measures. These inequalities can be effectively minimized by well implemented national policies for perinatal mental health, accompanied by evidence-based locally tailored programs and interventions across the country.

AB  - Environmental toxins pose significant risks to human health and are considered major contributors to chronic diseases, particularly cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Numerous studies have highlighted the detrimental impact of environmental toxicity on cardiovascular health. The primary sources of environmental toxins include pollutants containing particulate matter and organic substances, such as sulfate, nitrates, ammonium, elemental carbon, crystal elements, arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), and Bisphenol A (BPA). Epidemiological research has closely monitored the link between environmental toxins and CVDs. Notably, aerosols and particulate matter, including PM10 and PM2.5, prevalent in ambient air pollution, have been implicated in various CVDs like ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and dysrhythmia. Additionally, heavy metals such as lead and pesticides from environmental toxins are known to contribute to CVDs, even at low levels of exposure over extended periods. Mercury exposure, even at low concentrations, can adversely affect multiple organs, including the heart, kidneys, nervous system, and immune system. With Pb2+ ions exhibiting Ca2+-like properties, lead disrupts various pathways and can lead to cardiac and vascular lesions and functional impairments when blood lead concentrations exceed 100 mu g% in adults and 60 mu g% in children. Furthermore, cadmium exposure is higher in smokers, primarily due to tobacco use, and is associated with peripheral artery disease. Arsenic toxicity is well-documented, particularly its car-diotoxic effects, which can result in fatal and irreversible myocardial damage. Bisphenol A (BPA) has also been found in urine samples, underscoring its presence as an environmental toxin impacting human health.

AB  - Despite the negative implications on women's health, pregnancy, and fetal outcomes, population-based studies on hematological indices among reproductive age women in India have received inadequate attention. This study aimed to generate normative ranges for various hematological parameters among these women. After ethics approval, apparently healthy (n = 5884) women (aged 18-40 years) were recruited from six eco-geographic zones of India. After various exclusions (n = 5412), including women having anemia, data of clinically, and biochemically healthy women (n = 472) was analysed to generate centiles (2.5 and 97.5th) and correlations. The mean age and mean BMI of women was 29.3 +/- 6.5 years and 23.25 +/- 3.26 kg/m(2) with BP of 112.26 +/- 8.9/74.04 +/- 6.7 mmHg. The reference intervals for hemoglobin (12-15.1 gm/dl), RBC (3.68-5.55 millions/mu l), WBC (4.1-11.26*109/L), platelet count (1.32-4.42*105/mu l), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (4.35-41.65 mm/hr) were different from currently used reference values (p < 0.05). However, these haematological indices did not vary among various age categories, geographical zones, ethnicities and rural or urban origins. Pearson's correlation revealed a statistically significant association between ESR, WBC, monocytes, and platelets with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Women with HOMA-IR > 2 displayed a statistically significant differences in parameters like MCV, ESR, eosinophil and platelet counts as compared to the women with HOMA-IR < 2. This study provides a pioneering reference data of hematological indices among women of reproductive age in India. Despite the small sample size results can be extrapolated to the national population given the representative sampling of various geographical zones. This may pave way for future comprehensive large-scale studies on the subject.

AB  - Background: Variable incidences (up to 18.8%) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) have been reported following sleeve gastrectomy (SG), however, there is no published data from the Southeast Asian population.Objective: To determine the incidence of BE following SG in Southeast Asians.Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional observational study from a tertiary-care center, all patients who had undergone SG from 2008 to 2021 and completed a minimum of 1-year follow-up were contacted to participate. Preoperative data were retrieved from a prospectively maintained database. On recruitment, all patients underwent barium swallow and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and weight parameters and reflux symptoms were recorded.Results: One hundred fourteen patients with no preoperative evidence of BE were included. The mean follow-up duration was 5.4 +/- 3.1 years. On follow-up endoscopy, Barrett's was suspected in 4 patients. However, 3 patients had columnar-lined epithelium and only 1 patient (0.87%) had evidence of intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia on histology. Reflux esophagitis (grade LA-A) resolved in 9 out of 11 patients, while the rate of de novo esophagitis was reported in 22.3%. The mean reflux Symptom Severity score increased from 0.6 +/- 1.8 to 2.6 +/- 5.4 (P = .002). The mean body mass index reduced from 44.1 +/- 7.1 to 33.6 +/- 6.9 kg/m(2) (P < .0001), however, 23.7% of the patients experienced significant weight recidivism. Conclusions: Southeast Asians might have a low incidence of BE following SG. Hence, endoscopic surveillance for the sole purpose of diagnosing BE may not be advisable for these patients.

AB  - Glaucoma stands as a leading global cause of blindness, affecting millions. It entails optic nerve damage and vision loss, categorized into open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma with subtypes like POAG, ACG, XFG, PCG, PDG, and developmental glaucoma. The pathophysiological and genetic factors behind glaucoma remain partially understood, with past studies linking intraocular pressure (IOP) levels to retinal ganglion cell death. Open-angle glaucoma involves elevated resistance to aqueous outflow via the trabecular meshwork, while angleclosure glaucoma typically sees drainage pathways obstructed by the iris. Genes have been identified for POAG, ACG, XFG, PCG, PDG, and developmental glaucoma, allowing for early-onset detection and the emergence of gene therapy as an effective treatment. Nevertheless, diagnostic and treatment options have their constraints, necessitating large-scale, well-designed studies to deepen our grasp of genetics' role in glaucoma's pathogenesis. This review delves into glaucoma's risk factors, pathophysiology, genetics, diagnosis, and available treatment options, including gene therapy. Additionally, it suggests alternative therapies like yoga and meditation as adjunct treatments for glaucoma prevention. Overall, this review advances our comprehension of the pathophysiology and genetic associations of glaucoma while highlighting the potential of gene therapy as a treatment avenue. Further research is imperative to fully elucidate the genetic mechanisms underpinning glaucoma and to devise effective treatments.

AB  - Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC) has a significant negative impact and are associated with increased length of hospital stay and cost of care. Emergency surgery is a well-established risk factor for PPC. Previous studies reported that personalized positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) might reduce postoperative atelectasis and postoperative pulmonary complications. N = 168 adult patients undergoing major emergency laparotomy under general anesthesia were recruited in this study. A minimum driving pressure based incremental PEEP titration was compared to a fixed PEEP of 5 cmH2O. The primary outcome was PPC up to postoperative day 7. The mean (standard deviation) of the recruited patients was 41.7(16.1)y, and 48.8% (82 of 168 patients) were female. The risk of PPC at postoperative day 7 was similar in both the study groups [Relative risk (RR) (95% Confidence interval, CI) 0.81 (0.58, 1.13); p = 0.25]. In addition, the incidence of intraoperative hypotension [p = 0.75], oxygen-free days at day 28 [p = 0.27], duration of postoperative hospital stay [p = 0.50], length of postoperative intensive care unit stay [p = 0.28], and in-hospital mortality [p = 0.38] were similar in two groups. Incidence of PPC was not reduced with the use of an individualized PEEP strategy based on lowest driving pressure. However, the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia was also not increased with titrated PEEP.Trial Registration: www.ctri.nic.in; CTRI/2020/12/029765.

AB  - Permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) is a rare supra ventricular tachycardia (SVT) due to an accessory pathway (AP), characterized by slow and decremental retrograde conduction, which is predominantly seen in infants and children. Although the typical site of AP in PJRT is a right posteroseptal region around or just within the coronary sinus (CS), atypical sites of AP have been described. We report a rare case of PJRT in a 7-year-old girl with an AP located in the superio-paraseptal (Para-Hsian) region that was successfully ablated through a non-coronary sinus.

AB  - ObjectivesAlthough hemispheric surgeries are among the most effective procedures for drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) in the pediatric population, there is a large variability in seizure outcomes at the group level. A recently developed HOPS score provides individualized estimation of likelihood of seizure freedom to complement clinical judgement. The objective of this study was to develop a freely accessible online calculator that accurately predicts the probability of seizure freedom for any patient at 1-, 2-, and 5-years post-hemispherectomy.MethodsRetrospective data of all pediatric patients with DRE and seizure outcome data from the original Hemispherectomy Outcome Prediction Scale (HOPS) study were included. The primary outcome of interest was time-to-seizure recurrence. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model was developed to predict the likelihood of post-hemispheric surgery seizure freedom at three time points (1-, 2- and 5- years) based on a combination of variables identified by clinical judgment and inferential statistics predictive of the primary outcome. The final model from this study was encoded in a publicly accessible online calculator on the International Network for Epilepsy Surgery and Treatment (iNEST) website ().ResultsThe selected variables for inclusion in the final model included the five original HOPS variables (age at seizure onset, etiologic substrate, seizure semiology, prior non-hemispheric resective surgery, and contralateral fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography [FDG-PET] hypometabolism) and three additional variables (age at surgery, history of infantile spasms, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] lesion). Predictors of shorter time-to-seizure recurrence included younger age at seizure onset, prior resective surgery, generalized seizure semiology, FDG-PET hypometabolism contralateral to the side of surgery, contralateral MRI lesion, non-lesional MRI, non-stroke etiologies, and a history of infantile spasms. The area under the curve (AUC) of the final model was 73.0%.SignificanceOnline calculators are useful, cost-free tools that can assist physicians in risk estimation and inform joint decision-making processes with patients and families, potentially leading to greater satisfaction. Although the HOPS data was validated in the original analysis, the authors encourage external validation of this new calculator.

TI  - A case of antenatally undiagnosed laryngeal atresia with tracheo-esophageal fistula with airway obstruction at birth and its management
T2  - PEDIATRIC ANESTHESIA
AB  - Laryngeal atresia is a rare congenital anomaly that is usually diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound, however, if undiagnosed presents with desaturation after birth. A term neonate presented with airway obstruction after birth with multiple failed attempts at intubation and was rescued by proseal laryngeal mask airway (LMA). An esophagoscopy using an Ambuscope utilizing a modified connector assembly revealed an opening on the anterior wall of the esophagus with no esophageal atresia, leading to a diagnosis of H-type tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF) with laryngeal atresia. The ability to ventilate the neonate via LMA with an absent glottic opening raised the possibility of TEF.

AB  - Background and AimCeliac disease (CeD) has now become a global disease with a worldwide prevalence of 0.67%. Despite being a common disease, CeD is often not diagnosed and there is a significant delay in its diagnosis. We reviewed the impact of the delay in the diagnosis on the severity of manifestations of CeD.MethodsWe reviewed clinical records of 726 consecutive patients with CeD from the Celiac Clinic database and the National Celiac Disease Consortium database. We extracted specific data including the demographics, symptoms at presentation, time of onset of symptoms, time to diagnosis from the onset of the symptoms, and relevant clinical data including fold-rise in anti-tissue transglutaminase antibody (IgA anti-tTG Ab) and severity of villous and crypt abnormalities as assessed using modified Marsh classification.ResultsThe median duration between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis of CeD was 27 months (interquartile range 12-60 months). A longer delay in the diagnosis of CeD from the onset of symptoms was associated with lower height for age, lower hemoglobin, higher fold rise in IgA Anti tTG titers, and higher severity of villous and crypt abnormalities. About 18% of patients presented with predominantly non-gastrointestinal complaints and had a longer delay in the diagnosis of CeD.ConclusionsThere is a significant delay in the diagnosis of CeD since the onset of its symptoms. The severity of celiac disease increases with increasing delay in its diagnosis. There is a need to keep a low threshold for the diagnosis of CeD in appropriate clinical settings.

AB  - Cellular genome is considered a dynamic blueprint of a cell since it encodes genetic information that gets temporally altered due to various endogenous and exogenous insults. Largely, the extent of genomic dynamicity is controlled by the trade-off between DNA repair processes and the genotoxic potential of the causative agent (genotoxins or potential carcinogens). A subset of genotoxins form DNA adducts by covalently binding to the cellular DNA, triggering structural or functional changes that lead to significant alterations in cellular processes via genetic (e. g., mutations) or non-genetic (e. g., epigenome) routes. Identification, quantification, and characterization of DNA adducts are indispensable for their comprehensive understanding and could expedite the ongoing efforts in predicting carcinogenicity and their mode of action. In this review, we elaborate on using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based modeling in adducts biology and present multiple computational strategies to gain advancements in decoding DNA adducts. The proposed AI-based strategies encompass predictive modeling for adduct formation via metabolic activation, novel adducts' identification, prediction of biochemical routes for adduct formation, adducts' half-life predictions within biological ecosystems, and, establishing methods to predict the link between adducts chemistry and its location within the genomic DNA. In summary, we discuss some futuristic AI-based approaches in DNA adduct biology.
   While the experimental approaches are evolving, parallel computational efforts are indispensable to decode DNA adducts. This review accentuates AI's potential in various adduct biology aspects, including novel adduct identification, parent genotoxin associations, formation mechanisms, site of metabolism prediction, and genomic positioning.image

AB  - Background Exclusive enteral nutrition (EEN) supplementation of the standard of care (SOC) augments steroid responsiveness in patients with acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC). EEN is known to alter gut microbial composition. The present study investigates EEN-driven gut microbial alterations in patients with ASUC and examines their correlations with clinical parameters.Methods Stool samples from patients with ASUC (n = 44) who received either EEN-supplemented SOC (EEN group; n = 20) or SOC alone (SOC group; n = 24) for 7 days were collected at baseline (day 0) and postintervention (day 7). Microbiome analysis was carried out using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing followed by data processing using QIIME2 and R packages.Results Seven-day EEN-conjugated corticosteroid therapy in patients with ASUC enhanced the abundances of beneficial bacterial genera Faecalibacterium and Veillonella and reduced the abundance of Sphingomonas (generalized linear model fitted with Lasso regularization with robustness of 100%), while no such improvements in gut microbiota were observed in the SOC group. The EEN-associated taxa correlated with the patient's clinical parameters (serum albumin and C-reactive protein levels). Unlike the SOC group, which retained its preintervention core microbiota, EEN contributed Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a beneficial gut bacterial taxon, to the gut microbial core. EEN responders showed enhancement of Ligilactobacillus and Veillonella and reduction in Prevotella and Granulicatella. Analysis of baseline gut microbiota showed relative enhancement of certain microbial genera being associated with corticosteroid response and baseline clinical parameters and that this signature could conceivably be used as a predictive tool.Conclusions Augmentation of clinical response by EEN-conjugated corticosteroid therapy is accompanied by beneficial gut microbial changes in patients with ASUC.
   Exclusive enteral nutrition-supplemented corticosteroid therapy in acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is accompanied by the enrichment of beneficial gut microbial genera, which correlate negatively with the disease activity scores and objective inflammatory markers in ASUC. The baseline gut microbiota in ASUC associates with and may predict corticosteroid response.

AB  - Background - Pupillary assessment is an important part of the neurological assessment which provides vital information in critically ill patients. However, clinical pupillary assessment is subjective. The ultrasound-guided pupillary examination is objective. There are limited pieces of literature regarding its use in assessing patients with altered mental status. So, we studied the extent of agreement of B-mode ultrasound with clinical examination for assessment of the pupillary size and reflex in patients with altered mental status. Objectives - The primary objective was to determine the extent of agreement between clinical examination and ultrasound-based examination for assessing pupillary reflex and size in patients with altered mental status in two settings (trauma and non-trauma patients). Methods - Exactly 200 subjects (158 males, mean [range] age 43.56 [18-92 years]) with no history of partial globe rupture or dementia were included in this cross-sectional study from March 2019 to March 2020. B-mode ultrasound was performed with the subject's eyes closed using a 7-12 MHz linear probe and a standardized light stimulus. ICC score, paired t-test, kappa, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Bland-Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. Results - The clinical-USG agreement for pupillary light reflex examination (Pupillary Diameter [PD] at rest, after direct light stimulation [D-stim] and consensual light stimulation [C-stim]) was excellent (ICC, 0.93-0.96). The Kappa coefficient (0.74 +/- 0.07) showed an agreement of 87.36% between clinical and USG examination for pupillary reflex (reactive or non-reactive). Conclusion - USG-guided pupillary examination proves to be a better adjunct to neurological assessment in patients with altered mental status.

AB  - Background:Seizure freedom without deficits is the primary goal for epilepsy surgery. However, patients with medically refractory epilepsy commonly suffer from many co-morbidities related to mood, cognition, and sleep as well as social problems and resultant stigma. While epilepsy surgery literature does describe quality of life (QOL) and neuropsychological outcomes, there is a paucity of information on various common non-seizure outcomes, especially pertaining to mood, sleep, cognition, and social aspects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the role of various non-seizure parameters on post-epilepsy surgery QOL.Methods:Consecutive adult patients operated for refractory epilepsy at least 1 year prior to initiation of this study were included and classified as seizure-free (group 1) or non-seizure-free (group 2). QOL was assessed using the QOLIE-31 instrument; patients with a T score less than 40 were categorized as "poor QOL." Non-seizure parameters assessed were cognition, mood disturbances, social improvement, social stigma, and sleep disturbances. Categorization into "good" and "poor" outcome subgroups on each item was carried out by dichotomization of scores.Results:Thirty-seven patients (16 F) [mean age 23.5 +/- 5.6 years] were evaluated; 26 were seizure-free (group 1). In this group, impaired memory, lower language scores, depression, not having been employed, not receiving education prior to surgery, and experiencing social stigma were factors significantly associated with poor QOL. In group 2, all patients had poor QOL scores.Conclusion:Non-seizure factors related to common epilepsy co-morbidities and social issues are highly prevalent among seizure-free patients reporting poor QOL after epilepsy surgery.
   Chirurgie de l'epilepsie : evaluation globale des resultats et de la qualite de vie en phase postoperatoireContexte :La chirurgie de l'epilepsie vise avant tout a supprimer les crises d'epilepsie sans pour autant causer de deficit. Toutefois, les personnes atteintes d'epilepsie refractaire au traitement medical souffrent souvent de nombreux troubles comorbides qui influent sur l'humeur, la cognition et le sommeil, en plus de connaitre des problemes d'ordre social, d'ou stigmatisation. Certes, on fait etat de la qualite de vie (QV) et des resultats neuropsychologiques dans la documentation sur la chirurgie de l'epilepsie, mais il existe bien peu d'information sur d'autres parametres que les crises d'epilepsie, notamment ceux se rapportant a l'humeur, au sommeil, a la cognition et aux aspects sociaux. L'etude avait donc pour but d'evaluer l'incidence d'autres parametres que les crises d'epilepsie sur la QV, en phase postoperatoire.Methode :Ont participe a l'etude des adultes consecutifs, ayant ete operes pour de l'epilepsie refractaire au moins un an avant le debut de l'etude; ils ont ete divises en deux groupes : ceux exempts de crises d'epilepsie (groupe 1) et ceux non exempts de crises d'epilepsie (groupe 2). La QV a ete evaluee a l'aide de l'instrument QOLIE 31 [Quality Of Life In Epilepsy]; les personnes ayant un score T inferieur a 40 etaient considerees comme ayant une mauvaise qualite de vie. Les parametres evalues, differents des crises d'epilepsie, etaient la cognition, les troubles de l'humeur, l'amelioration de la situation sociale, la stigmatisation sociale et les troubles du sommeil. La categorisation des participants et participantes en deux sous-groupes selon les resultats, << bons >> ou << mauvais >>, obtenus a chacun des elements du questionnaire a ete realisee par dichotomisation.Resultats :Au total, 37 patients (16 femmes) (age moyen : 23,5 +/- 5,6 ans) ont ete evalues, parmi lesquels 26 etaient exempts de crises d'epilepsie (groupe 1). Dans ce dernier groupe, les facteurs fortement associes a une mauvaise QV etaient les troubles de la memoire, de faibles resultats au chapitre du langage, la depression, le non-emploi, l'absence de formation avant l'operation et la stigmatisation sociale. Dans le groupe 2, tous les sujets avaient obtenu des scores correspondant a une mauvaise QV.Conclusion :Les facteurs d'evaluation differents des crises d'epilepsie, relatifs a des troubles comorbides et a des problemes d'ordre social courants etaient fortement presents chez les patients exempts de crises d'epilepsie qui avaient fait etat d'une mauvaise qualite de vie en phase postoperatoire.

AB  - Purpose The upregulation of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression has been observed in various cancers, including metastatic breast carcinoma, prompting research into small molecule inhibitors for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. While the diagnostic value of PET/CT imaging using (68) Ga- or F-18-labelled FAPi-monomers in breast cancer diagnosis is well-established, there is a significant need for therapeutic analogs. This retrospective study aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.FAPi dimer radionuclide therapy in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer who had previously undergone [(68) Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans to confirm the expression of FAP.Materials and methods Between November 2020 and March 2023, a compassionate treatment approach was utilized to administer [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.FAPi dimer radionuclide therapy to heavily pretreated patients with advanced breast cancer. Nineteen patients (18 females, 1 male) with metastatic breast cancer participated in the study, with an average age of 44.6 +/- 10.7 years. The therapy was administered at intervals of 8 to 12 weeks, and the median follow-up duration was 14 months. The primary objective of the study was to assess molecular response using [(68) Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans, with response evaluation based on the PERCIST criteria. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), clinical response assessment, and safety evaluation using CTCAE v5.0 guidelines.Results A total of 65 cycles were administered, with a mean cumulative activity of 19 +/- 5.7 GBq (510 +/- 154 mCi) ranging from 11 to 33.3 GBq (300 to 900 mCi) of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.FAPi dimer. The number of cycles ranged from 2 to 6, with a median of 3 cycles. The treatment protocol consisted of different numbers of cycles administered to the patients: specifically, two cycles were given to five patients, three cycles to nine patients, four cycles to one patient, and six cycles to four patients. Most patients had invasive/infiltrative ductal carcinoma (94.7%), while a small percentage had invasive lobular carcinoma (5.3%). All patients had bone metastases, and five of them also had liver involvement, while seven had brain metastases. Response assessment using [(68) Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans showed that 25% of the 16 patients evaluated had partial remission, while 37.5% exhibited disease progression. According to the VAS response criteria, 26.3% achieved complete response, 15.7% had partial response, 42% showed minimal response, 11% had stable disease, and 5% had no response. The clinical disease control rate was promising, with 95% of patients achieving disease control. The clinical objective response rate was 84%. The median follow-up period was 14 months. At the time of analysis, the median overall survival was 12 months, and the median progression-free survival was 8.5 months. Notably, no severe hematological, renal, or hepatic toxicities, electrolyte imbalances, or adverse events of grade 3 or 4 were observed during the study.Conclusion The findings suggest that [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.FAPi dimer therapy is well-tolerated, safe, and effective for treating end-stage metastatic breast cancer patients. [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.FAPi dimer treatment demonstrated promising efficacy in patients with advanced breast cancer, as indicated by high disease control rates, favorable response outcomes, and acceptable safety profile.
   Further research and longer follow-up are warranted to assess long-term outcomes and validate these findings.

AB  - A 13-year-old female patient presented with painless vision loss and proptosis for 18 months. Imaging findings were highly suggestive of a supraorbital aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) for which she underwent complete surgical excision. Postoperatively, she developed left hemiparesis. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed right complete internal carotid arterial (ICA) thrombosis. This was managed conservatively, and she improved in hemiparesis over the next 3 weeks. Histopathology report revealed osteosarcoma with secondary ABC, for which she was referred for radiotherapy. At 1.5 months follow-up, the patient's left lower limb power improved to 4 + /5. She was walking without support, and her left upper limb power was 4/5.

AB  - Objective PSMA expression is seen in many solid tumours in addition to prostate cancer and several studies and case reports have shown PSMA expression and Ga-68-PSMA imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our prospective study evaluates the role of Ga-68-PSMA in HCC patients and compares it to conventional imaging (CE-CT/MRI).Methods Patients with radiologically and/or histopathologically confirmed HCC were included and all had undergone serum alpha-fetoprotein (S.AFP) assessment as well as CE-CT/MRI prior to PSMA PET/CT. Acquired whole-body PET/CTs were analysed both visually and quantitatively by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians.Results Forty-one (41) patients (36 male; 5 female) with known HCC and a mean age of 53.9 +/- 10.9 years underwent Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT. All patients had lesions on conventional imaging but only 38/41 patients showed Ga-68-PSMA uptake. Conventional imaging revealed 18 patients with single lesions, all of which were tracer avid. Twenty-three (23) of 41 patients had multifocal (> 2) hepatic lesions on CE-CT/MRI of which 3 patients showed no 68Ga-PSMA uptake, 7 showed tracer uptake in a single lesion only and 13 patients had multifocal tracer avid lesions. There was no correlation observed between S. AFP level and tumour SUVmax on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT.Conclusion Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT imaging of HCC may complement conventional imaging and identify patients for potential theranostic intervention.

AB  - Background Recruitment for randomized controlled trials [RCTs] in inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] has substantially dropped over time. This study aimed to assess reasons why IBD patients are not included in sponsored multicentre phase IIb-III RCTs.Methods All IOIBD members [n = 58] were invited to participate. We divided barriers to participation as follows: [1] reasons patients with active IBD were not deemed appropriate for an RCT; [2] reasons qualified patients did not wish to participate; and [3] reasons for screen failure [SF] in patients agreeing to participate. We assess these in a 4-week prospective study including, consecutively, all patients with symptomatic disease for whom a treatment change was required. In addition, we performed a 6-month retrospective study to further evaluate reasons for SF.Results A total of 106 patients (60 male [56.6%], 63 Crohn's disease [CD] [59.4%]), from ten centres across the world, were included in the prospective study. An RCT has not been proposed to 65 of them [mainly due to eligibility criteria]. Of the 41 patients to whom an RCT was offered, eight refused [mainly due to reluctance to receive placebo] and 28 agreed to participate. Among these 28 patients, five failed their screening and 23 were finally included in an RCT. A total of 107 patients (61 male [57%], 67 CD [62.6%]), from 13 centres worldwide, were included in our retrospective study of SFs. The main reason was insufficient disease activity.Conclusion This first multicentre study analysing reasons for non-enrolment in IBD RCTs shows that we lose patients at each step. Eligibility criteria, the risk of placebo assignment, and insufficient disease activity were part of the main barriers.

KW  - Preterm neonate
AB  - Neonates with absent-or-reversed umbilical artery end-diastolic flow (AREDF) are at an increased risk of feeding problems. In this retrospective study, authors evaluated the incidence of feed intolerance in 213 preterm neonates (January 2017-May 2022) with AREDF. The median (IQR) gestation and birth weight were 32 (30, 33) wk and 1120 (840, 1425) g, respectively. Of 213 neonates, 103 (48.4%; 95% CI 41.5%, 55.3%) neonates developed feed intolerance. Twelve of 213 neonates developed any stage necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (5.6%; 95% CI 2.9%, 9.6%) at a median age of 10 d. On multivariate regression, gestation was the only independent predictor of feed intolerance (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.28, 1.70; for every 1 wk decrease below 36 wk). Almost 50% of preterm neonates with AREDF develop feed intolerance. Alternative feeding strategies warrant exploration to optimise nutrition in these neonates.

AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) serve as molecular targets for the development of novel personalized therapies in many malignancies. In the present study, expression pattern of receptor tyrosine kinases and its clinical significance in orbital RMS has been explored. Eighteen patients with histopathologically confirmed orbital RMS formed part of this study. Comprehensive q-PCR gene expression profiles of 19 RTKs were generated in the cases and controls. The patients were followed up for 59.53 +/- 20.93 years. Clustering and statistical analysis tools were applied to identify the significant combination of RTKs associated with orbital rhabdomyosarcoma patients. mRNA overexpression of RTKs which included MET, AXL, EGFR was seen in 60-80% of cases; EGFR3, IGFR2, FGFR1, RET, PDGFR1, VEGFR2, PDGFR2 in 30-60% of cases; and EGFR4, FGFR3,VEGFR3 and ROS,IGFR1, EGFR1, FGFR2, VEGFR1 in 10-30% of cases. Immunoexpression of MET was seen in 89% of cases. A significant association was seen between MET mRNA and its protein expression. In all the cases MET gene expression was associated with worst overall survival (P = 0.03).There was a significant correlation of MET mRNA expression with RET, ROS, AXL, FGFR1, FGFR3, PDGFR1, IGFR1, VEGFR2, and EGFR3 genes. Association between MET gene and collective expression of RTKs was further evaluated by semi-supervised gene cluster analysis and Principal component analysis, which showed well-separated tumor clusters. MET gene overexpression could be a useful biomarker for identifying high risk orbital rhabdomyosarcoma patients. Well-separated tumor clusters confirmed the association between MET gene and collective expression of RTK genes. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of multi-kinase inhibitors targeting MET and the 9 other significant RTKs needs to be explored.

AB  - IntroductionMultiple synchronous spinal extradural arachnoid cysts are extremely rare in children and can lead to cord compression and disability. Multiple spinal extradural arachnoid cysts (SEDACs) in children with immature and growing spine need to be studied separately from multiple SEDACs in adults with mature and fully grown spine because of multiple surgical limitations in children (blood loss, surgery duration, long-term spinal stability after long segment exposure, etc.).Material and methodsWe planned a non-systematic literature review of similar cases described in literature to analyse the pattern of presentation, management, and outcome of this surgically curable disease.ResultsA total of 28 cases of paediatric multiple SEDACs in the age range of 5 months to 17 years and mean age of 11.54 years were analysed. Exposure was achieved by laminectomy in 9, laminoplastic laminotomy in 13, laminectomy in first surgery followed by laminoplasty in second surgery (re-exploration) in 1, hemilaminectomy in 2, and technique "not reported" in 3 children. Complete/near-complete recovery was seen in 27 (96.42%) children. Postoperative spine deformity was reported in 7 (25%) children and was progressive in 2 children during serial follow-up.ConclusionsSymptomatic multiple synchronous SEDACs in children is a rare surgically curable condition. Sincere attempt to find out a dural defect in all cysts is a very important step in multiple SEDAC surgery. Total cyst wall excision with closure of all dural defects is the gold standard treatment for symptomatic cases. Laminoplasty is preferred for excision of multiple SEDACs in children to prevent postoperative spine deformity during long-term follow-up. Long serial follow-up for postoperative spine deformity is necessary.

AB  - An intronic bi-allelic pentanucleotide repeat expansion mutation, (AAGGG)(400-2000), at AAAAG repeat locus in RFC1 gene, is known as underlying genetic cause in cases with cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia syndrome (CANVAS) and late-onset sporadic ataxia. Biallelic positive cases carry a common recessive risk haplotype, "AAGA," spanning RFC1 gene. In this study, our aim is to find prevalence of bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) in Indian ataxia and other neurological disorders and investigate the complexity of RFC1 repeat locus and its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases in Indian population-based cohorts. We carried out repeat number and repeat type estimation using flanking PCR and repeat primed PCR (AAAAG/AAAGG/AAGGG) in four Indian disease cohorts and healthy controls. Haplotype assessment of suspected cases was done by genotyping and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Blood samples and consent of all the cases and detailed clinical details of positive cases were collected in collaboration with A.I.I.M.S. Furthermore, comprehension of RFC1 repeat locus and risk haplotype analysis in Indian background was performed on the NGS data of Indian healthy controls by ExpansionHunter, ExpansionHunter Denovo, and PHASE analysis, respectively. Genetic screening of RFC1-TNR locus in 1998 uncharacterized cases (SCA12: 87; uncharacterized ataxia: 1818, CMT: 93) and 564 heterogenous controls showed that the frequency of subjects with bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) are 1.15%, < 0.05%, 2.15%, and 0% respectively. Two RFC1 positive sporadic late-onset ataxia cases, one bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp) and another, (AAAGG)(similar to 700)/(AAGGG)(exp), had recessive risk haplotype and CANVAS symptoms. Long normal alleles, 15-27, are significantly rare in ataxia cohort. In IndiGen control population (IndiGen; N = 1029), long normal repeat range, 15-27, is significantly associated with A(3)G(3) and some rare repeat motifs, AGAGG, AACGG, AAGAG, and AAGGC. Risk-associated "AAGA" haplotype of the original pathogenic expansion of A(2)G(3) was found associated with the A(3)G(3) representing alleles in background population. Apart from bi-allelic (AAGGG)(exp), we report cases with a new pathogenic expansion of (AAAGG)(exp)/(AAGGG)(exp) in RFC1 and recessive risk haplotype. We found different repeat motifs at RFC1 TNR locus, like AAAAG, AAAGG, AAAGGG, AAAAGG, AAGAG, AACGG, AAGGC, AGAGG, and AAGGG, in Indian background population except ACAGG and (AAAGG)(n)/(AAGGG)(n). Our findings will help in further understanding the role of long normal repeat size and different repeat motifs, specifically AAAGG, AAAGGG, and other rare repeat motifs, at the RFC1 locus.

AB  - Background While the frequency of islet antibody-negative (idiopathic) type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is reported to be increased in Indian children, its aetiology has not been studied. We investigated the role of monogenic diabetes in the causation of islet antibody-negative T1DM.Methods We conducted a multicenter, prospective, observational study of 169 Indian children (age 1-18 years) with recent-onset T1DM. All were tested for antibodies against GAD65, islet antigen-2, and zinc transporter 8 using validated ELISA. Thirty-four islet antibody-negative children underwent targeted next-generation sequencing for 31 genes implicated in monogenic diabetes using the Illumina platform. All mutations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing.Results Thirty-five (21%) children were negative for all islet antibodies. Twelve patients (7% of entire cohort, 34% of patients with islet antibody-negative T1DM) were detected to have pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variants. The most frequently affected locus was WFS1, with 9 patients (5% of entire cohort, 26% of islet antibody-negative). These included 7 children with homozygous and 1 patient each with a compound heterozygous and heterozygous mutation. Children with Wolfram syndrome 1 (WS) presented with severe insulin-requiring diabetes (including 3 patients with ketoacidosis), but other syndromic manifestations were not detected. In 3 patients, heterozygous mutations in HNF4A, ABCC8, and PTF1A loci were detected.Conclusion Nearly one-quarter of Indian children with islet antibody-negative T1DM had recessive mutations in the WFS1 gene. These patients did not exhibit other features of WS at the time of diagnosis. Testing for monogenic diabetes, especially WS, should be considered in Indian children with antibody-negative T1DM.

AB  - Background: The revised Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI)-2 is a self-report measure to assess the suicide crisis syndrome (SCS). We aimed to assess the factor structure, reliability, and validity of SCI-2 among adults with major depression.Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, between November 2021 and August 2022, the Hindi SCI-2, along with other self-report measures, was administered to Indian adult respondents clinically diagnosed with major depression across 24 centers in India. Confirmatory factor analysis was carried out to test the factor structure of SCI-2. Additionally, convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity were tested using bivariate or biserial correlations, as appropriate.Results: We obtained responses from 654 participants (Mean age = 36.9 +/- 11.9 years, 50.2 % female). The SCI-2 fit both a one-factor (chi(2)[1769] = 14,150.74, p < .001, CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.10), and five-factor solution (chi(2)[1759] = 13,130.83, p < .001,CFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.10) with the five-factor solution providing a significantly better fit. Internal consistencies of the SCI-2 total and subscale scores ranged from good to excellent. Most subscales significantly converged with each other and with other relevant measures although these associations were weak for thwarted belongingness and goal reengagement subscales. Small to moderate associations were noted in support of discriminant and criterion validity.Limitations: We could not assess the predictive validity of SCI-2 for suicidal behaviors.Conclusion: Consistent with prior data, the Hindi SCI-2 fit a five-factor solution and showed good psychometric properties. These findings support the use of SCI-2 to assess SCS among Indian adults with major depression.

AB  - Background: Schools are a valuable platform for oral health promotion and the role of school nurse is critical in promoting oral health of children. A training program was carried out to assess its effectiveness in promoting oral health among school nurses of Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), one of the largest groups of central schools in India.Methodology. A total of 557 school nurses of Navodaya Vidyalaya schools participated in the training program. The training was delivered virtually using didactic teaching methods based on a conceptual framework. Pre and post knowledge scores were assessed for all the participants.Results: A total of 451 pre-post complete responses were received during training program, with a response rate of 81 %. There was significant improvement in the overall knowledge scores (p < 0.001) of school nurses. After the training program was completed, oral health screening and education for students was conducted by these trained nurses in coordination with teachers in their respective schools.Conclusion: The present training program was effective in addressing the gaps in oral health knowledge of the school nurses and significantly improving their oral health knowledge.

AB  - We present updated, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the Indian Society of Pediatric Nephrology (ISPN) for the management of urinary tract infection (UTI) and primary vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) in children. These guidelines conform to international standards; Institute of Medicine and AGREE checklists were used to ensure transparency, rigor, and thoroughness in the guideline development. In view of the robust methodology, these guidelines are applicable globally for the management of UTI and VUR. Seventeen recommendations and 18 clinical practice points have been formulated. Some of the key recommendations and practice points are as follows. Urine culture with > 10(4) colony forming units/mL is considered significant for the diagnosis of UTI in an infant if the clinical suspicion is strong. Urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite can be used as an alternative screening test to urine microscopy in a child with suspected UTI. Acute pyelonephritis can be treated with oral antibiotics in a non-toxic infant for 7-10 days. An acute-phase DMSA scan is not recommended in the evaluation of UTI. Micturating cystourethrography (MCU) is indicated in children with recurrent UTI, abnormal kidney ultrasound, and in patients below 2 years of age with non-E. coli UTI. Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan (DMSA scan) is indicated only in children with recurrent UTI and high-grade (3-5) VUR. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated in children with a normal urinary tract after UTI. Prophylaxis is recommended to prevent UTI in children with bladder bowel dysfunction (BBD) and those with high-grade VUR. In children with VUR, prophylaxis should be stopped if the child is toilet trained, free of BBD, and has not had a UTI in the last 1 year. Surgical intervention in high-grade VUR can be considered for parental preference over antibiotic prophylaxis or in children developing recurrent breakthrough febrile UTIs on antibiotic prophylaxis.

AB  - Platelet activation and related cardiovascular complications are the hallmarks of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We investigated the mechanism of platelet activation in T2D using MS-based identification of differentially expressed platelet proteins with a focus on glycosylated forms. Glycosylation is considered one of the common post-translational modifications in T2D, and N/O-linked glycosylation of glycoproteins (GPs)/integrins is known to play crucial roles in platelet activation. Our platelet proteome data revealed elevated levels of GPs GPIb alpha, GPIIbIIIa, GPIV (CD36), GPV and integrins in T2D patients. T2D platelets had elevated N-linked glycosylation of CD36 at asparagine (Asn)(408,417) . Enrichment analysis revealed a close association of glycosylated CD36 with thrombospondin-1, fibrinogen and SERPINA1 in T2D platelets. The glycosylation of CD36 has previously been reported to increase cellular uptake of long-chain fatty acids. Our in silico molecular docking data also showed a favorable binding of cholesterol with glycosylated Asn(417) CD36 compared to the non-glycosylated form. We further investigated the CD36:LDL cholesterol axis in T2D. Elevated levels of oxidized-low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) were found to cause significant platelet activation via CD36-mediated stimulation of Lyn-JNK signaling. Sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, an inhibitor of CD36, effectively inhibited oxLDL-mediated platelet activation and adhesion in vitro. Our study suggests increased glycosylation of CD36 in T2D platelets as a potential route for oxLDL-mediated platelet activation. The oxLDL:CD36 axis may thus be exploited as a prospective target to develop therapeutics against thrombosis in T2D.

AB  - Introduction: The development of aminoglycoside modifying enzymes (AMEs) and increased efflux activity are considered important aminoglycosides resistance mechanisms. Aim.: This study is focused on the detection of the AMEs gene and assessing the effect of efflux pump inhibitor on the reversal of A. baumannii drug susceptibility. Methodology: Bacterial DNA was amplified using AMEs gene-specific primers. Isolates were also investigated for efflux pump activity using efflux pump inhibitor (EPI) i.e. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) and the impact of both mechanisms was analyzed. Results: Among A. baumannii isolates, 55% isolates (n = 22/40) were identified to have aminoglycoside modifying enzymes genes; ant(3 ')-I gene (50%, 11/22), aac(6 ')-Ib gene (45.4%, 10/22), aph(3 ')-I gene (18.1%, 4/22) and aac(3)-I (9.1%, 2/22). Total 70% isolates have shown MIC alteration in different classes of drugs in response to EPI-CCCP. Such alteration was found in 100% amikacin sensitive and 58.6% amikacin resistant, 93.7% and 57.1% gentamicin sensitive and resistant isolates respectively. Conclusion: The presence of aminoglycosides modifying enzymes was frequent among aminoglycosides resistant A. baumannii isolates and the coexistence of efflux pumps activity also plays an important role to increase drug resistance.

AB  - Introduction: Endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; and it plays a central role in the development of cardiovascular diseases and many types of human diseases (diabetes, kidney failure, cancer, and viral infections). Strategies that are effective in protecting vascular endothelial function and retard or reversing endothelial dysfunction in the early stage appear to be potential in the prevention of vascular, cardiac, and many human diseases. Several studies have been carried out on the effects of yoga on endothelial function, but the results of these studies have not been synthesized. This study aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of yoga on endothelial function.Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that assessed the effect of yoga practice on vascular endothelial function was done as per the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane controlled register of trials (CENTRAL) were searched from inception to August 2022. The search strategy was constructed around yoga-based techniques and endothelial function. All the yoga-based interventional studies on endothelial function or dysfunction were included in this review. A narrative synthesis and descriptive analysis were done due to the diverse methodology of selected studies. We carried out a formal meta-analysis of controlled trials that assessed the effect of yoga on flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), a measure of endothelial function.Results: A total of 18 studies were included for review involving 1043 participants. Yoga training showed improved endothelial function in 12 studies, whereas 6 studies did not find any statistically robust effect. Meta-analysis (n = 395 participants, 6-studies, 7 comparisons) showed an increase in brachial FMD by yoga practice (mean difference = -1.23%; 95% confidence interval -2.23 to -0.23; p = 0.02). The heterogeneity between the studies was 43% (Tau2 = 0.70, chi 2 = 10.49). The risk of bias was low to moderate in these studies. No adverse effects were reported.Conclusions: Yoga practice improved endothelial function. Yoga could be a safe and potential integrative medicine to improve endothelial function. However, as the statistical heterogeneity, that is, variation in the FMD among the studies was moderate, large clinical trials are necessary for its clinical recommendations.

AB  - Many optical techniques have been used in various diagnostics and biomedical applications since a decade and polarization imaging is one of the non-invasive and label free optical technique to investigate biological samples making it an important tool in diagnostics, biomedical applications. We report a multispectral polarization-based imaging of oral tissue by utilizing a polarization microscope system with a broadband-light source. Experiments were performed on oral tissue samples and multispectral Stokes mapping was done by recording a set of intensity images. Polarization-based parameters like degree of polarization, angle of fast axis, retardation and linear birefringence have been retrieved. The statistical moments of these polarization components have also been reported at multiples wavelengths. The polarimetric properties of oral tissue at different stages of cancer have been analyzed and significant changes from normal to pre-cancerous lesions to the cancerous are observed in linear birefringence quantification as (1.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-3), (2.5 +/- 0.2) x 10(-3) and (3.3 +/- 0.2) x 10(-3) respectively.

AB  - Background and Objective: The early diagnosis of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is of prime importance to improve the patient's survivability and quality of life. Being a heterogeneous disease at the molecular and cellular level, the biomarkers responsible for the heterogeneity aid in distinguishing NSCLC into its prominent subtypes-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Moreover, if identified, these biomarkers could pave the path to targeted therapy. Through this work, a novel explainable AI (XAI)-guided deep learning framework is proposed that assists in discovering a set of significant NSCLC-relevant biomarkers using methylation data.Methods: The proposed framework is divided into two blocks- the first block combines an autoencoder and a neural network to classify NSCLC instances. The second block utilizes various eXplainable AI (XAI) methods, namely IntegratedGradients, GradientSHAP, and DeepLIFT, to discover a set of seven significant biomarkers.Results: The classification performance of the biomarkers discovered using the proposed framework is evaluated by employing multiple machine learning algorithms, among which the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm based model outperforms others, yielding a 10-fold cross-validation accuracy of 91.53%. An improved accuracy of 96.37% is achieved by integrating RNA-Seq, CNV, and methylation data. On performing statistical analysis using the Friedman and Nemenyi tests, the MLP model is found to be significantly better than other machine learning-based models. Further, the clinical efficacy of the resultant biomarkers is established based on their potential druggability, the likelihood of predicting NSCLC patients' survival, gene-disease association, and biological pathways targeted by them. While the biomarkers C18orf18, CCNT2, THOP1, and TNPO2, are found potentially druggable, the biomarkers CCDC15, SNORA9, THOP1, and TNPO2 are found prognostically relevant. On further analysis, some of the discovered biomarkers are found to be associated with around 104 diseases. Moreover, five KEGG, ten Reactome, and three Wiki pathways are found to be triggered by the biomarkers discovered.Conclusion: In summary, the proposed framework uncovers a set of clinically effective biomarkers that accurately classify NSCLC. As a future course of work, efforts would be made to combine a variety of omics data with histopathological data to unveil more precise biomarkers for devising personalized therapy.

AB  - Background: Ventilating a pediatric patient during thoracoscopy is challenging. Few studies have highlighted the impact of capnothorax in children by measuring regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rcSO(2)) with near infrared spectroscopy. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarize the data from relevant studies and assess whether thoracoscopy in children is associated with intraoperative pathological cerebral desaturation.
   Methods: The authors systematically searched four databases for relevant studies on the measurement of rcSO(2) during pediatric thoracoscopic procedures. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with pathological desaturation, that is, >20% decline in the intraoperative rcSO(2). Risk of bias among the included studies was estimated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
   Results: The systematic search resulted in 776 articles, of which 7 studies were included in the analysis. In total, 88 patients (99 procedures) with an age ranging from 0 days to 8.1 years were included. Of these, 43 (49%) patients were neonates. The included cohort had esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula (n=26), long-gap esophageal atresia (n=5), congenital diaphragmatic hernia (n=14), and congenital pulmonary airway malformations and other conditions needing lung resection (n=43). Of the total 99 procedures, pathological desaturation was noticed in 13 (13.1%, 95% confidence interval 7.2-21.4) of them. Upon quality assessment, most of the studies were weaker in the selection and comparability domains.
   Conclusion: In this review, pathological cerebral desaturation was noticed in 13.1% of the pediatric thoracoscopic procedures. However, due to limited methodological quality of the included studies, further randomized multicentric studies comparing rcSO(2) in open versus thoracoscopic surgeries are needed to derive definitive conclusions.

AB  - BackgroundThis systematic review evaluated the available medical literature on the prevalence and trends of waterpipe tobacco smoking among adolescents and youth in jurisdictionally representative populations.MethodsPubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched for relevant studies from inception until 31 December 2022 that reported the burden of waterpipe smoking among adolescents and youth (10-24 years of age). We extracted qualitative data on the demographic characteristics, burden, and correlates of waterpipe smoking (PROSPERO ID: CRD42022310982).ResultsA total of 2,197 articles were screened and 62 were included in the analysis. The majority (29) of the studies was from the United States of America and there were no studies from the south-east Asian region. The prevalence of ever waterpipe smoking among the 10-24 years age group was noted to be 18.16% (95% CI, 18.03-18.29). The prevalence of current (30-day) waterpipe smoking was 6.43% (95% CI, 6.34-6.50). The age of initiation of waterpipe smoking was variable. The prevalence of waterpipe smoking was higher among males, among those who belong to the high- and middle-income groups, and among university students. The common risk factors of waterpipe smoking included cigarette smoking, alcohol, and substance use. Waterpipe smoking resulted in increased susceptibility to the use of conventional forms of tobacco (e.g. smoking) among those who were never smokers.ConclusionWaterpipe smoking usage was significantly high among adolescents and young adults. Developing regulatory guidelines for water-pipe smoking, surveillance of its use, intervention, and specific policy frameworks may be considered a public health priority.

AB  - Cow's milk allergy refers to an immunological reaction to milk protein. It is one of the commonest food protein allergies with an estimated prevalence of 0.5% to 3% at 1 y of life. The disease may be IgE or non-IgE mediated or mixed with a wide range of symptoms often involving multiple organ systems. Gastrointestinal manifestations are common in non-IgE disease and may consist of enteropathy, proctocolitis, colic, reflux-like symptoms, constipation, enterocolitis syndrome and eosinophilic esophagitis. The gold standard for diagnosis remains a double-blind placebo-controlled oral challenge. Specific IgE and skin prick tests may predict severe and persistent disease, and aid in deciding on reintroduction or oral immunotherapy; however, they do not contribute to a definitive diagnosis as they indicate only sensitization. In practice, an elimination diet followed by open challenge under medical supervision is often used for diagnosis except when symptoms are severe such as anaphylaxis. Management consists of the elimination of the allergen with resolution of symptoms between 1-4 wk later depending on the type of allergy. Extensively hydrolyzed and Amino acid formulas are used to substitute milk in infants. Soy-based formulas are often utilized in resource-limited settings. Tolerance to the protein develops over time and periodic reintroduction should be attempted every six months after the initial one year of elimination diet. Oral immunotherapy is a newer treatment technique for IgE-mediated disease. There is no firm evidence on prevention apart from recommending breast feeding in early life along with initiating complementary feeding between 4-6 mo age.

AB  - Objective: Computer vision syndrome is a major global public health concern affecting >60 million individuals globally. Yoga and naturopathy practices can reduce visual fatigue and strain. The present study attempted to explore the effect of trataka that is, a yogic cleansing technique and cold eye pack on visual strain and fatigue. Subjects: Three hundred volunteers from an IT company were recruited following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Intervention: The subjects were randomly distributed in three groups, that is, trataka, cold eye pack, and waitlist control group with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. Outcome measure: Visual Fatigue Scale and Visual symptoms checklist (VSC) was administered at baseline and end of 2 weeks. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA) with Bonferroni corrections was used to test the difference across the groups. Results: All the variables were similar at the baseline among the groups. Significant changes in the within-group analysis occurred in both the trataka and cold eye pack groups. The RM-ANOVA revealed significant differences in the VAS and VSC (p=0.001) and the post hoc analysis suggested that there were significant differences in both the trataka and cold eye pack group when compared with the control group (p=0.001); however, there was no differences between the trataka and cold eye pack group in both the scales (p=1). Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that a trataka and cold eye pack for 14 days improves self-rated visual strain and fatigue among IT professionals with computer vision syndrome.

AB  - A cluster randomized control trial study was conducted in Ballabgarh block of Faridabad District, Haryana, India. Baseline data of a total of 198 non-anemic and 202 anemic adolescent girls (12-19 years) was analyzed for hemoglobin and serum level of hepcidin, ferritin, folate acid, soluble transferrin receptor, vitamin B-12 and CRP. Deficiency of iron (p < 0.001), folate (p < 0.01) and their mixed deficiency (p < 0.001) significantly increased with increasing severity of anaemia and contributed to 48.7% mild anaemia and 66.9% moderate anaemia. Anaemia of inflammation contributed to 16.2% of mild anaemia and 11.7% of moderate anaemia. More than one third of mild anaemia is caused by other causes. Current iron and folic acid program can alleviate around more than 2/3rd moderate anaemia and around half of mild anaemia among adolescent girls. Unknown causes of anaemia need further investigation.

AB  - Standard urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosing urinary tract infections (UTIs) but fails to differentiate true UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, which is important to prevent the overuse of antibiotics. Correlation with the presence or absence of pyuria can be helpful in giving a hint of the true situation. With the help of Laboratory Information System (LIS), patients' urinalysis reports can be conveniently accessed and compared simultaneously with appropriate reports. In our study, a quality improvement initiative was planned for appropriate reporting of urine culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using information obtained through LIS.

AB  - BackgroundSchool-based oral health education has emerged as one of the most effective methods to instill a positive attitude toward oral health in children.AimThis systematic review (SR) aimed to assess the effectiveness of different methods of oral health education in children and adolescents.DesignSystematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, LILACS, Scopus, and EMBASE on January 29, 2023. Review included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and their risk of bias (ROB) was assessed by Cochrane RoB-2. Data were extracted and analyzed by expert group. The GRADE approach was used to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome. Every step was conducted in duplicate, and disagreements were resolved by consulting the third reviewer.ResultsThe SR included 10 RCTs with majority showing a high ROB. They included 12 methods with the commonest being the use of leaflets/flash cards. Most interventions were effective in improving oral hygiene, gingival health, and knowledge except conventional teaching methods, lecture by using PowerPoint by dentists, and e-learning interventions. The grade of evidence in the majority of outcomes was found to be low or very low.ConclusionInterventions using the interactive methods such as games, motivational-experiential learning, and audiovisual methods were found to be more effective than controls and other interventions. Variabilities in study methods and outcome variables must be addressed in the future.

AB  - Background: Claudin-4, a tight junction associated protein expressed in epithelial cells, is purported as a highly specific and sensitive marker for epithelial malignancies. Our aim was to assess the sensitivity, specificity and real-time utility of claudin-4 immunocytochemistry (ICC) in the diagnostic work-up of suspected malignant effusions.Methods: Claudin-4 (3E2C1 clone) ICC was performed prospectively in effusion cell blocks where other ICC markers were being performed as part of reporting over 3 months. Based on claudin-4 staining in unequivocal malignant and reactive effusions, the sensitivity and specificity was calculated. In cases signed out as inconclusive encompassing atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) and suspicious for malignancy (SFM) and negative for malignancy, change in diagnostic category based on addition of claudin-4 ICC was assessed.Results: Study included 107 effusions. Claudin-4 stained 100% of metastatic adenocarcinomas including those with primaries in lung, breast, ovary, female genital tract, gastrointestinal tract and pancreatic-biliary tract, and was negative in all reactive mesothelial and mesothelioma effusions with sensitivity of 100% (48/48) and specificity of 95% (20/21) for adenocarcinoma. Claudin-4 upgraded the diagnostic category to positive in 70% (16/23) of SFM, 20% (1/5) of AUS, and in 50% (5/10) of negative effusions. Among cases with confirmed serosal involvement status on follow-up, claudin-4 showed sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values of 85% (11/13), 100% (3/3), 100% (10/10) and 75% (3/4), respectively, for metastatic adenocarcinoma.Conclusion: Claudin-4 as a single marker is sensitive and specific for adenocarcinoma and is a valuable addition to the ICC armamentarium.

AB  - The objective of this study was to describe the clinical spectrum of primary localized bladder amyloidosis (PLBA), its management options, outcomes, and follow-up. We retrospectively reviewed our medical records for patients with PLBA between April 2013 and April 2021. Patient's demographics, imaging, cystoscopic characteristics, treatment, and outcomes were recorded and analyzed. Serum and urine electrophoresis, abdominal fat aspiration, and rectal biopsy results where available were also recorded. We identified 20 patients with PLBA with a median age of 56 years. Hematuria (80%) was the most common symptom followed by irritative lower urinary tract symptoms (iLUTS) (50%). The bladder lesions were focal, multiple, and diffuse in 4 (20%), 14 (70%), and 2 (10%) patients, respectively. All patients had transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, except for 4 patients with exclusive iLUTS who had cold cup biopsy. At a median follow-up of 43.9 months, 4 patients (20%) developed recurrence with median time to recurrence being 19 months. All the recurrences were managed endoscopically by re-resection and none of the patients required radical surgery. PLBA is a rare entity with varied clinical presentations. Although histologically benign, recurrences can occur and require long-term cystoscopic surveillance.

AB  - Lung cancer is listed as one of the hotfooted malignancies on the basis of mortality and morbidity. Thus, emergence of new targeting and immunotherapies is being recognized that later invited drug resistance. Therefore, a new strategic formulation of phytochemicals as potent antitumor has been beautifully adapted. Elimination of cancer cells preferentially through cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with negligible toxic effects seems to be the major theme in cancer treatment. Recently, the application of phytochemical-derived conjugated chemotherapeutic agents is gaining preference due to their biocompatibility, low cytotoxicity, low resistance and dynamic physico-chemical properties that discriminate normal cells from treated populations. A systematic evaluation of biological interactions of functional phytocompounds with respect to their synthetic counterparts always receives priority from entry, biodistribution, cellular/molecular interactions to excretion. Nanotechnology has revolutionized cancer therapy, including lung cancer. Tissue-specific phyto-nanomedicines using liposomes, micelles and nanoparticles as precise and effective delivery vehicles are making regular breakthroughs in the field of diagnostics. This article precisely summarizes the achievements by Food and Drug Administration, USA approved therapeutic phytomolecules in conjugation with phyto-chemopreventives for clinical trials. Furthermore, it justifies, how the selection of nanocarriers and the best pair of phytomedicine/chemodrugs are important determinants of therapy benefits. In addition, a detailed coverage is given to describe the long journey of phytochemicals in synergy with chemo-preventive from agro-field to medical field and their graceful transformation on the platform of nanotechnology as an anticancer drug. However, it is equally important to address current challenges and future perspectives.

AB  - Globally, helminthiasis is one of the most prevalent causes of mortality and morbidity and threatens humans and livestock. An effective anthelmintic vaccine is also lacking. As a result, nematode infections are mostly treated with chemotherapy, such as benzimidazoles, but due to drug resistance, their effectiveness is limited.This review focuses on previously synthesized benzimidazole derivatives and their structure-activity relationships related to effectiveness in treating helminthiasis. For example, structural modifications have been introduced in developing benzimidazole-based drugs for helminthiasis chemotherapy at positions 2, 5, or 6, whereas positions 4 and 7 should not be altered. For benzimidazole to be effective as an anthelmintic, it must have a free hydrogen atom at its 1-position.Using the results of this review as a guide, we have proposed designs that will allow the development of more effective and less toxic drugs for helminthiasis chemotherapy. Despite this, a better understanding of parasite biochemistry and host-parasite interactions is necessary to develop innovative lead molecules with greater efficacy.

AB  - ObjectivesTo explore the efficacy of combination of Bhramari pranayama and om chanting as an adjunct to standard pharmacological treatment on asthma control, quality of life, pulmonary function, and airway inflammation in asthmatic children.MethodsChildren (n = 110; 8-15 years) with uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma were recruited from the Pediatric Chest Clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Eligible participants were randomized to either home-based online Bhramari pranayama and om chanting plus standard treatment (YI + ST) group, or standard treatment (ST) alone group. Primary outcome measures were 12-week change in level of asthma symptom control; asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score, spirometry indices, impulse oscillometry parameters, and pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) score. Secondary outcome was a change in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels at 12 weeks. Beginning from the enrollment, every participant was evaluated at 0, 2, 6, and 12 weeks.ResultsAfter 12 weeks of intervention, higher proportion (68.2%) of children were found to have controlled asthma symptoms in the YI + ST group as compared to ST group (38.5%) according to per protocol analysis (p = 0.03). When compared to ST group, children in YI + ST group showed significantly lower ACQ score, higher PAQLQ score and reduced FeNO levels. No significant changes were observed for the lung function parameters.ConclusionChildren practicing Bhramari pranayama and om chanting for 12 weeks have better asthma symptom control, quality of life, and reduced airway inflammation than those taking standard pharmacotherapy alone.

AB  - ObjectivesTo study the impact of carbohydrate counting vs. fixed-meal plan on glycemic control, quality of life (QoL) and diabetes-related emotional distress in children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).MethodsChildren aged 6-18 y with T1DM of duration >1 y were eligible for the study if they were on multiple daily injections of insulin and regularly monitoring blood glucose. Those with celiac disease, hypothyroidism, any underlying chronic renal/liver/systemic disease or HbA1c >13% were excluded. Both groups received education on diabetes management and healthy diet. In the intervention arm, parents were taught to quantify carbohydrate content and modify insulin doses according to insulin-carbohydrate ratio. The control arm had dietary prescription according to recommended dietary allowance and food exchange list. Standard validated questionnaires were used to assess the QoL and emotional distress related to diabetes.ResultsOne hundred twenty five patients (61 intervention, 64 controls) were enrolled and 91.8% and 84.3%, respectively, completed 6-mo follow-up. There was a reduction in HbA1c in both the groups, but was not statistically significant within or between groups {Intervention: 8.9 (1.4) to 8.6 (1.5) vs. control: 9.1 (1.6) to 8.8 (1.9), [95% CI 8.3-9.3 vs. 8.3-9.0, intention to treat (ITT), p = 0.63]}. There was a significant reduction in diabetes distress in the intervention group; DAWN Problem Areas in Diabetes Questionnaire (PAID) score with a median (interquartile range) of 21 (11-33) vs. control: 27 (20-40), (p = 0.04).ConclusionsPatients in the carbohydrate-counting group demonstrated lower diabetes distress scores and less emotional burnout compared to fixed-meal plan over a 6 mo period though overall glycemic control was comparable between groups.

AB  - The present study comprehensively evaluates the postnatal growth, hematology, telomere length, and semen attributes of multiple clones and re-clone derived from superior buffalo breeding bulls. To the best of our knowledge, we successfully produced multiple clones and a re-clone of an earlier cloned buffalo bull from an embryo developed from an adult bull's skin-derived cell for the first time. The cloned bulls' growth, blood he-matology, plasma biochemistry, and telomere length were all shown to be normal at various stages of devel-opment. The bulls were used for semen production after being screened for testicular growth and training. Semen characteristics such as volume, concentration, and initial motility of fresh sperm as well as motility and kinetics characteristics such as straightness (STR), average lateral head displacement (ALH), and beat cross frequency (BCF) of frozen-thawed sperms of the cloned bulls were found to be similar to those of non-cloned bulls, including the donor bulls. Additionally, it was found that cloned bulls' functional sperm attributes, including acrosome intactness, mitochondrial membrane potential, and superoxide anion status, were comparable to those of non-cloned bulls. These characteristics are necessary for sperm to pass through the female reproductive sys-tem, penetrate the oocyte, and efficiently fertilize. Finally, this study adds to our understanding of the postnatal development, hematology, telomere length, and sperm characteristics of superior buffalo breeding bulls that have been cloned and re-cloned. The findings provide the groundwork for improving cloning practices, refining reproductive procedures, and optimizing the use of cloned genetic material in animal breeding and conservation.

AB  - BackgroundAneurysmal bone cyst is composed of variable -sized cystic blood-filled spaces separated by connective tissue septae. First-line surgical resection of spinal aneurysmal bone cyst in a child with limited total blood volume can lead to massive intraoperative bleeding, thus limiting extent of resection. Our Centre's has good experience of using absolute alcohol as an effective immediate devascularizing agent during vertebral hemangioma surgery in children.Material and methodsWe report the first case of pediatric lumbar primary aneurysmal bone cyst in which completely blood-less piecemeal total resection of the lesion was performed after intraoperative absolute alcohol intralesional sclerotherapy.ResultsCompletely blood-less piecemeal total resection of the lumbar aneurysmal bone cyst was performed after intraoperative absolute alcohol intralesional sclerotherapy.ConclusionIntraoperative absolute alcohol intralesional sclerotherapy is a very effective devascularizing adjunct for complete piecemeal resection of spinal aneurysmal bone cyst in children with limited blood volume.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus and central obesity are more common among South Asian populations than among White British people. This study explores the differences in diabetes and obesity in South Asians with stroke living in the United Kingdom, India, and Qatar compared with White British stroke patients.Methods: The study included the UK, Indian, and Qatari arms of the ongoing large Bio-Repository of DNA in Stroke (BRAINS) international prospective hospital-based study for South Asian stroke. BRAINS includes 4580 South Asian and White British recruits from UK, Indian, and Qatar sites with first-ever ischemic stroke.Results: The study population comprises 1751 White British (WB) UK residents, 1165 British South Asians (BSA), 1096 South Asians in India (ISA), and 568 South Asians in Qatar (QSA). ISA, BSA, and QSA South Asians suffered from higher prevalence of diabetes compared with WB by 14.5% (ISA: 95% confidence interval (CI) = 18.6-33.0, p < 0.001), 31.7% (BSA: 95% CI = 35.1-50.2, p < 0.001), and 32.7% (QSA: 95% CI = 28.1-37.3, p < 0.001), respectively. Although WB had the highest prevalence of body mass index (BMI) above 27 kg/m(2) compared with South Asian patients (37% vs 21%, p < 0.001), South Asian patients had a higher waist circumference than WB (94.8 cm vs 90.8 cm, p < 0.001). Adjusting for traditional stroke risk factors, ISA, BSA, and QSA continued to display an increased risk of diabetes compared with WB by 3.28 (95% CI: 2.53-4.25, p < 0.001), 3.61 (95% CI: 2.90-4.51, p < 0.001), and 5.24 (95% CI: 3.93-7.00, p < 0.001), respectively.Conclusion: South Asian ischemic stroke patients living in Britain and Qatar have a near 3.5-fold risk of diabetes compared with White British stroke patients. Their body composition may partly help explain that increased risk. These findings have important implications for public health policymakers in nations with large South Asian populations.

AB  - Background/AimThe updated version of the International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) guidelines was published online in May 2020 in the form of four papers. They are extensively used in dental trauma education in textbooks, undergraduate and postgraduate programs, and clinical workshops. Hence, this study aimed to assess the impact, global scientific reach, and utilization of these guidelines through altmetric and citation analysis.Material and MethodsThe protocol was prepared after an expert group discussion. Dimensions database was used to derive the altmetric and citation data on April 10th, 2023. The data was extracted by using a self-designed pre-piloted form by two authors independently. The citing articles were further categorized into the type of study and the domains and subdomains of dental traumatology. The VOSviewer program was utilized to explore the correlation between the subdomains and the overlap of citations was assessed by creating a citation matrix.ResultsA total of 552 citations had been collectively received by the four papers. The highest was seen for the guidelines for fracture and luxation in permanent teeth (FL), avulsion in permanent teeth (AV), general introduction (GI), and primary teeth (PT). Dental Traumatology had the maximum number of citing papers for each guideline. They were from 52 countries with English being the commonest language. Overall, the maximum number of citations had been received in narrative reviews (n = 104) and the majority of cited papers were categorized in the therapeutic domains. The most common subdomain for the papers that cited GI, FL, and AV was "treatment protocols in permanent teeth", while it was "awareness of prevention and emergency management of traumatic dental injuries" for the papers that had cited PT.ConclusionsThis analysis highlighted that the IADT 2020 guidelines are globally popular resources, which are widely used by the researchers across specialities and are intended towards clinical application.

AB  - Synthesis of dispirooxindolopyrrolidine embedded indole hybrid heterocycle was achieved in excellent yield employing intermolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition cascade reaction sequence. The non-stabilized 1,3-dipole component was derived from isatin and L-tryptophan under decarboxylative condensation methodology, was reacts with 3-(4-fluorobenzylidene)indolin-2-one to form 5-benzyl-spiro[2.3 ']oxindolo-spiro[3.3 '' ]-oxindolo-4[4-fluorophenyl-pyrrolidinewith four stereogenic center via two C-C and one C-N bonds in single synthetic operation. The structure of compound was undoubtably determined by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopic analysis. The stereo and regiochemistry of cycloadduct was confirmed through single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. The packing aspects of compound 4 were analyzed using Hirshfeld calculations. It is found that the O...H, N...H, C... H and H...H interactions have major role in the crystal stability. Their percentages are estimated to be 10.1, 3.4, 25.0 and 51.0%, respectively indicating that the H...H contacts are the most dominant. Different electronic parameters such as charge population, dipole moment, molecular electrostatic potential map and frontier molecular orbitals as well as their derived reactivity descriptors were presented. Compound 4 showed potent antibacterial efficacy against E. coli with MIC value of >7.8 mu g/mL, besides, compound 4 displayed significant antioxidant activity (84.05%) at the concentration of 500 mu g/mL.

AB  - Background/AimsThe recommended treatment for uncomplicated crown fractures is bonding the fractured fragment or the fragment reattachment. A paucity was identified regarding the studies comparing the efficacy of micro-hybrid and nanohybrid composites in fragment reattachment. Hence, the present study aimed to evaluate and compare three materials for bonding of fragments rehydrated by humidification in teeth with uncomplicated crown fractures.Material and MethodsEighty mandibular bovine incisors with similar dimensions and free of any structural deformities were fractured similar to the technique followed in previous studies. Fracture was simulated, fragments, and stumps were coded, stumps were stored in artificial saliva and the fragments were dehydrated at room temperature and pressure. They were randomly assigned to Group-1 (no rehydration), Group-2 (rehydrated and bonded by flowable nanohybrid composite-3M Filtek Supreme Syringe Flowable Composite Resin-A2, Sao Paulo, Brazil), Group-3 (rehydrated and bonded by flowable micro-hybrid composite- Ruby Flow, InciDental, England, United Kingdom), and Group-4 (rehydrated and bonded by light-cured Glass-Ionomer-Cement-Voco Ionoseal, Cuxhaven, Germany). The samples were subjected to a universal testing machine to evaluate the force required to fracture the bonded fragments.ResultsThe highest median value of the force required to fracture was recorded for Group 2 (208.4 N) followed by Group 3 (195.2). The force required to fracture the bonded fragments was lowest in Group 4 (67.2 N) which was lower than the negative control (131.4 N). The differences between the observations in Groups 2 and 3 were not found to be statistically significant.ConclusionThe nano and micro-hybrid composites showed greater force required to fracture than fragments bonded by LC-GIC. Dehydrated fragments bonded using nanocomposites performed better than rehydrated fragments bonded by using LC-GIC.

AB  - Background:This meta-analysis aimed to consolidate existing data from randomised controlled trials on hypoplastic left heart syndrome.Methods:Hypoplastic left heart syndrome specific randomised controlled trials published between January 2005 and September 2021 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were included. Regardless of clinical outcomes, we included all randomised controlled trials about hypoplastic left heart syndrome and categorised them according to their results. Two reviewers independently assessed for eligibility, relevance, and data extraction. The primary outcome was mortality after Norwood surgery. Study quality and heterogeneity were assessed. A random-effects model was used for analysis.Results:Of the 33 included randomised controlled trials, 21 compared right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt and modified Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt during the Norwood procedure, and 12 regarded medication, surgical strategy, cardiopulmonary bypass tactics, and ICU management. Survival rates up to 1 year were superior in the right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt group; this difference began to disappear at 3 years and remained unchanged until 6 years. The right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt group had a significantly higher reintervention rate from the interstage to the 6-year follow-up period. Right ventricular function was better in the modified Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt group 1-3 years after the Norwood procedure, but its superiority diminished in the 6-year follow-up. Randomised controlled trials regarding medical treatment, surgical strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass, and ICU management yielded insignificant results.Conclusions:Although right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt appeared to be superior in the early period, the two shunts applied during the Norwood procedure demonstrated comparable long-term prognosis despite high reintervention rates in right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt due to pulmonary artery stenosis. For medical/perioperative management of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, further randomised controlled trials are needed to deliver specific evidence-based recommendations.

AB  - The spectrum of benign B-cell precursors, known as hematogones (HGs), shows a significant morphological and immunophenotypic overlap with their malignant counterpart i.e. B-lymphoid blasts (BLBs). This results in a diagnostic dilemma in assessment of cases wherein there is a physiological preponderance of HGs and also poses a significant challenge in measurable residual disease assessment in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Consequently, expression patterns of various immunophenotypic markers are considered the most important tool in identification and delineation of HGs from BLBs. However, certain aspects of B-cell compartment evaluation by flow cytometric immunophenotyping and its relevance in clinical scenarios is yet to be defined precisely. This review summarizes current flowcytometric data on HGs and its discrimination from BLBs based on thorough review of literature and evaluation of in-house data. Furthermore, it focuses on the utility of an additional analytical tool i.e., radar plot for a comprehensive representation of various subsets of the B-cell compartment and their differentiation from BLBs.

AB  - Objective: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Prognostication remains sub-optimally defined. We aimed to assess clinical determinants of disease progression rates in Indian patients with ALS and to assess the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in disease progression.
   Methods: In this cross-sectional study, consecutive patients with clinically definite/probable ALS according to the revised El Escorial criteria and controls were included. Patients were classified into fast or slow progressors based on disease progression rate (DPR). Serum and CSF VEGF level was assessed for patients and controls.
   Results: Of 142 patients recruited, 93 (65.5%) were male. Mean age at enrollment was 49.37 +/- 12.65 years. Mean duration of symptoms was 20.53 +/- 20.88 months. Mean DPR was 1.14 +/- 0.94. Based on DPR, 81 (57%) patients were slow progressors and 61 (43%) were fast progressors. Univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant association of DPR with age at onset, symptom duration, time to spread, wasting of small muscles of the hand, frontal release signs, and neurophysiologic bulbar abnormalities. On multivariate analysis, age at onset and symptom duration had a significant association with disease progression. The CSF VEGF levels of ALS patients (46.18 +/- 27.8) were significantly elevated compared to controls (25.95 +/- 25.64 pg/ml) (p = 0.001), but not serum VEGF.
   Conclusion: Age at symptom onset and duration of disease had a significant impact on disease progression in Indian patients with ALS. CSF VEGF levels were significantly elevated in ALS compared to controls, indicating the role of CSF VEGF as a potential biomarker.

AB  - Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T cell) therapy has emerged as a groundbreaking immunotherapeutic approach for treating various hematological malignancies. CAR-T cells are engineered to express synthetic receptors that target specific antigens on cancer cells, leading to their eradication. While the therapy has shown remarkable efficacy, a significant challenge that has been observed in 30%-70% of patients showing recurrent disease is antigen loss or downregulation. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google scholar for articles on antigen loss/escape following Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in malignancies. Antigen loss refers to the loss or reduction in the expression of the target antigen on cancer cells, rendering CAR-T cells ineffective. This phenomenon poses a significant clinical concern, as it can lead to disease relapse and limited treatment options. This review explores the mechanisms underlying antigen loss following CAR-T cell therapy, its implications on treatment outcomes, and potential strategies to overcome the problem.

AB  - AimsCurrent understanding of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is incomplete with regard to prognostic factors that lead to the considerable heterogeneity in treatment response and patient outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the impact of individual tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets on prognosis as a possible rationale for this, in a retrospective observational study.MethodsImmunohistochemistry was performed to quantitatively assess cell densities of CD3+, CD20+, CD4+, CD8+ and FOXP3+TIL subsets in 50 surgically treated OSCC cases. Results were correlated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Youden index were applied to determine prognostically significant cut-off values.ResultsMean counts for CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD20+ and FOXP3+TILs were 243, 52, 132, 53 and 116 cells per high power field, respectively. High CD8+ and low FOXP3+TIL counts, and high ratio of CD8:FOXP3 were significantly associated with longer DFS and OS, as well as with improved tumour-host interface parameters.ConclusionsHost immune response and its interaction with cancer cells have a significant impact on OSCC outcomes, with some TIL subsets being more clinically relevant than others. High cytotoxic T-cell (CD8) and low Treg (FOXP3) counts, and high cytotoxic T-cell to Treg (CD8:FOXP3) ratio are significantly associated with favourable prognosis. These results may serve as a leading point in identifying novel therapeutic agents that can redesign the tumour immune microenvironment by reducing infiltrating FOXP3-lymphocytes, and modifying their signalling pathways.

AB  - The paper presents a novel framework for the prediction of the raised Intracranial Pressure (ICP) from ocular ultrasound images of traumatic patients through automated measurement of Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter (ONSD) and Eyeball Transverse Diameter (ETD). The measurement of ONSD using an ocular ultrasound scan is non-invasive and correlates with the raised ICP. However, the existing studies suggested that the ONSD value alone is insufficient to indicate the ICP condition. Since the ONSD and ETD values may vary among patients belonging to different ethnicity/origins, there is a need for developing an independent global biomarker for predicting raised ICP condition. The proposed work develops an automated framework for the prediction of raised ICP by developing algorithms for the automated measurement of ONSD and ETD values. It is established that the ONSD and ETD ratio (OER) is a potential biomarker for ICP prediction independent of ethnicity and origin. The OER threshold value is determined by performing statistical analysis on the data of 57 trauma patients obtained from the AIIMS, New Delhi. The automated OER is computed and compared with the conventionally measured ICP by determining suitable correlation coefficients. It is found that there is a significant correlation of OER with ICP (r = .81, p & LE; .01), whereas the correlation of ONSD alone with ICP is relatively less (r = .69, p = .004). These correlation values indicate that OER is a better parameter for the prediction of ICP. Further, the threshold value of OER is found to be 0.21 for predicting raised ICP conditions in this study. Scatter plot and Heat map analysis of OER and corresponding ICP reveal that patients with OER & GE; 0.21, have ICP in the range of 17 to 35 mm Hg. In the data available for this research work, OER ranges from 0.17 to 0.35.

AB  - Aims/Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccinations have been proven to be generally safe in healthy populations. However, the data on vaccine safety in patients with type 1 diabetes are scarce. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency and severity of short-term (<7-day) adverse vaccination events (AEs) and their risk factors among type 1 diabetes patients.
   Materials and Methods: This study analyzed data from the COVID-19 vaccination in Autoimmune Diseases (COVAD) survey database (May to December 2021; 110 collaborators, 94 countries), comparing <7-day COVID-19 vaccine AE among type 1 diabetes patients and healthy controls (HCs). Descriptive statistics; propensity score matching (1:4) using the variables age, sex and ethnicity; and multivariate analyses were carried out.
   Results: This study analyzed 5,480 completed survey responses. Of all responses, 5,408 were HCs, 72 were type 1 diabetes patients (43 females, 48.0% white European ancestry) and Pfizer was the most administered vaccine (39%). A total of 4,052 (73.9%) respondents had received two vaccine doses. Patients with type 1 diabetes had a comparable risk of injection site pain, minor and major vaccine AEs, as well as associated hospitalizations to HCs. However, type 1 diabetes patients had a higher risk of severe rashes (3% vs 0.4%, OR 8.0, 95% confidence interval 1.7-36), P = 0.007), although reassuringly, these were rare (n = 2 among type 1 diabetes patients).
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccination was safe and well tolerated in patients with type 1 diabetes with similar AE profiles compared with HCs, although severe rashes were more common in type 1 diabetes patients.

AB  - Background and purposeAlthough rare, neurological adverse events have been reported post-COVID-19 vaccination. This study reports 16 patients diagnosed with CNS inflammatory demyelinating diseases (CNS-IDD) within 6 weeks of COVID-19 vaccine administration.MethodologyA prospective observational study was conducted from June 2021 to May 2022. All patients were diagnosed according to the latest international guidelines with CNS-IDD within 6 weeks of COVID-19 vaccine exposure. Data regarding the demographic profile, clinical features, type of COVID-19 vaccination, radiological findings and occurrence of symptoms were noted and further analysed using descriptive statistics.ResultsWe reported 16 cases (median age 40 years) of CNS demyelination: fourteen occurred in temporal association with ChAdOx1-S vaccine and two in association with BBV152 vaccine. Median time duration of presenting symptoms after vaccination was 19 days (3-40 days). The most common presentation was myelitis (7/16 patients), followed by optic neuritis (6/16 patients). Demyelination events were reported after first and second dose in thirteen and five patients respectively, although two patients reported such events after both vaccine dosages. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) IgG antibodies were positive in eight patients. Tumefactive demyelination was seen in four patients. Management included high-dose methylprednisolone, PLEX, IVIG or a combination of those, with a favourable outcome in the majority of cases.ConclusionAlthough a rare event, awareness regarding potential demyelinating episodes post-COVID-19 vaccination can help in early diagnosis. The presence of increased MOG-IgG antibodies with temporal association in post-COVID vaccine patients raises a possibility of an immunogenic phenomenon leading to demyelinating disorders.

AB  - High-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is the standard of care treatment in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (rrHL). Published long-term follow-up data concerning this modality from the Indian subcontinent is lacking. In this retrospective study, the data on adults (> 16 years) with biopsy-confirmed rrHL who were autografted from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2021 at our transplant unit were analyzed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from transplant to disease progression or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) was determined from date of transplant to date of death due to any cause. Overall, 134 patients with Hodgkin lymphoma underwent ASCT. At a median follow-up of 38.2 (range, 0.1-240) months, 5 years PFS was 45.3% (95% CI 35.4-54.4). The probability of OS at 5 years was 60.5% (95% CI 49.6-69.6). Eleven (8.2%) patients suffered transplant-related mortality by 100 days. Post-transplant persistent disease, pre-transplant serum hypoalbuminemia (< 3.5 g/dl) and chemo-resistance (< PR after last salvage regimen) of tumour at transplant were independent prognostic factors associated with worse PFS in multivariable analysis. Likewise, age >= 30 years, ECOG performance status >= 1 and residual disease after transplantation correlated with inferior OS. Long-term outcomes of rrHL patients undergoing ASCT in India match those from the developed world in the era of peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Pre-transplant performance status, chemo-sensitivity of disease, serum albumin and post-transplant remission status determined survival in our cohort.

AB  - PurposeWe aimed to evaluate the prevalence of postpartum diabetes among women with a history of overt diabetes in pregnancy (ODiP) and compare with women having a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normoglycemia in pregnancy.MethodsWe have an established longitudinal cohort of postpartum women with a history of hyperglycemia (preexisting diabetes [PED] [n = 101], ODiP [n = 92], GDM [n = 643]), and normoglycemia (n = 183) in pregnancy. For this study, we excluded women with PED and invited other eligible women in a fasting state for clinical and biochemical evaluation.ResultsWe evaluated 918 women with a mean (SD) age of 33.6 (5.0) years and at a median (interquartile range) postpartum interval of 31 (20-45) months. Diabetes was diagnosed in 65 (70.7%) women in ODiP compared to 99 (15.4%) in GDM (p < .001) and 4 (2.2%) in normoglycemia group (p < .001). In the ODiP group, the prevalence of diabetes was 47.4% among women tested in the first year postpartum, increasing to 86.8% among women tested at >3 years postpartum. Diabetes was more common when ODiP was diagnosed in the first (27/29, 93.1%) compared to the second trimester of pregnancy (35/57, 61.4%). The adjusted odds ratio for diabetes in ODiP was 14.82 (95% confidence interval, 8.49-25.87; p < .001; reference category: GDM).ConclusionsThe prevalence of postpartum diabetes was significantly higher in women with ODiP compared to GDM. Nearly 50% of women with ODiP did not develop diabetes in the first year of follow-up, especially when ODiP was diagnosed after the first trimester of pregnancy and on the basis of a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test value. Such women are amenable to prevention strategies.

AB  - Background/Aim Individuals with special healthcare needs (SHCN) are more likely to sustain traumatic dental injuries (TDIs) due to distinct risk factors. The aim of this review was to assess various risk factors associated with TDIs in individuals with SHCN.Materials and Methods The protocol was designed according to the recommendations of the Cochrane-handbook, Joanna Briggs Institute, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022357422). A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, LILACS, Web of Science, EMBASE and Scopus using a pre-defined strategy without any limitation of language and year of publication. It was last updated on 25 April 2023. Studies addressing the TDIs in individuals with SHCN were included. Data extraction and analyses were performed, risk of bias (ROB) assessment was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool, and a meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model.Results A total of 21 studies were included in the review. They were categorized according to the target disease/condition: cerebral palsy (n = 5), ADHD and autism spectrum disorders (n = 5), visually impaired (n = 4), and multiple disorders (n = 7). The studies showed variability in the design and methods; however, 17 out of 21 studies showed moderate to low ROB. Increased overjet and lip incompetence were the main risk factors reported in the studies. The commonest injuries were observed to be enamel and enamel and dentine fractures.Conclusion The overall pooled prevalence of TDI in individuals with special healthcare needs was 23.16% with 20.98% in males and 27.06% in females. Overjet >3 mm and inadequate lip coverage were found to be associated with a higher risk of TDI in all the categories of individuals with special healthcare needs except ADHD and ASD. Falls at home in cerebral palsy, falls while walking and self-harm in ADHD and ASD, falls at home and collision in visual impairment, and unspecified falls in multiple disorders could be identified as the most common cause of TDI.

AB  - Objectives: Penile squamous cell carcinomas (PCs) are rare malignancies with a dismal prognosis in a metastatic setting; therefore, novel immunotherapeutic modalities are an unmet need. One such modality is the immune checkpoint molecule programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1). We sought to analyze PD-L1 expression and its correlation with various clinicopathologic parameters in a contemporary cohort of 134 patients with PC.
   Methods: A cohort of 134 patients with PC was studied for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry. The PD-L1 expression was evaluated using a combined proportion score with a cutoff of 1 or higher to define positivity. The results were correlated with various clinicopathologic parameters.
   Results: Overall, 77 (57%) patients had positive PD-L1 expression. Significantly high PD-L1 expression was observed in high-grade tumors ( P =.006). We found that 37% of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated subtypes and 73% of other histotype tumors expressed PD-L1, while 63% of HPV-associated tumors and 27% of other histotype tumors did not (odds ratio, 1.35; P =.002 when compared for HPV-associated groups vs all others). Similarly, PD-L1-positive tumors had a 3.61-times higher chance of being node positive than PD-L1-negative tumors ( P =.0009). In addition, PD-L1 high-positive tumors had a 5-times higher chance of being p16(ink4a) negative than PD-L1 low-positive tumors ( P =.004). The PD-L1-positive tumors had a lower overall survival and cancer-specific survival than PD-L1-negative tumors.
   Conclusions: Overall, PD-L1 expression is associated with high-grade and metastatic tumors. Lower PD-L1 expression is observed more frequently in HPV-associated (warty or basaloid) subtypes than in other, predominantly HPV-independent types. As a result, PD-L1 positivity, including higher expression, portends lower overall and cancer-specific survival. These data provide a rational for further investigating PD-L1-based immunotherapeutics in PC.

AB  - Philadelphia chromosome positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (ALL) is an uncommon subtype of ALL in children, seen in 2-5% cases. Diagnostic evaluation includes conventional karyotyping and detection of BCR-ABL1 translocation by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). For children, the frontline management includes combination of intensive chemotherapy along with imatinib (300-340 mg/m2/d) or dasatinib (60-80 mg/m2/d). Imatinib/dasatinib should be introduced in induction as soon as results for BCR-ABL are available. Minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring is essential; multi-parametric flowcytometry and immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor rearrangement PCR are the preferred methods. Intrathecal therapy with at least 12 doses of methotrexate is adequate for central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis, but cranial radiation is necessary for CNS3 involvement. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first remission may be considered in high-risk cases (persistent MRD positivity/induction failure). Maintenance therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in children is debatable, with potential concerns for long term adverse effects. At relapse, the choice of TKI is guided by the presence of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain resistance mutations, although the frequency of resistance mutations in children are lower. Allogeneic HSCT is essential for consolidation in second remission, if not done. Ph-like ALL is a newly recognized molecular entity, with gene expression profile similar to Ph+ALL and poor survival outcomes. In resource-constrained settings, a stepwise cost-effective diagnostic evaluation should be considered among high-risk patients without recurrent genetic abnormalities. Current treatment strategies remain similar to Ph-negative ALL. Enrolment in clinical trials is encouraged for such children to evaluate potential targeted agents in this subtype.

TI  - Baseline and Post-NACT Imaging in Retinoblastoma With Optic Nerve Involvement: Can MRI Predict Prognosis?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC OPHTHALMOLOGY & STRABISMUS
KW  - CHEMOTHERAPY
KW  - INVASION
AB  - Purpose: To describe a staging system for optic nerve invasion using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and report any correlation with survival outcome.Methods: This was a ambispective study. Twenty-one patients with retinoblastoma who had optic nerve involvement on MRI were staged at baseline based on contrast enhancement and/or thickening and length of involvement. Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) was noted according to proposed response evaluation criteria and results were correlated with survival outcome.Results: Baseline MRI staging was able to predict event free survival (EFS) (P = .0015) using the log-rank test for trends. Patients with optic nerve enhancement alone showed 100% survival prognosis. Optic nerve thickening cases with complete or partial response to NACT showed better EFS (P > .90) than those with stable disease according to response evaluation criteria.Conclusions: The modified staging system for optic nerve invasion used in the current study significantly predicted EFS. The study also showed that response to NACT may be affected by baseline staging. The authors recommend that cases with optic nerve enhancement only, irrespective of the length of involvement (stage 0), may be treated with upfront enucleation. Cases with optic nerve thickening may be staged to evaluate the correlation with survival outcome in a larger cohort in future studies.

AB  - Human gamma delta T cells are highly enriched in epithelial cell-dominated compartments like skin. Nonetheless, their function in the pathogenesis of pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune skin disorder, is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the functional expression of human gamma delta T cell subsets along with their homing chemokine receptor-ligand and inflammatory cytokines in the immunopathogenesis of PV. Estimation of the frequency of gamma delta T cell subsets by flow cytometry revealed four major subsets of gamma delta T cells (gamma delta T1,gamma delta T2,gamma delta T17,gamma delta Treg) in both control and PV circulation. The elevated frequency of gamma delta T17 cells producing IL17 and expressing CCR6 receptor suggests their inflammatory and migratory potential in PV. In vitro culture of gamma delta T cells from patients showed increased mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines IL17, ROR gamma t, IL23, IL1, and co-stimulatory markers, CD27 and CD70. These findings correlated the role of IL1 and IL23 cytokines that alleviate the Th17 population in PV. Cytotoxic activities of gamma delta T cells were higher and inflammatory gamma delta T17 cells were localized in the skin of PV whereas gamma delta Treg cells associated TGF beta and FOXP3 were lowered. Hyperinflammatory phenotype of the gamma delta T17 cell subset and its migratory potential might be aiding in the pathogenesis of PV, whereas gamma delta Treg cells fail to suppress these inflammatory responses. Hence,.dT17 cell-associated markers can be targeted for identifying novel therapeutics in PV.

AB  - Mesenchymal Stromal/Stem Cells (MSCs) are multipotent, non-hematopoietic progenitor cells with a wide range of immune modulation and regenerative potential which qualify them as a potential component of cell-based therapy for various autoimmune/chronic inflammatory ailments. Their immunomodulatory properties include the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines, the ability to suppress T-cell activation and differentiation, and the induction of regulatory T-cells. Considering this and our interest, we here discuss the significance of MSC for the management of Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD), one of the autoimmune manifestations in human. In pre-clinical models, MSCs have been shown to reduce the severity of GvHD symptoms, including skin and gut damage, which are the most common and debilitating manifestations of this disease. While initial clinical studies of MSCs in GvHD cases were promising, the results were variable in randomized studies. So, further studies are warranted to fully understand their potential benefits, safety profile, and optimal dosing regimens. Owing to these inevitable issues, here we discuss various mechanisms, and how MSCs can be employed in managing GvHD, as a cellular therapeutic approach for this disease.
   Preconditioning of MSCs before infusing in patients with GvHDPreconditioning of MSCs is indeed a crucial step in improving the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for GvHD. Preconditioning involves exposing MSCs to cytokines, growth factors, and/or drugs prior to transplantation. This exposure induces changes in the MSCs' behavior such as enhance the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, which can reduce the severity of GvHD and improving the homing of MSCs to the injured target organ helping in tissue repair. Overall, precondition makes MSCs more effective in combating GvHD.

AB  - Split thickness skin grafting is one of the common skin transplantation techniques employed in treating severe burn injuries. Recent experimental studies have shown that the expansions offered by split thickness skin grafts are much lower than what is claimed by the graft manufacturers. To date, limited studies have investigated the effect of slit patterns on the expansions and the possibility of material innovation. This work has experimentally tested novel auxetic slit patterns on a biofidelic skin simulant to evaluate their effect on skin graft expansion. A wide range of variants of alternating slit (AS), I-shaped (IS), and Rotating Triangle (RT) based auxetic patterns were tested. A biaxial testing device was employed to simulate realistic skin stretching during graft implementation. The deformation, expansion, stress-strain response, void area, and maximum gap size were estimated, and the material behavior was also modeled using hyperelastic curve fit coefficients. The key design parameters were determined, which would produce high expansion with minimal voids. The findings of this study are anticipated to throw light on the possibility of using auxetic slit patterns for generating higher expansions in split thickness skin grafts.

AB  - 41-year-old lady, known case of Takayasu arteritis with pulmonary arterial involvement, presented with multiple episodes of haemoptysis (maximum 50 mL) in a week. She had undergone descending thoracic aorta angioplasty and stenting 3 years ago due to uncontrolled hypertension, left ventricular systolic dysfunction and approximately 70% stenosis of descending thoracic aorta. This lady was treated with embolization of hypertrophied bronchial artery as well as left internal mammary artery branch for management of haemoptysis. Embolization of hypertrophied bronchial artery in the setting of Takayasu arteritis with pulmonary arterial involvement presenting with haemoptysis is rare. Hypertrophied bronchial artery detected in post stenting computed tomography raises suspicion whether descending thoracic aorta stenting promotes the hypertrophy of bronchial artery. Literature of bronchial artery embolization in the setting of Takayasu with post DTA stenting is scarce.

AB  - In low-risk febrile neutropenia (LR-FN), the safety of early discontinuation of empiric antibiotics without marrow recovery is not well established. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of procalcitonin (PCT) guided early discontinuation of antibiotics in LR-FN. In this trial, children with LR-FN with an afebrile period of at least 24 h, sterile blood culture, and negative/normalized PCT were randomized at 72 h of starting antibiotics into two groups: intervention arm and standard arm. The antibiotics were stopped in the intervention arm regardless of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), while in the standard arm, antibiotics were continued for at least 7 days or until recovery of ANC (>500/mm(3)). The primary objective was to determine the treatment failure rates, and the secondary objective was to compare the duration of antibiotics and all-cause mortality between the two arms. A total of 46 children with LR-FN were randomized to either the intervention arm (n = 23) or the standard arm (n = 23). Treatment failure was observed in 2/23 (8.7%) of patients in the intervention arm compared to 1/23 (4.3%) in the standard arm [RR: 2 (95% CI: 0.19-20.6); p = 0.55]. The median duration of antibiotics in the intervention arm and standard arm were 3 days vs 7 days (P= <0.001). There was no mortality in this study. PCT-guided early discontinuation of empirical antibiotics in LR-FN is feasible. There was no significant difference observed in treatment failure between the early discontinuation of antibiotics vs standard therapy. The total duration of antibiotic exposure was significantly lesser in the discontinuation arm. Further, larger multicenter studies are needed to confirm the finding of this study.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with special needs requiring special care are more vulnerable to oral health problems. Sign language is a communication medium and language of instruction for individuals with hearing impairments. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of sign language-based educational interventions compared to other educational interventions in improving the oral health of hearing-impaired individuals. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched without any restriction on the publication date. Analytical and experimental studies that evaluated and compared the effectiveness of sign language with other educational intervention groups such as videos, posters etc were included. Results: Initially, 5568 records were identified. Three relevant publications from India were eligible and included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Differences were reported in favour of sign language over other interventions concerning plaque status, gingival health, and oral hygiene status. Conclusion: Sign language-based interventions were found to be effective. However, further studies in different locations and populations are required to support their effectiveness.

AB  - Background: India accounts for 13.3% of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to stroke with a relatively younger age of onset compared to the Western population. In India's public healthcare system, many stroke patients seek care at tertiary-level government-funded medical colleges where an optimal level of stroke care is expected. However, there are no studies from India that have assessed the quality of stroke care, including infrastructure, imaging facilities, or the availability of stroke care units in medical colleges. Aim: This study aimed to understand the existing protocols and management of acute stroke care across 22 medical colleges in India, as part of the baseline assessment of the ongoing IMPETUS stroke study. Methods: A semi-structured quantitative pre-tested questionnaire, developed based on review of literature and expert discussion, was mailed to 22 participating sites of the IMPETUS stroke study. The questionnaire assessed comprehensively all components of stroke care, including human resources, emergency system, in-hospital care, and secondary prevention. A descriptive analysis of their status was undertaken. Results: In the emergency services, limited stroke helpline numbers, 3/22 (14%); prenotification system, 5/22 (23%); and stroke-trained physicians were available, 6/22 (27%). One-third of hospitals did not have on-call neurologists. Although non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) was always available, 39% of hospitals were not doing computed tomography (CT) angiography and 13/22 (59%) were not doing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after routine working hours. Intravenous thrombolysis was being done in 20/22 (91%) hospitals, but 36% of hospitals did not provide it free of cost. Endovascular therapy was available only in 6/22 (27%) hospitals. The study highlighted the scarcity of multidisciplinary stroke teams, 8/22 (36%), and stroke units, 7/22 (32%). Lifesaving surgeries like hematoma evacuation, 11/22 (50%), and decompressive craniectomy, 9/22 (41%), were performed in limited numbers. The availability of occupational therapists, speech therapists, and cognitive rehabilitation was minimal. Conclusion: This study highlighted the current status of acute stroke management in publicly funded tertiary care hospitals. Lack of prenotification, limited number of stroke-trained physicians and neurosurgeons, relatively lesser provision of free thrombolytic agents, limited stroke units, and lack of rehabilitation services are areas needing urgent attention by policymakers and creation of sustainable education models for uniform stroke care by medical professionals across the country.

AB  - Background and aimsEarly neurological deterioration (END) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS), patients is defined as clinical worsening or recurrence during first 72 h after onset of AIS. We have conducted this study to determine the association between END and functional outcome at 3 months of onset of AIS along with associated risk factors of END in AIS cases.MethodologyThis study was conducted after approval of Institute Ethics Committee. Two hundred three consecutive patients were admitted from September 2020 to January 2022 at a tertiary care hospital. One hundred ninety patients were included in the study; patients were divided into two groups: (1) early neurological deterioration (END) and (2) non-early neurological deterioration (non-END). Patients were followed-up either telephonically or in person at approximately 3 months using modified Rankin Scale 0-6. All the clinically significant prognostic markers and p < 0.10 variables were considered significant in univariate analysis; P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant for the multivariate analysis.ResultsOut of 190 cases included in the cohort 34/190 (17.8%) cases showed END with mean age (56.56 (& PLUSMN; 16.6)) and males (20/34 (58.8%)). END was independently associated with high blood glucose at admission (OR = 1.015; P = 0.002; 95%CI = 1.005-1.024) and low serum albumin (OR = 0.208; P = 0.002; 95%CI = 0.077-0.562). Patients with END showed poor functional outcome (mRS > 2) at end of 3 months (32 (94.1%); P < 0.001) and death was also statistically significant (22 (64.7%); P < 0.001) as compared to AIS cases having non-END.ConclusionOur study showed END may be associated with poor functional outcome in AIS patients. Higher blood glucose at admission and low serum albumin may be statistically significant causing END. Future prospective cohort with larger sample size may confirm the findings.

AB  - Introduction: Tobacco is a well-established risk factor for cancer, but its association with other morbidities needs consideration. The low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with unprecedented demographic transformation lack evidence on tobacco use and its impact on cognitive health.
   Aims and Methods: Using a propensity score matching approach, we utilized data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study of India. Study employed 1:1 nearest neighbor matching with the replacement methodology. We estimated the odds of the poor cognitive score and tobacco use among older adults based on five different models for ever tobacco user, former tobacco user, current tobacco user, current smokers, and current smokeless tobacco users with reference to never tobacco users.
   Results: The estimated average treatment effect for the treated and the untreated group has shown a higher likelihood of cognitive decline among ever (OR -0.26; 95%CI -0.43 to -0.09), current (OR -0.28; 95%CI -0.45 to -0.10), and former (OR -0.53; 95%CI -0.87 to -0.19) tobacco users compared to never tobacco users. The finding further suggests the odds of lower cognitive scores among older adults who were smokers (OR -0.53; 95%CI -0.87 to -0.19) and smokeless tobacco users (OR -0.22; 95%CI -0.43 to -0.01) as compared to never tobacco users.
   Conclusions: Interventions designed to prevent the incidence of cognitive impairment should focus on limiting the use of tobacco. Strategies under the tobacco-free generation initiative should be amplified in order to prevent future generations from productivity loss, premature ageing and to promote healthy aging.
   Implications: Evidence of a definitive association between tobacco consumption and cognition among older adults is sporadic in LMICs. Though tobacco is a risk factor for various diseases including cancer, the extent of its impact on cognitive health among the older population is limited. This study contributes to the existing literature by highlighting poor cognitive outcomes among older adults who smoke tobacco and/or consume smokeless tobacco as compared to never-tobacco users. Our findings emphasize the need to accelerate programmes related to tobacco-free generation in LMICs to reach a higher quality of life and healthy aging in pursuit of achieving the sustainable development goal of "good health and well-being."

AB  - Mastectomy serves as the main surgical treatment for both invasive and in situ breast carcinoma and large phyllodes tumors. It is associated with skin necrosis, seroma, and surgical site infection in up to 30% of patients. In the present trial, we compared the complications in patients undergoing skin flap elevation by one of the 4 techniques: thick skin flap raised by scalpel(group1), thin skin flap raised with scalpel (group 2), thick skin flap raised with diathermy (group 3), and thin skin flap raised with diathermy (group 4). A randomized trial with superiority hypothesis and 2 x 2 factorial design was conducted at All India Institute of Medical Sciences New Delhi. Mastectomy skin flap necrosis (MSN) was recorded as the main outcome of interest. MSN was noted in 2.5% in group1, 10% in group 2, 7.5% in group 3, and 30% in group 4. MSN was observed in 5% cases with thick flap compared to 20% cases with a thin skin flap (p = 0.007). Raising the flap with scalpel was associated with MSN in 6.25% compared to 18.75% in the diathermy group (p = 0.029). We conclude that raising a thick flap with scalpel is associated with lowest risk of skin flap necrosis.

AB  - The present study assessed the correlation between the stature and scapular measurements from both sides in order to develop population-specific regression equations to estimate the stature from measurements of the scapula in a contemporary Northern Indian population individually for the left and right sides. A total of 597 cadavers underwent postmortem multidetector computed tomography and subsequent medicolegal autopsy in our department between August 2021 and August 2022. Two hundred samples (100 males and 100 females) were randomly collected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six linear anthropometric measurements of the scapula from either side were measured using the 3D volume-rendered technique by an electronic cursor. Each anthropometric measurement showed a significant difference between males and females (p < 0.05). Regression analysis was applied to match the taken measurements against stature. The accuracy to predict stature ranged from 3.99 to 4.94 cm for males and from 4.49 to 5.27 cm for females, respectively. Left-sided measurements were better predictors of stature than the right side in both genders. The results of this study indicate that scapular measurements could be useful to estimate the stature of Northern Indian individuals, particularly in scenarios of disaster victim identification lacking long bones, which are considered to be better predictors to date.

AB  - Introduction The dysregulated host immune response in sepsis is orchestrated by peripheral blood leukocytes. This study explored the associations of the peripheral blood leukocyte subpopulations with early clinical deterioration and mortality in sepsis. Methods We performed a prospective observational single-center study enrolling adult subjects with sepsis within 48 h of hospital admission. Peripheral blood flow cytometry was performed for the patients at enrolment and after 5 days. The primary outcome was to explore the association between various leukocyte subpopulations at enrolment and early clinical deterioration [defined as an increase in the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score between enrolment and day 5, or death before day 5]. Other pre-specified outcomes explored associations of leukocyte subpopulations at enrolment and on day 5 with in-hospital mortality. Results A total of 100 patients, including 47 with septic shock were enrolled. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 53.99 (14.93) years. Among them, 26 patients had early clinical deterioration, whereas 41 died during hospitalization. There was no significant association between the leukocyte subpopulations at enrolment and early clinical deterioration on day 5. On multivariate logistic regression, a reduced percentage of CD8 + CD25+ T-cells at enrolment was associated with in-hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR), 0.82 (0.70-0.97); p-value = 0.02]. A reduced lymphocyte percentage on day 5 was associated with in-hospital mortality [OR, 0.28 (0.11-0.69); p-value = 0.01]. In a post-hoc analysis, patients with "very early" deterioration within 48 h had an increased granulocyte CD64 median fluorescent intensity (MFI) [OR, 1.07 (1.01-1.14); p-value = 0.02] and a reduced granulocyte CD16 MFI [OR, 0.97 (0.95-1.00); p-value = 0.04] at enrolment. Conclusions None of the leukocyte subpopulations showed an association with early clinical deterioration at day 5. Impaired lymphocyte activation and lymphocytopenia indicative of adaptive immune dysfunction may be associated with in-hospital mortality.

AB  - Asian Society of Mastology (ASOMA) is an international body of experts from disciplines of surgery, radiology, pathology, medical and radiation oncology, plastic surgery, and breast support group dedicated to improving the care of patients with breast diseases. The clinical breast assessment (CBA) of patients with a focused history and clinical breast examination (CBE) is an essential and initial component of triple assessment in the evaluation of patients presenting with breast diseases. CBE is also an affordable method of screening for breast cancer. It adds to breast imaging by providing additional information about the breast lesion and providing a sense of reassurance to the patients. CBA needs to be implemented in a systematic and uniform fashion throughout the world by all the clinicians involved in breast care. The optimal method for CBE has not yet been fully established. This article highlights the importance of CBE and discusses the studies comparing various methods of CBE on breast models and human subjects to provide the evidence to support the most valid and reliable method of CBE.

AB  - PurposeThe pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is currently poorly understood. This exploratory study aimed to identify potential cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in IIH cases compared to controls using SWATH-MS proteomics approach. Experimental DesignCSF samples were collected prospectively from IIH cases and control subjects which were subjected to SWATH-MS based untargeted proteomics. Proteins with fold change > 1.5 or p-value We included CSF samples from 33 subjects, consisting of 13 IIH cases and 20 controls. A total of 262 proteins were identified in Proteinpilot search. Through SWATH analysis, we quantified 232 proteins. We observed 37 differentially expressed proteins between the two groups with 24 upregulated and 13 downregulated proteins. There were two differential proteins among overweight versus non-overweight IIH cases. Network for 23 proteins was highly connected in the interaction analysis. Conclusions and Clinical RelevanceNeurosecretory, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory proteins were predominantly involved in causing IIH. This exploratory study served as a platform to identify 37 differentially expressed proteins in IIH and also showed significant differences between overweight and non-overweight IIH patients.

AB  - ObjectivesTo investigate the IgA levels and bacterial profile in umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples of mothers with risk factors compared to those without risk factors; and to understand the link between UCB culture positivity and neonatal outcomes [early-onset sepsis (EOS) or death within 7 d of life].MethodsThis is a pilot prospective case-control study. Mothers with preterm deliveries (gestational age <34 wk) were enrolled in two groups- Cases: Those with antenatal risk factors (prolonged duration of rupture of membranes of & GE;24 h or chorioamnionitis) and controls: Those without these two risk factors. Serum IgA levels was assayed and microbiological culture was tested in UCB samples. 16S sequencing to determine the UCB microbiome was performed in a subset of samples (n = 15). Neonates were followed-up for the occurrence of EOS or death until 7 d of life.ResultsForty-nine mothers as cases and 50 mothers as controls were consecutively enrolled. No significant difference was observed in the IgA levels (60.5 vs. 58.1 mg/L; p = 0.71), neonatal blood culture positivity (4.1% vs. 8.0%; p = 0.41) and UCB culture positivity (30.6% vs. 26.0%; p = 0.61) in the two groups. No difference was observed between the groups in occurrence of EOS or death within 7 d of life. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. Serratia, Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, Meganomas and Blautia being the most common genera.ConclusionsCord blood IgA concentration could not differentiate the neonates at-risk of infection due to its presence in both the groups.

AB  - The D allele has been identified as being linked to cardiovascular disease since the discovery of an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism in the ACE gene, this polymorphism has been found to have significant associations with a variety of cardiovascular risk factors. Recent findings indicate a rising prevalence of metabolic disorders among rural populations in developing nations. Research on health matters has been predominantly focused on urban populations, with relatively less attention given to their rural counterparts Hence, the present study attempts to estimate the prevalence of ACE gene I/D polymorphism and explore its association with various cardiovascular risk factors among Rural Yadav population from India. In the present study, 207 (Male 47, Female 160) members of the Yadav community participated in the cross-sectional study. All the socio-demographic factors, somatometric (anthropometric) variables, and the intravenous blood was collected and Physiological (blood pressure), and biochemical (fasting glucose and lipid profile) parameters were measured as recommended by the American Heart Association, allele-specific PCR of the ACE gene I/D polymorphism was carried out, the PCR products were genotyped on 2% agarose gel Electrophoresis and ACE gene polymorphism was analysed for its association with various cardiovascular risk factors. Among the analysed individuals, 34 (16.4%) were found to have the II genotype, 58 (28.0%) had the ID genotype, and 115 (55.6%) had the DD genotype. The allele frequency of the I allele was found to be 0.31, and the frequency of the D allele was 0.69. The frequency of the DD genotype was found to be significantly higher among individuals with high TC, high TG, and low non-HDL levels (p value < 0.05). When considered collectively, the findings of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that the DD genotype of ACE polymorphism represents a correlation with cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population.

AB  - ObjectivesTo determine the prevalence of insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome (MS) in children with asthma, aged 10 to 15 y, and to determine if these metabolic abnormalities showed an association with asthma symptom control and lung function.MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary centre in north India. Consecutive children with physician diagnosed asthma were enrolled. Asthma symptom control over previous four weeks was assessed as per Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommendations. Fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin and lipid levels were estimated. Homeostasis Model Assessment- Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was used as a marker of IR. Spirometry was performed for assessing lung function.ResultsEighty-three children were enrolled. Median (IQR) age was 12.0 (11.0, 13.5) y and mean (SD) body mass index (BMI) Z score was -0.42 (1.0). Median (IQR) HOMA-IR was 1.65 (1.06, 2.39). Prevalence of IR was 42.3% (95% CI: 31.7-52.9%). Number of children with elevated triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was 4 (4.8%), 4 (4.8%) and 5 (6%), respectively. Sixty-seven (80.7%) children had low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Only one subject was found to have metabolic syndrome. Presence of IR and elevation in serum insulin and triglycerides were associated with poorer asthma control, independent of BMI. None of the metabolic parameters were associated with lung function, after adjusting for height.ConclusionsAmong children with asthma, aged 10 to 15 y, the prevalence of IR was 42.3% (95% CI: 31.7-52.9%). Elevated serum insulin, triglycerides, and presence of IR were associated with poorer asthma control, after adjusting for BMI.

AB  - Major mammary duct excision is the standard surgical treatment for patients with periductal mastitis presenting with persistent non-bloody nipple discharge or recurrent subareolar sepsis and mammary duct fistula. The present trial was aimed at comparing outcomes following 1.5-cm ductal cone excision versus conventional 3-cm-long excision, in terms of control of periductal mastitis, occurrence of complications, postoperative pain, and the cosmetic outcome. Patients with non-bloody nipple discharge without imaging suspicious of malignancy and history of lactation in the past 6 months were recruited and randomized into two groups, viz., 1.5-cm ductal cone excision and 3-cm ductal cone excision. After completing triple assessment, patients underwent a procedure under local anesthesia and were followed up at 1, 2, and 4 weeks and 6 months to assess postoperative complications, viz., hematoma, surgical site infection, the nipple-areolar complex (NAC) necrosis, pain, NAC sensation, cosmesis, and recurrence. Sixty patients were recruited in this study. Recurrence of nipple discharge was observed in one patient in each arm. Three patients in the 3-cm duct excision group had a partial necrosis of areola and 2 had complete loss of sensation, whereas none was observed in the 1.5-cm duct excision group. More patients had complained of pain in the former group. A total of 86.67% patients experienced excellent cosmesis in the 1.5-cm duct excision group, whereas only 66.67% reported the same in the 3 cm group. The limited 1.5-cm-long ductal cone excision is a safe and effective procedure in ladies presenting with pathological non-bloody nipple discharge.

AB  - PurposeContinuum-of-care is crucial following knee replacement. This is an understudied area in the context of low- and middle-income countries. We report findings of a mixed-methods study conducted to understand patient's postoperative experiences in following unsupervised home-based physiotherapy protocols and healthcare provider's experiences in providing rehabilitation care.MethodsConsecutive adults (n = 79) scheduled or had undergone knee replacement, attending an urban tertiary care hospital in India completed a 22-item questionnaire to gauge attitude towards physical rehabilitation. We conducted in-depth interviews with nine patients, ten physiotherapists, and three surgeons using a phenomenology approach. Data were interpreted using the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behaviour (COM-B) framework.ResultsPatients were motivated to do exercises and valued family support during the recovery period. However, they desired physiotherapy support, especially during the early recovery period due to post-operative pain. Healthcare providers reported poor adherence with the exercise regimen and desired a mechanism to monitor patient progress after discharge. Patients and health care providers identified accessibility to rehabilitation centre as a major barrier in availing affordable and reliable physiotherapy services.ConclusionThere is a need for a continuum of care to improve patient experience during recovery and for health care providers to monitor progress and provide personalised progressive exercise therapy.

AB  - ObjectivesTo study the clinical and molecular spectrum of Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA).MethodsIn this retrospective study, the records of 30 MMA patients were evaluated for their phenotype, biochemical abnormalities, genotype, and outcomes.ResultsThirty patients with MMA (age range 0-21 y) from 27 unrelated families were enrolled. Family history and consanguinity were noted in 10/27 (37%) and 11/27 (41%) families respectively. Acute metabolic decompensation was more common (57%) than chronic presentation. Biochemical work-up was suggestive of isolated MMA (n = 18) and MMA with homocystinuria (n = 9) respectively. Molecular testing in 24 families showed 21 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants with MMA cblC as the commonest molecular subtype (n = 8). B12 responsiveness, an important determinant of long-term outcome, was observed in eight patients [MMAA (n = 3) and MMACHC (n = 5)]. Mortality was 30% (n = 9/30) with a high proportion of early-onset severe disease and fatal outcome in isolated MMA mut(0) (4/4) and MMA cblB (3/3), as compared to MMA cblA (1/5) and MMA cblC (1/10).Conclusions This study cohort had MMA cblC subtype as the most common type of MMA followed by the MMA mutase defect. Outcomes in MMA are influenced by the type of molecular defect, age, and severity of presentation. Early detection and management is likely to result in better outcomes.

AB  - PurposeTo determine the burden of trachoma and its related risk factors among the underserved population of sixteen states/union territories (UTs) in India.MethodsTrachoma rapid assessment (TRA) was conducted in seventeen Enumeration Units (EUs) spanning sixteen states/UTs in India according to standard WHO guidelines. A total of ten clusters were selected in each EU and 50 children aged 1-9 years were assessed clinically for signs of active trachoma and facial cleanliness in each cluster. Additionally, all adults aged 15 years and above in the same households were examined for evidence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and corneal opacity. Environmental risk factors contributing to trachoma were also noted in all households.ResultsOut of 766 districts in India, seventeen EUs were selected for TRA depending on evidence of socio-developmental indicators like poverty and suboptimal access to water, sanitation, and healthcare facilities. The total population of the selected clusters was 21,774 in the 17 EUs. Overall, 104 of 8807 children (1.2%; CI: 0.9-1.4) had evidence of follicular or inflammatory stages of trachoma. Nearly 16.6% (CI:15.8-17.4) children were noted to have unclean faces in the 170 clusters. Trichiasis was noted in 19 adults (2.1 per 1000; CI:1.2-3.2 per 1000). Environmental sanitation was found to be unsatisfactory in two-thirds (67.8%) of the surveyed households in the clusters mainly due to improper garbage disposal.ConclusionActive trachoma was not a public health problem in any of the EUs surveyed. However, burden of TT among adults was found to be above 0.2% in two EUs; hence, further public health interventions like trichiasis surgery were recommended.

AB  - ObjectivesTo develop and validate weight estimation tools using mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and body length, and determine accuracy and precision of Broselow tape in children 6 mo to 15 y of age.MethodsData of 18,456 children aged 6 mo to 5 y and 1420 children aged 5 to 15 y were used to develop linear regression equations using length and MUAC to estimate weight. These were validated on prospectively enrolled populations of 276 and 312 children, respectively. Accuracy was measured by Bland-Altman bias, median percentage errors, and percentage of predicted weight within 10% of true weight. Broselow tape was tested on the validation population.ResultsGender specific equations were developed which estimated weight within 10% of true weight in 69.9% (64.1-75.2%) and 65.7% (60.1-70.9%) of children aged 6 mo to 5 y, and 5 to 15 y, respectively. Broselow tape predicted weight within 10% of the true weight in 40.5% (34.7-46.6%) and 32.5% (26.7-38.7%) of children aged 6 mo to 5 y and 5 to 15 y, respectively.ConclusionsThe model developed from MUAC and length accurately estimated weight in children aged 6 mo to 15 y, and is potentially useful during emergencies. The Broselow tape frequently overestimated weight in authors' setting.

AB  - PurposePatients with Germ cell tumours (GCT) are at risk of long-term toxicities due to multimodality therapy. It is debatable whether there is an impact on the quality of life(QoL) of GCT survivors.MethodsA case-control study was conducted at a tertiary care centre in India, using the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire, to compare the QoL between GCT survivors(disease free > 2 years) and healthy matched controls. A multivariate regression model was used to identify factors affecting QoL.ResultsA total of 55 cases and 100 controls were recruited. Cases had a median age of 32 years (interquartile range, IQR 28-40 years), ECOG PS of 0-1(75%), advanced stage III (58%), chemotherapy (94%) and 66% were > 5 years from diagnosis. The median age of controls: 35 years (IQR 28-43 years). A statistically significant difference was seen for emotional (85.8 & PLUSMN; 14.2 vs 91.7 & PLUSMN; 10.4, p 0.005), social(83.0 & PLUSMN; 22.0 vs 95.2 & PLUSMN; 9.6, p < 0.001) and global scales (80.4 & PLUSMN; 21.1 vs 91.3 & PLUSMN; 9.7, p < 0.001). Cases had more nausea and vomiting(3.3 & PLUSMN; 7.4 vs 1.0 & PLUSMN; 3.9, p 0.015), pain(13.9 & PLUSMN; 13.9 vs 4.8 & PLUSMN; 9.8, p < 0.001), dyspnea(7.9 + 14.3 vs 2.7 & PLUSMN; 9.1, p 0.007), and appetite loss(6.7 & PLUSMN; 14.9 vs 1.9 & PLUSMN; 7.9, p 0.016) and greater financial toxicity(31.5 & PLUSMN; 32.3 vs 9.0 & PLUSMN; 16.3, p < 0.001). Adjusting for age, performance status, BMI, stage, chemotherapy, RPLND, recurrent disease, and time since diagnosis, no predictive variables were significant.ConclusionThere is a detrimental impact of history of GCT in long term survivors of GCT.

AB  - BackgroundSpinal deformities are common in Marfan syndrome (MFS). They usually involve the thoraco-lumbar spine but rarely involves the cervical spine. Kyphosis is the common spine deformity of the cervical spine and mandates surgical correction as they are at risk of neurological deterioration since they are refractory to conservative management. Few studies of surgical correction of spine deformity included cervical deformity.ObjectivesTo analyze the challenges faced during surgery, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following surgical correction for cervical kyphosis in Marfan syndrome.MethodsWe identified that 5 patients with a diagnosis of MFS with cervical kyphosis who underwent fusion surgery between the years 2010 and 2022 were reviewed, retrospectively. We analyzed the demographic details, radiological parameters, operative variables (blood loss and nuances), perioperative complications, length of stay, clinical and radiological outcome, and complications following fusion surgery for cervical kyphosis in MFS.ResultsThe mean age of patients was 16.6 & PLUSMN; 4.72 years (range, 12-23 years). The average kyphotic vertebra involved is 3 & PLUSMN; 0.7 bodies (range 2-4) with 2 patients with thoracic deformity. All patients underwent surgical deformity correction. All patients improved clinically with Nurick grade (pre vs. post: 3.4 vs. 2.2) and mJOA (pre vs. post: 8.2 vs. 12.6). There was significant deformity correction from 37.48 & DEG; to 9.1 & DEG;. Mean blood loss encountered was 900 & PLUSMN; 173.2 ml. Perioperative complications: wound complication with CSF leak (1). Late complications: ventilator dependence (1) and junctional kyphosis (1). Mean length of hospital stay was 103 & PLUSMN; 178.9 days. All patients were doing symptomatically better after mean follow-up of 58 & PLUSMN; 28.32 months. One patient is bedridden and hospitalized.ConclusionCervical kyphosis is a rare spine deformity in patients with MFS, and they usually present with neurological deterioration mandating surgical correction. Multidisciplinary approach (pediatrics, genetics and cardiology) is required for systematic evaluation of these patients. They should be evaluated with necessary imaging to rule out associated spinal deformity (atlanto-axial subluxation, scoliosis, and intraspinal pathology like ductal ectasia). Our results suggest better surgical outcome in terms of low operative complications with neurologic improvement in MFS patients. These patients require regular follow-up to identify late complications (instrument failure, non-union, and pseudarthrosis).

AB  - ObjectivesTo make sonographic evaluation for biliary atresia (BA) more objective and reproducible using scoring systems, and evaluate hepatic shear wave elastography (SWE) as an adjunct in sonographic diagnosis of BA.MethodsSixty-four infants with cholestatic jaundice were enrolled between June 2016 and March 2018 in this prospective observational cohort study. Sonography and SWE was performed with SuperSonic Aixplorer system. Novel scoring systems were developed incorporating established sonographic parameters and hepatic stiffness values and analysed using SPSS software.ResultsOf the 18 patients confirmed as BA, 3 were misdiagnosed on conventional sonography (16.7%) as non-BA. Gall bladder (GB) wall irregularity and fasting GB length were the most accurate (93.8%) and most specific (97.8%) individual parameters, respectively. A significant difference was noted in the triangular cord (TC) thickness of BA and non-BA infants (p <0.001), with a high specificity of 95.6% for a 4 mm cut-off value for a positive TC sign. Comparison of hepatic SWE stiffness among age-matched groups of BA and non-BA showed significant differences (& LE;60 d: p = 0.003; >60 d: p <0.001) but with a reduced accuracy (93.8%). Diagnostic accuracy of greyscale scoring system (96.9%), greyscale + elastography scoring system in & LE;60 d (94.4%) and >60 d (97.8%) were better than that of conventional sonographic diagnosis (93.8%).ConclusionsGrey scale scoring system improves the accuracy of sonographic diagnosis of BA without any additional cost or time penalty along with making it universally reproducible. SWE has only an adjunctive role, if any, in the sonographic diagnosis of BA.

AB  - PurposeA library of Virtual Reality (VR) tasks has been developed for targeted post-stroke rehabilitation of distal upper extremities. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the clinical potential of the targeted VR-based therapeutic intervention in a small cohort of patients specifically with chronic stroke. Furthermore, our aim was to explore the possible neuronal reorganizations in corticospinal pathways in response to the distal upper limb targeted VR-intervention.MethodologyFive patients with chronic stroke were enrolled in this study and were given VR-intervention of 20 sessions of 45 min each. Clinical Scales, cortical-excitability measures (using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation): Resting Motor Threshold (RMT), and Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) amplitude, task-specific performance metrics i.e., Time taken to complete the task (TCT), smoothness of trajectory, relative % error were evaluated pre- and post-intervention to evaluate the intervention-induced improvements.ResultsPre-to post-intervention improvements were observed in Fugl-Meyer Assessment (both total and wrist/hand component), Modified Barthel Index, Stroke Impact Scale, Motor Assessment Scale, active range of motion at wrist, and task-specific outcome metrics. Pre-to post-intervention ipsilesional RMT reduced (mean & SIM;9%) and MEP amplitude increased (mean & SIM;29 & mu;V), indicating increased cortical excitability at post-intervention.ConclusionVR-training exhibited improved motor outcomes and cortical-excitability in patients with stroke. Neurophysiological changes observed in terms of improved cortical-excitability might be a consequence of plastic reorganization induced by VR-intervention.

AB  - Background: Currently, the mainstay of treatment for allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is surgical debridement along with topical or systemic steroids. However, prolonged systemic steroid therapy comes with side effects and is also sometimes contraindicated. Systemic antifungals have been used earlier as an adjunct to steroids or in refractory cases, but they have not been used as the sole primary treatment.Objective: To study the effectiveness of sole Itraconazole therapy in patients with AFRS by comparison of clinical, radiological, and biochemical parameters before and after treatment.Methods: Thirty-four patients diagnosed with localized sino-nasal AFRS were recruited and started on the tablet Itraconazole 200 mg orally twice daily for 3 months with q2weekly monitoring of liver function tests. The baseline clinical, radiological, and biochemical parameters were then compared with those after completion of 3 months of Itraconazole therapy.Results: There was significant difference between all the parameters-clinical: SNOT-22 score (p < 0.001) and Meltzer endoscopy score (p < 0.001), radiological: Lund-Mackay score (p = 0.004) and 20-point CT score (p = 0.002), and biochemical: serum total IgE (p < 0.001), Aspergillus-specific IgE (p < 0.001), and absolute eosinophil count (p < 0.001). The clearance of the disease was more in anterior sinuses than the posterior ones.Conclusion: Prolonged Itraconazole can be given as sole therapy in AFRS, especially in patients for whom steroids are contraindicated or in those who are awaiting surgery. It can result in symptomatic and radiological improvement, but surgery still remains the definitive treatment option for AFRS for complete clearance of disease.

AB  - Multiple parallel factors are frequently interrogated with various toxic radicals which are abundantly generated in the liver, heart, and pancreas in stress conditions. They are actively involved in the development of diabetes and metabolic aberrations. However, whether over-activation of GDF-15mRNA and influxes of iron-by-iron trafficking genes are directly suppressing the Nrf-2 gene in patients with diabetes and metabolic aberrations in context with undiagnosed individuals with diabetes and metabolic aberrations? Therefore, we have investigated inter and intra- related Zip8/14 mRNA, GDF-15mRNA, and Nrf-2 mRNA expressions in diabetes and metabolic syndrome as it is expected to be up to 134 million by 2045 in India. We recruited 120 subjects from the Department of Medicine, Endocrinology and Metabolic Clinic, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Various investigations related to anthropometry, nutritional, hematological, biochemical, cytokine, and oxidative stress were measured in diabetes, metabolic syndrome, diabetes with metabolic aberration, and healthy controls. Relative expression of GDF-15, ZIP8, ZIP14, Nrf-2, and housekeeping genes was done in all subjects. Stress-responsive cytokines are highly expressed in patients with metabolic aberration with respect to body weight, IR, waist circumference, and fat mass. IL-1 & beta;, TNF-& alpha;, and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in metabolic syndrome, whereas Adiponectin levels were profoundly lower side. MDA levels were significantly raised in diabetes with metabolic syndrome while SOD activities were lowered (p = 0.001). GDF-15 mRNA expression was 1.79-fold upregulated in group III as compared with Group I while 2-threefold down-regulation of Nrf-2 expression was observed in diabetes with metabolic aberration groups. Zip 8 mRNA expressions were downregulated (p = 0.014), and Zip 14 mRNA expressions were upregulated (p = 0.06) in diabetes and metabolic aberrations. The association of GDF-15 and Nrf-2 mRNA expression was found contradictory and highly interlinked with ROS. Zip 8/14mRNA expressions were also dysregulated in diabetes and metabolic-associated complications.

AB  - With the change in global environment, respiratory disorders are becoming more threatening to the health of people all over the world. These diseases are closely linked to performance of immune system. Within the innate arm of immune system, Neutrophils are an important moiety to serve as an immune defense barrier. They are one of the first cells recruited to the site of infection and plays a critical role in pathogenesis of various pulmonary diseases. It is established that the migration and activation of neutrophils can lead to inflammation either directly or indirectly and this inflammation caused is very crucial for the clearance of pathogens and resolution of infection. However, the immunopathological mechanisms involved to carry out the same is very complex and not well understood. Despite there being studies concentrating on the role of neutrophils in multiple respiratory diseases, there is still a long way to go in order to completely understand the complexity of the participation of neutrophils and mechanisms involved in the development of these respiratory diseases. In the present article, we have reviewed the literature to comprehensively provide an insight in the current development and advancements about the role of neutrophils in infectious respiratory disorders including viral respiratory disorders such as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and bacterial pulmonary disorders with a focused review on pulmonary tuberculosis as well as in noninfectious disorders like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Also, future directions into research and therapeutic targets have been discussed for further exploration.
   PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYRespiratory illnesses are becoming more prevalent and a substantial source of sickness and mortality worldwide as a result of the changes in the global environment. Although diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for respiratory disorders have improved over the years, a thorough and in-depth approach is still required to understand the underlying immuno-pathophysiological mechanisms. Neutrophils are a crucial part of innate immune system which functions as a first line defense against various pulmonary infections. They are known to be involved in resistance against invading pulmonary pathogens and also play an important role in repairing of damaged lung tissue by removing debris. However, emerging evidences suggest that neutrophils may also be involved in promoting and aggravating the unabating inflammation in several pulmonary disorders by release of various proteases, forming neutrophil extracellular traps or by attracting and activating other immune cells at the site of inflammation. In this article, we have discussed diverse roles and responses of neutrophils and their use in potential future research and therapeutic approaches in infectious pulmonary disorders like Tuberculosis and COVID-19 and noninfectious pulmonary disorders like Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.

AB  - PurposeTo report a case series of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative patients with healed cytomegalovirus retinitis presenting with proliferative retinopathy (in the form of neovascularisation elsewhere).MethodsRetrospective case series. Multimodal imaging was performed at each follow-up visit.ResultsThree patients with non-HIV immune dysfunction were followed up after healing of CMV retinitis. All three developed neovascularisation. Patient 1 after 4 months presented with vitreous haemorrhage for which pars plana vitrectomy was performed. Patient 2 developed neovascularization at disc and neovascularisation elsewhere 4 months after resolution, and patient 3 despite being affected by bilateral CMV retinitis, presented with unilateral neovascularization at 14 month after resolution of retinitis.ConclusionIncreased incidence of this rare entity could be attributed to partial immune dysfunction in non-HIV patients, limited area of retinitis with a more aggressive occlusive vasculitis. Extensive occlusion with more area of viable retina for angiogenic factor production explains this phenomena. It emphasizes the need for continued follow-up even after healing and to differentiate it from reactivation of retinitis and immune recovery uveitis.

AB  - Necrotizing scleritis is the most destructive and vision-threatening form of scleritis. Necrotizing scleritis can occur in systemic autoimmune disorders and systemic vasculitis, as well as following microbial infection. Rheumatoid arthritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis remain the commonest identifiable systemic diseases associated with necrotising scleritis. Pseudomonas species is the most common organism causing infectious necrotizing scleritis, with surgery the most common risk factor. Necrotizing scleritis has the highest rates of complications and is more prone to secondary glaucoma and cataract than other phenotypes of scleritis. The differentiation between non-infectious and infectious necrotizing scleritis is not always easy but is critical in the management of necrotizing scleritis. Non-infectious necrotizing scleritis requires aggressive treatment with combination immunosuppressive therapy. Infectious scleritis is often recalcitrant and difficult to control, requiring long-term antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement with drainage and patch grafting due to deep-seated infection and the avascularity of the sclera.

AB  - Three years into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there are still growing concerns with the emergence of different variants,unknown long- and short-term effects of the virus, andpotential biological mechanisms underlying etiopathogenesis and increased risk for morbidity and mortality.The role of the microbiome in human physiology and the initiation and progression of several oral and systemic diseases have been actively studied in the past decade. With the proof of viral transmission, carriage, and a potential role in etiopathogenesis, saliva and the oral environment have been a focus of COVID-19 research beyond diagnostic purposes. The oral environment hosts diverse microbial communities and contributes to human oral and systemic health. Several investigations have identified disruptions in the oral microbiome in COVID-19 patients. However, all these studies are cross-sectional in nature and present heterogeneity in study design, techniques, and analysis. Therefore, in this undertaking, we (a) systematically reviewed the current literature associating COVID-19 with changes in the microbiome; (b) performed a re-analysis of publicly available data as a means to standardize the analysis, and (c) reported alterations in the microbial characteristics in COVID-19 patients compared to negative controls. Overall, we identified that COVID-19 is associated with oral microbial dysbiosis with significant reduction in diversity. However, alterations in specific bacterial members differed across the study. Re-analysis from our pipeline shed light on Neisseria as the potential key microbial member associated with COVID-19.

AB  - Mucormycosis is a fungal infection of the sinuses, brain and lungs that is the cause of approximately 50% mortality rate despite the available first-line therapy. Glucose-Regulated Protein 78 (GRP78) is already reported to be a novel host receptor that mediates invasion and damage of human endothelial cells by Rhizopus oryzae and Rhizopus delemar, the most common etiologic species of Mucorales. The expression of GRP78 is also regulated by the levels of iron and glucose in the blood. There are several antifungal drugs in the market but they pose a serious side effect to the vital organs of the body. Therefore, there is an immediate need to discover effective drug molecules having increased efficacy with no side effects. With the help of various computational tools, the current study was attempted to determine potential antimucor agents against GRP78. The receptor molecule GRP78 was screened against 8820 known drugs deposited in DrugBank library using high-throughput virtual screening method. Total top 10 compounds were selected based on the binding energies greater than the reference co-crystal molecule. Furthermore, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using AMBER were performed to calculate the stability of the top-ranked compounds in the active site of GRP78. After extensive computational studies, we propose that two compounds (CID439153 and CID5289104) have inhibitory potency against mucormycosis and can serve as potential drugs that can form the basis of treating mucormycosis disease.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

AB  - Background"Depth of invasion" is an additional index incorporated in 8th AJCC staging system for oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma based on its prognostic significance. Pre-operative assessment by clinical palpation and imaging modalities has been used with limitations. The aim of the study is to compare different techniques including clinical palpation, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging with histopathology for assessment of depth of tumor invasion.MaterialsFifty patients of carcinoma tongue (T1-T3) were enrolled. Clinical palpation, Ultrasound tongue, and Magnetic resonance imaging were used to assess depth of tumor invasion. Microscopic depth of invasion was considered as reference. Statistical analysis was done to assess the level of agreement, reliability, and internal consistency. ROC analysis was done to find the "Area Under Curve" for microscopic depth versus ultrasound, MRI, and gross histopathological "depth of invasion".ResultsUltrasound tongue showed highest "area under curve", Intra class correlation (ICC:0.786) with a good consistency (Cronbach's Alpha:0.880) with histological reference compared to MRI(ICC:0.689;CA:0.816). Clinical palpation showed weak agreement (Kappa:0.43) for assessing depth. To observe the concordance between ultrasound and microscopic depth, Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC = 0.782) was calculated with 95% limits of agreement. Lin's concordance correlation between ultrasound and microscopic depth showed a good agreement.ConclusionsUltrasound tongue is a reliable imaging modality for pre-operative T staging by assessing tumor "depth of invasion" in carcinoma tongue patients with good internal consistency as per 8th AJCC staging system.

AB  - PurposeLimb amputation is one of the oldest medical operations, dating back over 2500 years to Hippocrates' time. In developing countries like India, most of the patients are young, and trauma is the primary cause of limb amputation. The objectives of this study were to investigate the factors that can predict the outcome of patients who underwent upper or lower limb amputations.Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective analysis of the prospectively collected data of patients who underwent limb amputations from January 2015 to December 2019.ResultsFrom January 2015 to December 2019, 547 patients underwent limb amputations. Males predominated (86%). Road traffic injuries (RTI) were the most common (323, 59%) mechanism of injury. Hemorrhagic shock was present in 125 (22.9%) patients. Above-knee amputation was the most common (33%) amputation procedure performed. The correlation of hemodynamic status at presentation with the outcome was statistically significant (p-0.001). Outcome measures like delayed presentation, hemorrhagic shock, Injury severity scores (ISS), and the new injury severity scores (NISS) were statistically significant (p-0.001) when compared to the outcome. There were 47 (8.6%) mortalities during the study period.ConclusionFactors that affected the outcome were delayed presentation, hemorrhagic shock, higher ISS, NISS, MESS scores, surgical-site infection, and associated injuries. Overall mortality during the study was 8.6%.

AB  - Central venous access devices (chemoport) are nowadays most commonly used for delivering chemotherapy drugs. As the chemoport insertion procedures are increasing in number, there are documented complications which are common, life threatening if not immediately treated, and rare. The common complications are pneumothorax, infection, thrombosis, hemothorax, drug extravasation, and malfunction of chemoport. A rare and dangerous complication is fracture embolization of catheter. Another rare complication is flipping of chemoport. In this article, we would like to present images of two patients with one image showing catheter embolized to right ventricle and another patient with port flipping and their management.

AB  - This review summarizes the impact of systemic and ocular inflammatory disorders on diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Local inflammation is a key pathology in diabetic retinopathy (DR) and is also an evolving target for clinical therapy. The legacy effects of local inflammation at the intracellular level make DR a persistent self-driven vicious process. Ocular inflammation is accompanied as well as incited by systemic inflammation due to diabetes mellitus (DM) itself. Over the years, a multitude of studies have evaluated the impact of systemic inflammatory disorders (SIDs, like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, psoriasis, etc.) and anti-inflammatory drugs prescribed for managing them on manifestations of DM. Recent studies have indicated increased insulin resistance to be a result of chronic inflammation, and the anti-inflammatory drugs to have a protective effect towards DM. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of SIDs on DR. Furthermore, the evidence from these studies is conflicting, and while local anti-inflammatory therapy has shown a lot of clinical potential for use in DR, the results of systemic anti-inflammatory therapies have been inconsistent. The impact of local ocular inflammation due to uveitis on DR is a crucial aspect that has not been evaluated well at present. Initial pre-clinical studies and small-sized clinical reports have shown a strong and positive relationship between the presence of uveitis and the severity of DR as well as its progression, while larger cross-sectional patient surveys have refuted the same. The long term impact of ocular inflammation due to uveitis on DR needs to be studied while adjusting for confounders.

AB  - Poorly differentiated colonic carcinoma with rhabdoid features is a rarely described entity. Our knowledge regarding the molecular phenotype of the tumor is evolving. We herein report a similar tumor with rhabdoid differentiation identified in the splenic flexure, which on histological examination showed a poorly differentiated phenotype with epithelioid to spindled morphology, tumor giant cells, and rhabdoid differentiation. The tumor was mismatch repair-proficient, deficient of INI1/SMARCB1, KRAS mutated (A146x), BRAFV600E mutated (c.1799T > A), and NRAS wild-type, indicating serrated differentiation in the tumor. The patient died after 3.5 months post-surgery. INI1-deficient poorly differentiated carcinoma of the colon is a rare, aggressive colonic malignancy showing a serrated phenotype. Routine identification and subtyping are important keeping in mind the distinct tumor phenotype, resistance to conventional chemotherapy, and dismal prognosis.

AB  - During the last two decades the world has seen an increase in the use of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) which has led to its worldwide expansion. Since, HSCT unit is an advanced set up, developing and maintaining a successful hematopoietic stem cell transplant program with a properly functioning unit enhances the credibility of any tertiary level medical facility especially for a country like ours which is in its early expanding phase of providing transplant services. The underlying principle for designing any HSCT facility is to maintain the highest possible level of aseptic environment for patients undergoing the transplant in order to prevent healthcare associated infections. Basic premises of designing the entire HSCT unit was to ensure restricted access to the facility and having an aseptic environment by implementing infection control parameters in design elements, which are explained subsequently in the article. The present manuscript describes the project experience of creating a positive pressure isolation facility for HSCT patients at a tertiary care hospital, India, which is a resource limited setting with an emphasis on need assessment, key elements in planning and designing along with the challenges associated with it.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate the performance of the empiric tool by Gupta et al. in predicting neurological outcomes in children admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and to evaluate the association of biomarkers S100B and NSE with neurological outcomes.MethodsThis prospective observational study was conducted in 163 critically ill children aged 2 mo to 17 y admitted to the PICU from June 2020 to July 2021. The authors used the prediction tool developed by Gupta et al.; the tool was applied at admission and at PICU discharge/death. Samples for NSE and S100B were collected at admission and discharge. The performance of the new tool was assessed through discrimination and calibration. Risk factors for "unfavorable outcomes" (decline in PCPC score by > 1) were evaluated by multivariate analysis.ResultsThe PICU mortality was 28% (n = 45). When the tool developed by Gupta et al. was used at the time of admission, favorable neurological outcomes were predicted for 69% (112) children. The area under the curve for the new tool at admission was 0.72 and at discharge/death it was 0.99, and the calibration was excellent at both time points. Independent factors associated with unfavorable neurological outcomes were higher PCPC scores and organ failure. As the number of samples processed for NSE and S100B was less, statistical analysis was not attempted.ConclusionsThe new tool by Gupta et al. has good discrimination, calibration, sensitivity, and specificity and can be used as a prediction tool. NSE and S100B are promising biomarkers and need further evaluation.

AB  - BackgroundResponse rate of PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapeutic blockade agents in uveal melanoma (UM) is poor. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) are the two promising immune checkpoint targets. Therefore, our aim was to explore at how these proteins were expressed in tumour tissue and serum, as well as their prognostic implications in UM. MethodsThe expression of LAG3, CTLA-4, CD3, CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 was determined by immunohistochemistry in 54 enucleated UM tissue samples. mRNA expression level of LAG3 and CTLA-4 was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and corroborated by western blotting. Furthermore, soluble form of LAG3, CTLA-4 and CCR8 expression in serum was measured in 40 UM patients using ELISA. ResultThe expression of LAG3, CTLA-4, CD3, CD4, CD8 and FOXP3 was observed in 30%, 33%, 41%, 35%, 50% and 39% of the cases, respectively. Loss of nBAP1 expression was significantly correlated with CD8+expression (p=0.012) but not with tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. LAG3 and CTLA-4 mRNA levels were higher in UM compared with normal uveal tissues. Higher LAG3 expression with CD8+expression was associated with lower metastasis-free survival (MFS) (p=0.049), but not with CTLA-4 in UM patients. MFS rate was reduced in patients having lower levels of CCR8 protein (p=0.050) and increased level of LAG3 protein (p=0.001). ConclusionOur findings suggest that higher levels of LAG3 in UM with histopathologically high-risk parameters predict high metastatic potential and that it could be used as a targeted immunotherapy alone or in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade agents.

AB  - Cleome viscosa L., a member of the family Cleomaceae, is a potential medicinal plant, known for several bioactive properties such as: anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, wound healing, etc. Our study aimed to isolate a bioactive compound and assess its antibacterial activity. The crystal compound imperatorin was isolated and reported for the first time from the aerial parts of C. viscosa. The isolation was made using silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography. The structure of imperatorin was investigated through single-crystal XRD, unit cell molecules, FTIR, and ESI-MS spectral analysis. The results validated imperatorin's triclinic crystal structure and P2i/c distance group. The electronic structure was also calculated (4.28/6.21 D) along with the frontier molecular orbital, dipole moment, atomic charges, and electrostatic map of particles in gaseous stage and active site. Imperatorin showed highest activity at 40 mu g/mL concentration against Gram + ve bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (3 +/- 0.2 mm), Bacillus subtilis (3 +/- 0.6 mm), and Gram -ve bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae (3 +/- 0.2 mm), Escherichia coli (5 +/- 0.2 mm). The study highlights that the compound can be isolated in larger quantities as the plant is easily available across the tropics.

AB  - Disparity in the activity of Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to degenerative diseases, mainly associated with protein misfolding and aggregation leading to cellular dysfunction and damage, ultimately contributing to ER stress. ER stress activates the complex network of Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling pathways mediated by transmembrane proteins IRE1, ATF6, and PERK. In addition to UPR, many ER chaperones have evolved to optimize the output of properly folded secretory and membrane proteins. Glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), an ER chaperone of heat shock protein HSP90 family, directs protein folding through interaction with other components of the ER protein folding machinery and assists in ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Activation of GRP94 would increase the efficacy of protein folding machinery and regulate the UPR pathway toward homeostasis. The present study aims to screen for novel agonists for GRP94 based on Core hopping, pharmacophore hypothesis, 3D-QSAR, and virtual screening with small-molecule compound libraries in order to improve the efficiency of native protein folding by enhancing GRP94 chaperone activity, therefore to reduce protein misfolding and aggregation. In this study, we have employed the strategy of small molecule-dependent ER programming to enhance the chaperone activity of GRP94 through scaffold hopping-based screening approach to identify specific GRP94 agonists. New scaffolds generated by altering the cores of NECA, the known GRP94 agonist, were validated by employing pharmacophore hypothesis testing, 3D-QSAR modeling, and molecular dynamics simulations. This facilitated the identification of small molecules to improve the efficiency of native protein folding by enhancing GRP94 activity. High-throughput virtual screening of the selected pharmacophore hypothesis against Selleckchem and ZINC databases retrieved a total of 2,27,081 compounds. Further analysis on docking and ADMET properties revealed Epimedin A, Narcissoside, Eriocitrin 1,2,3,4,6-O-Pentagalloylglucose, Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, ZINC92952357, ZINC67650204, and ZINC72457930 as potential lead molecules. The stability and interaction of these small molecules were far better than the known agonist, NECA indicating their efficacy in selectively alleviating ER stress-associated pathogenesis. These results substantiate the fact that small molecule-dependent ER reprogramming would activate the ER chaperones and therefore reduce the protein misfolding as well as aggregation associated with ER stress in order to restore cellular homeostasis.

KW  - CHRONIC HYPONATREMIA
AB  - Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is one of the common causes of euvolemic hyponatremia (serum Na+ < 135 mEq/L) in hospitalized children. It is characterized by increased serum ADH, leading to water retention via its action on V2 receptors in the distal renal tubules. Various conditions such as pain, the postoperative state, drugs, central nervous system infections, tumors, malformations, and pneumonia can predispose a person to SIADH. The conventional treatment of SIADH includes fluid restriction and salt supplementation. Occasionally, this may fail to control hyponatremia, mandating pharmacological therapy. V2-receptor antagonists are an FDA-approved therapy for adults with euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. However, there is limited experience with their use in the pediatric population. Here, the authors present a girl with corpus callosum agenesis with severe symptomatic hyponatremia due to SIADH who was successfully managed with the V2-receptor antagonist tolvaptan.

AB  - ObjectivesTo translate the Pediatric Nausea Assessment Tool (PeNAT) into Hindi and validate it in Indian pediatric cancer patients and survivors.MethodsThe PeNAT-Hindi was finalized by forward and backward translations, and pilot testing. The PeNAT-Hindi was administered to 200 Hindi-speaking pediatric (4-18 y) cancer patients/survivors, in three groups. These included pediatric cancer patients who had recently received chemotherapy (n = 150); who received no chemotherapy within 5 d (n = 25) and survivors (n = 25). Construct validity was tested by comparing scores among the three groups. Test-retest reliability and criterion validity were estimated by the correlation of the first PeNAT score with the second (taken 1 h later) PeNAT score and the number of vomiting/retching episodes, respectively. Convergent validity and discriminant validity were estimated by correlating PeNAT scores with parent-assessed nausea severity, and pain, respectively. The responsiveness was tested by comparing second PeNAT scores with subsequent divergent PeNAT scores among patients reporting subjective change (improvement and worsening, respectively) in nausea severity.ResultsTest-retest reliability of PeNAT-Hindi was good (intraclass correlation = 0.791). The initial PeNAT score had moderate correlation with the number of vomiting/retching episodes (Spearman rho = 0.401). Median PeNAT scores in group 1 versus groups 2 and 3 were significantly different (p < 0.001). Initial PeNAT scores showed a moderate correlation with parent-assessed nausea (Spearman rho = 0.657) and a weak correlation with parent-assessed pain (Spearman rho = 0.319). The responsiveness (standardized response mean) of PeNAT-Hindi to the change in nausea severity was -1.79 (improvement) and 2.19 (worsening), respectively.ConclusionPeNAT-Hindi showed good reliability and acceptable validity. It may be used among Hindi-speaking children for measuring nausea. The responsiveness of PeNAT-Hindi needs further evaluation.

AB  - Objective To assess the characteristics of popular videos on YouTube about the feeding of infants with cleft lip and palate (CLP) and analyze the adequacy of information provided by them. Design A cross-sectional design was used. Methods YouTube was systematically searched for consecutive relevant videos about the feeding of infants with CLP, using predefined keyword combinations, without any limitations on language or duration. Scrutiny of the top 50 videos for each keyword combination was performed and a self-designed data-extraction sheet was used. A content adequacy index was developed by an expert group, and used to assess content adequacy, classifying it into categories from excellent to poor. Results From an initial retrieval of 200 videos, 42 were included in the final assessment. The videos originated from nine different countries, with more than half coming from the USA and in English. Five of the videos came from the channel of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association. Content adequacy analysis showed that no video could be classified as excellent, while 33.3% were classified as optimal, 21.4% as suboptimal and 45.2% as poor. Conclusions The content adequacy of the majority of videos on YouTube, relating to the feeding of infants with CLP was inadequate, with only one third of them achieving optimal content adequacy. Efforts must be made to develop informative and standardized videos for social media and video-sharing platforms, perhaps through professional associations to ensure that families with an infant with CLP receive appropriate information.

AB  - Objectives To describe prevalence of various imaging findings in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients; and find imaging biomarkers for differentiating chest infections caused by different micro-organisms.Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 15 patients (49 scans) with proven CGD. Scans which had a correlative microbiological diagnosis for organisms were included in the analysis. The scans were reviewed by 3 radiologists on a predefined proforma, under the lung parenchymal, airway, pleural, mediastinal, and extrathoracic abnormalities. Analysis of various imaging parameters on a semiquantitative scale was performed, followed by a correlation of each imaging findings with causative organisms.Result The mean age of presentation was nearly 7 y, with a male preponderance. Definitive proof of causative organisms was obtained in 22 scans. Bacterial infection was found in 7, fungal in 12, tubercular in 2, and viral in 1 scan. Most prevalent thoracic imaging manifestations included lymphadenopathy (commonest), consolidation, nodules, air trapping, and bronchiectasis. Fungal infections showed necrotic conglomerate lymphadenopathy, cavitating nodules, and multilobar consolidation more frequently than bacterial infections (though not statistically significant). Abscesses and lymphadenopathy were the most common extrathoracic manifestations.Conclusion In patients with CGD, multifocal or multilobar consolidation, mass-like consolidation, cavitating nodules, and conglomerate necrotic lymphadenopathy should alert the radiologist to a possible fungal cause.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate by meta-analysis the safety and efficacy of venous sac embolization (VSE) with or without feeding artery embolization versus feeding artery embolization (FAE) alone in the management of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus till August 31, 2021 to identify studies comparing the safety and efficacy of VSE with or without FAE versus FAE alone in PAVMs. The success of treatment was assessed by comparing the number of PAVMs with >= 70% decrease in the size of draining vein/sac between the 2 groups. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated using the random-effects inverse-variance model and were used to compare pooled therapeutic efficacy between the groups. Results: Three studies were found eligible for the meta-analysis. The included studies had a total of 169 patients (119 females and 50 males). The total number of PAVMs was 298, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was present in 119 patients. The success of treatment was higher with VSE as compared to FAE (OR=3.54, 95% CI=1.66-7.56). The minor complications were similar in both groups, and one major complication occurred in the FAE group. More coils were used in the VSE group. Conclusions: The present systematic review and meta-analysis has consolidated the evidence that VSE with or without FAE is more efficacious than FAE alone in the management of PAVMs without any increase in the associated risk of sac rupture or coil migration. Clinical Impact Until high-quality data from a prospective, multicentric, randomized controlled trial becomes available, the evidence consolidated by the present systematic review and meta-analysis showing the efficacy of venous sac embolization (with or without feeding artery embolization) over feeding artery embolization alone, can be used for clinical decision-making in the management of pulmonary arterio-venous malformations.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed tremendous growth in analyzing the cortical representation of human locomotion and balance using Electroencephalography (EEG). With the advanced developments in miniaturized electronics, wireless brain recording systems have been developed for mobile recordings, such as in locomotion. In this review, the cortical dynamics during locomotion are presented with extensive focus on motor imagery, and employing the treadmill as a tool for performing different locomotion tasks. Further, the studies that examine the cortical dynamics during balancing, focusing on two types of balancing tasks, ie, static and dynamic, with the challenges in sensory inputs and cognition (dual-task), are presented. Moreover, the current literature demonstrates the advancements in signal processing methods to detect and remove the artifacts from EEG signals. Prior studies show the electrocortical sources in the anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex was found to be activated during locomotion. The event-related potential has been observed to increase in the fronto-central region for a wide range of balance tasks. The advanced knowledge of cortical dynamics during mobility can benefit various application areas such as neuroprosthetics and gait/balance rehabilitation.

AB  - Background: Low and middle-income countries like India anticipate rapid population aging and increases in dementia burden. In India, dementia screening scales originally developed in other contexts need to be assessed for feasibility and validity, given the number of different languages and varying levels of literacy and education. Method: Using data from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (N = 4,028), we characterize the performance of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE). We described patterns and correlates of missingness, evaluated the psychometric properties of the scale, and assessed criterion validity against the Hindi Mental State Examination (HMSE) using linear regression. Results: Several IQCODE items had high levels of missingness, which was associated with urbanicity, respondent's gender, and informant's generation (same vs. younger generation). Full IQCODE scores showed strong criterion validity against the HMSE; each 1-point increase in IQCODE score was associated with a 3.03-point lower score on the HMSE, controlling for age, gender, and urbanicity. The statistically significant association between IQCODE and HMSE was stronger in urban than rural settings (p-value for interaction = 0.04). Associations between IQCODE and HMSE remained unchanged after removing the three items with the highest levels of differential missingness (remembering addresses and telephone numbers, ability to work with familiar machines, ability to learn to use new gadget or machine). Conclusion: Findings raise questions about the value of including items with high proportions of missingness, which may signal cultural irrelevance, while removing them did not affect criterion validity.

AB  - Aim of the study: Activating Transforming factor 3 (ATF3) is a stress induced gene and closely associated with neuro-inflammation while Transforming growth Factor Beta (TGF beta) signalling is also reported to be involved in neuro-inflammation and hyper-excitability associated with drug resistant epilepsy. Animal model studies indicate the involvement of ATF3 and TGF beta receptors to promote epileptogenesis. Human studies also show that TGF beta signalling is activated in MTLE-HS. However, lack of studies on ATF3 and TGF beta RI expression in MTLE-HS patients exists. We hypothesize that ATF3 and TGF beta RI might be expressed in hippocampi of patients with MTLE-HS and playing role in epileptogenesis.
   Materials & methods: Protein expression of ATF3 and TGF beta RI was performed by western blotting. Localisation of ATF3 was performed by immunohistochemistry and immunoflorescence.
   Results: Protein expression of ATF3 and TGF beta RI was significantly up-regulated in hippocampi of patients as compared to controls. Also ATF3 IR was significantly expressed in hippocampi of patients and ATF3 was expressed predominantly in cytoplasm as compared to nucleus. No correlation was found between ATF3 expression and epilepsy duration and seizure frequency.
   Conclusions: ATF3 and TGF beta RI are both important players in neuro-inflammation and might potentiate epileptogenesis in these patients.

KW  - COMPLICATIONS
AB  - Bilateral defects around the knee joint following fracture of the proximal tibia (Schatzker type V & VI) are difficult to reconstruct because of the unavailability of local tissue. A bicondylar proximal tibial fracture requires a bilateral approach and dual plates for fracture fixation. Because of extensive dissection during plating and extended zone of trauma, the suture lines occasionally dehisce resulting in soft tissue defects on both sides of the proximal tibia. Because of its bilateral nature, the defect requires 2 flaps. We are reporting 2 cases of suture dehiscence after fixation of bicondylar fracture of the proximal tibia which required reconstruction with bilateral gastrocnemius flaps. This reconstruction is a simple option that helps in providing stable coverage. The first case was followed up for a period of 5 years and the second case was followed up for a minimum period of 6 months. Both cases demonstrated well-healed flaps, united bone and no donor side morbidity. Bilateral gastrocnemius muscle flaps can be used simultaneously for 2 separate defects on both sides of the knee without significant donor site morbidly. This reconstructive option provides stable coverage, reduces the infection and promotes bony union thus helping in early ambulation.

AB  - There is a wide discrepancy in the epidemiology of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) due to diverse scales and survey approaches. We estimated the prevalence of AUDs by comparing the pooled prevalence based on the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT) Vs. non-AUDIT (all scales other than AUDIT). This review searched the community-based prevalence of AUDs in PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, Ovid, and Google Scholar. Articles published during the years from 2000 to 2020 were included. The methodological quality of each study was scored, and data were extracted from the published reports. Pooled prevalence was estimated, and the publication bias was evaluated. Twenty-one studies conducted in different states of India included 73997 community-based respondents, which estimated the overall prevalence of AUDs as 12.5% (95% CI: 9 to 17.3%). The pooled prevalence based on AUDIT was 12.4% (AUDIT >= 8; 95% CI: 8.8 to 17.1%) in which the magnitude of hazardous and harmful alcohol use (8.6%; 95% CI: 5.7 to 12.8%; AUDIT 8-19) was significantly higher than dependent alcohol use (2.3%; 95% CI: 1.1 to 4.8%; AUDIT >= 20). The pooled prevalence using the non-AUDIT tool was 14.2(95%; CI: 6-30%). Our findings further reveal that about one in twelve of the population of India have AUDs, and there is a gross variation in the patterns of alcohol use across the country. The high prevalence of AUDs suggests developing a national policy to benefit alcohol use, justifying regional variations.

AB  - Acute compartment syndrome in the lower limb, a surgical emergency, may cause ischemic damage to muscles and neurological deficits leading to loss of function of the limb which may even require amputation, thus drastically affecting the quality of life of a patient. Fasciotomy for decompression is suggested when the differential pressure in the compartment of the leg is <= 30 mm Hg. However, compartment pressure measurement is not always feasible. Surgeons often find themselves in a dilemma in deciding the right treatment option for the patient: fasciotomy or conservative management. Since there is no universally accepted reference standard for the diagnosis of acute compartment syndrome at present, there is a need for definitive diagnostic variables so as to not delay fasciotomy in patients who need it, as well as to avoid unnecessary fasciotomies, especially when compartment pressures cannot be measured. In this observational study including 71 patients, based on the compartment pressures of the affected limb, treatment was done either with fasciotomy or conservative approach, and various clinical and biochemical parameters were evaluated in between these two groups. Statistically significant difference was found in the venous blood gas parameters between patients managed conservatively and with fasciotomy (MANOVA, P = .001). The results revealed the association of lower venous blood bicarbonate levels (independent sample t test, P = .021) and the presence of paresthesia (Fisher exact test, P = .0016) with the fasciotomy group. Also, pain on passive stretching of the affected limb was found to be significantly associated with a delta pressure of <= 30 mm Hg in any compartment (Fisher exact test, P = .002). These variables may thus be used as an alternative to the measurement of compartment pressure to assess the requirement of fasciotomy.

AB  - Extrarenal extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumour (MRT) is a rare and highly aggressive tumour representing <1% of paediatric soft tissue malignancies. Only a few cases of MRT of the thigh arising from the sciatic nerve have been reported in medical literature to date. A 5-year-old girl presented with progressively increasing painless lump in the posterior aspect of the left thigh. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left thigh showed a 4.7 x 5 x 10.5 cm well-marginated, lobulated, homogeneously enhancing lesion in the posterior compartment of the left thigh along the course of the sciatic nerve. She underwent en bloc excision of the left sciatic nerve tumour and end-to-end anastomosis of the left sciatic nerve with a right sural nerve graft. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the surgical specimen revealed a malignant rhabdoid tumour. INI-1 immunoexpression was lost in the tumour cells. The metastatic workup was essentially normal. Subsequently, she received post-operative radiotherapy to the tumour bed (50.4 Gray in 28 fractions over 5.5 weeks) followed by six cycles of multiagent chemotherapy with ICE (Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide) regimen. On the last follow-up visit, 20 months after surgery, she was in complete clinical and radiological response. Aggressive multimodality management comprising radical resection of tumour, post-operative radiotherapy to the tumour bed, and multiagent chemotherapy with ICE regimen can lead to favourable outcomes in patients with this rare tumour.
